00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:21.029
 for me the advanced means my style 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 of life my profession my passion my 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.220
 inspiration my way of focusing and my 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 challenge 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.040
 Classical dance is a discipline that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.890
 It requires a record of reaching 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.030
 certain lines but classical dance in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.839
 yes it is an expression that tells stories 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.710
 it's movement is to merge the music 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.710
 with the body 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.970
 how to train a dancer is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.700
 almost like that of a high athlete 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.059
 performance you have to train between 6 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.850
 and 8 hours a day the training goes 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.860
 varying during these 18 hours so 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.820
 regular you always start with a class 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.000
 that lasts between an hour and a half or two hours 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.760
 after that comes a break a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.580
 break and then comes a day of 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.330
 essays that are practices of the works 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.010
 that you're going to release because you're going to have 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.010
 also within those trials come 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.740
 mounts that is to learn new works 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.110
 then in these eight hours all the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.869
 time is to be in search of that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.140
 movement in that perfect line of that 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.140
 interpretation 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.030
 has been modified over time 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.850
 Classical dance because also the bodies 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.439
 the movements have now changed 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.869
 they require more extreme to carry 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.350
 extreme to the body also go up a lot 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.840
 more legs rotate more and every day it 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.030
 they are surpassing those standards also a 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.929
 little as a high sportsman does 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.929
 performance 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.670
 the dance mostly seeks to express the 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.609
 essence of the human being what really 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.819
 we are where we are going, why are we 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.819
 here 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.299
 being on stage is a moment 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.409
 unique as finding myself 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.409
 it's like undressing
