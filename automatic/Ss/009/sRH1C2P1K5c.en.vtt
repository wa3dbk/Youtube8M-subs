00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
see those are monkeys which i think they

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.610 
see those are monkeys which i think they
could<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.280> from<00:00:44.789> ones<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.329> ascension<00:00:45.719> i'm

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
could be from ones from ascension i'm

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
could be from ones from ascension i'm
not<00:00:46.800> sure<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.340> uh<00:00:48.980> yeah<00:00:49.980> that's<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.690> my

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
in this game and stuff I know it's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
in this game and stuff I know it's
because<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> Vietnam<00:01:24.659> War<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:24.960> stuff

like that but I'm just trying to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
like that but I'm just trying to
wondering<00:01:27.540> why<00:01:27.840> five<00:01:28.380> would<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> end

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
wondering why five would be at the end

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.590 
wondering why five would be at the end
of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> campaign<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.030> stuff<00:01:31.159> also<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.600> have

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of the campaign and stuff also I have

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.609 
of the campaign and stuff also I have
found<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.200> two<00:01:34.380> zip<00:01:34.710> lines<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:36.170> cool<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.350> or

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
found the two zip lines in cool on or

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
found the two zip lines in cool on or
whatever<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
whatever it is one is right here and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.520 
whatever it is one is right here and
then<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.009> other<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.759> very<00:01:42.750> behind<00:01:43.079> here

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
then the other one is very behind here

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
then the other one is very behind here
the<00:01:43.829> reason<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.700> good<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the reason that this one is good is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.800 
the reason that this one is good is
because<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.220> use<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.729> breach<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
because you can use it to breach a and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
because you can use it to breach a and
stuff<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.310> right<00:01:50.670> over<00:01:50.880> there

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
stuff and a is right over there

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.690 
stuff and a is right over there
somewhere<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.409> yeah<00:01:52.829> i<00:01:52.860> already<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.490> that

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
somewhere but yeah i already use that
