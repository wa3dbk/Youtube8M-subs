00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.710
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.130
 Andrei Kupriyanov in this video we will get 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.170
 answer to the question of how often you can include 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.980
 or turn off the computer 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.369
 I recommend to you for the day 1 or 2 times 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.630
 turn off the computer is the most 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.150
 best option 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.980
 Some organizations generally include 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.000
 monday computer turns off at 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.550
 Friday before the weekend because 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.120
 certain computer components 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.670
 wears out during power up 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.109
 power outages due to voltage surges 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.050
 starting currents and so on to the first 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.690
 queue suffers hard drive so in 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.870
 power plan in windows system 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.100
 you need to customize so that your hard 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.720
 the disk was disconnected as little as possible he and 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.930
 performs some operations on 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.680
 reading information by writing if its 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.340
 suddenly tear off his work then it's bad 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.100
 impact on his work, too, as well 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.450
 it is very important not to turn off the computer often 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.689
 at least 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.970
 and the power button that is you probably 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.310
 you know if you press the power button 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.640
 computer hold it for three seconds or 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.680
 five then the computer will turn off abruptly it 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.549
 also bad for work 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.020
 hard drive first 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:44.840
 but they still say that windows is all 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.280
 still need to reboot but it 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.850
 refers to how during 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.960
 reboot la hard drives 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.789
 components work in normal mode 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.250
 and you can reboot even though I 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:01.069
 the laptop hasn't rebooted for a long time and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.640
 works stably enough 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:08.090
 those people who say that windows 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.729
 litters with time the longer he 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.860
 it works maybe for those people installed 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.810
 a lot of programs are either configured by themselves 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.989
 windows is wrong and i'm still 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.040
 I wanted to give an example with a light bulb in 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.440
 regarding this topic 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.200
 just take a light bulb and turn it on 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.510
 turn it off very often she also you 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.069
 probably 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.900
 will burn faster than just her 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.760
 use on a permanent basis 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.829
 also you probably noticed that light bulbs 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.150
 basically it burns during 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.150
 inclusions or 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.660
 their shutdown so close and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.850
 computers from this are gone of course if you 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.069
 you download a lot of information from 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.910
 Internet then you can leave the computer and 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.170
 for the night included here already questions 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.560
 consumption and payment of utility services 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.370
 rises if for you it is relevant to you 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.099
 dora ready 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.989
 at least turn off the computer at night 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.170
 also if you still leave 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.389
 turn on the computer at night which is better 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.030
 put the computer in that room in 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:20.900
 which you do not sleep because it is so 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.519
 same bad and and own on 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:29.359
 your health for the monitor is also not 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.700
 very good when he is constantly 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.799
 the included picture on it does not change 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.280
 so install screensaver either 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.960
 disconnect about turning off the monitor 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.180
 setting plans great hurry 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.800
 and not on the computer we'll talk in 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.440
