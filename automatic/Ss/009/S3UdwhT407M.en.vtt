00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
well we finally got this computer

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.780 
well we finally got this computer
running<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:06.799> I've<00:00:07.799> had<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> ten<00:00:08.960> chance<00:00:10.040> to<00:00:11.040> do

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
running and I've had a ten chance to do

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.169 
running and I've had a ten chance to do
some<00:00:12.090> benchmarking<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.019> whatnot<00:00:14.030> there's<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
some benchmarking and whatnot there's a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.130 
some benchmarking and whatnot there's a
YouTube<00:00:15.570> page<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:19.130> there's<00:00:20.130> some<00:00:20.460> serious

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
YouTube page and there's some serious

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.550 
YouTube page and there's some serious
overclocking<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:24.080> stock<00:00:25.080> clock

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
overclocking going on here a stock clock

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.310 
overclocking going on here a stock clock
on<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.220> particular<00:00:26.760> unit<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.289> four<00:00:28.289> hundred

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
on this particular unit is four hundred

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.540 
on this particular unit is four hundred
and<00:00:28.710> fifty<00:00:29.220> megahertz<00:00:29.689> on<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.779> core<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.369> have

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
and fifty megahertz on a core and I have

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
and fifty megahertz on a core and I have
it<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> six<00:00:33.210> ninety<00:00:33.660> stabili<00:00:34.380> mind<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.570> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
it up to six ninety stabili mind you I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
it up to six ninety stabili mind you I
headed<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.170> around<00:00:37.410> 7:20<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.980> would<00:00:41.219> be

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
headed up around 7:20 and it would be

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
headed up around 7:20 and it would be
stable<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.910> Windows<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.930> open<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> run

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
stable on Windows but I get open to run

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.580 
stable on Windows but I get open to run
a<00:00:43.710> game<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.430> would<00:00:44.550> crash<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:46.140> memory<00:00:46.500> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
a game and it would crash the memory I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.580 
a game and it would crash the memory I
believe<00:00:47.070> stock<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.879> 400<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.200> best<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.530> can

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
believe stock is 400 and the best I can

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.420 
believe stock is 400 and the best I can
do<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.950> 500<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:51.360> topped<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.430> 505

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
do is 500 it topped out at like 505

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.930 
do is 500 it topped out at like 505
would<00:00:54.210> crash<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.530> drop<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.949> down<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
would crash so I drop that down and it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
would crash so I drop that down and it
seems<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:58.260> doing<00:00:58.770> pretty<00:00:58.920> well<00:00:59.190> where<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
seems to be doing pretty well where it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.799 
seems to be doing pretty well where it
is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.020 

yeah<00:01:05.760> idle<00:01:06.760> can<00:01:07.720> write<00:01:07.990> around<00:01:08.670> 44<00:01:09.670> it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
yeah idle can write around 44 it's

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.609 
yeah idle can write around 44 it's
usually<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.420> little<00:01:10.600> lower<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:11.409> did<00:01:11.590> a

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
usually a little lower I just did a

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.170 
usually a little lower I just did a
little<00:01:11.799> gaming<00:01:12.130> with<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.700> little<00:01:12.850> bit<00:01:13.060> of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
little gaming with it a little bit of

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.070 
little gaming with it a little bit of
test<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.549> that's<00:01:15.729> pretty<00:01:15.940> good<00:01:16.119> also<00:01:16.330> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
test so that's pretty good also the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.510 
test so that's pretty good also the
program<00:01:17.409> I'm<00:01:17.680> using<00:01:17.710> here<00:01:18.549> is<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:19.080> ati<00:01:20.080> tool

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
program I'm using here is a ati tool

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.840 
program I'm using here is a ati tool
which<00:01:21.600> actually<00:01:22.600> works<00:01:22.750> with<00:01:22.930> nvidia<00:01:23.350> kurds

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
which actually works with nvidia kurds

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.639 
which actually works with nvidia kurds
it's<00:01:24.850> great<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.450> runs<00:01:28.659> Call<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.140> Duty<00:01:29.440> 4

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
it's great so but it runs Call of Duty 4

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.899 
it's great so but it runs Call of Duty 4
on<00:01:30.040> reasonably<00:01:30.909> high<00:01:31.180> settings<00:01:31.750> which<00:01:32.560> is

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
on reasonably high settings which is

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.950 
on reasonably high settings which is
really<00:01:33.909> fantastic<00:01:36.360> before<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.630> would<00:01:37.780> only

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
really fantastic before it would only

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.010 
really fantastic before it would only
run<00:01:38.380> it<00:01:38.560> barely<00:01:39.369> and<00:01:39.910> you'd<00:01:40.090> have<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.539> drop<00:01:40.869> the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
run it barely and you'd have to drop the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.580 
run it barely and you'd have to drop the
screen<00:01:41.259> resolution<00:01:41.470> down<00:01:42.009> quite<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> bit<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:45.520> I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
screen resolution down quite a bit now I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.749 
screen resolution down quite a bit now I
can<00:01:47.590> run<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:47.920> on<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.429> native<00:01:48.729> resolution

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
can run it on the native resolution

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.969 
can run it on the native resolution
which<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.479> 1680<00:01:50.170> by<00:01:50.289> 1050<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:53.140> also<00:01:53.619> have

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
which is 1680 by 1050 and I also have

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.779 
which is 1680 by 1050 and I also have
well<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.550> can<00:01:54.940> show<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:56.490> most<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.700> the

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
well I can show you the most of the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.480 
well I can show you the most of the
options<00:01:57.970> are<00:01:58.330> Han<00:01:58.890> anti-aliasing<00:01:59.890> is<00:01:59.950> down<00:02:00.250> to

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
options are Han anti-aliasing is down to

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.899 
options are Han anti-aliasing is down to
2x<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:05.380> not<00:02:05.619> sinking<00:02:05.860> frames<00:02:06.340> that's<00:02:06.729> off

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
2x it's not sinking frames that's off

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.850 
2x it's not sinking frames that's off
but<00:02:07.420> shadows<00:02:09.450> are<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:12.540> most<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.530> off

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
but shadows are on most of this is off

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.780 
but shadows are on most of this is off
dynamic<00:02:15.640> lights<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:18.630> bullet<00:02:19.630> rag<00:02:19.930> doll

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
dynamic lights is on bullet rag doll

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.960 
dynamic lights is on bullet rag doll
model<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.910> water<00:02:22.120> are<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:23.549> but<00:02:24.549> just<00:02:24.700> some<00:02:24.940> of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
model and water are on but just some of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.229 
model and water are on but just some of
the<00:02:25.150> little<00:02:26.250> some<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> little<00:02:27.400> add-on<00:02:27.760> crap

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
the little some a little add-on crap

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.400 
the little some a little add-on crap
that<00:02:28.480> really<00:02:28.660> doesn't<00:02:28.930> make<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.049> difference

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
that really doesn't make a difference

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.300 
that really doesn't make a difference
that's<00:02:29.590> turned<00:02:29.890> off<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.750> we<00:02:32.709> go<00:02:32.829> to<00:02:32.890> texture

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
that's turned off and we go to texture

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.190 
that's turned off and we go to texture
and<00:02:33.760> that's<00:02:33.940> turned<00:02:34.299> all<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> way<00:02:34.600> down<00:02:34.810> but

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
and that's turned all the way down but

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
and that's turned all the way down but
the<00:02:35.500> filtering<00:02:36.250> obviously<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.120> texture

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
the filtering obviously and texture

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.949 
the filtering obviously and texture
quality<00:02:38.200> or<00:02:38.320> both<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.709> automatic<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:40.780> best

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
quality or both on automatic for best

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.699 
quality or both on automatic for best
performance<00:02:44.609> I<00:02:45.609> will<00:02:46.120> start<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.780> new<00:02:46.900> server<00:02:47.260> I

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
performance I will start a new server I

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.259 
performance I will start a new server I
usually<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.000> run<00:02:49.150> block<00:02:49.540> with<00:02:49.870> my<00:02:51.269> tests

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
usually like to run block with my tests

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.060 
usually like to run block with my tests
especially<00:02:52.720> with<00:02:52.840> Cod<00:02:53.049> 4<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.680> because<00:02:53.950> of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
especially with Cod 4 just because of

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.310 
especially with Cod 4 just because of
the<00:02:54.130> falling<00:02:54.370> snow<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:55.180> throws<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.079> through<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
the falling snow it throws it through a

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.140 
the falling snow it throws it through a
little<00:02:56.530> bit<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.829> loop<00:02:57.040> sometimes<00:02:57.609> and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
little bit of a loop sometimes and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.840 
little bit of a loop sometimes and
that's<00:02:59.109> usually<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.799> best<00:03:00.510> way<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.540> test<00:03:01.840> it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
that's usually the best way to test it

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.479 
that's usually the best way to test it
as<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:04.359> can<00:03:04.450> see<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.900> detail<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.950> actually

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
as you can see the detail is actually

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.949 
as you can see the detail is actually
quite<00:03:06.790> good<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.269> it's<00:03:07.420> probably<00:03:07.750> not<00:03:07.840> gonna

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
quite good and it's probably not gonna

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.860 
quite good and it's probably not gonna
look<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.200> good<00:03:08.350> on<00:03:08.530> YouTube<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:09.660> it's<00:03:10.660> not

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
look that good on YouTube but it's not

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:26.949 
look that good on YouTube but it's not
terrible<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.650> mean

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:37.550 

get<00:03:27.470> out<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:27.799> mean<00:03:28.069> area<00:03:28.459> here

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.140 

it's<00:03:37.980> gonna<00:03:38.130> hurt<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.459> do<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:38.940> shell

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
it's gonna hurt to do this in shell

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.460 
it's gonna hurt to do this in shell
maybe<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.870> fire

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:04:19.879 

are

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.689 

as<00:04:20.889> you<00:04:21.100> can<00:04:21.190> see<00:04:21.400> pretty<00:04:21.669> awesome<00:04:23.580> I'll<00:04:24.580> be

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
as you can see pretty awesome I'll be

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.070 
as you can see pretty awesome I'll be
doing<00:04:24.910> some<00:04:25.060> other<00:04:25.210> games<00:04:25.510> in<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.780> next<00:04:25.960> few

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
doing some other games in the next few

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.280 
doing some other games in the next few
days<00:04:26.230> here<00:04:26.560> but<00:04:26.860> keep<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.699> updated<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:29.080> is

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
days here but keep you updated and it is

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.960 
days here but keep you updated and it is
really<00:04:29.590> overclocking<00:04:30.430> quite<00:04:30.699> nicely

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
really overclocking quite nicely

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.210 
really overclocking quite nicely
considering<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.900> age<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.350> card<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.860> what

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
considering the age of the card and what

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.140 
considering the age of the card and what
it<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:37.350> obviously<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.470> little<00:04:39.400> slower<00:04:39.760> fire

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
it is obviously a little slower fire

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:47.670 
it is obviously a little slower fire

with<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.479> overclocked<00:05:10.870> card<00:05:11.669> so<00:05:12.669> this<00:05:13.450> card

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
with the overclocked card so this card

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.760 
with the overclocked card so this card
obviously<00:05:14.169> being

obviously being

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.930 
obviously being
one<00:05:17.770> we<00:05:18.010> modified<00:05:18.670> with<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.660> custom<00:05:20.290> heatsink

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940

one we modified with the custom heatsink
so<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:24.190> I'll<00:05:24.310> keep<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.640> updated<00:05:24.760> on
