bike handles we're going to talk through
a<00:00:13.330> series<00:00:13.780> of<00:00:13.810> steps<00:00:14.170> that<00:00:14.470> we<00:00:14.980> recommend<00:00:15.550> to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
a series of steps that we recommend to

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.689 
a series of steps that we recommend to
make<00:00:16.660> a<00:00:16.720> happy<00:00:16.960> rider<00:00:17.289> have<00:00:18.099> you<00:00:18.220> killed<00:00:20.699> ha

make a happy rider have you killed ha

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.390 
make a happy rider have you killed ha
that's<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.390> wrong<00:00:22.509> way

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that's the wrong way

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.710 
that's the wrong way
we<00:00:24.400> suggest<00:00:24.759> stabilize<00:00:25.210> the<00:00:25.359> bike<00:00:25.509> with<00:00:25.689> the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
we suggest stabilize the bike with the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.720 
we suggest stabilize the bike with the
front<00:00:25.989> brake<00:00:26.109> both<00:00:26.739> feet<00:00:27.009> on<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.159> ground<00:00:27.249> will

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
front brake both feet on the ground will

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.729 
front brake both feet on the ground will
keep<00:00:27.880> your<00:00:27.999> head<00:00:28.089> level<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.619> remember<00:00:29.619> that

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
keep your head level and remember that

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.050 
keep your head level and remember that
foot<00:00:29.919> pick<00:00:32.280> we<00:00:33.280> should<00:00:33.460> just<00:00:33.580> head<00:00:33.760> over<00:00:33.790> the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
foot pick we should just head over the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.220 
foot pick we should just head over the
seat<00:00:34.300> stay<00:00:34.780> central<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.410> bike<00:00:35.590> ah<00:00:37.230> that's

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
seat stay central to the bike ah that's

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.870 
seat stay central to the bike ah that's
much<00:00:38.380> better<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:41.440> suggest<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:41.980> pin<00:00:42.220> sits<00:00:42.670> as

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
much better we suggest the pin sits as

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.630 
much better we suggest the pin sits as
far<00:00:43.150> forward<00:00:43.540> as<00:00:43.600> possible<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.920> will<00:00:45.220> reduce

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
far forward as possible this will reduce

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.100 
far forward as possible this will reduce
the<00:00:45.700> effect<00:00:46.150> that<00:00:46.270> they<00:00:46.510> have<00:00:46.540> on<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.930> bikes

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
the effect that they have on the bikes

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.900 
the effect that they have on the bikes
handling<00:00:47.560> there<00:00:48.310> are<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.490> number<00:00:48.610> of<00:00:48.730> ways

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
handling there are a number of ways

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.580 
handling there are a number of ways
opinion<00:00:49.390> can<00:00:49.540> hang<00:00:49.720> on<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:50.380> could<00:00:50.500> either

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
opinion can hang on you could either
