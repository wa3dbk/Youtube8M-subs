does and that you make the bottom a
little<00:00:07.839> wider<00:00:07.990> than<00:00:08.230> you<00:00:08.350> would<00:00:09.690> unlike<00:00:10.690> a

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
little wider than you would unlike a

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.080 
little wider than you would unlike a
regular<00:00:10.900> cylinder<00:00:11.790> cuz<00:00:12.790> you're<00:00:12.880> trying<00:00:13.030> to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
regular cylinder cuz you're trying to

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.470 
regular cylinder cuz you're trying to
make<00:00:13.179> it<00:00:13.300> light<00:00:13.540> I<00:00:15.029> think<00:00:16.029> tumblers<00:00:16.330> are

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
make it light I think tumblers are

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.030 
make it light I think tumblers are
really<00:00:16.660> important<00:00:16.960> that<00:00:17.050> they<00:00:17.170> stay<00:00:17.230> light<00:00:17.619> if

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
really important that they stay light if

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.340 
really important that they stay light if
they're<00:00:18.310> thick<00:00:18.610> they<00:00:19.509> don't<00:00:19.660> feel<00:00:19.930> right

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.100 

so<00:00:23.860> it's<00:00:23.949> opened<00:00:24.190> up<00:00:24.220> a<00:00:24.310> little<00:00:24.460> wider<00:00:25.110> you're

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
so it's opened up a little wider you're

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.319 
so it's opened up a little wider you're
going<00:00:26.260> to<00:00:26.320> pull<00:00:26.439> up<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:26.920> towards<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.430> center

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.919 

repeat<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.079> same<00:00:33.260> at<00:00:33.469> the<00:00:33.559> bottom<00:00:33.679> pushing<00:00:34.339> in

00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:34.929 
repeat the same at the bottom pushing in

00:00:34.929 --> 00:01:14.980 
repeat the same at the bottom pushing in
squeezing<00:00:35.929> that<00:00:36.019> clay<00:00:36.260> up

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.870 

blowing<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.290> sooner<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.430> pounded<00:01:17.760> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
blowing it here sooner I get pounded the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.109 
blowing it here sooner I get pounded the
quarter<00:01:18.180> tumbler

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.320 

same<00:01:22.720> thing<00:01:22.960> in<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.440> centering<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:23.890> all<00:01:24.330> lake

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
same thing in the centering and all lake

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.789 
same thing in the centering and all lake
the<00:01:25.510> mug<00:01:25.690> I'm<00:01:25.900> going<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.110> open<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.409> up<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.680> little

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
the mug I'm going to open it up a little

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.760 
the mug I'm going to open it up a little
bit<00:01:27.040> wider<00:01:27.280> than<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:28.360> needs<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.750> be<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:32.590> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
bit wider than it needs to be at the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.560 
bit wider than it needs to be at the
base<00:01:32.950> so<00:01:33.549> that<00:01:33.729> can<00:01:33.880> get<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.090> extra<00:01:34.360> clay<00:01:34.540> out

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
base so that can get the extra clay out

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.070 
base so that can get the extra clay out
of<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.780> corner

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.040 

so<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.200> space<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:44.210> inside<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.660> even<00:01:45.810> wider

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
so the space on the inside is even wider

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.900 
so the space on the inside is even wider
than<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.410> outside<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:47.010> it<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.760> I

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
than the outside of it would be but as I

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.350 
than the outside of it would be but as I
pull<00:01:48.210> I'm<00:01:48.660> going<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.110> press<00:01:49.410> this<00:01:50.360> outside

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pull I'm going to press this outside

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.670 
pull I'm going to press this outside
towards<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> center<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.620> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
towards the center and it's going to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.300 
towards the center and it's going to
decrease<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:55.110> bottom<00:01:55.440> it's<00:01:56.220> also

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
decrease that that bottom it's also

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.590 
decrease that that bottom it's also
going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.550> get<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.760> clay<00:01:56.940> out<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> corner

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
going to get the clay out of the corner

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.679 
going to get the clay out of the corner
there

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:12.030 

and<00:02:03.140> into<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.499> wall

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000 

Golovin<00:02:12.640> tumblers<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.239> be<00:02:13.360> thin<00:02:13.689> a<00:02:14.010> thick

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
Golovin tumblers to be thin a thick

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.720 
Golovin tumblers to be thin a thick
heavy<00:02:15.220> tumbler<00:02:16.019> feels<00:02:17.019> bad<00:02:17.379> you<00:02:18.069> know<00:02:18.189> it<00:02:18.430> just

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
heavy tumbler feels bad you know it just

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.179 
heavy tumbler feels bad you know it just
doesn't<00:02:19.720> doesn't<00:02:20.079> feel<00:02:20.439> right<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.980> you're

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:37.949 

at<00:02:27.730> least<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.090> am

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.910 

know<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.050> color<00:02:39.260> in

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.630 

and<00:02:42.310> then<00:02:42.550> at<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.730> bottom

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.860 

and<00:02:46.120> with<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.270> taper<00:02:47.790> or<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.850> want<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.330> waste<00:02:49.600> to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
and with a taper or I want the waste to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.720 
and with a taper or I want the waste to
be

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.270 

by<00:02:53.239> coloring<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:53.810> first

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.640 

and<00:02:57.580> then<00:02:57.880> I'll<00:02:58.000> go<00:02:58.090> back<00:02:58.270> with<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.510> rib<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:02.440> kind

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
and then I'll go back with a rib we kind

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.840 
and then I'll go back with a rib we kind
of<00:03:02.740> define<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:04.650> pressing<00:03:05.650> out<00:03:05.770> against<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.400> to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
of define it pressing out against it to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.420 
of define it pressing out against it to
compress<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.390> clay<00:03:08.820> flip<00:03:09.820> it<00:03:09.940> over<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:12.310> the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
compress the clay flip it over to the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.680 
compress the clay flip it over to the
square<00:03:12.730> side<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.150> rib

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.309 

to<00:03:17.080> find<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.440> lip

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.100 

we<00:03:21.709> want<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:21.920> refine<00:03:22.129> that<00:03:22.190> shape<00:03:22.550> there

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.720 

so<00:03:25.620> it's<00:03:25.740> one<00:03:25.950> smooth<00:03:26.280> curve<00:03:26.610> from<00:03:26.880> top<00:03:27.180> edge

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
so it's one smooth curve from top edge

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.610 
so it's one smooth curve from top edge
to<00:03:29.730> bottom

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.600 

now<00:03:36.620> I'll<00:03:36.710> still<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:37.010> able<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.160> trim<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.460> little

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
now I'll still be able to trim a little

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.120 
now I'll still be able to trim a little
bit<00:03:37.760> out<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.060> bottom<00:03:38.390> there<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:39.980> dip

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
bit out of the bottom there and you dip

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.060 
bit out of the bottom there and you dip
a<00:03:40.160> little<00:03:40.280> more<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.970> little<00:03:41.320> more<00:03:42.320> sasnett's

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
a little more a little more sasnett's

00:03:43.070 --> 00:04:08.790 
a little more a little more sasnett's
there<00:03:43.310> but

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.100 

greedy<00:04:09.800> again

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.210 

that<00:04:15.110> wasn't<00:04:15.349> my<00:04:15.560> powder<00:04:15.769> in<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:15.950> quarter

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
that wasn't my powder in the quarter

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.120 
that wasn't my powder in the quarter
ball<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:18.609> think<00:04:19.609> now
