00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.390
 talk about the best animes 2012 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.420
 before starting I would like to clarify 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.699
 one thing will be a top 7 of course 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.560
 seen more anime but some are not worth 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.339
 worth entering the list 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.429
 well let's start tari tari narrates life 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.050
 of five teenagers in high school 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.090
 waka nasa that is part of the club 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.309
 music but loses interest after the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.260
 death of his mother but in the third 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.300
 institute course meets conax 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.070
 humiliate motohisa guau removes with whom 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.379
 will form the music club again 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.660
 later they also get that tai chí 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.390
 tanaka a badminton player and wood 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.730
 join their club is a good anime about 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.280
 recounts of life and friendship has 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.379
 good animation well-worked landscapes 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.329
 the bad thing is that it can become something 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.609
 cloying and uncomfortable to say it 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.240
 somehow but in itself it's a good 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.820
 anime to see dom 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.160
 but here sakamoto is a young man of 22 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.500
 years that he spends all day in his house 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.140
 playing an online video game called 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.150
 tom of which is one of the best 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.670
 world being in the 10th position of the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.410
 world ranking then one day it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 wakes up on a desert island of 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.930
 pacific and is forced to play high in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.030
 real life with other participants what 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.610
 good is that it has strategic battles 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.040
 and entertaining characters with backgrounds 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.800
 Turbid things of the past, the bad is the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.510
 censorship and the fan service if there is something today 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.700
 in day that bothers me of the animes 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.160
 current is the censorship and the fan service 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.150
 no doubt but by general it is not a bad 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.180
 anime and it is enjoyable robotics notes the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.460
 history is located the year 2019 we 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.740
 tells the story of kite today so it's 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.350
 one of the 5 best players in japan 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.510
 of a video game called kid go is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.670
 in a club robotic club with her friend 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.410
 of childhood here or do not mile to what 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 throughout the series is getting to know more 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.820
 people who are joining the club 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.190
 robotic one day fallen finds himself with 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.810
 walks reports with a person who 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.910
 he died in the past and he tried 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.099
 to transmit through their reports all 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.620
 what he knows and warns about a nearby 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.930
 end of the world it should be noted that it is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.880
 the creators of stein gate so what 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.800
 the series has a high degree of intrigue 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.950
 but in my opinion it is quite far 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.690
 to compare with steins gate has a 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.330
 good ties between history 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.680
 mystery characters in the end is unanimous 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.440
 enjoyable fate 0 is about the fourth 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.480
 war for the holy grail the character 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.239
 main here is emilia kirk it goes up 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.250
 the master of knowing in this sequel is given 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.310
 to get to know the characters better 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.500
 kirk its gilgamesh sakura or rim has 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.840
 a remarkable animation in each chapter and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.269
 good fights the problem are your 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.130
 characters that do not get to know 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.470
 attracting me I would even prefer to 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.319
 characters like ichigo naruto osuna 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.060
 before knowing gilgamesh a character 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.430
 which in my opinion is a bad villain 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.980
 even much worse than they make kill 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.190
 obvious cure I will not name all the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.010
 characters but 95% fail to attract 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.200
 me in my opinion- kirishi berserker 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.770
 immediately they were 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.830
 rescues 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.110
 the others as I said do not appeal to me but 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.600
 ignoring its generic and stereotyped 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.060
 characters is a good anime has 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.550
 strategy good fights and a remarkable 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.900
 animation much better than your next 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.520
 sequel fate stein night code breaker a 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.560
 day going by bus 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.570
 sakura sakura I took a look out the window 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.940
 a lot of people burning alive between 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.680
 blue flames while a boy of his 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.350
 age that is next to the victims 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.790
 look with indifference the next day 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.070
 discover that a new student 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.720
 transferred called ogami king looks like 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.490
 too much to the boy who saw with the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.350
 blue flames and above leads to a 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.870
 suspicious glove alone in the hand 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.120
 left now I find it to be a code 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.010
 breaker a person who does not exist according to 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.740
 the government and that is apparently a 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.360
 murderer in cold blood convinced that 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.640
 the murder is not right 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.130
 sakura cookie will try to stop me ogame 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.140
 and fork in your heart of ice in my 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.210
 opinion is one of the best are in that 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.100
 I have seen and that despite having only 12 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.410
 chapters does not change the fact that it is 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.290
 very good has attractive characters 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.520
 with interesting backgrounds and 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.379
 well used 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.539
 unlike most animes 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.099
 it's unanimous that it has an old style 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.060
 school what makes it even more 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:34.919
 interesting pulls my chinese support us 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.840
 tells the story of Caroni Shimmy who 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.879
 comes to the island kyushu to live with 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.800
 relatives due to the work condition 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.770
 of his father who can not be much 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.960
 time in one place had now been 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.970

 no problem of behavior and quite 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.659
 reserved until one day he meets

 of the same kind of carme which is 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.060
 feared by all because of his 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.220
 impressive physical shape and its 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.949
 ability to get into big fights 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.020
 kaoru begins to know the music is already 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.819

 they begin to have ties of friendship and 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.069
 kaoru meets the first 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.169
 person you can call a friend 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.240
 inside your classroom you 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.310
 meet a girl called ritsuko

 sit down and start practicing jazz 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.940
 daily is a beautiful story that 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.110
 teaches the values ​​of 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.030
 and the charm of jazz music and drinks 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.380
 tells a story located in the future 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.480
 where the coefficient of 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.210
 criminality can be measured by 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.280
 a system called siegel history 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.200
 revolves around a detective named 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.300
 conga missing already from a department of 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.850
 police that is dedicated to solve cases 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.890
 using dominator that is a kind 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.390
 of a weapon capable of measuring efficiency 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.580
 of criminality developed by 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.740
 systems and bull but one day it 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.810
 find a strange case in which 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.970
 the main suspect called maquis and 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.280
 more or hugo to which the civil system does not 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.380
 affects and is called symptomatic since 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.090
 it is impossible to measure your co efficiency 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.790
 criminality and therefore the 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.950
 dominators do not work in the then 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.350
 from there maxims or hugo tries 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.870
 dismantle the civil system being him 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.970
 the only person able to do it is 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.070
 unanimous that is still in emission and leaves

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.050
 contradictions that can lead to 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.480
 civil system 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.700

 protagonists of anime which creates a 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.410
 advantage to have an antagonist of
