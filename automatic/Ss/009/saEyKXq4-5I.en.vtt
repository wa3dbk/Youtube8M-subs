00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
complete lubrication of a speed cube so

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.650 
complete lubrication of a speed cube so
what<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.580> need<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.790> do<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.269> disassemble

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660

what you need to do is just disassemble
the<00:00:10.410> whole<00:00:10.620> cube<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.670> yeah<00:00:12.059> I'm<00:00:12.240> all<00:00:12.540> mine

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the whole cube so yeah I'm all mine

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:22.260 
the whole cube so yeah I'm all mine
corner<00:00:12.990> isn't<00:00:13.080> it

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.830 

you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.600 

edge<00:00:28.380> pieces<00:00:29.060> problem<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.360> to<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> side<00:00:31.610> we

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
edge pieces problem all to the side we

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.220 
edge pieces problem all to the side we
have<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.970> center<00:00:33.270> caps<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:33.810> we'll<00:00:34.020> just

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
have our center caps which we'll just

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.320 
have our center caps which we'll just
toss<00:00:34.440> over<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.790> move<00:00:36.000> them<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
toss over here or just move them to the

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.350 
toss over here or just move them to the
side<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> guess<00:00:36.810> and<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.330> the<00:00:39.330> rest

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
side I guess and then we have the rest

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.350 
side I guess and then we have the rest
of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.900> centerpieces<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.059> I've<00:00:42.059> had<00:00:42.239> this

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
of the centerpieces and I've had this

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
of the centerpieces and I've had this
cube<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> while<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.559> my<00:00:43.680> first<00:00:43.920> speed

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
cube for a while now it's my first speed

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.330 
cube for a while now it's my first speed
cube<00:00:44.400> so<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:45.780> dirty<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.100> tell

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
cube so it's very dirty you can tell

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.369 
cube so it's very dirty you can tell
from<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:48.170> it's<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.860> mess<00:00:51.260> ripped<00:00:52.260> apart

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
from here it's just a mess ripped apart

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.780 
from here it's just a mess ripped apart
and<00:00:52.680> stuff<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.100> I'm<00:00:53.220> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.400> try<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.580> make

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
and stuff but I'm going to try to make

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.910 
and stuff but I'm going to try to make
it<00:00:53.850> better<00:00:54.449> by<00:00:54.750> completely<00:00:55.199> lubricating<00:00:55.830> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it better by completely lubricating it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.229 
it better by completely lubricating it
with<00:00:56.070> traxxas<00:00:56.580> so<00:00:57.420> basically<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:58.830> do<00:00:59.010> is

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.420 

you<00:01:03.239> pretty<00:01:03.480> much<00:01:03.540> take<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> center<00:01:04.199> cap<00:01:04.430> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you pretty much take a center cap so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.880 
you pretty much take a center cap so
i'll<00:01:05.520> start<00:01:05.759> with<00:01:05.820> white<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.649> it's<00:01:07.649> kind<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
i'll start with white and it's kind of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.760 
i'll start with white and it's kind of
messy<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.310> too<00:01:09.110> but<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:10.530> need<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
messy in there too but what you need to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
messy in there too but what you need to
do<00:01:11.009> is<00:01:11.750> pretty<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.899> take<00:01:13.259> traxxas<00:01:14.450> no<00:01:15.450> mate

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
do is pretty much take traxxas no mate

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.690 
do is pretty much take traxxas no mate
weird<00:01:16.350> noise<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.800> usually<00:01:17.220> what<00:01:17.310> i<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
weird noise and usually what i like to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.279 
weird noise and usually what i like to
do<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.090> first<00:01:18.330> apply<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> drop<00:01:20.180> inside<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.600> just

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
do is first apply a drop inside and just

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.180 
do is first apply a drop inside and just
like<00:01:22.500> rub<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> around<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.869> that

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
like rub it around a little bit that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.550 
like rub it around a little bit that
just<00:01:26.190> basically<00:01:26.729> put<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.300> washer<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.930> there

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
just basically put the washer in there

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.180 
just basically put the washer in there
and<00:01:28.850> get<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.210> sit<00:01:30.869> straight<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.979> can

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
and get it to sit straight so you can

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.650 
and get it to sit straight so you can
use<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> screwdriver<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.209> it<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.420> sit

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
use a screwdriver to get it to sit

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.309 
use a screwdriver to get it to sit
straight<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> yeah<00:01:35.910> sitting<00:01:36.660> straight<00:01:37.050> in

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
straight so yeah sitting straight in

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.370 
straight so yeah sitting straight in
there<00:01:37.700> what<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.179> now<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.600> take<00:01:40.319> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
basically now what you do is what I

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.119 
basically now what you do is what I
think<00:03:50.900> most<00:03:51.109> people<00:03:51.409> do<00:03:51.590> if<00:03:51.709> they<00:03:51.739> don't<00:03:52.010> take

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
think most people do if they don't take

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.000 
think most people do if they don't take
the<00:03:52.310> whole<00:03:52.340> cube<00:03:52.639> apart<00:03:52.909> is<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.930> taking<00:03:54.739> it

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
the whole cube apart is just taking it

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.069 
the whole cube apart is just taking it
and<00:03:55.129> pulling<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.329> up<00:03:56.799> to<00:03:57.799> where<00:03:57.919> you<00:03:58.040> can<00:03:58.220> see<00:03:58.519> a

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
and pulling it up to where you can see a

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.599 
and pulling it up to where you can see a
part<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:00.139> the<00:04:00.229> screw<00:04:00.500> I'm<00:04:00.739> sorry<00:04:01.099> if<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.340> can't

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
part of the screw I'm sorry if you can't

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.849 
part of the screw I'm sorry if you can't
if<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:01.970> not<00:04:02.120> focused<00:04:02.599> and<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.620> kind<00:04:03.829> of

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
if it's not focused and this is kind of

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.630 
if it's not focused and this is kind of
hard<00:04:04.009> to<00:04:04.099> do<00:04:04.250> on<00:04:04.280> camera

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.090 

but<00:04:10.540> anyway<00:04:10.960> I<00:04:10.990> think<00:04:11.410> most<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.740> you<00:04:11.860> know<00:04:11.890> what

but anyway I think most of you know what

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.020 
but anyway I think most of you know what
to<00:04:12.250> do<00:04:12.370> just<00:04:12.580> pull<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.000> up<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.830> take<00:04:14.830> lube<00:04:15.130> and

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
to do just pull it up and take lube and

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.360 
to do just pull it up and take lube and
put<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.420> on<00:04:16.540> the<00:04:16.600> shiny<00:04:17.230> screw<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.920> spring

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
put it on the shiny screw and spring

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.160 
put it on the shiny screw and spring
