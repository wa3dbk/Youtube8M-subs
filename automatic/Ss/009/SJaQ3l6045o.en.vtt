00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
ok so it's 250 to start right 30 for an

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060 
ok so it's 250 to start right 30 for an
armband<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.330> 280<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.860> want

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
armband that's 280 and then if you want

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.460 
armband that's 280 and then if you want
the<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.610> bluetooth<00:01:21.030> wireless<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:22.259> said

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the the bluetooth wireless you said

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.179 
the the bluetooth wireless you said
those<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.729> 130<00:01:23.729> 130<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.540> basically<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.830> were

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
those are 130 130 so basically if I were

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.310 
those are 130 130 so basically if I were
to<00:01:26.430> buy<00:01:26.580> all<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> things<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.600> thought<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> wanted

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to buy all the things I thought I wanted

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.910 
to buy all the things I thought I wanted
I<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.520> probably<00:01:29.759> go<00:01:30.030> armband<00:01:30.630> device<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I would probably go armband device and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
I would probably go armband device and
then<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.700> headphones<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.270> would<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.630> 1<00:01:34.110> or

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
then these headphones that would be 1 or

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.910 
then these headphones that would be 1 or
4<00:01:34.710> 10<00:01:34.920> 4<00:01:35.759> 10<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.720> pricey<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.650> very

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
4 10 4 10 so it's pricey but it's very

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.370 
4 10 4 10 so it's pricey but it's very
techie<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:39.000> you're<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.810> you're<00:01:39.990> willing<00:01:40.320> to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.050 
no GPS is you know I spend a lot more
time<00:03:46.560> now<00:03:46.800> actually<00:03:47.489> looking<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.030> the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
time now actually looking on the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.570 
time now actually looking on the
computer<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.780> playing<00:03:49.110> with<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:50.280> know<00:03:50.400> I

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
computer and playing with it you know I

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.180 
computer and playing with it you know I
don't<00:03:50.760> know<00:03:51.000> I'm<00:03:51.390> not<00:03:51.570> really<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:52.620> into<00:03:52.890> that

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
don't know I'm not really that into that

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.230 
don't know I'm not really that into that
so<00:03:53.810> we'll<00:03:54.810> see<00:03:55.050> if<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.290> continue<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.830> do<00:03:55.890> that

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
so we'll see if I continue to do that

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.710 
so we'll see if I continue to do that
but<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:58.430> know<00:03:58.550> I<00:03:58.790> think<00:03:59.030> it's<00:03:59.390> one<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.570> the

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
but you know I think it's one of the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.180 
but you know I think it's one of the
smallest<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.350> lightest<00:04:00.740> on<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.010> mark

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
smallest and the lightest on the mark

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.310 
smallest and the lightest on the mark
here<00:04:01.340> right<00:04:01.490> now<00:04:01.640> which<00:04:01.910> is<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.540> she's<00:04:03.050> in<00:04:03.230> the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
here right now which is and she's in the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.580 
here right now which is and she's in the
cell<00:04:03.560> phone<00:04:03.590> technology<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.470> like<00:04:06.470> I'll

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
cell phone technology and so like I'll

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.340 
cell phone technology and so like I'll
run<00:04:06.950> with<00:04:06.980> other<00:04:07.280> people<00:04:07.610> who<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:07.880> different

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
run with other people who have different

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.830 
run with other people who have different
gps<00:04:09.350> watches<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:10.040> mine<00:04:10.370> always<00:04:10.820> gets<00:04:11.150> more

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
gps watches and mine always gets more

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.960 
gps watches and mine always gets more
distance<00:04:12.260> than<00:04:12.320> theirs<00:04:12.740> which<00:04:13.160> means<00:04:13.430> mine<00:04:13.790> is

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
distance than theirs which means mine is

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.570 
distance than theirs which means mine is
keeping<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.360> signal<00:04:14.860> more<00:04:15.860> than<00:04:16.100> theirs<00:04:16.310> is

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
keeping a signal more than theirs is

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.840 
keeping a signal more than theirs is
right<00:04:17.530> I'm<00:04:18.530> not<00:04:18.680> running<00:04:19.100> farther<00:04:19.430> than<00:04:19.610> them

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
right I'm not running farther than them

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.280 
right I'm not running farther than them
we're<00:04:20.120> running<00:04:20.450> together<00:04:21.490> and<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:23.360> not<00:04:23.570> you

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
we're running together and it's not you

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.590 
we're running together and it's not you
know<00:04:24.380> it's<00:04:24.410> not<00:04:24.620> adding<00:04:25.040> distance<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:26.330> uh

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
know it's not adding distance it's uh

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.520 
know it's not adding distance it's uh
it's<00:04:26.930> just<00:04:27.260> mapping<00:04:27.650> more<00:04:28.220> accurately<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.530> oh

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
it's just mapping more accurately so oh

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.380 
it's just mapping more accurately so oh
and<00:04:31.070> then<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.370> other<00:04:31.400> thing<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:32.000> does<00:04:32.030> have<00:04:32.360> a

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
and then the other thing it does have a

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.970 
and then the other thing it does have a
heart<00:04:32.630> rate<00:04:32.840> monitor<00:04:32.900> which<00:04:33.410> i<00:04:33.590> think<00:04:33.650> i<00:04:33.950> would

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
heart rate monitor which i think i would

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.770 
heart rate monitor which i think i would
actually<00:04:34.250> kind<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.640> like<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.880> get<00:04:35.060> in<00:04:35.630> the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
actually kind of like to get in the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.820 
actually kind of like to get in the
price<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.170> that<00:04:36.230> that's<00:04:36.560> 70<00:04:37.130> um<00:04:38.290> but<00:04:39.290> then<00:04:39.470> you

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
price on that that's 70 um but then you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.800 
price on that that's 70 um but then you
can<00:04:41.980> it'll<00:04:42.980> it'll<00:04:43.280> give<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> workout<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.690> do

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
can it'll it'll give you a workout to do

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.860 
can it'll it'll give you a workout to do
with<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.110> heart<00:04:45.380> rate<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.760> it'll<00:04:47.240> help<00:04:47.690> you

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
with the heart rate and it'll help you

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.200 
with the heart rate and it'll help you
figure<00:04:48.050> out<00:04:48.230> like<00:04:48.620> your<00:04:48.950> heart<00:04:49.730> rate<00:04:49.940> zones

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
figure out like your heart rate zones

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.760 
figure out like your heart rate zones
and<00:04:50.450> things<00:04:50.630> like<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.020> you<00:04:51.290> can<00:04:51.470> get<00:04:51.590> some

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
and things like that so you can get some

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.050 
and things like that so you can get some
more<00:04:51.800> accurate<00:04:52.220> training<00:04:52.550> which<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:52.850> really

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
more accurate training which is really

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.860 
more accurate training which is really
pretty<00:04:53.180> sweet<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:54.700> lot<00:04:55.700> of<00:04:55.730> stuff<00:04:56.060> that<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.570> coach

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
pretty sweet a lot of stuff that a coach

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.380 
pretty sweet a lot of stuff that a coach
would<00:04:57.380> be<00:04:57.500> able<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.710> do<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:58.010> you<00:04:58.100> too<00:04:58.280> but<00:04:58.700> if

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
would be able to do for you too but if

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.700 
would be able to do for you too but if
you're<00:04:59.660> really<00:04:59.870> just<00:04:59.990> kind<00:05:00.290> of<00:05:00.350> starting<00:05:00.680> to

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
you're really just kind of starting to

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.100 
you're really just kind of starting to
get<00:05:00.860> into<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:01.720> you're<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.750> little<00:05:02.900> bit

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
get into it and and you're a little bit

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.080 
get into it and and you're a little bit
techy<00:05:03.470> this<00:05:04.190> would<00:05:04.370> be<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.520> really<00:05:04.610> good<00:05:04.880> way<00:05:05.030> to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
techy this would be a really good way to

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.240 
techy this would be a really good way to
go
