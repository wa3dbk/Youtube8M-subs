00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.870
 interesting many got used i'm little 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.199
 they say that this is a screwdriver 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.240
 absolutely useless and unnecessary place 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.130
 this does not agree to me she periodically 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:18.880
 need even now you do not need 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:18.880
 walk away this one that's holding 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:32.919
 dior I want to immediately warn 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:36.760
 everything is held here very, very much 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.760
 mad power of neodymium magnet 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.210
 so laugh 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.890
 nothing but magic I don't need a head 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:53.810
 looked through it was possible to return it to me 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:57.290
 it is not necessary it actually is 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.690
 why did you do all this today 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.000
 Neodymium magnet on site 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:06.960
 the only thing that this magnet is very 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.330
 strongly glued I donâ€™t know what to tear off 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.350
 screwdriver 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:16.010
 does not work so I pinch in a vice 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.620
 one end and in another way I beat with a hammer 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:23.970
 after that the magnet is peeled off from here 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.600
 this substrate after which we have it 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:31.200
 add one pile 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:34.980
 magnets are extremely strong now breaking 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.110
 this bundle, I can not that is 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:44.310
 catch ratovat can not 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:47.190
 only turning their unplugging and so what 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.910
 I did all this for what I needed 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:55.050
 this is not a stack of magnet volumes like 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.950
 recently i say i got myself 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.290
 Chinese apex to blade 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:04.200
 kept on 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:07.470
 this site right here this 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.410
 place i will put this pack of neodymium 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.890
 magnets and they just fit 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:17.730
 here here I can put it either way 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:19.830
 either like this then i won these 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:24.390
 here are the bolts and put there neodymium 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:26.160
 the magnet then the knife set on 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:30.599
 This bar will sit here 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:34.120
 put in all 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:38.379
 understand the mind prayer still 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.680
 taking the opportunity drove terrible and bought 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:45.849
 such rings 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:50.020
 who doesn't know from from this kit you need 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:52.870
 only nut diameter is 8 millimeters she 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.360
 needed to compensate for height 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.849
 our sharpened glasses that is if i will 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.650
 use different stones for height here 

00:07:57.849 --> 00:08:02.500
 we will need this gadget very much 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.330
 Here I think in one of the following videos I 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.069
 show for what and how it is used 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.069
 thank you all, bye
