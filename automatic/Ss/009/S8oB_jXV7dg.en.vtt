a major earthquake the study used an
example<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.860> magnitude<00:00:41.340> eight<00:00:41.520> quake<00:00:41.940> with

intensified and may produce them
downtown<00:00:54.750> area<00:00:55.489> there<00:00:56.489> might<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.730> possible

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
downtown area there might be possible

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.790 
downtown area there might be possible
just<00:00:57.360> having<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.930> damages<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.590> these

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
just having more damages of these

so<00:01:00.989> weird<00:01:01.649> means<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.219> than<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.579> buildings

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so weird means more than one buildings

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570 
so weird means more than one buildings
