00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.080
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.630
 xia is this time about this theme 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.160
 I want to work with Pendora xia 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.340
 It's a bit of a pity to introduce three exercises that I did in high school 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300
 If you would like to see this video that you would like to do 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.630
 Though it is practice that we did in the last junior high school era though 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.359
 I did three introductions, but 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.050
 Fore or back-to-back drive 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.260
 To some extent the basic technology is done and the ball is moved further and stronger 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.809
 It is after getting to be able to hit such after 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.399
 Very effective when you look at it 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.500
 If you think it is expensive, there are three practice methods 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.660
 I would like to introduce you one by one 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.000
 At first it is a back two-thirds and two-thirds all 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Practice method to hit 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.970
 Next is the second but it is multi-ball practice 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.080
 There were various practice methods though 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 There is a memory I did a lot of multi-ball practice anyway 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.100
 Finally the third and third is the practice of the third ball 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.940
 The menu decided by the teacher to some extent 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.090
 It is in this and while thinking by myself 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.159
 There is practice that we did though 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.000
 Basic technology has been achieved to some extent as a theme 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.110
 I moved and hit a strong ball in the fore 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.959
 The next thing to do is move and strike 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.950
 It is practice to connect to 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.159
 I think that it will be absolutely necessary 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.349
 So I did my first two thirds of my back 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.939
 All fore is simply the widest 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.609
 Though it is practice method to cover 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.030
 For example, practice on the bench of multi-ball practice 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.360
 After all, stop and stop with receive 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.690
 What is it like flicking? 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.130
 Don't let your opponent hit it, for yourself 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.180
 It is the technology to make a chance, and it is the third game 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.389
 For example, I use my own doubles starting point 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.290
 The partner was serving because 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.830
 If I use it back when I put it out 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.330
 The partner is attacked 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.370
 I can process it with forehand and attack 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.410
 And after serving out, it's all ttsutuki and so on 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.800
 Stop the aztz ski all 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.180
 After processing it and with footwork 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.710
 Move in the way you say and have a strong ball 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.120
 Even if you can hit it, it will be connected there 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.780
 It is the technology of chance make 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.490
 It will be necessary if the level goes up 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.990
 Anyway, I went through high school days with such technology 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.050
 I have memories so I used to be in junior high school 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.970
 We did practice three introductions though 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.770
 The first thing to do is to acquire basic technology 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.080
 It is a foreback rumbling drive 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.460
 Let's wear those things first 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.180
 Next, people with the Fore Main battle move well 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.289
 Let's get to hit a strong ball 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.910
 The next thing to do is 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.850
 What chance to make a strong forehand 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.680
 It is to say that the technology of chance make 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.289
 It is said that we will increase accuracy and enhance 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.210
 A way to improve one forehand main battle type 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.300
 I think this video Forehand main battle type I think 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.180
 Though it is quite difficult 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.330
 After all, a forehand is a powerful ball 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.850
 I can hit a high ball that the ball enters with confidence 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.270
 It is a technique that can be entered if you practice low balls stably 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.319
 It is a technology with a very sense of security, so such players 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.030
 Instructors also follow the flow of this practice method 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.500
 I think if you can refer to one 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.910
 Thank you very much for your reference
