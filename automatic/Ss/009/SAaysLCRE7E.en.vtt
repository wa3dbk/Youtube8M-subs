see in a minute these photos take a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.290 
see in a minute these photos take a
little<00:00:32.880> bit<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.059> pre-planning<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:35.309> I'll<00:00:36.000> show

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
how I said files because there will be

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.610 
how I said files because there will be
two<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.280> them<00:00:45.260> open<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:48.020> as<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
two of them open and as you can see I

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
two of them open and as you can see I
have<00:00:49.829> two<00:00:50.010> files<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.879> takes<00:00:51.090> two

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
have two files because it takes two

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.600

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
photo in the right place without it

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.330 
photo in the right place without it
being<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.849> weird<00:02:36.000> it'll<00:02:36.330> drop<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.340> directly

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
being all weird it'll drop it directly

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.949 
being all weird it'll drop it directly
above<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.810> photo<00:02:40.019> below<00:02:40.380> which<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.400> nice<00:02:41.959> and

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
above the photo below which is nice and

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.259 
above the photo below which is nice and
so<00:02:43.319> that's<00:02:44.100> what<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.580> far<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.120> knew

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
so that's what we have so far but I knew

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.809 
so that's what we have so far but I knew
actually<00:02:45.390> need<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.780> flip<00:02:46.019> these<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.890> let's

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
actually need to flip these so let's

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.509 
actually need to flip these so let's
unlock<00:02:48.299> that<00:02:48.569> layer<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.230> drag<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.220> on

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
unlock that layer and drag this one on

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.920 
unlock that layer and drag this one on
top<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.600> it's<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.799> there<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:53.430> go

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
top so that it's like that there we go

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.370 
top so that it's like that there we go
that's<00:02:54.930> better

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
that's better

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.470 
that's better
now<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:55.920> need<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.220> do<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.910> create<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.110> layer<00:02:58.410> mask

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
now we need to do is create a layer mask

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
now we need to do is create a layer mask
with<00:03:00.480> black<00:03:01.310> blocks<00:03:02.310> selected<00:03:03.200> go<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
with black blocks selected go on the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.890 
with black blocks selected go on the
layer<00:03:04.680> mask<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:06.480> sorry<00:03:07.040> with<00:03:08.090> white<00:03:09.090> selected

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
layer mask and sorry with white selected

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.710 
layer mask and sorry with white selected
I<00:03:10.670> always<00:03:11.670> mix<00:03:11.819> those<00:03:12.030> up<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.540> white

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
I always mix those up with white

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.890 
I always mix those up with white

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.259 
selected you just go ahead and take the
brush<00:03:16.109> tool<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:17.359> paint<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:19.530> bucket<00:03:19.799> up<00:03:20.269> see

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
brush tool and paint the bucket up see

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.530 
brush tool and paint the bucket up see
really<00:03:21.720> easy<00:03:21.870> really<00:03:22.440> simple<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:24.390> just

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
really easy really simple and you just

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.630 
really easy really simple and you just
panned<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:25.049> as<00:03:25.290> close<00:03:25.769> as<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.100> can<00:03:26.340> with<00:03:26.609> a

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
panned up as close as you can with a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.210 
panned up as close as you can with a
hard<00:03:26.940> brush<00:03:27.209> if<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.660> use<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.989> soft<00:03:28.319> brush<00:03:28.590> like

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
hard brush if you use a soft brush like

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.390 
hard brush if you use a soft brush like
this<00:03:29.480> better<00:03:30.480> shot<00:03:30.750> brick<00:03:31.310> you'll<00:03:32.310> be

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
this better shot brick you'll be

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.780 
this better shot brick you'll be
painting<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.970> it'll<00:03:33.780> dig<00:03:34.709> into<00:03:34.920> your<00:03:35.190> models

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
painting and it'll dig into your models

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.750 
painting and it'll dig into your models
so<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:35.970> want<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.239> use<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.359> hard<00:03:36.540> brush<00:03:36.600> for<00:03:36.959> that

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
so you want to use a hard brush for that

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.750 
so you want to use a hard brush for that
so<00:03:38.760> use<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> hard<00:03:39.389> brush<00:03:40.819> press<00:03:41.819> Z<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.569> zoom<00:03:43.139> in

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
so use a hard brush press Z to zoom in

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.000 
so use a hard brush press Z to zoom in
get<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> little<00:03:45.030> bit<00:03:45.120> closer<00:03:45.889> and<00:03:47.090> just<00:03:48.090> keep

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
get a little bit closer and just keep

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.340 
get a little bit closer and just keep
painting<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.220> out<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.730> when<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.810> get<00:03:51.959> really

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
painting it out and when you get really

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.970 
painting it out and when you get really
close<00:03:52.859> I<00:03:54.829> like<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.980> do<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:57.470> go<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.530> your<00:03:58.769> brush

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
close I like to do is go to your brush

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.509 
close I like to do is go to your brush
settings<00:03:59.220> and<00:04:00.230> squish<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.829> then<00:04:02.160> angle

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
settings and squish this and then angle

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.150 
settings and squish this and then angle
it<00:04:02.910> up<00:04:03.799> so<00:04:04.799> that<00:04:04.829> your<00:04:05.100> brush<00:04:05.370> is<00:04:05.549> nice<00:04:05.790> and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
it up so that your brush is nice and

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.479 
it up so that your brush is nice and
thin<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:09.000> can<00:04:09.150> get<00:04:09.329> really<00:04:09.569> close<00:04:10.489> and

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
thin and you can get really close and

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.069 
thin and you can get really close and
have<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> lot<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:13.459> control<00:04:14.459> over<00:04:14.870> exactly<00:04:15.870> what

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
have a lot of control over exactly what

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.860 
have a lot of control over exactly what
you<00:04:16.380> want<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.650> paint<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.700> don't<00:04:18.630> want<00:04:18.840> to

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
you want to paint and don't want to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.660 
you want to paint and don't want to

paint
so<00:04:20.980> just<00:04:21.980> kind<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.430> go<00:04:22.700> right<00:04:23.180> along<00:04:24.280> getting

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
so just kind of go right along getting

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.980 
so just kind of go right along getting
the<00:04:25.520> bucket<00:04:25.850> out<00:04:26.320> that's<00:04:27.320> our<00:04:27.560> goal<00:04:27.860> here<00:04:28.990> make

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
the bucket out that's our goal here make

and then you can kind of just go along
the<00:06:03.530> edge<00:06:04.150> here<00:06:05.150> a<00:06:05.180> little<00:06:05.570> bit<00:06:08.470> just<00:06:09.470> to<00:06:09.620> kind

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
the edge here a little bit just to kind

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.730 
the edge here a little bit just to kind
of<00:06:13.040> soften<00:06:13.610> it<00:06:13.730> up<00:06:13.850> a<00:06:14.120> little<00:06:14.720> bit<00:06:14.960> that<00:06:15.590> was

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
of soften it up a little bit that was

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.490 
of soften it up a little bit that was
too<00:06:15.920> much<00:06:16.070> so<00:06:16.420> go<00:06:17.420> back<00:06:18.880> get<00:06:19.880> rid<00:06:20.030> of<00:06:20.090> that

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.990 

but<00:06:23.500> yeah<00:06:23.710> use<00:06:24.070> a<00:06:24.100> soft<00:06:24.460> brush<00:06:26.010> to<00:06:27.010> just<00:06:27.520> soften

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
but yeah use a soft brush to just soften

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.180 
but yeah use a soft brush to just soften
it<00:06:28.450> up<00:06:28.540> a<00:06:28.980> little<00:06:29.980> bit<00:06:31.650> and<00:06:32.650> then<00:06:32.950> when<00:06:33.070> you

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
it up a little bit and then when you

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.520 
it up a little bit and then when you
zoom<00:06:33.400> out<00:06:34.350> it<00:06:35.350> won't<00:06:35.530> be<00:06:35.650> as<00:06:35.770> hard<00:06:35.920> edged<00:06:36.160> so

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
zoom out it won't be as hard edged so

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.080 
zoom out it won't be as hard edged so
yeah<00:06:38.530> that's<00:06:38.950> what<00:06:39.130> you<00:06:39.190> can<00:06:39.340> do<00:06:39.490> so<00:06:39.790> I<00:06:39.820> think

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
yeah that's what you can do so I think

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.440 
yeah that's what you can do so I think
that's<00:06:40.390> it<00:06:40.540> for<00:06:40.720> this<00:06:40.810> tutorial<00:06:42.450> hopefully

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450
