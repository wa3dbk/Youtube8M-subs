00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.850
 and well that state is that you are 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.310
 Commenting distracted gameplay of black 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.589
 ops 2 and how are you looking at the simple 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.049
 map stand off and well I am going to 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.030
 talk about a rather peculiar console 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.400
 which is barely talked about because 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.080
 obviously it's much smaller than 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.720
 any other console 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.150
 removing the xbox of 120 that they announced 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.779
 next month and also removing the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.550
 play 4 the case I will not tell you a 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.460
 little how did all this start? 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.160
 some time ago on one of those pages 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.920
 of crowdfunding ie websites 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.039
 which emerged as a kind of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.719
 place where I could help people 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.579
 that was say that in development is 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.710
 say imagine that I have a super 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.359
 project the idea is very good but not 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.890
 I have money to carry it out is 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.449
 say imagine that I who invented 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.010
 teleportation or I know that while 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.620
 a website like function marries 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.600
 from a console something that you think 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.250
 it's super good you can put a page 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.899
 web like for example kickstarter that was 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.789
 of the first ones that started then 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.590
 you had there you put look I need this 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.160
 for this this and it will be better you put that 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.810
 you are 500,000 million 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.060
 1500 or whatever you put what 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.050
 believe that what it may cost, let's say 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.160
 that development is to say it can cost 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.440
 to do the project you have in mind 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.470
 and if you like it, people will 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.010
 support and make donations let's say that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.290
 that is basically the goal not the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.520
 people if it's true that maybe you 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.900
 they say hear look at each one of us 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.400
 help is going to have the game for free or if it is 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.050
 the console because the best thing is going to have the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.650
 free or good console let's say that 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.700
 it's something like one support projects 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.870
 place where you can find 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.830
 projects that maybe you can 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.990
 like and the people who want to invest 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.790
 Well, let's say you can leave 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.020
 pretty good and you can find some 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.420
 a much simpler way to go 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.040
 asking one by one let's say this 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.619
 console came out there in a kind of 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.570
 project and it turns out that you can not I do not know 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.670
 how much the limit they needed if 500 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.370
 thousand 200 thousand or one million but the case is 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.240
 who got 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.910
 eight and a half million dollars with the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.740
 which can finance and power we leave 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.780
 that came to do the console that is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.000
 They spent more than a lot of people 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.500
 liked the idea of a fascinating 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.450
 Idris is worth it and what does this have 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.430
 console not because the console is a device 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.170
 super small actually comes with a 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.880
 console already a command and I think it's going to 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.430
 cost about 299 dollars that is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.290
 imagine how the console can be 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.840
 super super cheap triple go low 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.700
 that the console away from me is super cheap and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.770
 because it's cheap because it's not going to have 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.780
 I explain games will have no game is 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.240
 what good as we know ourselves is 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.320
 physically say what you are going to have is going to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 to be simply a kind of everyone 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.460
 the games are going to be free to try is 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.010
 say will be connected by the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.750
 television and that is to say you are going to cross 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.390
 the internet you will see the entire list of 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.840
 games that there is and also this list of 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.940
 games 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.920
 let's say you're going to be able to try the game 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.050
 that you want all will be like 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.760
 playable demos and if you like it then I'll 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.830
 shopping and we have every center 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.350
 downloaded through the internet not something 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.030
 well let's say you 're super cheap 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.800
 because the only thing they have to do 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.360
 You can download how you can do it 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.830
 better from your mobile or from any 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.860
 thing then that but on a much scale 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.810
 greater in terms of graphical section how 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.760
 do what benefits are going to bring and 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.440
 I do not know exactly how it works 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.690
 I have no idea but I do know that 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.569
 I can say that you bring a console for 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.450
 $ 99 with the included command and with 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.670
 everything looks like it actually comes out in 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.350
 June so imagine the little 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.110
 advertising that obviously has between no 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.940
 to carry out but have in 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.820
 account that is that it costs 9 book of 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.250
 dollars and it looks good the truth and 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.840
 Well the truth is that he is calling me 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.180
 quite the attention simply because 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.880
 if I do not know how many people is to say yes 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.250
 Equis have a budget of money and 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.440
 I do not know I think there's a sixty-odd 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.400
 thousand people who have helped grow 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.080
 that project is to say that they have invested 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.920
 in that project 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.740
 oysters will be for something and I guess not 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.210
 is going to be a console that hey well 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.410
 I look at a kid I'm better at parents 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.150
 of spending 500 600 800 euros on a 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.650
 console that is how secure that is what 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.140
 surely better work of the 400 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.960
 euros then buy a 99 console 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.850
 dollars or whatever it will have then 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.730
 imagine that those games and let's say it is 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.720
 another type of console let's not say 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.920
 oysters this has shown that no 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.690
 they are only with sonars always 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.580
 but anyone can get more or 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.600
 less and make your own console though 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.940
 will not always be the war of 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.410
 consoles of the same let's say this 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.140
 people played like from another category with 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.950
 a thousand times lower budgets 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.240
 let's all say that inferior to what 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.480
 which can be any other type of 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.160
 console but well I do not know just 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.290
 will have to wait I do not know what it is 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.050
 what do you think, I think that as 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.930
 idea is pretty well the truth and without 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.330
 I do not know if it will hurt me to buy but the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.950
 costumes that are 99 dollars is that it is little 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.360
 some say a bit more than 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.700
 that costs you a game is not a game 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.740
 of cost 70 for like 20 dollars more and 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.160
 I bought a new console with a remote 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.470
 with everything good to look for simply since 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.259
 is on which is the console described 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.490
 where you are looking for one thing is super 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.160
 small that seems like a kind of 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.750
 tiny speaker and as he said he 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.460
 connect the TV and from there you can 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.289
 buy all the games as I say no 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.150
 has neither cedes has practically no 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.520
 nothing and the good thing is that all the 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.930
 demos are playable I do not know to what extent 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.130
 nor how will they work if it is to say 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.199
 it would be better if you have to lower the 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.930
 demos or maybe it will be played in 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.130
 streaming I explain you know that when 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.590
 here is out a demo of any 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.940
 game thing is still mobile or what 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.560
 you had to get off you always have to 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.229
 download the demo and play it but without 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.810
 But there is a kind of market that 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.150
 it's a new kind of videogames that 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.470
 they are thinking about doing in which 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.699
 you do not have to download anything 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.130
 you just play some servers 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.690
 as already explained in a previous video 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.190
 you just play some servers 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.500
 which are housed to better or 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.330
 imagine Germany and with our 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.880
 servers with a decent internet I think 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.560
 what you have to have to be able to play and 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.870
 you can play in streaming that is 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.070
 while having nothing housed in 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.930
 your console we could say 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.990
 I personally find it super good 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.450
 idea the truth is that I think it is 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.260
 something incredible but good I do not know how they go 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.640
 to work if maybe the 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.350
 shown you have to download now or the 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.360
 let's give as I say you do not need 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.250
 even get off the I do not know just 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.840
 is for you to be aware that there 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.240
 there will be more consoles not only going to 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.830
 be the play 4 and the xbox and others but 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.450
 well up here everything if you liked 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.310
 the video vote the subscribed ones for not 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.960
 lose any more video and now 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.480
 Tell me what you think if you know 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.860
 about this console or not or what 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.150
 expectations you think you may have no 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.960
 it simply happens and if you are going to buy 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.970
 better the xbox or the console that is that 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.740
 from console better nothing happens that has 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.740
 been everything and we see it the next goodbye
