lot about this device in Feng Shui it's
got<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> powerful<00:00:23.070> energy<00:00:23.280> if<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:24.150> at<00:00:24.300> it

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
got a powerful energy if you look at it

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.470 
got a powerful energy if you look at it
just<00:00:24.690> analyze<00:00:25.530> the<00:00:26.310> average<00:00:27.300> TV<00:00:28.110> set<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:29.480> look

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
we're grouping it with stereo equipment

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.319 
we're grouping it with stereo equipment
and<00:00:34.079> tuners<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.590> receivers<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.060> there's<00:00:36.240> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
and tuners and receivers so there's a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.050 
and tuners and receivers so there's a
lot<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.660> electrical<00:00:37.260> energy<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.520> here

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
lot of electrical energy going on here

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.990 
lot of electrical energy going on here
and<00:00:39.440> if<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.560> look<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.280> some<00:00:41.489> signals

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and if you look at it it's some signals

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.870 
and if you look at it it's some signals
for<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.810> to<00:00:42.960> three<00:00:43.200> days<00:00:43.440> after<00:00:44.130> it's<00:00:44.670> been

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
for up to three days after it's been

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.990 
for up to three days after it's been
switched<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.960> mean<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:46.890> EMF<00:00:47.520> signals

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
switched off I mean these EMF signals

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.720 
switched off I mean these EMF signals
are<00:00:48.149> extremely<00:00:48.989> strong<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:50.280> means<00:00:50.489> you're

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
are extremely strong that means you're

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.660 
are extremely strong that means you're
drawn<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.060> the<00:00:51.690> television<00:00:52.250> even<00:00:53.250> when<00:00:53.489> it's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
drawn to the television even when it's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.110 
drawn to the television even when it's
switched<00:00:53.880> off<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.090> be

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
switched off so when it's not it can be

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
switched off so when it's not it can be
almost<00:00:57.390> hypnotic<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.530> functions<00:00:58.950> in

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
almost hypnotic because of functions in

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.799 
almost hypnotic because of functions in
the<00:00:59.190> spectrum<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> alpha<00:01:00.239> brainwave

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the spectrum of the alpha brainwave

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.440 
the spectrum of the alpha brainwave
range<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.860> automatically<00:01:02.640> forces<00:01:03.239> us<00:01:03.420> into

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
range that automatically forces us into

range that automatically forces us into
a<00:01:03.809> relaxed<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.309> hypnotic<00:01:05.850> state<00:01:06.149> folks
