of this triangle just like so then I'm

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.190 
of this triangle just like so then I'm
gonna<00:01:59.030> open<00:01:59.179> that<00:01:59.390> up<00:01:59.689> that'll<00:02:00.049> be<00:02:00.170> a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
reference line we'll use in a minute if

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.960 
reference line we'll use in a minute if
I<00:02:03.140> rotate<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.740> bill<00:02:03.920> I'm<00:02:04.099> going<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.369> lift<00:02:04.729> up

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.070 

I<00:02:46.940> know<00:02:47.940> my<00:02:48.120> fingers<00:02:48.480> are<00:02:48.600> getting<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.050> way

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
I know my fingers are getting in the way

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.420 
I know my fingers are getting in the way
but<00:02:51.140> I'm<00:02:52.140> gonna<00:02:52.260> get<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> good<00:02:52.740> crease<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.220> there

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
but I'm gonna get a good crease in there

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.780 
but I'm gonna get a good crease in there
and<00:02:53.880> then<00:02:54.000> we<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.330> put<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.110> down<00:02:55.640> all<00:02:56.640> right

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
and then we can put that down all right

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.790 
and then we can put that down all right
so<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.209> put<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.510> flat<00:02:57.750> back<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.260> we<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.560> now

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
so we put the flat back and we have now

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.580 
so we put the flat back and we have now
what<00:02:59.640> looks<00:02:59.819> like<00:02:59.940> an<00:03:00.090> arrow<00:03:00.470> what<00:03:01.470> we're

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
what looks like an arrow what we're

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.110 
what looks like an arrow what we're

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
gonna do is we're gonna lift up this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.710 
gonna do is we're gonna lift up this
flap<00:03:03.750> here<00:03:04.430> holding<00:03:05.430> these<00:03:05.610> down<00:03:05.970> this

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
flap here holding these down this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.449 
flap here holding these down this
reference<00:03:07.050> line<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.590> made<00:03:07.800> earlier<00:03:08.160> where<00:03:08.340> we

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
reference line we made earlier where we

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.810 
reference line we made earlier where we
folded<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.510> tip<00:03:09.810> back<00:03:10.050> we're<00:03:10.740> going<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.130> lift

folded this tip back we're going to lift

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.660 
folded this tip back we're going to lift
this<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.380> point<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.130> right<00:03:14.340> underneath

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
this to that point so right underneath

this to that point so right underneath
there<00:03:15.090> you'll<00:03:15.300> see<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.630> we'll<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.050> go

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
there you'll see that we'll just go

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.610 
there you'll see that we'll just go
ahead<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.590> fold<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:18.170> now<00:03:19.170> what<00:03:19.350> we're<00:03:19.500> gonna

of the whole thing we're going to fold

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.729 
of the whole thing we're going to fold
these<00:03:25.080> sides<00:03:25.470> down<00:03:26.989> along<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.320> center<00:03:28.709> line

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
these sides down along this center line

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.080 
these sides down along this center line
so<00:03:29.250> I'll<00:03:29.340> show<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.550> what<00:03:29.670> we're<00:03:29.760> gonna<00:03:29.850> do<00:03:30.000> I'm

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
so I'll show you what we're gonna do I'm

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.270 
so I'll show you what we're gonna do I'm
going<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.239> take<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.600> edge<00:03:31.130> holding<00:03:32.130> this

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
going to take this edge holding this

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.370 
going to take this edge holding this
down<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.850> I'm<00:03:32.970> going<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.300> fold<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:34.110> down

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.540 

crease<00:03:37.380> in<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.680> center<00:03:42.830> we<00:03:43.830> do<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.130> same<00:03:44.370> to

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
crease in the center we do the same to

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:58.500 
crease in the center we do the same to
this<00:03:44.700> side

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.339 

and<00:03:59.080> I<00:03:59.260> will<00:03:59.590> fix<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.099> side<00:04:00.519> because<00:04:01.349> it

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
and I will fix this side because it

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:08.520 
and I will fix this side because it
could<00:04:02.530> be<00:04:02.560> better

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.530 

all<00:04:09.040> right<00:04:09.220> once<00:04:09.610> we<00:04:09.790> have<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.240> where<00:04:10.390> we

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
all right once we have it to where we

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.770 
all right once we have it to where we
like<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:11.069> what<00:04:12.069> we're<00:04:12.250> going<00:04:12.550> to<00:04:12.610> do<00:04:12.970> is<00:04:13.390> at

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
like it what we're going to do is at

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.510 
like it what we're going to do is at
this<00:04:13.930> point<00:04:14.200> we're<00:04:14.319> going<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.590> flip<00:04:15.010> this<00:04:15.220> over

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
this point we're going to flip this over

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.030 
this point we're going to flip this over
and<00:04:16.000> then<00:04:16.480> we're<00:04:16.600> going<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.750> fold<00:04:17.139> this<00:04:17.470> corner

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
and then we're going to fold this corner

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.120 
and then we're going to fold this corner
back<00:04:18.220> down<00:04:19.560> we're<00:04:20.560> going<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.739> fold<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.100> down

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
back down we're going to fold it down

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.840 
back down we're going to fold it down
make<00:04:21.609> this<00:04:21.790> arrow<00:04:22.110> meet<00:04:23.110> up<00:04:23.260> with<00:04:23.470> our<00:04:23.850> crease

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
make this arrow meet up with our crease

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.879 
make this arrow meet up with our crease
line<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:26.100> then<00:04:27.100> once<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.460> does<00:04:27.700> we<00:04:28.030> can<00:04:28.740> cap<00:04:29.740> it

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
line and then once it does we can cap it

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.750 
line and then once it does we can cap it
down<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:32.070> believe<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.190> or<00:04:33.280> not<00:04:33.400> we're<00:04:33.610> almost

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
down and believe it or not we're almost

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.790 
down and believe it or not we're almost
