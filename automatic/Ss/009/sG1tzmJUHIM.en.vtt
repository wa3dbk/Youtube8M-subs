00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.490
 this is a map a plateau the arrival at beauvais as part of a 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.900
 search back tomorrow from 2002 to 2006 we continued then in 2010 the map 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.860
 territorial disparities in education so more on my 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.499
 Thu 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.269
 and one more we are dealing with departments 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.339
 in situation of deaf academic success while you observe who 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.609
 is still a paradox 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.329
 the people we love concentration of the mouse site around the capital then 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.839
 that the capital and its periphery are enumerated as concentrated what there is 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.960
 two years gray matter in this country of wealth and so on would you be 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.489
 surprised, for example, to learn that one of the first departments under 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.850
 school success in France 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.649
 it was that of the civilians had killed at the same time one of the departments the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.329
 richer france then why and what the ruhr does have a concentration of 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.160
 power and wealth 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.339
 we will take the time of the mouse one of them 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.510
 first department on succeeded by then ottawa and the second is the law 

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:03.189
 retains department m worker he has why because in these 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.979
 departments where are concentrated powers and wealth and where by 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.190
 elsewhere but high density 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.610
 new grades and school but the rum route is afp 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.760
 very marked segregation phenomena in other words the poor and the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.820
 rich are not mixed but are separate and great bottom that separate 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.770
 artificially populations and when you focus through processes 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.820
 linked either urban or to the human school of students in difficulty and 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.649
 rather two layers 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.369
 socio-economic goes 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.030
 well burgundy you produce a year each school much more 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.790
 massive 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.640
 that if the populations were 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.830
 roughly equitably distributed in the space will reinforce 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.440
 inequalities if when we focus good and bad students in 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.710
 institutions different groups when we have social gaps of 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.460
 success that are maximo between wholesale schools that 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.870
 the eyes of troubled institutions will dive even more 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.620
 quickly what there is at once a city saouassiah fear even though 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.750
 technical a little passive veil the face but also excited school in the sense of 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.760
 performance 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.209
 school and being in France because of 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.530
 of policy development for example as the removal of the card 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.930
 schooling and the fact that some parents who have the means to implement 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.149
 strategies 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.179
 for all that, what makes their children in their establishments we have a 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:28.119
 destabilization of the school fabric with very strong polarizations 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.789
 the establishment is optimistic and then of establishment will say rather for the 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.560
 low-end to say the most beautiful as some 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.860
 and that these differences between institutions eventually pulls 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.150
 the whole education system down I find that we were doing black 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.319
 and that was published in September 2010 was confirmed percent in 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.060
 october by pisa publications which showed that if france bought in 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.950
 classifications the school sealier to the growing inequalities and 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.099
 in particular inequalities between students and between
