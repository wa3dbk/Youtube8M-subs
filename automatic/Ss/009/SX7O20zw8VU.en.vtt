00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.180
You want love, you want sex

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.130
You want music to move your waist

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.160
You're tired of overthinking

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.200
You party every weekend

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200
I don't understand actually

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.000
Maybe because I'm silly

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You wanna be a millionaire, but you don't even have a wage

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.100
You don't really care anyway

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.030
Forgetting Daddy and Mommy

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.040
Facing the consequences

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.000
Doing it with or without it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You don't have children anyway

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Living your life the wrong way

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.020
Knowing it's upsetting

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.050
Damn it, tell me what you want

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.040
You want that? What do you want?

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.060
You want that? What do you want?

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.090
You want that? What do you want?

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.100
Tell me, what do you want?

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.100
You want that? What do you want?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.090
You want that? What do you want?

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.120
You want that? What do you want?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.000
I want whatever you want

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.060
I want whatever you want

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.080
I want whatever you want

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.230
I want whatever you want

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.200
I want whatever you want

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
You wanna get drunk all night

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.220
Smoking kills but living too

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190
You send politicians packing

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.000
Telling them

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.020
''I love myself as I am and I'm fine with that"

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.050
Tell me what's the problem, for you I have no hatred

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.000
I just think differently

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.040
Maybe I'm not mature enough

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.040
A fruit can taste good, even if it's not ripe

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.040
Y'all make false statement under oath

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.090
A gloomy and colorless life

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.110
Ready for anything or nothing, getting nothing in the end

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.040
Down, you little dog

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.070
Is that really what you want?

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.020
You want that? What do you want?

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.020
You want that? What do you want?

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.060
You want that? What do you want?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.070
Tell me, what do you want ?

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.000
You want that? What do you want?

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.090
You want that? What do you want?

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.150
You want that? What do you want?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.160
I want whatever you want

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.000
I want whatever you want

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.050
I want whatever you want

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.230
I want whatever you want

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.230
I want whatever you want

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.030
Get high if you want

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.030
So what, you're a priest now?

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.180
Come on, have some fun, you'll feel better

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.070
We'll have a party when you die

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.080
Maybe the cops will be there

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.160
Lots of chicks for your vigil

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.000
Oh yeah...You'll feel as good as new

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.000
Definitely as good as new

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.000
Definitely as good as new

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.200
Definitely as good as new

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.060
Is that what you really want?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.000
You want that? What do you want?

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.210
You want that? What do you want?

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.140
You want that? What do you want?

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.070
Tell me, what do you want?

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.180
You want that? What do you want?

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.200
You want that? What do you want?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.180
You want that? What do you want?

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.240
I want whatever you want

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.070
I want whatever you want

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.080
I want whatever you want

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.100
I want whatever you want

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.240
I want whatever you want

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.000
Driving drunk on the road

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.170
Thinking you're OK, as you're driving slowly...

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.100
No cars ahead, so you fall asleep sweetly...

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.230
Mmh...
