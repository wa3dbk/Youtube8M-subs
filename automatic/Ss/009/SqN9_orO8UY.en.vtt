00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.850
 hello everyone welcome on the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.799
 nonsense to catch her today I 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.260
 offers you a super easy recipe 2 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.150
 stuffed peppers it's gone we start 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.520
 to pass the peppers under the clear and 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.439
 then you will split in two so 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.670
 if possible you keep the rod because 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.840
 that it's prettier after when we 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.430
 present in the plate but good if 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.380
 you do not have it does not matter you 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.820
 sell it in two so you remove them 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.309
 seeds paying attention to the stem 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.629
 from also you keep it you remember 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.489
 well inside you take off the 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.920
 white party all that is a 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.989
 not too thick and then you book 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.790
 now we will take care of the farce 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.370
 which you take a small container you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.330
 went crashing tuna you add salt 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.460
 and pepper 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.690
 then we add chives 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.070
 cool preferably but you can 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.100
 also of course use freeze 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.870
 then we add the rice cream and 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.000
 grated cheese then grated cheese 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.769
 me it was dice of mozzarella 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.479
 but you can add what you 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.489
 really want the cheese you 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.049
 like you mix this well 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.909
 preparation and then you do not have 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.710
 more than to garnish of course so the 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.630
 peppers and you can possibly 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.969
 add if you fancy after again 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.859
 cheese over it like that when we 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.840
 will do au gratin on the end it will still be 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.399
 so pretty when your peppers are 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.049
 well stuffed you put all this in a 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.609
 gratin dish you put a sheet 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.420
 of aluminum to avoid that gratis 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.820
 too fast 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.340
 then you put your dish in the oven at 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.850
 half height at 200 degrees for 30 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.159
 minutes 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.750
 and to check if it's cooked it is enough 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.219
 to plant a knife actually on the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.689
 side of pepper they have to be 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.229
 tender 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.369
