let<00:01:03.990> you<00:01:04.520> mess<00:01:05.520> with<00:01:05.730> this

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.560 

the<00:01:09.290> only<00:01:09.440> thing<00:01:09.680> I'm<00:01:10.580> going<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:10.880> change<00:01:11.180> is

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
the only thing I'm going to change is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.750 
the only thing I'm going to change is
the<00:01:11.840> width<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.470> height<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.310> calendar

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
the width and the height of the calendar

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.660 
the width and the height of the calendar
just<00:01:13.790> because<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.680> demo<00:01:16.010> site<00:01:16.430> that<00:01:16.640> I

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
just because on the demo site that I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.330 
just because on the demo site that I
have<00:01:16.970> up<00:01:17.420> in<00:01:17.900> web<00:01:18.200> easy<00:01:18.590> it's<00:01:18.800> kind<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:19.220> small

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
have up in web easy it's kind of small

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.400 
have up in web easy it's kind of small
so<00:01:19.760> this<00:01:20.180> isn't<00:01:20.480> really<00:01:20.510> going<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.900> fit<00:01:21.200> too

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
so this isn't really going to fit too

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.980 
so this isn't really going to fit too
well<00:01:21.440> so<00:01:22.100> I'm<00:01:22.160> just<00:01:22.310> going<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.520> make<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.990> some

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
well so I'm just going to make it some

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:41.350 
well so I'm just going to make it some
smaller<00:01:24.590> half<00:01:25.190> size

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.130 

then<00:01:41.450> click<00:01:41.900> update<00:01:42.200> HTML

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
and you'll copy this code just like you

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.190 
and you'll copy this code just like you

the calendar with other objects on our

website what I typically do is I'll put
this<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:58.250> object<00:02:59.250> mode<00:02:59.310> select<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.420> you'll

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
this in object mode select it and you'll

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.500 
this in object mode select it and you'll
see<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.990> handles<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> outside<00:03:02.330> go<00:03:03.330> over

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
see the handles on the outside go over

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.530 
see the handles on the outside go over
to<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.870> inspector<00:03:04.230> tool<00:03:05.030> click<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.300> style

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
to the inspector tool click on the style

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.160 
to the inspector tool click on the style
tab<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.880> then<00:03:09.050> double<00:03:10.050> click<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.440> dimensions

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.770 

then<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:15.220> would<00:03:15.340> type<00:03:15.520> in<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.209> dimensions

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
then you would type in the dimensions

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.220 
then you would type in the dimensions
that<00:03:16.990> you<00:03:17.110> had<00:03:17.290> set<00:03:17.620> up<00:03:17.740> on<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:19.599> previous<00:03:19.989> page

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
that you had set up on the previous page

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.500 
that you had set up on the previous page
in<00:03:20.590> Google<00:03:21.040> so

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
in Google so

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.920 
in Google so
we<00:03:23.049> had<00:03:23.260> 400<00:03:24.010> pixels<00:03:24.430> wide<00:03:24.670> by<00:03:25.030> 200<00:03:25.540> pixels

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
we had 400 pixels wide by 200 pixels

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.370 
we had 400 pixels wide by 200 pixels
high

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.530 

so<00:03:29.010> just<00:03:29.250> type<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.460> in<00:03:29.640> there

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.140 

when<00:03:34.140> doing<00:03:34.439> this<00:03:34.560> make<00:03:34.829> sure<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.819> keep

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
when doing this make sure that the keep

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.330 
when doing this make sure that the keep
aspect<00:03:36.629> ratio<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.379> unchecked<00:03:37.980> because

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
aspect ratio is unchecked because

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.380 
aspect ratio is unchecked because
otherwise<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:40.200> won't<00:03:40.500> let<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.769> type<00:03:41.129> in<00:03:41.390> to

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
otherwise it won't let you type in to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.089 
otherwise it won't let you type in to
individual<00:03:42.989> custom<00:03:43.379> numbers<00:03:43.680> once<00:03:43.980> you

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
individual custom numbers once you

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.440 
individual custom numbers once you
change<00:03:44.310> one<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.730> will<00:03:44.879> automatically

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
change one that will automatically

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.199 
change one that will automatically
change<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.989> other<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.640> doesn't<00:03:47.909> distort

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
change the other so it doesn't distort

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.899 
change the other so it doesn't distort
the<00:03:48.420> image<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.829> this<00:03:50.040> case<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.310> already

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
the image and in this case we already

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.690 
the image and in this case we already
know<00:03:51.569> exactly<00:03:52.319> what<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.560> size<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.250> make

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
know exactly what the size is so make

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.110 
know exactly what the size is so make
sure<00:03:53.730> that's<00:03:54.030> unchecked<00:03:54.480> type<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:55.590> and

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
sure that's unchecked type it in and

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.990 
sure that's unchecked type it in and
click<00:03:57.120> OK

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.890 

and<00:04:04.120> I'll<00:04:04.810> go<00:04:04.960> to<00:04:05.110> preview<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.630> see<00:04:07.810> what

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
and I'll go to preview just to see what

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.090 
and I'll go to preview just to see what
it<00:04:07.960> looks<00:04:08.140> like

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.470 

and<00:04:14.220> there's<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.880> calendar<00:04:15.240> right<00:04:15.390> there

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.750 

so<00:04:20.050> you<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.710> know<00:04:20.800> move<00:04:21.130> this<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.550> ever

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
so you can you know move this to ever

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.500 
so you can you know move this to ever
you<00:04:22.000> would<00:04:22.120> like<00:04:22.300> line<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.690> up<00:04:22.900> with<00:04:24.510> whatever

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
you would like line it up with whatever

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.150 
you would like line it up with whatever
objects<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.140> want<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.350> line<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.500> up<00:04:26.650> with<00:04:26.710> and

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
objects you want to line it up with and

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.590 
objects you want to line it up with and
that's<00:04:27.370> pretty<00:04:27.700> much<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.940> then<00:04:28.360> you're<00:04:28.510> all

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
that's pretty much it then you're all

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.630 
that's pretty much it then you're all
set
