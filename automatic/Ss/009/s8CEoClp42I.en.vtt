and<00:00:10.680> I'm<00:00:11.370> here<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.670> tell<00:00:11.850> you<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.970> little<00:00:12.090> bit

how<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:16.379> slip<00:00:16.890> board<00:00:17.130> works<00:00:17.429> essentially<00:00:18.029> what

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
how a slip board works essentially what

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.060 
how a slip board works essentially what
I've<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.599> here<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.929> our<00:00:19.199> storm<00:00:19.529> split<00:00:19.859> board

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
I've got here is our storm split board

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.579 
I've got here is our storm split board
and<00:00:20.550> we've<00:00:20.880> got<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> pair<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.509> spark<00:00:21.960> R&amp;D

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
and we've got a pair of spark R&amp;D

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.739 
and we've got a pair of spark R&amp;D
binders<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:23.849> this<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.239> split<00:00:24.599> board

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:24.749 
binders on here this is a split board

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:28.399 
binders on here this is a split board
specific<00:00:25.349> binding<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.749> fairly<00:00:28.109> easy

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:28.409 
specific binding and so it's fairly easy

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.589 
specific binding and so it's fairly easy
to<00:00:28.829> get<00:00:29.189> these<00:00:29.399> on<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.819> off<00:00:29.909> there's<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.329> pin

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to get these on and off there's a pin

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.790 
to get these on and off there's a pin
that<00:00:30.749> slides<00:00:31.079> out<00:00:31.319> and<00:00:31.940> then<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.800> slide

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that slides out and then you just slide

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.740 
that slides out and then you just slide
the<00:00:34.980> binding<00:00:35.609> right<00:00:35.789> off<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.449> can<00:00:36.690> see

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the binding right off and as you can see

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.590 
the binding right off and as you can see
there's<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.289> puck<00:00:37.620> system<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.789> and<00:00:38.969> in

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there's a puck system right here and in

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.540 
there's a puck system right here and in
the<00:00:39.690> bottom<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.590> binding<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> slider

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the bottom of the binding is a slider

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.779 
the bottom of the binding is a slider
track<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.239> allows<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.789> so

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
track that allows it to go on and off so

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
track that allows it to go on and off so
that<00:00:45.179> comes<00:00:45.539> off<00:00:45.750> pretty<00:00:45.780> simply<00:00:46.530> pretty

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that comes off pretty simply pretty

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.439 
that comes off pretty simply pretty
easily<00:00:47.010> we'll<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.609> that<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.300> back

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
easily we'll do that here on the back

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.050 
easily we'll do that here on the back
foot<00:00:48.809> now

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.040 

pin<00:00:52.870> coming<00:00:53.290> out

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
pin coming out

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.150 
pin coming out
binding<00:00:56.010> slides<00:00:56.400> right<00:00:56.730> off<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> now<00:00:58.920> you've

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
binding slides right off so now you've

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
binding slides right off so now you've
got<00:00:59.430> just<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> board<00:01:00.570> itself<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
got just the board itself here that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.690 
got just the board itself here that
you're<00:01:01.560> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.740> want<00:01:01.950> to<00:01:02.040> get<00:01:02.130> into<00:01:02.310> ski

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
you're going to want to get into ski

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.240 
you're going to want to get into ski
mode<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.210> we're<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> flip<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.589> clip<00:01:04.920> on

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
mode so we're going to flip this clip on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.470 
mode so we're going to flip this clip on
the<00:01:05.430> tip<00:01:06.170> same<00:01:07.170> thing<00:01:07.410> down<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.620> on<00:01:07.980> the<00:01:08.070> tail

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.320 

and<00:01:10.930> then<00:01:11.230> we're<00:01:12.220> just<00:01:12.430> going<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.790> slide<00:01:13.090> these

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
and then we're just going to slide these

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.710 
and then we're just going to slide these
two<00:01:13.630> halves<00:01:13.840> apart<00:01:14.290> now<00:01:14.620> you're<00:01:14.860> in<00:01:14.980> ski<00:01:15.250> mode

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
two halves apart now you're in ski mode

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.710 
two halves apart now you're in ski mode
so<00:01:16.720> you're<00:01:16.840> going<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.020> swap<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.380> like<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
so you're going to swap it like this so

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.330 
so you're going to swap it like this so
that<00:01:19.870> you<00:01:20.020> have<00:01:20.170> your<00:01:20.320> side<00:01:20.620> cut<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.130> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
that you have your side cut on the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.420 
that you have your side cut on the
inside<00:01:21.790> edge<00:01:22.030> for<00:01:22.360> better<00:01:22.510> control<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.430> then

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
inside edge for better control and then

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.090 
inside edge for better control and then
you'll<00:01:24.610> take<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.910> binding<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.950> going

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
you'll take the binding and it's going

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.000 
you'll take the binding and it's going
to<00:01:27.160> attach<00:01:27.550> right<00:01:27.940> here<00:01:28.000> using<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.840> same<00:01:29.440> pin

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
to attach right here using that same pin

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.090 
to attach right here using that same pin
on<00:01:30.730> this<00:01:31.030> pivot<00:01:31.510> point<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:32.260> then<00:01:32.920> you're

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
on this pivot point and then you're

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.920 
on this pivot point and then you're
essentially<00:01:33.640> going<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.970> be<00:01:34.060> able<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.390> use<00:01:34.630> it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
essentially going to be able to use it

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.359 
essentially going to be able to use it
like<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.560> Tele<00:01:35.920> binding<00:01:36.490> while<00:01:36.700> you're<00:01:36.910> skiing

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.760 

so<00:01:39.939> that's<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.479> basics<00:01:40.960> of<00:01:41.079> how<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.469> works

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
so that's the basics of how that works

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.810 
so that's the basics of how that works
it's<00:01:42.429> really<00:01:42.820> a<00:01:42.850> very<00:01:42.909> efficient<00:01:43.689> way<00:01:43.899> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
it's really a very efficient way to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.789 
it's really a very efficient way to
switch<00:01:45.820> between<00:01:46.090> modes<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:47.469> way<00:01:47.770> more

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
switch between modes and it's way more

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.770 
switch between modes and it's way more
