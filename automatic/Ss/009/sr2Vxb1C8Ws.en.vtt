brackets god mode so let's hope God and
there<00:02:29.109> we<00:02:29.170> go<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.530> whilst<00:02:29.920> playing<00:02:30.159> zombie<00:02:30.549> is

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
there we go so whilst playing zombie is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.699 
there we go so whilst playing zombie is
different<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.870> single<00:02:32.170> player<00:02:32.319> only<00:02:32.349> as

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
different it's a single player only as

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.500 
different it's a single player only as
far<00:02:32.859> as<00:02:33.010> i<00:02:33.069> know<00:02:33.220> i<00:02:33.459> haven't<00:02:34.060> tested<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.390> my

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
far as i know i haven't tested it my

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.259 
far as i know i haven't tested it my
player<00:02:35.159> yeah<00:02:36.159> if<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.519> press<00:02:36.700> 0<00:02:36.939> during<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
player yeah if you press 0 during the

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.089 
player yeah if you press 0 during the
game<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.599> me<00:02:37.780> as<00:02:37.840> your<00:02:38.019> enable<00:02:38.620> god<00:02:38.859> mode

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
game is on me as your enable god mode

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.640 
game is on me as your enable god mode
and<00:02:39.340> i<00:02:40.209> think<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.049> easier<00:02:41.260> if<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.379> just<00:02:41.409> get

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
and i think it's easier if I just get

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.379 
and i think it's easier if I just get
all<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.829> heck's<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.280> i<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.549> here<00:02:48.389> it's

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
all the heck's that i have here it's

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.930 
all the heck's that i have here it's
easier<00:02:49.569> although<00:02:50.349> i'll<00:02:50.950> put<00:02:51.190> all<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.519> hacks

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
easier although i'll put all the hacks

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.750 
easier although i'll put all the hacks
in<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.450> I've<00:02:52.510> got<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.680> description<00:02:54.189> see
