00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello all welcome this Wednesday 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.700
 for today I bring you a video with 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.500
 personal marketing teaching them how 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 They can make your eyes look more 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.550
 large and especially correcting some 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.559
 problems that we have in our eyes like 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.269
 it is the drooping eyelids or 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.460
 Thick eyelids that make the logo appear 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.710
 smaller with smaller eyes 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.689
 this video has been very requested by 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.430
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.160
 I send you a kiss a hug 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 remember to subscribe and send me all 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.470
 the photos of the makeup that you 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.470
 they are doing 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.670
 to make the eyes look more 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.580
 we need to have as a base the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.890
 concept of contour and lighting or 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.570
 of light and dark everything 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.460
 be clear, it will make it look more 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.710
 big and everything we put dark in 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.510
 the face is going to be reduced with this 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.340
 as a basis we will understand that everything 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.020
 that we put also in the clear eyes 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.970
 it's going to be out and everything 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.860
 let's say dark it's going to be that it looks more 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.590
 small for people then that 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.480
 they have smaller eyes a very mistake 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.820
 common that I see they do is that they put a 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.740
 light color on the entire part of the eyelid 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.900
 that is below the eyebrow doing 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.550
 that this eyelid looks much bigger 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.410
 and of course if the eyelid looks 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.890
 big because we put a light color 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.530
 white or a little satin or glossy 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.259
 the eyelid will look bigger and the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.640
 eyes are going to look smaller 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.160
 significantly smaller the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.770
 first type then it is to stop using 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.140
 those colors so clear in the part of the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.780
 Movable eyelid so have an eyelid 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.600
 small and we're going to use a contour color 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.400
 what can be this day 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.080
 and we are going to put it above the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.210
 basin this have seen it in almost all 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.009
 my videos but it's a technique for 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.690
 then leave what I 'm going to do is that I 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.369
 I'm going to make up one side of the face and the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.020
 another side not for you to see the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.420
 difference of how an eye is going to put 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.729
 bigger and more striking compared to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.729
 the other well above the basin 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.350
 it is as you can see neither basin is here 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.200
 however I am using a brush that 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.149
 allow me to cover more space towards 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.009
 Above the step eyebrow is fundamental 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.319
 then for the eyes that are of 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.209
 eyelid drooping thick eyelid and that 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.920
 see smaller eyes when putting a 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.230
 color darker than our tone 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.180
 skin on this top part to make 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.580
 that the eye, as is clear, stands out more 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.620
 you have seen in my videos that almost 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.120
 I always line up or go around the corner 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
 external of the eye and that has two 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.590
 purposes one give you depth but 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.660
 especially look up and do 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.690
 that then look bigger before with the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.569
 darker color and with a brush in 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.569
 pencil shape I will do that time 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.650
 and all these steps that we are doing 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.660
 we should do them with a matte color 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.580
 because remember that this is 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.800
 helping is to control the size of the 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.599
 births and if we use refined colors or 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.870
 with brightness goes to snakes the eyelid 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.580
 it looks much bigger is optional but 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.629
 it always helps a lot to also put a 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.629
 little black 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.970
 as you can see we are already beginning to see 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.830
 more raised than this today not only 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.320
 makeup but starts to have 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.410
 some lifting effect and then it 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.750
 see much bigger we are not going to take the 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.270
 dark color right up to the eyebrows but 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.100
 that we should leave at least two 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.960
 or three millimeters of space between 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.480
 contour color and eyebrow then there 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.340
 I'm going to put a little bit of light color 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.010
 well under the eyebrows I'm going to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.560
 put a little bit of white 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.329
 when we have the drooping eyelid 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.519
 mobile eyelid does not look much then 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.560
 we need to bring colors that make 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.239
 that eyelid is seen therefore we must 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.239
 use lighter shades 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.920
 if we make a cat outline for 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.120
 enhance the look and it's going to make you 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.120
 see more lift flight 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.980
 Another tip that I have is to delineate the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.440
 part of the water line of the eyes 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.840
 with a light tone it can be a color 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.180
 silver can be a white color can 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.400
 be a skin color but when we put 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.740
 there a lighter tone is going to be that then 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.100
 Look bigger I'm going to use a tone 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.100
 silver 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.120
 as I have told you in many of my 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.400
 videos you are going to make the decision 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.410
 to delineate it is preferable to do so 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.300
 first up before down 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.800
 delineate only the bottom part 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.680
 of the eyes is going to be that then you see 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.389
 more fallen and smaller also if you 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.300
 delineate inside it's going to be that then 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.800
 it looks even smaller then what 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.750
 I'm going to do it outside the eye and 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.210
 only one quarter of the eye for not 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.430
 close it to not close it but before 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.770
 open it more 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.420
 to finish it is very important to put 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.080
 blink because this is going to make 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:11.000
 then look more open 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.000
 always use mascara gr 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.880
 how can you see the logo that is 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.040
 makeup has an effect of 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.410
 rising and apart from that it looks more 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.940
 big because we put the outline and 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.620
 all the tricks that I have given them in 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.690
 this video I'm going to finish putting on makeup 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.520
 the other because that way I can not go out to the 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.320
 street and we see these tips 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.030
 then we finished this tutorial 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.950
 any been much requested by 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.260
 you so that the look you see them 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.450
 larger more pronounced swamps 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.830
 They go back and rise 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.930
 these are then the tips for 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.420
 drooping eyelids for little ones 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.370
 send pictures of makeups that 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.260
 you are recreating by instagram or 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.180
 by facebook that I always 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.900
 Stoicism is I send them a kiss and 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.900
 a hug chao
