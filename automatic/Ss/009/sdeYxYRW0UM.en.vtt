definitely<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:46.060> way<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.209> play<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.660> game<00:03:46.870> for

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
definitely the way to play the game for

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.220 
definitely the way to play the game for
me<00:03:47.550> lately<00:03:48.550> I've<00:03:48.850> become<00:03:49.209> more<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.600> more<00:03:49.690> fan

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
me lately I've become more and more fan

me lately I've become more and more fan
of<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.950> 345<00:03:51.940> kill<00:03:52.270> streak<00:03:52.540> it's<00:03:53.110> so

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
of the 345 kill streak it's so

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.130 
of the 345 kill streak it's so
repeatable<00:03:54.069> it's<00:03:54.819> so<00:03:55.090> fast<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:55.630> get<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.959> and

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
repeatable it's so fast you get it and

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.500 
repeatable it's so fast you get it and
then<00:03:56.290> right<00:03:56.500> away<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.739> have<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.069> advantage

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
then right away you have the advantage

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.449 
then right away you have the advantage

net<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.310> get<00:04:06.459> killstreaks<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.540> don't

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
net you get killstreaks and you don't

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.120

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
number you just get them and I think

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.920 
number you just get them and I think
it's<00:04:11.950> very<00:04:12.010> arguable<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.239> IMS<00:04:13.690> is

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
it's very arguable that the IMS is

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.379 
it's very arguable that the IMS is
possibly<00:04:14.680> better<00:04:15.519> than<00:04:15.850> some<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.209> top

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
possibly better than some of the top

possibly better than some of the top

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049

I<00:04:20.320> know<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.250> when<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.820> get<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:22.000> c-130<00:04:22.660> sometimes
