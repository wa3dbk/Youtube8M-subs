00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.980
 video of me today I want you 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 Actually only very briefly show how 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.400
 I decorated my Christmas tree 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.980
 and again very soon 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.690
 pictured so i see left behind 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.090
 bit with music and i hope so 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.710
 that one piece now because it is yes 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.970
 not for long and you should 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.050
 probably even at the beginning 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.939
 to decorate christmas tree 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.350
 at home, by the way, always 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.210
 tradition that you only on the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.070
 holy evening has done or then 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.529
 at noon sometime during the day started 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.940
 but has me my little apartment 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.410
 because I thought it would be quite 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.730
 Nice that already a few days full 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.680
 to do that with me too 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.390
 have a little something because I like the day 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.860
 Christmas Eve itself, not at my 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.500
 be home but of course with mine 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.969
 parents and my family 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.410
 that's why it did a little earlier and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 I thought I'll show you this now 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.260
 You are very welcome to write to me 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.610
 what your tree theme this time is saying 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.870
 I just now you have yes 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 I saw myself red and silver 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.489
 chosen and I would 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.410
 What is the place theme so interesting 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.280
 some fact more like wooden jewelery Sun 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.439
 a bit more classic and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.740
 Of course, something traditional is often something traditional 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.049
 gold and green or even mixed 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.270
 So let me be happy today 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.369
 know what your christmas tree is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.259
 theme motto however it is and yes 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.479

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.710

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
