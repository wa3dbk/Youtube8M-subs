00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.539
 the list 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.079
 the animal pibito 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.669
 that is not interrupted in the place of the world is not only suitable for all is 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:16.909
 an animal 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.249
 this scenario efe 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.919
 true pelagic zone 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.150
 i 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.919
 behind always the saleswoman 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.869
 china still great movies claim 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.710
 a striped dolphin 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.480
 animal coast stranded in lima 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.790
 because as I make feces animals very nervous that well offshore and when 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.570
 they are sick after days the currents bring us to the beaches and in 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.000
 a comatose state 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.860
 and because they have never been in contact with man with an environment 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.130
 still lives as is the pocero 11 ko the stress of stranding tons 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.240
 the little one can not be that turning point 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.790
 from that window of light that according to the oic try 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 it's complicated it's a challenge but you have to try 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.390
 e has been very close to the beach madaro 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.980
 and we know that of these dolphins 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.650
 in sea of ​​spawning 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.780
 large funds divided into groups 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.550
 after an animal model only and close to the beach min is bad 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.000
 bad forecast true some problem we have 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.680
 in bull we did was 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.719
 to have a rescue team 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.590
 and it could be that in 25 minutes the animal went from being in motion 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.760
 recovery pool 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.560
 he was turning over on himself he did not coordinate his movements 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.920
 the animals were so weakened 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.580
 that when being in the pool with some frequency have fainting 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.570
 and animal is swimming and suddenly every axis that has fainted becomes vertical 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.900
 in the background and sometimes I am that peace to water to be able 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.479
 Refloat up the animal 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.229
 he recovers from fainting and yes again he whispers he recovers city 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.620
 the great luck we had since it affected us right away 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.370
 in food and that really opened an important window of hope for us because 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.080
 Normally these norms as they have a very serious state do not accept food and 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.220
 either any medication supply must be via injection 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.469
 serum days 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.469
 that that represents manipulation and more stressed 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.469
 and the third day of what happened was that he vomited moment a quantity of 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.629
 plastics 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.629
 of course that we set out to converse declared then 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.939
 is that it was an animal that had received a gastric inflammation 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:41.839
 serious 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.639
 according to aperribay intoxication that had weakened him by 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.090
 that had led him to lose his group 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.670
 and get weakened acosta when vomiting and with the coadjuvant treatment we live 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.489
 the animal was improving day by day 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.540
 already the food we already opposed in the mouth if you do not want we had talked 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.789
 of the pool and the vase looking for it to exhibit it 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.639
 evidently the first sign d dt 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.180
 behind the recovery is a fact but had fertilized a chin takes 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.179
 there was a behavior that had us very worried 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.819
 is because it was that the animal was always swimming in circles 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.279
 against schedules 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.510
 December in the same direction in the opposite direction 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.579
 and always in circles 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.239
 We wanted to rule out any injury that had a letter that the animal did not 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.119
 could anything rector of the ur fissure any accusation the service in a 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:35.880
 series of radiographic plates 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.430
 and then he dedicated himself to curry mossad doing an acoustic study to see if the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.860
 animal could have some problem of sound emission or reception of 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.789
 sound 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.519
 percent I already made consultations to different colleagues give each other 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 countries to see if they had any casuistry or could know 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.519
 which would be the cause 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.519
 and the truth is that we do not get anything clear 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:59.699
 then we decided to know 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.919
 the step to take it from the recovery pool 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.029
 to a fence that we should be more 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:09.639
 much more extensive and the surprise was capitalized because it goes more to leave it in the 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.489
 animal fencing made a great circle the game of will become with a 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.309
 true cinde deficit 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.359
 He burned them for a long time 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.879
 the underwater swimming from 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:24.399
 and I think it was an animal that I loved in your little kerala 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:26.860
 the courage of youth 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.400
 they lived the same juvenile with 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.110
 it was with much self-confidence and with much 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.189
 I really want to live with a lot of AIDS and also helped him 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:37.830
 exceed 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.259
 One of the most important problems is the interaction with this 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.789
 wild shape and man 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.580
 they are not used 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.580
 to a contact evidently beginning of the future impact 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.159
 the excessive hotel sasso has died 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.470
 we asked how we excited him we knew 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.740
 of those animals that live in a group 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.620
 that can not be left in 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.529
 lonely anywhere 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.279
 and for this purpose it asks for allaida morla from fishermen of the 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.219
 Catalonia 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:09.309
 so that on a specific day l 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.009
 as the boats returned in the morning to port 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.289
 we were radiating the positioning of a bank of a bank dolphins 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.729
 listings or we were not told that there was a power more than one 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.639
 hundred of state neighbors 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.770
 relatively close 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.759
 and that's where the animal was left a famous map of sofora with 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.080
 his colleagues 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.500
 and I hope that the ulysses prize will explain to them how good not all 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.719
 let's go two legs 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.469
 you everything is so bad 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.469
 and is that by making relatives of the fallen 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.120
 the possibility of being able to recover and Teresa that look 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:49.360
 this intelligence brigade 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.100
 ii try to understand 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.830
 that samira the strand grateful for how he returns home that's this 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.290
 experience keep in mind that is the one that is all of us 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.969
 the professionals to the volunteers 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.189
 in the channel to follow
