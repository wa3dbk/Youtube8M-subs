because<00:00:00.210> it's<00:00:00.390> quick<00:00:00.690> and<00:00:00.900> it<00:00:01.410> looks<00:00:01.650> good<00:00:01.920> I

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.200 
because it's quick and it looks good I

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.519 
because it's quick and it looks good I
start<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.350> stick<00:00:04.620> twirl<00:00:05.690> between<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.170> middle

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
start the stick twirl between the middle

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.549 
start the stick twirl between the middle
and<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.189> index<00:00:08.550> finger<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:10.260> get<00:00:10.410> this

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
and the index finger and I get this

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.850 
and the index finger and I get this
rotating<00:00:11.340> motion<00:00:11.790> happening<00:00:12.500> when<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> first

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
rotating motion happening when I first

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.980 
rotating motion happening when I first
started<00:00:14.219> out<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.670> kind<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.179> had<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.360> use<00:00:15.509> my<00:00:15.690> left

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
started out I kind of had to use my left

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.040 
started out I kind of had to use my left
hand<00:00:16.520> so<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.699> could<00:00:18.000> know<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.869> that

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
hand so that I could know what that

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.380 
hand so that I could know what that
feels<00:00:19.410> like<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> stick<00:00:20.520> swing<00:00:20.910> in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
feels like to have the stick swing in

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.599 
feels like to have the stick swing in
between<00:00:22.050> my<00:00:22.199> fingers<00:00:23.359> then<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.449> got<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.900> going

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
between my fingers then I got that going

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
between my fingers then I got that going
after<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.939> while<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.150> noticed<00:00:27.470> that<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.680> more

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
after a while I noticed that it was more

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.700 
after a while I noticed that it was more
practical<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:30.390> twirl<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> stick<00:00:31.080> backwards

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
practical to twirl the stick backwards

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.740 
practical to twirl the stick backwards
the<00:00:32.489> reason<00:00:32.910> being<00:00:33.290> when<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.410> hit<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> stroke

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
the reason being when you hit a stroke

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
the reason being when you hit a stroke
you<00:00:36.750> want<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.350> rebound<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you want to get that rebound and that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.389 
you want to get that rebound and that
rebound<00:00:39.840> will<00:00:40.469> help<00:00:41.210> propel<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.480> twirl<00:00:43.399> when

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
rebound will help propel the twirl when

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.000 
rebound will help propel the twirl when
it<00:00:44.550> comes<00:00:44.760> back<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:46.280> can<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.399> multiple<00:00:47.610> twirls

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
it comes back you can do multiple twirls

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.180 
it comes back you can do multiple twirls
or<00:00:50.010> quick<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:51.030> twirl<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> stick

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
or quick one twirl and that's the stick

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.139 
or quick one twirl and that's the stick
twirl<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.820> upstroke<00:01:00.420> cymbal<00:01:00.960> twirl<00:01:02.149> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
twirl the upstroke cymbal twirl this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.570 
twirl the upstroke cymbal twirl this
visual<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.930> pretty<00:01:04.320> much<00:01:04.470> an<00:01:04.650> extension<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
visual is pretty much an extension of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
visual is pretty much an extension of
the<00:01:05.820> stick<00:01:06.119> twirl<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:07.580> take<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> stick<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the stick twirl I take the stick in the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.980 
the stick twirl I take the stick in the
grip<00:01:10.310> whereas<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> stick

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
grip whereas if I'm going to do a stick

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.740 
grip whereas if I'm going to do a stick
twirl<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.880> I<00:01:14.880> hit<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> cymbal<00:01:15.450> from

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
twirl and I hit the cymbal from

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.830 
twirl and I hit the cymbal from
underneath<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.650> follow<00:01:17.610> through<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
underneath and follow through with the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.880 
underneath and follow through with the
stick<00:01:19.140> twirl<00:01:23.630> alright<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.290> difficult

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
stick twirl alright so one difficult

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.240 
stick twirl alright so one difficult
thing<00:01:29.220> about<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.240> maneuver<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.860> requires

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
thing about this maneuver is it requires

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
thing about this maneuver is it requires
a<00:01:32.549> lot<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> forearm<00:01:33.390> muscles<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.290> got<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
a lot of forearm muscles so you got to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
a lot of forearm muscles so you got to
really<00:01:34.740> work<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.340> forearms<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
really work up your forearms to get that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.069 
really work up your forearms to get that
going

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
going

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.380 
going
especially<00:01:37.799> at<00:01:37.890> loud<00:01:38.100> volumes<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:42.150> last

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
especially at loud volumes the last

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.649 
especially at loud volumes the last
visual<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> demonstrate<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.450> back

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
visual I want to demonstrate is the back

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.859 
visual I want to demonstrate is the back
toss<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.430> motion<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.909> makes<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.329> back<00:01:48.540> toss

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
toss the motion that makes the back toss

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.149 
toss the motion that makes the back toss
possible<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.250> rapid<00:01:50.880> pool<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> arm

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
possible is a rapid pool of the arm

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.780 
possible is a rapid pool of the arm
backward<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.689> pretty<00:01:54.689> much<00:01:54.950> let<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> stick<00:01:56.399> fly

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
backward I pretty much let the stick fly

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.649 
backward I pretty much let the stick fly
and<00:01:57.360> catch<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.430> when<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> comes<00:01:59.759> back

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
and catch it when it comes back

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.740 
and catch it when it comes back
the<00:02:02.080> good<00:02:02.260> thing<00:02:02.470> about<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.830> back<00:02:03.040> toss<00:02:03.369> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the good thing about the back toss is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.960 
the good thing about the back toss is
I'm<00:02:04.750> with<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.409> grip<00:02:05.650> here<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.700> I'm<00:02:06.790> pretty

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
I'm with the grip here and I'm pretty

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.940 
I'm with the grip here and I'm pretty
much<00:02:07.180> back<00:02:07.869> holding<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.800> stick<00:02:13.680> that's<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
much back holding the stick that's the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.080 
much back holding the stick that's the
back<00:02:15.130> toss<00:02:15.459> now<00:02:15.989> I'm<00:02:16.989> going<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> solo

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
back toss now I'm going to do a solo

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.960 
back toss now I'm going to do a solo
