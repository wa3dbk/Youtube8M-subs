00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
here and if you were wondering how it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.760 
here and if you were wondering how it
noticed<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:54.079> how<00:01:55.079> how<00:01:55.829> these<00:01:56.240> how<00:01:57.320> they<00:01:58.320> make

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
noticed some how how these how they make

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.730 
noticed some how how these how they make
the<00:01:59.009> sounds<00:01:59.460> how<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.350> which<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the sounds how they know which is

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.240 
the sounds how they know which is
recycling<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.689> how<00:02:04.250> these

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
recycling all that you see how these

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.529 
recycling all that you see how these
things<00:02:05.810> here<00:02:06.810> are<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.350> different<00:02:07.740> spots

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
things here are in different spots

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.570 
things here are in different spots
they've<00:02:09.539> got<00:02:09.810> these<00:02:10.140> things<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.800> push<00:02:11.250> on

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
they've got these things that push on

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.010 
they've got these things that push on
the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.810 
the
buttons<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:14.360> when<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.810> put<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.200> beans<00:02:15.440> on<00:02:15.820> you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
buttons so when you put the beans on you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.570 
buttons so when you put the beans on you
can<00:02:17.000> they<00:02:17.300> push<00:02:17.630> these<00:02:17.930> buttons<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.800> then

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
can they push these buttons and then

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.520 
can they push these buttons and then
they<00:02:20.000> can<00:02:20.210> press<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.320> would

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
they can press on that and that would

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.310 
they can press on that and that would
probably<00:02:22.070> be<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.300> recycling<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.140> would

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
probably be the recycling and that would

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.130 
probably be the recycling and that would
be<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.500> obvious<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:25.220> look<00:02:25.670> if<00:02:26.540> we<00:02:26.780> put<00:02:26.990> that

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
be the obvious but look if we put that

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.790 
be the obvious but look if we put that
there

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
there

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.920 
there
if<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.670> turn<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.150> around<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.750> would

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
if you turn that around that would

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.250 
if you turn that around that would
probably<00:02:30.440> be<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:31.160> underside<00:02:31.910> if<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.810> put<00:02:33.140> it

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
probably be the underside if you put it

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.870 
probably be the underside if you put it
in<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.740> that<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:39.410> yes<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:40.130> on<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.610> side

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
in like that and yes it's on this side

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.780 
in like that and yes it's on this side
like<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.360> they'll<00:02:42.020> be<00:02:42.560> probably<00:02:43.010> that's

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
like that they'll be probably that's

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.760 
like that they'll be probably that's
answered<00:02:44.680> mine<00:02:45.680> yeah<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:50.080> figured<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.110> out

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
answered mine yeah I figured that out

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.640 
answered mine yeah I figured that out
one<00:02:51.950> day<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:53.600> winner<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.990> very<00:02:54.170> shiny<00:02:54.410> and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
one day and the winner is very shiny and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.910 
one day and the winner is very shiny and
