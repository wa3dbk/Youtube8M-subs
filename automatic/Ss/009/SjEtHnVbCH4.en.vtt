you<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.759> today<00:00:14.759> run<00:00:14.969> slums<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.830> one<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
you and today run slums and one of the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890 
you and today run slums and one of the
big<00:00:17.190> things<00:00:17.490> about<00:00:17.699> slums<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
big things about slums is that it's a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.990 
big things about slums is that it's a
very<00:00:19.170> big<00:00:19.500> they're<00:00:20.039> kind<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.340> hard<00:00:20.580> point<00:00:20.850> map

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
very big they're kind of hard point map

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.400 
very big they're kind of hard point map
you<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> lot<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> people<00:00:21.810> like<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.020> user

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
you know a lot of people like to user

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.950 
you know a lot of people like to user
use<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.070> map<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.550> hard<00:00:23.789> point<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> figured

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
use this map for hard point so I figured

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
use this map for hard point so I figured
that<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.170> may<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.500> well<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:26.250> ahead<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> get

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that we may as well go ahead and get

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.700 
that we may as well go ahead and get
some<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.240> good<00:00:27.449> hard<00:00:27.750> points<00:00:28.199> no<00:00:28.380> spots

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
some really good hard points no spots

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
some really good hard points no spots
for<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.189> let's<00:00:29.580> hope<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.970> find<00:00:30.150> these<00:00:30.390> useful

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
for you let's hope you find these useful

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
for you let's hope you find these useful
and<00:00:30.960> also<00:00:31.109> there<00:00:31.859> are<00:00:31.890> some<00:00:32.009> people<00:00:32.460> were

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
and also there are some people were

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
and also there are some people were
wondering<00:00:33.030> why<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> missed<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.870> Plaza<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
wondering why I missed that Plaza the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.670 
wondering why I missed that Plaza the
the<00:00:35.100> Plaza<00:00:35.340> map<00:00:35.670> from<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.510> series<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.200> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the Plaza map from this series and that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.959 
the Plaza map from this series and that
is<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.920> purely<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> was

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
is just purely because when I was

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
is just purely because when I was
looking<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> map<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.780> looking<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.410> spots

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
looking at the map and looking for spots

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.530 
looking at the map and looking for spots
and<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.610> trying<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> think<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.239> spots

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and you know trying to think what spots

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.900 
and you know trying to think what spots
I<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.260> literally<00:00:43.890> couldn't<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.670> any

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
I use I literally couldn't think of any

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.459 
I use I literally couldn't think of any
you<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.690> big<00:00:45.780> sniper<00:00:46.170> map

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
you know it's not a very big sniper map

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
you know it's not a very big sniper map
or<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.100> good<00:00:47.250> sniper<00:00:47.550> map<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
or it's not a very good sniper map so I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
or it's not a very good sniper map so I
figured<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.200> probably<00:00:49.469> better<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.890> skip<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
figured it's probably better to skip it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.790 
figured it's probably better to skip it
rather<00:00:50.730> than<00:00:51.059> try<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.899> find<00:00:52.110> some<00:00:52.500> useless

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
rather than try and find some useless

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
rather than try and find some useless
sniper<00:00:53.250> spots<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.640> no<00:00:53.820> one's<00:00:53.969> gonna<00:00:54.030> use<00:00:54.360> so

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
sniper spots that no one's gonna use so

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.479 
sniper spots that no one's gonna use so
hope<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> understand<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
hope you understand that but that as the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
hope you understand that but that as the
reason<00:00:56.670> behind<00:00:56.910> us<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:57.899> actually<00:00:58.079> using

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
reason behind us I'm not actually using

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
reason behind us I'm not actually using
that<00:00:59.039> Plaza<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> map<00:01:00.090> anyway<00:01:00.510> let's<00:01:00.870> move<00:01:01.050> on

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that Plaza as a map anyway let's move on

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
that Plaza as a map anyway let's move on

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
is very good for defending the second

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320 
is very good for defending the second

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
objective now it also works very well

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.359 
objective now it also works very well
with<00:01:09.720> assault<00:01:10.140> rifles<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.740> sometimes<00:01:11.189> even

submachine guns if you are one of those

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.289 
submachine guns if you are one of those
players<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.250> very<00:01:14.549> simple<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.060> just

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
players it's very simple you just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
literally stand up on these tables that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.789 
literally stand up on these tables that
Arman<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.509> snipe<00:01:18.810> pretty<00:01:19.590> much

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
Arman and you can snipe pretty much

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
Arman and you can snipe pretty much
towards<00:01:20.189> anyone<00:01:20.400> that's<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> try<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the that's the first sniper spot the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.560 
the that's the first sniper spot the
second<00:01:25.950> sniper<00:01:26.220> spot<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> also<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> very

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
second sniper spot is also in a very

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.390 
second sniper spot is also in a very
similar<00:01:27.900> location<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.710> at<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> back<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
similar location it's at the back of the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310 
similar location it's at the back of the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
of shooting you so it's a really good
defensive<00:01:50.670> sniper<00:01:51.090> spot<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.780> next

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
defensive sniper spot so this next

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.780 
defensive sniper spot so this next
sniper<00:01:52.350> spot<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.860> actually<00:01:53.009> fully<00:01:53.430> furred

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
sniper spot is actually fully furred

sniper spot is actually fully furred
hardpoint<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.630> slums<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.409> very<00:01:55.590> good

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
hardpoint on slums it's a very good

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.950 
hardpoint on slums it's a very good
offensive<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.460> because<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.390> hard<00:01:57.689> point

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
offensive one because this hard point

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200 
offensive one because this hard point
often<00:01:58.380> gets<00:01:58.530> locked<00:01:58.799> down<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.640> quickly<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
often gets locked down so so quickly and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.700 
often gets locked down so so quickly and
it's<00:02:00.360> often<00:02:00.659> quite<00:02:00.810> difficult<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.590> in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it's often quite difficult to get in

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.499 
it's often quite difficult to get in
there<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.850> sniper<00:02:03.090> spot<00:02:03.420> of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
there but with this sniper spot of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.539 
there but with this sniper spot of
course<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.170> take<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> guys<00:02:05.399> at

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
course you can just take out the guys at

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.920 
course you can just take out the guys at
the<00:02:05.579> entrance<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:06.390> teammates<00:02:06.750> can

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the entrance and then your teammates can

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.020 
the entrance and then your teammates can
hope<00:02:07.079> hopefully<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:08.129> run<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.429> there<00:02:08.459> now

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030

hope hopefully just run in there now
this<00:02:09.179> sniper<00:02:09.390> spot<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> middle<00:02:10.739> or

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
this sniper spot is for the middle or

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.050 
this sniper spot is for the middle or
the<00:02:11.099> main<00:02:11.510> hardpoints<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
the main hardpoints I like to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.960 
the main hardpoints I like to
and<00:02:13.390> it's<00:02:14.200> often<00:02:14.500> very<00:02:14.920> difficult<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.700> get<00:02:15.880> in

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and it's often very difficult to get in

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.790 
and it's often very difficult to get in
there<00:02:16.180> because<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.840> never<00:02:17.230> hard<00:02:17.500> put<00:02:17.740> in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
there because this is never hard put in

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.010 
there because this is never hard put in
it<00:02:17.860> gets<00:02:17.980> locked<00:02:18.280> down<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.490> quickly<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.570> very

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
it gets locked down so quickly just very

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020 
it gets locked down so quickly just very
simple<00:02:20.410> jump<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.490> an<00:02:21.580> easy<00:02:21.730> kill

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
simple jump and it's an easy kill

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.880 
simple jump and it's an easy kill
especially<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.690> people<00:02:22.810> who<00:02:23.020> are<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.350> top<00:02:23.590> of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
especially for people who are on top of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.720 
especially for people who are on top of
the<00:02:24.160> hardpoint

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
the hardpoint

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.880 
the hardpoint
so<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.150> next<00:02:25.390> sniper<00:02:25.720> spot<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.230> very<00:02:26.560> very

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
so this next sniper spot is very very

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.980 
so this next sniper spot is very very
simple<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:27.820> that's<00:02:28.000> probably<00:02:28.300> why<00:02:28.960> I

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
simple and I think that's probably why I

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.810 
simple and I think that's probably why I
like<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.440> sniper<00:02:29.740> spot<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.250> much<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.730> know

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
like this sniper spot so much you know

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.580 
like this sniper spot so much you know
literally<00:02:31.240> anyone<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.990> do<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.350> not<00:02:32.530> a

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
literally anyone can do it it's not a

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.190 
literally anyone can do it it's not a
jump<00:02:32.920> shot<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.730> very<00:02:34.240> easy<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.840> you're<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.140> a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
jump shot it's very easy and you're in a

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.780 
jump shot it's very easy and you're in a
very<00:02:35.410> secure<00:02:35.740> location<00:02:36.340> because<00:02:36.550> no<00:02:36.670> one

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
very secure location because no one

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.699 
very secure location because no one
really<00:02:36.820> comes<00:02:37.150> back<00:02:37.240> here<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:38.380> people<00:02:38.530> are

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709

in the carriage for the hardpoint you
know<00:02:40.330> they're<00:02:40.480> often<00:02:40.780> looking<00:02:40.900> out<00:02:41.170> all<00:02:41.320> the
