arcade<00:02:15.840> game<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.500> did<00:02:16.620> not<00:02:16.740> get<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
arcade game that we did not get in the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.340 
arcade game that we did not get in the
original<00:02:17.400> ColecoVision<00:02:18.000> game<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:19.230> it's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
original ColecoVision game so it's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.840 
original ColecoVision game so it's
pretty<00:02:19.530> cool<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.250> should<00:02:20.490> mention<00:02:20.670> is

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
pretty cool and this I should mention is

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.240 
pretty cool and this I should mention is
a<00:02:20.880> prototype<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.840> not<00:02:22.020> yet<00:02:22.320> finished<00:02:22.350> but

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
a prototype it's not yet finished but

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.690 
a prototype it's not yet finished but
this<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.520> how<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.910> right<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:29.490> see<00:02:29.670> that

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
this is how it is right now you see that

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.840 
this is how it is right now you see that
this<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.120> way<00:02:30.540> more<00:02:30.570> accurate<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.460> visual

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
this is way more accurate in a visual

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.080 
this is way more accurate in a visual
sense<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.420> any<00:02:33.540> gameplay<00:02:33.750> sense<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> old

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
sense and any gameplay sense in the old

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.670 
sense and any gameplay sense in the old
I'm<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:36.150> very<00:02:36.360> good<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.260> old<00:02:37.350> Clicquot

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
I'm not very good in the old Clicquot

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.140 
I'm not very good in the old Clicquot

those<00:04:24.979> games<00:04:25.700> use<00:04:26.450> some<00:04:26.720> extra<00:04:26.960> memory<00:04:27.200> so

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
those games use some extra memory so

this<00:05:07.550> is<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.760> game<00:05:08.000> that<00:05:08.240> was<00:05:09.010> initially

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
this is a game that was initially

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.920 
this is a game that was initially
released<00:05:10.220> for<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.490> Japanese<00:05:10.940> cousin<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.840> the

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
released for the Japanese cousin of the

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.170 
released for the Japanese cousin of the
ColecoVision<00:05:12.200> called<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.680> MSX<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:14.060> they're

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
ColecoVision called the MSX and they're

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.300 
ColecoVision called the MSX and they're
really<00:05:14.389> similar<00:05:14.630> in<00:05:14.810> hardware

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
really similar in hardware

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.190 
really similar in hardware
I<00:05:16.370> guess<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.090> MSX<00:05:17.479> just<00:05:17.720> had<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.840> little<00:05:18.050> bit

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
I guess the MSX just had a little bit

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.520 
I guess the MSX just had a little bit
more<00:05:18.520> memory<00:05:19.520> or<00:05:19.750> sound<00:05:20.750> capabilities<00:05:21.350> or

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
more memory or sound capabilities or

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.900 
more memory or sound capabilities or
whatever<00:05:21.770> that's<00:05:22.130> why<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.340> super<00:05:22.760> game

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
whatever that's why the super game

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.500 
whatever that's why the super game
module<00:05:23.330> takes<00:05:24.110> care<00:05:24.410> of<00:05:24.440> that<00:05:24.800> in<00:05:25.190> terms

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
module takes care of that in terms

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.480 
module takes care of that in terms
the<00:05:25.600> extra<00:05:25.870> resources<00:05:26.320> required<00:05:26.740> so<00:05:27.340> let's

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
the extra resources required so let's

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:39.660 
the extra resources required so let's
give<00:05:27.640> this<00:05:27.760> one<00:05:27.820> a<00:05:27.970> shot<00:05:38.220> so<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.340> good<00:05:39.490> news<00:05:39.520> is

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
give this one a shot so the good news is

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.210 
give this one a shot so the good news is
like<00:05:40.000> a<00:05:40.030> kind<00:05:40.960> of<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.080> platformer<00:05:41.710> adventure

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
like a kind of a platformer adventure

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.020 
like a kind of a platformer adventure
game<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:43.780> I<00:05:44.470> think<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.770> was<00:05:44.920> released<00:05:45.730> on<00:05:45.970> the

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
game and I think it was released on the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.840 
game and I think it was released on the
the<00:05:46.870> NES<00:05:47.230> or<00:05:47.560> some<00:05:48.310> version<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.730> was

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
the NES or some version of it was

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.020 
the NES or some version of it was
released<00:05:49.120> on<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.330> NES<00:05:49.450> as<00:05:49.840> well<00:05:50.730> but<00:05:51.730> this<00:05:51.970> is

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
released on the NES as well but this is

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.810 
released on the NES as well but this is
actually<00:05:52.540> a<00:05:52.570> part<00:05:52.870> of<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.200> Japanese<00:05:53.410> MSX<00:05:54.370> game

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
actually a part of the Japanese MSX game

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.170 
actually a part of the Japanese MSX game
if<00:05:55.060> I'm<00:05:55.180> not<00:05:55.330> mistaken<00:05:55.780> and<00:05:56.790> and<00:05:57.790> I'll<00:05:57.970> tell

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
if I'm not mistaken and and I'll tell

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.560 
if I'm not mistaken and and I'll tell
you<00:05:58.270> it's<00:05:58.420> it's<00:05:58.990> pretty<00:05:59.290> good<00:05:59.590> it's<00:06:00.420> you<00:06:01.420> know

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
you it's it's pretty good it's you know

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.910 
you it's it's pretty good it's you know
you<00:06:01.840> can<00:06:02.020> tell<00:06:02.230> it's<00:06:02.530> not<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.740> typical

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
you can tell it's not a typical

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.280 
you can tell it's not a typical
ColecoVision<00:06:03.760> game<00:06:03.940> just<00:06:04.870> because<00:06:05.110> of<00:06:05.200> the

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
ColecoVision game just because of the

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.230 
ColecoVision game just because of the
amount<00:06:05.440> of<00:06:05.590> detail<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:06.040> all<00:06:06.910> the<00:06:07.090> different

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
