00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.420
 Hello everyone 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.540
 I want to share with you today. 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.820
 My daily makeup skills 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.000
 in my opinion 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 Most effective in makeup time every morning 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.420
 So I really like it 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.600
 The entire makeup step takes about 30 minutes 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.820
 let us start 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.500
 After washing your face before applying makeup 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.940
 I use Banilla Co's CC cream to make a base. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.080
 CC cream function similar to BB cream 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.940
 But it is better for the skin 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 And relatively light 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.540
 Next I want to use my favorite sunscreen Shiseido Annessa 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.160
 Sunscreen protects skin from UV rays 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.700
 I used to use Hera's sunscreen before. 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.460
 Hero is also pretty good. 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 But that only SPF35 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.720
 So I switched to Shiseido 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.320
 Next is the foundation 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.320
 I want to choose one from these two. 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.820
 One is Holika Holika and the other is Make Up For Ever. 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.340
 Because many people want to see me using Holika Holika 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.580
 So I chose this foundation today. 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.540
 The foundation itself is very thin and can be easily applied by hand. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.020
 But I like to use my Sigma Foundation Brush 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.180
 Because I want to keep my hands clean 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780
 Tell you a little trick. 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.780
 In order to prevent excess oil on the face 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.580
 And if you want makeup to last a little longer, 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.580
 I will use the thinnest paper towel 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.940
 Gently pat on the face and remove excess oil 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.460
 You can really see the big difference when using this technique. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.460
 The concealer 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.800
 I want to use Bobbi Brown's concealer. 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 I have used this concealer for three years. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.320
 Its masking effect is no substitute for other products. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.740
 Use the prepared powder to maintain the concealer effect 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.780
 Eyebrows 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.300
 If you have seen my Korean eyebrow film 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.660
 You will find that I use a lot of products for the eyebrows. 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.300
 But I seem to use Laura Mercier's eyebrow glue most often. 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.080
 And it’s the easiest eyebrow cream to wipe. 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.100
 Like my concealer step, I will also use the special powder for eyebrows to fix the makeup. 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.040
 The eyebrows gradually darken from the inside out 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.940
 This will give the eyebrows a three-dimensional 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.080
 Next I want to use the eye base cream. 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.660
 I chose the lightest color from my Naked Basics eye shadow tray. 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.100
 Rub in the corner of the eye and let the eyes stand out 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.020
 From the Naked 2 eye shadow tray, use Half baked 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.760
 Rub in the center of the eye 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.780
 Sometimes I will jump this step 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.460
 But if I want to give me some light, 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.040
 Will figure a little 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.900
 From the Naked 1 eye shadow tray, I chose the two colors I use the most. 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.420
 Smog and Dark horse 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.280
 This is to repair the eyes and give the eyes depth 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.260
 If you are not sure how deep the eye shadow is 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.160
 Draw an invisible line from the end of the eye to the end of the eyebrow 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.920
 It’s enough to draw eye shadows in that range. 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.780
 In order to increase the stereoscopic effect 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.920
 I used Dark horse at the end of my eyes. 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.420
 And blending with the eyeshadow in the center of the eye 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.580
 Next I want to use the eyelash curler 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.020
 After that, I will use black eyeliner. 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.700
 Figure under the eyeliner 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.320
 The reason why I put the eyelashes in front of the eyeliner 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.800
 Because my eyes are not smeared 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.520
 Next I want to use MAC Dipdown eyeliner 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.820
 This is a very beautiful and durable brown 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.340
 I will draw a little more 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.600
 I like to make the brown painting a little more obvious. 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.940
 And let the brown and the black tail of the eye end blend naturally. 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.920
 This kind of painting also looks natural in everyday life. 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.960
 I will put the remaining eye shadow glue on the head of the brush. 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.100
 almost finished 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.500
 In order to brighten my eyes, I used a white Faceshop eyeliner in my eyes. 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.180
 Then use the eyeliner under the eyes to show a shiny effect. 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.880
 This may look too much 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.400
 But it also looks natural in everyday life. 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.000
 Next I want to use blush 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.600
 I am using Maybelline Mineral Blush 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.320
 I really like this blush. 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.480
 The blush brush I use is Hakuhodo. 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.840
 I don't often, but sometimes I will repair it. 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.120
 I am using Napoleon the Ultimate Contour Palette 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.220
 I use the bottom color to repair the cheekbones. 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.700
 Also repair the side of the bridge of the nose 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.120
 Light and shadow are not very common 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
 But I like to use Mac Luna 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.080
 Rub a little on the nose with the cheekbones 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.080
 I use Chanel powder to fix my makeup. 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.920
 The part of the light and shadow is also a little fixed 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.580
 Finally use waterproof Lancome Hypnose Mascara 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.840
 I really like this mascara. 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.880
 My eyelashes won't fall down easily when rubbing this mascara 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.980
 And this mascara has a thick and long-lasting effect, and it won't smear. 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.580
 In terms of lipstick 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.160
 I want to choose one from YSL, Skinfood, or Tom Ford. 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.960
 I usually choose one from the three, taking turns to rub 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.600
 The first one is Tom Ford. 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.180
 The second is a mix of Skinfood and Mac. 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.260
 And this one is YSL's lip gloss 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.220
 I hope that you like the makeup that everyday life can wear.
