00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.289 
paint actually it turned out pretty good
and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> way<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.549> came<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.180> made

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and I like the way it came out and made

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.080 
and I like the way it came out and made
some<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.720> bit<00:01:54.810> stiffer<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:56.939> they

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
some little bit stiffer so I think they

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.709 
some little bit stiffer so I think they
turn<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.390> real<00:01:57.750> cute<00:01:58.020> looking<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.360> the<00:02:00.360> next

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
turn out real cute looking and the next

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.039 
turn out real cute looking and the next
ones<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> did<00:02:01.799> were<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.450> same<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.689> these

really Laughton's never use them wasn't

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.410 
really Laughton's never use them wasn't
thrilled<00:03:17.530> about<00:03:17.709> them<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.250> when<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.150> layered

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
seven dollars on everything that I

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.370
