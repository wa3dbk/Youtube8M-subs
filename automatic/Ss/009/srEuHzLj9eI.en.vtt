00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 A good coach can lead his team to the championship title. 

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:07.300
 But a great coach will lead any team in any sport ... 

00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:09.000
 ... to the top. 

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.500
 We have a proposal for you. 

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.500
 This is the Battle of the Year. 

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.000
 We created the sport. 

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.000
 But in the last fifteen years, no American team has won it. 

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.000
 I want you to train my group. 

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.000
 I was a basketball coach. 

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.300
 Those guys are athletes and you can make them champions. 

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.000
 Gentlemen, welcome. This will be your new home for a few months. 

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.000
 - What is this place? - Any old school? 

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.000
 Mom was right. She always told me I'd end up in a place like this. 

00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.500
 Listen! Training starts exactly at six. 

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:43.000
 - At 6 am? - You arrive at 6:01 and you're flying out of here. 

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.500
 Follow my simple rules, or you're flying from here. 

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:49.000
 - Coach! - Ask me some clever question about my rules 

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.300
 and you're flying too. 

00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:52.300
 They came from all over the country ... 

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:54.600
 - Breathing is like breathing for me. - Double trouble! 

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.000
 - I've sacrificed it all my life. - It's all I have. 

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.700
 ... to fight a battle ... 

00:00:58.701 --> 00:00:59.800
 So finally, let's go! 

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.000
 ... with yourself. 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.200
 Is this the girl? 

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:06.000
 - You left one of our best? - The best. 

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.000
 Until he showed them it was different. 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.000
 History is full of teams where they didn't get along. 

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.500
 Players must support each other to perfection. 

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.000
 The coach was right. We will not get anywhere if you two do not deal with each other! 

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:20.000
 We can win it. 

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.500
 I'm talking about this! 

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.500
 - I think we need a choreographer. - Get me the best. 

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.000
 - It is a girl! - You wanted the best. 

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.000
 - What to put on one, baby. - I'm not the boys. 

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.200
 I like men so we don't have a problem together. 

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:42.000
 The only way to win is to go there as a team. 

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.600
 When the whole world stands against them ... 

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.000
 Look. There are the Koreans. World Champions. 

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.000
 ... everything depends only on one. 

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.000
 - What's it like to be one team? - Damn good, coach. 

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.000
 They can't believe in their dreams 

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.000
 These are the Olympic Games of our sport. 

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.000
 UNTIL ONE ONE IN THE SECOND 

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.000
 You guys, you're like my brothers. 

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.000
 These aren't the same guys who came to your door. 

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.000
 Get that podium for yourself! 

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.000
 Get your viewers to yourself! 

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:15.000
 We'll bring the title back to America! 

00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:21.000
 BATTLE OF THE YEAR IN 3D 

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:22.000
 Dream Team! ------------------------------ d1e0798f1828--
