00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
again to to understand basically how I

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.520 
again to to understand basically how I
do<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.240> but<00:04:27.420> there<00:04:27.870> are<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:27.990> couple<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.320> tips

that I will tell you right now so tip

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.030 
that I will tell you right now so tip
number<00:04:32.280> one<00:04:33.110> controlling<00:04:34.110> your<00:04:34.410> audience<00:04:34.860> is

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
number one controlling your audience is

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.500 
number one controlling your audience is
probably<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.430> most<00:04:35.580> important<00:04:36.150> thing<00:04:36.330> with

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
probably the most important thing with

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.910 
probably the most important thing with
this<00:04:36.690> trick<00:04:36.990> as<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.500> would<00:04:37.590> have<00:04:37.680> seen<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.860> the

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
this trick as you would have seen in the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.400 
this trick as you would have seen in the
performance<00:04:38.430> there<00:04:38.820> were<00:04:38.910> two<00:04:39.120> girls<00:04:39.390> I<00:04:39.780> said

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
performance there were two girls I said

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.320 
performance there were two girls I said
to<00:04:40.560> her<00:04:40.740> one<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.460> friends<00:04:41.760> hate<00:04:41.940> you're

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
to her one of the friends hate you're

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.940 
to her one of the friends hate you're
going<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.540> know<00:04:42.600> how<00:04:42.750> this<00:04:42.870> is<00:04:43.020> done<00:04:43.290> don't

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
going to know how this is done don't

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.940 
going to know how this is done don't
tell<00:04:44.340> her<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:45.540> I<00:04:45.870> think<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.230> told<00:04:46.650> her<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.800> a

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
tell her and I think I told her that a

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.250 
tell her and I think I told her that a
couple<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.400> times<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:47.790> she<00:04:47.850> doesn't<00:04:48.060> say<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:48.450> so

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
couple of times so she doesn't say it so

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.570 
couple of times so she doesn't say it so
that's<00:04:49.470> one<00:04:49.680> important<00:04:50.070> thing<00:04:50.100> well<00:04:50.490> the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
that's one important thing well the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.830 
that's one important thing well the
other<00:04:50.700> second<00:04:50.970> thing<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.180> controlling<00:04:51.720> the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
other second thing is controlling the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.330 
other second thing is controlling the
person<00:04:52.200> you're<00:04:52.320> using<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.680> chuck<00:04:52.860> baseballs

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
person you're using to chuck baseballs

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.130 
person you're using to chuck baseballs
overhead<00:04:53.730> something<00:04:54.419> important<00:04:54.870> as<00:04:54.960> well<00:04:55.110> is

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
overhead something important as well is

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.010 
overhead something important as well is
levels<00:04:55.740> what<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.280> mean<00:04:56.520> by<00:04:56.730> that<00:04:56.760> is<00:04:57.390> I'm<00:04:57.960> a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
levels what I mean by that is I'm a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.610 
levels what I mean by that is I'm a
little<00:04:58.350> bit<00:04:58.500> higher<00:04:58.830> right<00:04:59.850> then<00:05:00.630> her<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.200> the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
little bit higher right then her and the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.810 
little bit higher right then her and the
reason<00:05:01.950> for<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.130> is<00:05:02.310> because<00:05:02.340> when<00:05:02.730> you're

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
reason for that is because when you're

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.940 
reason for that is because when you're
trapping<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.210> pig<00:05:03.360> balls<00:05:03.570> overhead<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.710> want

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
trapping the pig balls overhead you want

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.409 
trapping the pig balls overhead you want
the<00:05:05.070> height<00:05:05.340> okay

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
the height okay

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.790 
the height okay
I'm<00:05:06.630> not<00:05:06.810> saying<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.140> can<00:05:07.320> do<00:05:07.440> this<00:05:07.470> sitting

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
I'm not saying you can do this sitting

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.830 
I'm not saying you can do this sitting
down<00:05:07.890> at<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.580> same<00:05:08.760> level<00:05:09.090> but<00:05:09.210> I<00:05:09.240> just<00:05:09.510> was<00:05:09.810> a

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
down at the same level but I just was a

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.170 
down at the same level but I just was a
little<00:05:09.990> bit<00:05:10.110> taller<00:05:10.410> than<00:05:10.590> her<00:05:10.860> so<00:05:11.250> when<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.430> put

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
little bit taller than her so when I put

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.420 
little bit taller than her so when I put
the<00:05:12.330> ball<00:05:12.570> put<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.020> paper<00:05:13.260> napkin<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.950> little

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
the ball put the paper napkin a little

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.820 
the ball put the paper napkin a little
bit<00:05:14.520> over<00:05:15.120> her<00:05:15.510> eye<00:05:15.690> level<00:05:15.960> that's<00:05:16.530> when<00:05:16.800> I

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
bit over her eye level that's when I

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.740 
bit over her eye level that's when I
chuck<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.490> that's<00:05:17.790> when<00:05:18.030> she<00:05:18.060> can't<00:05:18.450> see

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
chuck it and that's when she can't see

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.550 
chuck it and that's when she can't see
it<00:05:18.870> okay

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
it okay

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.840 
it okay
that's<00:05:19.800> really<00:05:20.070> important<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.610> there<00:05:20.730> is<00:05:20.820> a

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
that's really important and there is a

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.820 
that's really important and there is a
little<00:05:21.000> bit<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.240> a<00:05:21.300> timing<00:05:21.750> thing<00:05:21.780> with<00:05:22.590> that

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
little bit of a timing thing with that

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.550 
little bit of a timing thing with that
so<00:05:23.280> controlling<00:05:23.970> her<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.419> making<00:05:24.870> sure<00:05:25.230> she

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
so controlling her and making sure she

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.010 
so controlling her and making sure she
doesn't<00:05:26.030> fall<00:05:27.030> out<00:05:27.090> of<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.330> tree<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:27.720> become

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
doesn't fall out of the tree and become

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.290 
doesn't fall out of the tree and become
JJ<00:05:28.890> in<00:05:29.040> a<00:05:29.100> wheelchair<00:05:29.580> video<00:05:29.850> too

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
JJ in a wheelchair video too

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.200 
JJ in a wheelchair video too
before<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.290> just<00:05:32.250> so<00:05:32.370> she<00:05:32.430> doesn't<00:05:32.550> look<00:05:32.940> turn

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
before I just so she doesn't look turn

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.320 
before I just so she doesn't look turn
around<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.810> see<00:05:34.230> the<00:05:34.350> paper<00:05:34.560> balls<00:05:34.800> going

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
around and see the paper balls going

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.640 
around and see the paper balls going
over<00:05:36.330> her<00:05:36.510> head<00:05:36.690> so<00:05:36.870> there<00:05:37.200> is<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.350> lot<00:05:37.560> of

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
over her head so there is a lot of

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.170 
over her head so there is a lot of
audience<00:05:38.040> and<00:05:38.250> management<00:05:38.730> which<00:05:38.820> is<00:05:38.940> very

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
audience and management which is very

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.230 
audience and management which is very
important<00:05:39.690> with

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
important with

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.610 
important with
and<00:05:40.330> it<00:05:40.660> look<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:40.870> also<00:05:40.990> helps<00:05:41.290> with<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.470> right

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
and it look it also helps with the right

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.590 
and it look it also helps with the right
type<00:05:41.890> of<00:05:41.920> person<00:05:42.160> as<00:05:42.430> well<00:05:42.580> but<00:05:42.820> well

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
type of person as well but well

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.000 
type of person as well but well
management<00:05:44.320> is<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.440> most<00:05:44.620> important<00:05:44.890> thing

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
management is the most important thing

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.320 
management is the most important thing
so<00:05:45.160> as<00:05:45.400> you've<00:05:45.520> seen<00:05:45.700> I'm<00:05:45.820> checking<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.150> paper

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
so as you've seen I'm checking the paper

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.780 
so as you've seen I'm checking the paper
walls<00:05:46.540> overhead<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:47.140> what<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:47.710> do<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:48.160> I<00:05:48.550> keep

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
walls overhead and what I do is I keep

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.070 
walls overhead and what I do is I keep
doing<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.450> until<00:05:50.320> the<00:05:50.560> gag<00:05:50.800> gets<00:05:51.870> there<00:05:52.870> till

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
doing it until the gag gets there till

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.600 
doing it until the gag gets there till
until<00:05:53.380> they've<00:05:53.500> had<00:05:53.530> enough<00:05:53.740> it's<00:05:54.370> sort<00:05:54.580> of

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
until they've had enough it's sort of

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.400 
until they've had enough it's sort of
like<00:05:54.700> when<00:05:54.880> you<00:05:54.970> do<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.120> trick<00:05:55.480> over<00:05:55.900> and<00:05:56.200> over

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
like when you do a trick over and over

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.900 
like when you do a trick over and over
again<00:05:56.470> for<00:05:56.680> example<00:05:56.830> IKEA<00:05:57.220> and<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:57.580> ambitious

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
again for example IKEA and the ambitious

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.130 
again for example IKEA and the ambitious
card<00:05:58.090> where<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.330> card<00:05:58.540> keeps<00:05:58.690> coming<00:05:58.990> to<00:05:59.020> the

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
card where the card keeps coming to the

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.200 
card where the card keeps coming to the
top<00:05:59.380> you<00:06:00.250> don't<00:06:00.400> want<00:06:00.520> to<00:06:00.580> do<00:06:00.700> it<00:06:00.790> when<00:06:00.910> people

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
top you don't want to do it when people

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.280 
top you don't want to do it when people
getting<00:06:01.420> annoyed<00:06:01.720> that<00:06:02.050> they're<00:06:02.170> not

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
getting annoyed that they're not

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.560 
getting annoyed that they're not
figuring<00:06:02.710> out<00:06:02.830> she<00:06:03.130> was<00:06:03.280> lots<00:06:03.460> of<00:06:03.610> fun<00:06:03.820> and<00:06:04.090> I

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
figuring out she was lots of fun and I

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.900 
figuring out she was lots of fun and I
sort<00:06:04.870> of<00:06:04.930> timed<00:06:05.290> it<00:06:05.530> right<00:06:05.740> that<00:06:06.040> about<00:06:06.490> three

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
sort of timed it right that about three

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.820 
sort of timed it right that about three
or<00:06:07.000> four<00:06:07.210> phases<00:06:07.540> into<00:06:07.990> this<00:06:08.380> sort<00:06:08.590> of<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.800> the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
or four phases into this sort of the the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.060 
or four phases into this sort of the the
trick<00:06:09.430> that<00:06:09.640> I<00:06:09.910> knew<00:06:10.330> that<00:06:11.080> they<00:06:11.590> would<00:06:11.740> enjoy

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
trick that I knew that they would enjoy

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.210 
trick that I knew that they would enjoy
so<00:06:12.610> you<00:06:12.900> do<00:06:13.900> it<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.050> couple<00:06:14.170> of<00:06:14.320> times<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:14.890> then

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
so you do it a couple of times and then

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.490 
so you do it a couple of times and then
you<00:06:16.030> know<00:06:16.150> you<00:06:16.210> finish<00:06:16.600> it<00:06:16.720> off<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:17.080> that's<00:06:17.260> it

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
you know you finish it off and that's it

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.830 
you know you finish it off and that's it
now<00:06:17.950> another<00:06:18.280> tip<00:06:18.490> is<00:06:18.640> important<00:06:19.060> as<00:06:19.120> well<00:06:19.300> why

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
now another tip is important as well why

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.610 
now another tip is important as well why
make<00:06:20.140> sure<00:06:20.470> or<00:06:21.250> are<00:06:21.720> sort<00:06:22.720> of<00:06:22.810> just<00:06:23.290> so<00:06:23.470> that

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
make sure or are sort of just so that

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.530 
make sure or are sort of just so that
she<00:06:24.070> doesn't<00:06:24.520> think<00:06:24.670> I'm<00:06:24.820> talking<00:06:25.120> overhead

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
she doesn't think I'm talking overhead

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.480 
she doesn't think I'm talking overhead
straight<00:06:25.840> away<00:06:26.020> I<00:06:26.260> will<00:06:26.740> get<00:06:26.950> her<00:06:27.100> to<00:06:27.130> win<00:06:27.460> a

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
straight away I will get her to win a

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.130 
straight away I will get her to win a
couple<00:06:27.730> of<00:06:27.940> times<00:06:28.210> as<00:06:28.540> you<00:06:28.840> would<00:06:28.900> have<00:06:28.990> seen

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
couple of times as you would have seen

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.860 
couple of times as you would have seen
in<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:29.320> performance<00:06:29.860> so<00:06:30.700> that<00:06:30.910> she<00:06:31.150> sort<00:06:31.810> of

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
in the performance so that she sort of

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.510 
in the performance so that she sort of
feels<00:06:32.080> like<00:06:32.200> it's<00:06:32.410> still<00:06:32.650> there<00:06:32.860> and<00:06:33.070> I<00:06:33.250> okay

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
feels like it's still there and I okay

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.970 
feels like it's still there and I okay
she's<00:06:33.730> just<00:06:34.000> not<00:06:34.240> picking<00:06:34.660> the<00:06:34.870> right<00:06:35.050> hand<00:06:35.350> so

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
she's just not picking the right hand so

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.310 
she's just not picking the right hand so
I'll<00:06:36.220> do<00:06:36.400> it<00:06:36.490> first<00:06:36.700> few<00:06:37.600> times<00:06:37.780> for<00:06:38.140> her<00:06:38.230> to

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
I'll do it first few times for her to

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.140 
I'll do it first few times for her to
get<00:06:38.500> it<00:06:38.590> get<00:06:38.920> the<00:06:39.010> game<00:06:39.220> then<00:06:39.880> I'll<00:06:40.000> do<00:06:40.120> a

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
get it get the game then I'll do a

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.760 
get it get the game then I'll do a
couple<00:06:40.510> of<00:06:40.600> times<00:06:40.780> overhead<00:06:41.140> then<00:06:41.440> I'll<00:06:41.560> do<00:06:41.680> it

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
couple of times overhead then I'll do it

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.130 
couple of times overhead then I'll do it
normally<00:06:42.220> again<00:06:42.520> and<00:06:42.790> then<00:06:43.540> I'll<00:06:43.780> check<00:06:43.990> it

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
normally again and then I'll check it

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.990 
normally again and then I'll check it
over<00:06:44.230> a<00:06:44.350> head<00:06:44.530> again<00:06:44.770> and<00:06:44.920> then<00:06:45.220> that's

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
over a head again and then that's

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.580 
over a head again and then that's
basically<00:06:46.210> it<00:06:46.630> and<00:06:46.750> then<00:06:46.900> the<00:06:47.020> last<00:06:47.200> part<00:06:47.440> is

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
basically it and then the last part is

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.440 
basically it and then the last part is
you<00:06:47.770> typically<00:06:48.550> you<00:06:48.730> would<00:06:48.880> use<00:06:49.000> a<00:06:49.030> really

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
you typically you would use a really

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.510 
you typically you would use a really
really<00:06:49.690> big<00:06:49.930> napkin<00:06:50.680> or<00:06:50.830> the<00:06:50.920> toilet<00:06:51.190> paper<00:06:51.370> or

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
really big napkin or the toilet paper or

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.220 
really big napkin or the toilet paper or
whatever<00:06:51.670> in<00:06:52.120> your<00:06:52.510> hand<00:06:52.780> which<00:06:52.960> I<00:06:53.050> didn't

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
whatever in your hand which I didn't

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.409 
whatever in your hand which I didn't
have<00:06:53.320> a<00:06:53.350> lot<00:06:53.530> on<00:06:53.560> me<00:06:53.770> but<00:06:53.950> you<00:06:54.310> really<00:06:54.390> get<00:06:55.390> a

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
have a lot on me but you really get a

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.760 
have a lot on me but you really get a
really<00:06:55.780> big<00:06:55.930> gag<00:06:56.080> especially<00:06:56.530> in<00:06:56.620> like<00:06:56.740> a

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
really big gag especially in like a

really big gag especially in like a
private<00:06:57.190> party<00:06:57.580> or<00:06:58.110> you<00:06:59.110> know<00:06:59.230> a<00:06:59.260> corporate
