00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.840
 it's been a little since we learn 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.070
 to look at the sky and try to recognize shapes 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 in the clouds 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.720
 if it stops to pay attention even goes 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.439
 that there are several types of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.840
 names 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.850
 today you will meet the ten types 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 basic 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.699
 the world meteorological organization to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.230
 who officially classifies and recognizes 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.360
 all kinds of clouds 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.840
 the clouds are generally divided 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.510
 in three groups the low clouds based 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.300
 up to two kilometers from the ground the clouds 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.899
 average of two to eight kilometers 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.090
 altitude and high clouds above 8 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.430
 kilometers condendo get to 12 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.829
 Software kilometers rating 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.879
 also involves the appearance and texture 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.570
 of hands 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.559
 There are three types of accumulations and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.109
 abstract 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.210
 Let's look at some of the details. 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.729
 even because they provoke 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.080
 meteorological phenomena we are more 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.330
 accustomed to see 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.790
 although the names are unknown 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.369
 weird for the vast majority already 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.470
 we heard about another cloud 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.780
 in the group of low clouds have the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.970
 extracts that form less than one 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 kilometer from the ground 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.070
 view from above looks like a long carpet 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.500
 white the gray medium may 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.100
 and when it is very close 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.770
 of the soil forms the haze to extract as 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.079
 light looks cuter looks like a 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.350
 Cotton path side by side 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.200
 also causes light rain on the tongue 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.200
 extracts is more invents spice and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.390
 can cover all sun is common to see 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 on those humid days of closed time and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.170
 rain can cause strong rainfall and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.479
 snow 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.360
 the same group there is accumulation of good 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.290
 weather or popularly called clouds 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.939
 lamb 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.299
 that's what we're trying to find 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.909
 shapes in the sky is white looks muzzle 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.600
 like a cotton swab and does not threaten 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.330
 the rain 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.730
 closing the group we have accumulated nests at 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.800
 more dangerous as long as you want 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.319
 in a very characteristic format of a 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.360
 anvil is dark grows a lot 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.040
 can practically reach 12 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.530
 kilometers of altitude 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.920
 results in time with wind rays 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.650
 and even hail knows the famous rain of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.620
 summer is caused by as links 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.620
 she is often scary and the cloud 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.319
 which gives rise to tornadoes in the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.930
 medium clouds there are high extracts that 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.209
 changes novelty put the sun to look 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.959
 half sore can cause rain as well 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.660
 Light 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.840
 later in high common also it recalls 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.720
 cotton foci and lining the sky 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.480
 side by side looking like a huge quilt 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.390
 covering the sky of the group of high clouds 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.720
 we have the most delicate clouds at circuses 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.510
 it is white, although strokes and scratches 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.299
 in the sky to be the shape extracts logo 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.849
 below the silva are also thin and 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.510
 when they are in front of the sun they form the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.090
 student to be the cumulus is almost queen 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.609
 transparent but group appear as 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.440
 you are so far from the ground you can not 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.419
 cause shade on the floor 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.639
 the high clouds are formed by 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:26.250
 ice crystals and so and not 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.859
 offensive against rain and 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.130
 clouds associated with rainfall are 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.269
 extracts language extracts to extracts 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.430
 accumulation minutes 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.400
 in which case the atmosphere must be 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.620
 charged with heat and moisture elements 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.919
 essential for any rainfall 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.060
 occur now just look at the sky and 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.190
 have a good time 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.680
 in another episode let's talk about the clouds 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.980
 rare suggestions talk to us by e 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.030
 mail explaining the time to clothes 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.769
 climatempo.com.br or by the hashtag 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.769
 explaining time until the next
