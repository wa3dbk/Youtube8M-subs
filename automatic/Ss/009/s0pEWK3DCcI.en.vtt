00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.400
 my name is hugo moisés martínez 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.890
 karradá and I'm 25 years old 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.689
 I am Luis Reyna Escivel study 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.010
 mechatronics engineering career in the 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:26.039
 anp and is 321 turn on the robots 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.529
 the competitors move away and the objective 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.940
 is to throw the opponent out of the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.940
 combat area without you leave you 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.850
 the first time we designed a robot 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.409
 it was around the fifth semester 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.289
 we started to develop prototypes every 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.289
 more sophisticated times a little bit better 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.410
 we do not ally ourselves more in materials of 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.360
 waste we take for example to the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.550
 tianguis of electronic scrap or 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.159
 industrial and good scrap from sara 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.559
 let's go sun computer VCRs 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.030
 camcorders and because of that we started to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.030
 create the first robots 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.729
 of the strawberry we use to make 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.430
 many of the pieces of the robots the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.740
 which are for example some 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.930
 perforations to the tires that good 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.680
 we have make in the lathe 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.750
 we have like many little ones 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.820
 of which afterwards we are worth as 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.800
 example joysticks that maybe not anymore 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:39.500
 serves for some reason they come to stop 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:41.150
 here and we give them another use in the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.770
 president of the city of robotics 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.080
 American so are the direct invitation 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.000
 to the international Olympics to the 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.430
 Robogames Cruz and I were the first 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.590
 Mexican team that arrived in some 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.869
 category of the 70 that exists the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.280
 problem that we had there was that no 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.649
 We knew how bad they were going to treat 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.090
 our robot at the airport of usa and 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.770
 when we opened the boxes 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.509
 robots are all broken not then 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.729
 we had to get to work for 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.290
 to be able to assemble the robots we brought five 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.509
 robots of which nothing else we could 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.220
 recover three and well we arrived and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.320
 we saw the austria team the team 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.030
 from singapore and we were getting closer to 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.000
 they said it today when I can take 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.320
 the photos robots and others and this they do not 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.500
 they approached they did not see our robot or 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.510
 ugly as well as marched 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.400
 and at the time of competition when 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.170
 they give the first bouts we started 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.660
 to win then like they get out of 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.099
 indeed there is no wave a time 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.550
 that Americans like to celebrate 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.550
 in the time 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.410
 we faced each other and we won both 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.020
 followed we already knew the podium 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.480
 in fact the USA competitor who was already 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.180
 a man around about 40 years old nor 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.890
 he even wanted to go up to second place 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.860
 at that time day begins to approach 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.750
 the youth of Singapore Austria 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.990
 Japan and they start taking pictures of our 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.990
 robot 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.459
 the diamond game 2008 we won the first 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.810
 second third and fourth place 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.489
 after winning the first three 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.560
 places comes the moment of the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.300
 award announces in third place 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.280
 we went to third place on the podium 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.660
 then announce the second place the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.490
 silver medal for pistache and 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.040
 we got out of third place and 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.840
 we went to the second place and there then 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.060
 some of the people laugh at some 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.410
 applause and everything and then after the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.030
 most important moment is when 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.800
 announce the gold medal for the robot 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.480
 bull and we had the 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.440
 second to the first place on the podium and we 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.440
 they give the gold medal 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.120
 when people stopped and applauded 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.040
 all for the same reason because it has never been 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.230
 seen that it has been seen that the same country 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.910
 will win three the three places but not that 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.500
 the same team from the same country was 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.280
 changing podium to win the three 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.280
 of first places 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.610
 well this is pepe the double champion 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.400
 world of robogames this is 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.610
 pistache won the silver medal in 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.610
 the robogames 2008 is not very strong but 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.180
 it's relatively quick, we can see it 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:19.120
 here to pepe the bull and his little brother 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.739
 that is vulgarcito this is a sumo nano 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.650
 the robot must be exactly the same 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.930
 but in its smaller version 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.360
 this is pepe the bull 2007 the first 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.400
 version with which we compete and win 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.220
 the first place the first time down 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.590
 we see the engines that is one of the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.050
 things that helped us to win is this 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.610
 engine configuration what it does 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.310
 this configuration is to provide us 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.930
 one greater is contact area and good 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.300
 it's pretty much the same design as 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.950
 we have been applying in the most 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.740
 new and this is the 3 kilogram juice 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.600
 so sting with the robot with which 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.300
 we compete in Japan 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.150
 we won in the US the ticket to travel to 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.160
 Japan and well there we compete against in 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.970
 essence the champions of each province 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.950
 Japanese and some foreign countries and 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.930
 being in japan with so good so 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.390
 nothing else we place them as inside 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.510
 the best foreign countries but 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.430
 really the Japanese is another one they are very 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.140
 good but are not invincible then 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.000
 Well we're there in that wave 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.400
 build a robot that can make them 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.900
 directly the Japanese already give them 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.630
 once in the category of the two 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.390
 small ones and in the one of the big robots 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.160
 they are this right now you have them the 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.160
 crown then you can get them to support
