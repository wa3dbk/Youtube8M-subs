00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
game bring it to overtime who knows I

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.580 
game bring it to overtime who knows I
were<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.630> having<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.140> bad<00:01:49.290> luck<00:01:49.560> I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
were just having like really bad luck I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
were just having like really bad luck I
think<00:01:49.890> most<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> games<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.939> lose<00:01:51.119> only<00:01:51.329> by<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
think most the games we lose only by a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.980 
think most the games we lose only by a
goal<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.640> hopefully<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.149> said<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.869> at

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
