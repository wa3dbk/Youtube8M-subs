00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
and my idea for the next part of it is

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.440 
and my idea for the next part of it is
teaser<00:03:21.380> wise<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.980> think<00:03:22.250> we'll<00:03:22.760> either<00:03:22.910> see<00:03:23.269> a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
teaser wise I think we'll either see a

teaser wise I think we'll either see a
nightmare<00:03:24.049> puppet<00:03:24.440> at<00:03:24.530> some<00:03:24.739> point<00:03:25.010> because

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
nightmare puppet at some point because

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.710 
nightmare puppet at some point because
we<00:03:25.640> still<00:03:25.850> don't<00:03:26.030> know<00:03:26.120> too<00:03:26.180> much<00:03:26.420> about<00:03:26.600> him

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
we still don't know too much about him

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.340 
we still don't know too much about him
or<00:03:27.140> we<00:03:28.070> will<00:03:28.250> see<00:03:28.519> Freddy<00:03:29.180> Bonnie<00:03:29.600> chica<00:03:29.750> and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
or we will see Freddy Bonnie chica and
