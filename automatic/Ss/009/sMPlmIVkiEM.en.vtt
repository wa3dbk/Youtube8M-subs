I've<00:01:11.670> been<00:01:11.939> balancing<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> giving<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> too

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
I've been balancing was I giving it too

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.550 
I've been balancing was I giving it too
much<00:01:14.040> gas<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:15.119> gas<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
much gas to little gas and it's kind of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.499 
much gas to little gas and it's kind of
hard<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> figure<00:01:17.070> out<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> finally<00:01:18.000> determined

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
hard to figure out I finally determined

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.870 
hard to figure out I finally determined
that<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.159> give<00:01:20.369> him<00:01:20.460> much<00:01:20.640> gas

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that you really don't give him much gas

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
that you really don't give him much gas
at<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.960> progress<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.560> standstill<00:01:22.920> but

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
at all to progress from a standstill but

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
at all to progress from a standstill but
often<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.759> town<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.479> jerk<00:01:24.780> back<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> forth<00:01:25.500> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
often in town you jerk back and forth it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.410 
often in town you jerk back and forth it
makes<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.159> lot<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> noise<00:01:26.430> people<00:01:26.909> are<00:01:27.119> looking

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
makes a lot of noise people are looking

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.730 
makes a lot of noise people are looking
at<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.900> look<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.259> you're<00:01:28.439> driving<00:01:28.710> like

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
at you you look like you're driving like

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.149 
at you you look like you're driving like
an<00:01:28.979> idiot<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.000> difficult<00:01:31.159> another

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
an idiot so it is difficult another

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
an idiot so it is difficult another
downside<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> cars<00:01:33.329> turning<00:01:33.840> radius<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
downside is the cars turning radius it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.920 
downside is the cars turning radius it
is<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> worst<00:01:35.280> turning<00:01:36.240> radiuses<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
is one of the worst turning radiuses of

is one of the worst turning radiuses of
any<00:01:37.409> car<00:01:37.680> I've<00:01:37.890> ever<00:01:38.100> driven<00:01:39.200> probably<00:01:40.200> due<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
any car I've ever driven probably due to

the all-wheel-drive system wide tires

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.310 
the all-wheel-drive system wide tires
but<00:01:43.680> I've<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.460> never<00:01:44.850> driven<00:01:45.540> anything<00:01:45.810> like

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
but I've just never driven anything like

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.640 
but I've just never driven anything like
it<00:01:46.500> where<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.740> takes<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.460> many<00:01:48.259> damn<00:01:49.259> turns

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
it where it takes so many damn turns

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.380 
it where it takes so many damn turns
to<00:01:51.280> get<00:01:51.460> around<00:01:51.700> things<00:01:51.910> when<00:01:52.120> you're<00:01:52.240> in<00:01:52.330> a

volume<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:52.039> what<00:05:52.250> surprises<00:05:52.909> me<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.210> most<00:05:53.240> and

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
volume is what surprises me the most and

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.029

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
the volume goes to 30 at 30 out of 30 it

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.330 
the volume goes to 30 at 30 out of 30 it
is<00:05:58.849> not<00:05:59.180> loud<00:05:59.539> enough<00:05:59.599> I<00:06:00.110> mean<00:06:00.740> it's<00:06:01.039> pretty

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
is not loud enough I mean it's pretty

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.850 
is not loud enough I mean it's pretty
loud<00:06:01.610> but<00:06:01.970> most<00:06:02.479> cars<00:06:02.810> if<00:06:03.259> you're<00:06:03.409> turning<00:06:03.770> it

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
loud but most cars if you're turning it

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.260 
loud but most cars if you're turning it
up<00:06:03.979> all<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:04.250> way<00:06:04.400> unless<00:06:04.879> you<00:06:05.030> have<00:06:05.120> some

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
up all the way unless you have some

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.540 
up all the way unless you have some
serious<00:06:05.750> hearing<00:06:05.990> issues<00:06:06.440> it's<00:06:07.129> going<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.460> be

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
serious hearing issues it's going to be

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.140 
serious hearing issues it's going to be
way<00:06:08.090> too<00:06:08.150> loud<00:06:09.069> and<00:06:10.069> the<00:06:10.699> reason<00:06:11.030> that's

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
way too loud and the reason that's

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.170 
way too loud and the reason that's
frustrating<00:06:12.080> is<00:06:12.229> if<00:06:12.469> you<00:06:12.830> turn<00:06:13.039> it<00:06:13.159> up<00:06:13.280> to<00:06:13.699> 29

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
frustrating is if you turn it up to 29

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.200 
frustrating is if you turn it up to 29
out<00:06:14.479> of<00:06:14.509> 30<00:06:14.740> it's<00:06:15.740> really<00:06:16.039> not<00:06:16.190> good<00:06:16.550> for<00:06:16.789> the

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
out of 30 it's really not good for the

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.360 
out of 30 it's really not good for the
speaker<00:06:17.599> system<00:06:17.750> so<00:06:18.169> often<00:06:18.830> I<00:06:19.009> find<00:06:19.219> myself

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
speaker system so often I find myself

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.490 
speaker system so often I find myself
listening<00:06:20.240> to<00:06:20.330> music<00:06:20.629> quieter<00:06:21.050> than<00:06:21.199> I<00:06:21.319> would

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
listening to music quieter than I would

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.890 
listening to music quieter than I would
like<00:06:21.789> I'm<00:06:22.789> probably<00:06:23.120> not<00:06:23.479> going<00:06:23.719> to<00:06:23.780> do

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
like I'm probably not going to do

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.839 
like I'm probably not going to do

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
anything about it because this car is

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.629 
anything about it because this car is
not<00:06:26.180> supposed<00:06:26.659> to<00:06:26.750> be<00:06:26.930> an<00:06:27.229> in<00:06:27.469> home<00:06:27.800> theater
