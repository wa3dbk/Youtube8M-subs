toned it washed out and it was white and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.530 
toned it washed out and it was white and
then<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:07.850> turn<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.060> again<00:02:08.239> it<00:02:08.450> would

it<00:02:44.800> really<00:02:45.010> really<00:02:45.160> pastel<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:45.880> had<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.120> use

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
it really really pastel so I had to use

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.970 
it really really pastel so I had to use
a<00:02:46.270> whole<00:02:46.450> tub<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.720> them<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.500> little<00:02:47.710> bit<00:02:47.920> of

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
tensions

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.940 
tensions
I<00:03:00.760> left<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.270> on<00:03:01.480> for<00:03:01.840> 20<00:03:02.170> minutes<00:03:02.620> they<00:03:02.740> just

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
I left this on for 20 minutes they just

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.970 
I left this on for 20 minutes they just
say<00:03:03.100> leave<00:03:03.250> on<00:03:03.370> for<00:03:03.460> 20<00:03:03.670> minutes<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:05.260> think

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
say leave on for 20 minutes and I think

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.170 
say leave on for 20 minutes and I think
maybe<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.280> could<00:03:06.340> have<00:03:06.520> left<00:03:06.670> on<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> bit<00:03:07.000> longer

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
maybe I could have left on a bit longer

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.600 
maybe I could have left on a bit longer
and<00:03:07.600> wait<00:03:08.350> is<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.710> cool<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.070> wanted<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.580> I

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610
