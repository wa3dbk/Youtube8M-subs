door<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.690> I'm<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:33.930> gonna<00:00:34.050> lie<00:00:34.260> I've<00:00:34.559> really

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
door and I'm not gonna lie I've really

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
door and I'm not gonna lie I've really
liked<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> way<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.640> thing<00:00:35.850> looks<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> fact<00:00:36.360> I

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
liked the way this thing looks in fact I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
liked the way this thing looks in fact I
would<00:00:36.660> almost<00:00:37.020> argue<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.739> looks<00:00:37.920> better

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
would almost argue that it looks better

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
would almost argue that it looks better
than<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.460> standard<00:00:38.700> 4x4<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.690> don't<00:00:40.110> know<00:00:40.170> just

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
than your standard 4x4 I don't know just

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
than your standard 4x4 I don't know just
personal<00:00:40.829> preference<00:00:41.070> anyway<00:00:41.579> we're<00:00:41.730> gonna

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
personal preference anyway we're gonna

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
personal preference anyway we're gonna
take<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> look<00:00:42.270> at<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.510> opening<00:00:42.930> sequence<00:00:43.140> as

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
take a look at this opening sequence as

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.610 
take a look at this opening sequence as
you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.120> extremely<00:00:45.300> fast<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> fact

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you can see it is extremely fast in fact

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
you can see it is extremely fast in fact
it<00:00:46.739> opens<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.309> under<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> second<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.600> thing<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it opens in under a second this thing is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.979 
it opens in under a second this thing is
breaking<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> land<00:00:50.280> speed<00:00:50.789> record<00:00:51.300> sort<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
breaking the land speed record sort of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.410 
breaking the land speed record sort of
maybe<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.070> closing<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.090> little<00:00:54.300> bit

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
maybe and the closing it's a little bit

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.350 
maybe and the closing it's a little bit
slower<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.410> handle<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:56.030> worried<00:00:57.030> so

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
slower but we can handle that worried so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
slower but we can handle that worried so
let's<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> look<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> Redstone<00:00:58.920> behind

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
let's take a look at the Redstone behind

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.500 
let's take a look at the Redstone behind
it<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.460> we'll<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.699> take<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> sneak<00:01:00.239> peek

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it so we'll just take a sneak peek

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.869 
it so we'll just take a sneak peek
around<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> back<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:01.890> this

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
around the back and as you can see this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.700 
around the back and as you can see this
alright<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.510> twelve<00:01:03.870> point<00:01:04.140> nine<00:01:04.170> by<00:01:04.439> four

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
alright it's twelve point nine by four

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.100 
alright it's twelve point nine by four
it's<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:05.040> large<00:01:05.309> by<00:01:05.580> any<00:01:05.790> means<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> suppose<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it's not large by any means I suppose I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.719 
it's not large by any means I suppose I
was<00:01:07.320> concentrating<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.220> keeping<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.670> thing

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
was concentrating on keeping this thing

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
was concentrating on keeping this thing
as<00:01:09.060> fast<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.750> possible<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.409> guess<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.130> size

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
as fast as possible so I guess the size

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.210 
as fast as possible so I guess the size
suffered<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.360> bit<00:01:12.479> there<00:01:12.860> alright<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
suffered a little bit there alright so I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.499 
suffered a little bit there alright so I
guess<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
guess it's about that time and the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.149 
guess it's about that time and the
episode<00:01:15.780> where<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> show<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.439> how<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> build<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
episode where I show you how to build it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.910 
episode where I show you how to build it
so<00:01:17.369> let's<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:18.200> alright<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> kick

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
things off by putting four sticky

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
things off by putting four sticky
pistons<00:01:22.110> facing<00:01:22.259> upwards<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pistons facing upwards like this and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
pistons facing upwards like this and
then<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.060> blocks<00:01:24.659> running<00:01:24.990> into<00:01:25.290> each<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
then just blocks running into each of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.070 
then just blocks running into each of
those<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.189> yet<00:01:26.700> more<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.240> them<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:27.960> grab

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.109 
those and yet more of them and then grab
some<00:01:28.200> peers<00:01:28.680> set<00:01:29.009> each<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.579> three<00:01:29.820> ticks

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
some peers set each one to three ticks

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
some peers set each one to three ticks
like<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.439> redstone<00:01:32.100> round<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
like that and then redstone round the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
like that and then redstone round the
back<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> want<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
do is just drag this out by three blocks

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.600 
do is just drag this out by three blocks
and<00:01:36.869> put<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.170> block<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> then

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and put a block out like that and then

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.490 
and put a block out like that and then
make<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.820> run<00:01:39.180> into<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.600> block<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.350> grab

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
make that run into a block so just grab

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.319 
make that run into a block so just grab
your<00:01:40.619> redstone<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> repeater<00:01:41.939> there

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
your redstone and then a repeater there

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
your redstone and then a repeater there
and<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.990> repeat<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> same<00:01:43.619> thing<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and just repeat the same thing on the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
and just repeat the same thing on the
other<00:01:44.159> side<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.820> three<00:01:45.149> blocks<00:01:45.420> out<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
other side so three blocks out like this

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
other side so three blocks out like this
and<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.250> blocks<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.329> then

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and then it blocks out like that so then

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
and then it blocks out like that so then
you<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.810> want<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.960> grab<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.259> redstone<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you just want to grab your redstone and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.789 
you just want to grab your redstone and
run<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.430> into<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.820> block<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.560> alright<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
run it into that block there alright so

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.679 
run it into that block there alright so
just<00:01:52.829> as<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.759> information<00:01:54.060> this

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
just as a little bit of information this

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.719 
just as a little bit of information this
here<00:01:55.020> will<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.500> floor<00:01:55.829> level<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> your

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.499 
plot out your door so you just want to
go<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.159> block<00:02:02.310> above<00:02:02.670> these<00:02:02.820> Pistons<00:02:03.299> here

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
go one block above these Pistons here

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.530 
go one block above these Pistons here
and<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:04.229> make<00:02:04.439> an<00:02:04.590> O<00:02:04.860> shape<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.790> just

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and just make an O shape like this just

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
and just make an O shape like this just
drag<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.710> then<00:02:08.069> this

will give you a good guideline as to
where<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> place<00:02:10.590> your<00:02:10.770> pistons<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:12.120> new

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
where to place your pistons the new

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.699 
where to place your pistons the new
pistons<00:02:12.690> need<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.020> go<00:02:13.140> through<00:02:13.440> on<00:02:13.590> either

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
pistons need to go through on either

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.370 
pistons need to go through on either
side

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
side

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.010 
side
two<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> top<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:16.420> then<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.600> want<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> place

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
two on the top so then you want to place

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.170 
two on the top so then you want to place
a<00:02:17.260> redstone<00:02:17.620> torch<00:02:17.890> on<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.610> side<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.060> this

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
a redstone torch on this side of this

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.300 
a redstone torch on this side of this
book<00:02:19.420> here<00:02:19.720> with<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.290> block<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.680> top<00:02:20.890> piece<00:02:21.160> of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
book here with a block on top piece of

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.100 
book here with a block on top piece of
redstone<00:02:21.520> dust<00:02:21.910> another<00:02:22.330> block<00:02:22.630> like<00:02:22.810> that

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
redstone dust another block like that

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.470 
redstone dust another block like that
redstone<00:02:23.650> torch<00:02:24.160> block<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.030> then<00:02:25.210> another

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
redstone torch block and then another

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.570 
redstone torch block and then another
piece<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.960> redstone<00:02:26.230> dust<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.430> want

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
piece of redstone dust and then you want

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.980 
piece of redstone dust and then you want
to<00:02:27.610> repeat<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.120> same<00:02:28.360> thing<00:02:28.690> on<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.960> other

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
to repeat the same thing on the other

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.450 
to repeat the same thing on the other
side<00:02:29.320> so<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:29.800> goes<00:02:30.100> torch<00:02:30.460> block<00:02:31.420> dust<00:02:32.460> block

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
side so that goes torch block dust block

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.680 
side so that goes torch block dust block
and<00:02:33.790> then<00:02:34.330> torch<00:02:34.780> block<00:02:35.590> dust<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.480> then<00:02:37.630> you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
and then torch block dust so then you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.540 
and then torch block dust so then you
want<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.870> pay<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.080> block<00:02:38.440> here<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.190> then<00:02:39.460> you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
want to pay a block here and then you

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.280 
want to pay a block here and then you
block<00:02:39.760> up<00:02:39.910> like<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.570> then<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:40.840> carry

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
block up like that and then just carry

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.740 
block up like that and then just carry
them<00:02:41.530> out<00:02:41.680> into<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.460> block<00:02:42.760> here<00:02:43.090> then<00:02:43.540> just

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
them out into this block here then just

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.000 
them out into this block here then just
grab<00:02:43.930> your<00:02:44.020> redstone<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.740> run<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.950> around

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
grab your redstone just run it around

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.880 
grab your redstone just run it around
like<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.690> then<00:02:46.870> on<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.170> left-hand<00:02:47.500> side

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
like that so then on the left-hand side

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.500 
like that so then on the left-hand side
you<00:02:48.100> just<00:02:48.130> want<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.460> grab<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.820> block<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.270> put<00:02:49.420> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
you just want to grab a block and put it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.630 
you just want to grab a block and put it
like<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:50.080> piece<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.710> glowstone<00:02:51.160> there<00:02:51.460> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
like that a piece of glowstone there and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.490 
like that a piece of glowstone there and
then<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.910> block<00:02:52.210> on<00:02:52.420> top<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:52.840> piston<00:02:53.110> and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
then a block on top of this piston and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.400 
then a block on top of this piston and
then<00:02:53.920> just<00:02:54.100> run<00:02:54.310> blocks<00:02:54.610> out<00:02:54.910> here<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.960> then

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
then just run blocks out here and then

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.300 
then just run blocks out here and then
you<00:02:56.440> just<00:02:56.530> want<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.800> grab<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.980> piece<00:02:57.130> of

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
you just want to grab a piece of

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.920 
you just want to grab a piece of
redstone<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:58.120> run<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.300> over<00:02:58.480> like<00:02:58.720> that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
redstone and just run it over like that

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.070 
redstone and just run it over like that
and<00:02:59.170> into<00:02:59.740> this<00:02:59.950> block<00:03:00.250> here<00:03:00.460> so<00:03:01.080> now

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
and into this block here so now

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.200 
and into this block here so now
theoretically<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:03.220> should<00:03:03.400> have<00:03:03.610> all<00:03:03.910> of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
theoretically you should have all of

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.690 
theoretically you should have all of
your<00:03:04.390> first<00:03:04.750> block<00:03:05.080> retractions<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:06.010> there<00:03:06.550> we

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
your first block retractions so there we

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.420 
your first block retractions so there we
go<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.150> then<00:03:07.930> there<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.650> opening<00:03:09.160> all<00:03:09.370> a

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
go and then there is the opening all a

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.360 
go and then there is the opening all a
nice<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.270> synced<00:03:10.600> up<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.890> now<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.070> want<00:03:12.340> to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
nice and synced up so now you want to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.070 
nice and synced up so now you want to
map<00:03:12.580> out<00:03:12.790> your<00:03:12.820> double<00:03:13.270> piston<00:03:13.450> extenders<00:03:14.050> you

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
map out your double piston extenders you

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.550 
map out your double piston extenders you
just<00:03:14.410> from<00:03:14.560> one<00:03:14.800> on<00:03:14.980> either<00:03:15.430> side<00:03:15.610> like<00:03:16.150> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
just from one on either side like that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.690 
just from one on either side like that
so<00:03:17.560> now<00:03:17.680> for<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.950> first<00:03:18.160> double<00:03:18.550> piston

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
so now for the first double piston

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.130 
so now for the first double piston
extender<00:03:19.150> we're<00:03:19.360> going<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.540> be<00:03:19.630> working<00:03:19.870> on

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
extender we're going to be working on

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.170 
extender we're going to be working on
the<00:03:20.260> right<00:03:20.470> hand<00:03:20.740> side<00:03:20.860> from<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.730> front<00:03:21.970> of

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
the right hand side from the front of

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.730 
the right hand side from the front of
the<00:03:22.240> door<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:22.540> that's<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.930> side<00:03:23.140> without<00:03:23.320> all

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
the door so that's the side without all

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.890 
the door so that's the side without all
of<00:03:23.770> these<00:03:24.040> repeaters<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.550> things<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.180> what<00:03:25.870> I

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
of these repeaters and things and what I

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.990 
of these repeaters and things and what I
want<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.350> do<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.710> kick<00:03:26.950> things<00:03:27.160> off<00:03:27.460> is<00:03:27.760> to

redstone there sorry about that so now

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.250 
redstone there sorry about that so now
on<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.910> edge<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.450> torch<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:34.960> just<00:03:35.140> want

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
on the edge of this torch you just want

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.110 
on the edge of this torch you just want
to<00:03:35.320> put<00:03:35.470> two<00:03:35.650> blocks<00:03:35.770> like<00:03:36.070> this<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.490> piece<00:03:36.970> of

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
to put two blocks like this a piece of

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.910 
to put two blocks like this a piece of
redstone<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.780> repeater<00:03:38.110> set<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.710> two

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
redstone and a repeater set it to two

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.890 
redstone and a repeater set it to two
tix<00:03:39.250> blocks<00:03:39.850> running<00:03:40.120> around<00:03:40.210> like<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.720> and

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
tix blocks running around like that and

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.080 
tix blocks running around like that and
then<00:03:41.140> make<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.440> drop<00:03:41.800> down<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.070> level<00:03:42.280> here<00:03:42.700> and

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
then make it drop down a level here and

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.660 
then make it drop down a level here and
then<00:03:43.240> back<00:03:43.510> up<00:03:43.750> like<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:44.920> then<00:03:45.340> put<00:03:45.640> a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
then back up like so and then put a

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.940 
then back up like so and then put a
block<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.420> half<00:03:46.750> slab<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.320> then<00:03:47.470> make<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.680> run

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
block a half slab and then make it run

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.949 
block a half slab and then make it run
into<00:03:48.160> this<00:03:48.310> block<00:03:48.580> here<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.090> will<00:03:49.510> make<00:03:49.540> up

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
into this block here that will make up

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.810 
into this block here that will make up
at<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.230> wall<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.560> your<00:03:50.860> door<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.490> just<00:03:51.520> bear

that in mind
grab<00:03:52.959> some<00:03:53.170> redstone<00:03:53.350> just<00:03:53.830> right<00:03:53.950> around

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
grab some redstone just right around

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.340 
grab some redstone just right around
like<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.700> into<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.209> block<00:03:55.450> there<00:03:55.810> down

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
like this and into that block there down

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.960 
like this and into that block there down
here<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.830> just<00:03:56.950> want<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.160> put<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.430> block<00:03:57.730> and

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
here you just want to put a block and

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.910 
here you just want to put a block and
then<00:03:58.240> another<00:03:58.540> one<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.290> one<00:03:59.380> there

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
then another one like that and one there

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.310 
then another one like that and one there
with<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.400> repeater<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.120> set<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.480> four<00:04:01.990> ticks

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
with a repeater and set it to four ticks

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.590 
with a repeater and set it to four ticks
then<00:04:02.980> back<00:04:03.250> up<00:04:03.459> at<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.730> top<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.209> just<00:04:04.330> want<00:04:04.540> to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
then back up at the top you just want to

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.750 
then back up at the top you just want to
run<00:04:04.780> blocks<00:04:05.050> around<00:04:05.170> like<00:04:05.440> this<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.950> over

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
run blocks around like this and over

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.370 
run blocks around like this and over
like<00:04:06.910> that<00:04:07.240> and<00:04:07.420> then<00:04:07.660> grab<00:04:07.900> some<00:04:07.930> redstone

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
like that and then grab some redstone

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.770 
like that and then grab some redstone
just<00:04:08.890> run<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.100> round<00:04:09.360> repeater

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
just run it round repeater

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.170 
just run it round repeater
set<00:04:11.110> as<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> full<00:04:11.530> ticks<00:04:11.830> more<00:04:12.580> redstone<00:04:12.850> and

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
set as a full ticks more redstone and

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.510 
set as a full ticks more redstone and
then<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.690> fence<00:04:14.200> gate<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.680> cause<00:04:14.860> an<00:04:14.980> update<00:04:15.370> to

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
then a fence gate to cause an update to

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.820 
then a fence gate to cause an update to
this<00:04:15.640> piston<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.330> now<00:04:16.540> when<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.230> power<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.709> you

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
this piston so now when we power it you

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.830 
this piston so now when we power it you
will<00:04:17.980> see<00:04:18.190> we<00:04:18.400> get<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.700> double<00:04:19.060> extension<00:04:19.630> and

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
will see we get the double extension and

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.920 
will see we get the double extension and
the<00:04:20.650> retraction<00:04:21.100> which<00:04:21.430> is<00:04:21.580> wicked<00:04:21.910> so<00:04:22.810> on

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
the retraction which is wicked so on

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.270 
the retraction which is wicked so on
this<00:04:23.080> side<00:04:23.290> it<00:04:23.440> is<00:04:23.530> pretty<00:04:23.800> much<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.100> same

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
this side it is pretty much the same

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.590 
this side it is pretty much the same
story<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.760> just<00:04:24.820> want<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.120> put<00:04:25.270> two<00:04:25.479> blocks

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
story you just want to put two blocks

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.090 
story you just want to put two blocks
like<00:04:25.900> this<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.320> edge<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.680> redstone

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
like this on the edge of that redstone

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
like this on the edge of that redstone

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
dust repair set it to 2 ticks then just

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.189 
dust repair set it to 2 ticks then just
run<00:04:30.910> your<00:04:31.000> blocks<00:04:31.210> down<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.479> make<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.840> drop

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
even looks a little bit nicer than the

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.029 
even looks a little bit nicer than the
one<00:05:28.720> that<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.930> showed<00:05:29.139> earlier<00:05:29.350> I<00:05:29.680> seriously

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
one that I showed earlier I seriously

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.860 
one that I showed earlier I seriously
don't<00:05:30.310> know<00:05:30.430> how<00:05:30.699> because<00:05:30.940> it's<00:05:31.240> exactly<00:05:31.720> the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
don't know how because it's exactly the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.529 
don't know how because it's exactly the
same<00:05:32.080> maybe<00:05:32.740> it's<00:05:33.039> like<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.280> chunk<00:05:33.700> faced<00:05:34.060> quark

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539
