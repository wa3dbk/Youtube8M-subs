00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello and welcome to my channel 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.279
 well-being physio intox and regeneration 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.830
 as you can see 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.389
 today at fishing I have the potato 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.580
 I would say even if the one displayed the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.900
 panade now that I made the wave 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.889
 the most rotten of all the earth I 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.140
 think I'll be able to talk to you about 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.119
 this fabulous fruit already is what you 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.920
 know that this food plant is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.470
 the first that was grown by 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640
 the man 2000 years ago and that makes 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.010
 only a little more than one 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.970
 century that it is imported into France by 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.520
 french antilles 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.020
 Guadeloupe Martinique 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.149
 mainly we eat about 12 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.980
 kilos per person per year this is our 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.719
 favorite fruit after the apple then 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.920
 the phrase have banana one comes from 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.440
 obviously the shape of our mouth 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 when we smile or then the shape of a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.379
 other male organs that expresses his 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 contentment when he sees a woman 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.520
 but I will spare you the details 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.199
 little pervert goes but what am I 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 sure is that banana has 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 immense virtues and in particular that of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.109
 help you fight depression 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.510
 why why depression has nothing 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.969
 to see alas here because banana 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 contains tryptophan tryptophan 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.510
 are amino acids that are 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.180
 synthesized by our neurons for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.409
 manufacture serotonin and 7 serotonin 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.600
 is known to be an excellent 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 more natural relaxing helping to 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.659
 regulate our blood coagulation 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.100
 you know for example that aspirin 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.020
 is an anticoagulant that helps us to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.610
 fight against migraines and bah then 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 the ball to the water if small months 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 when you're stressed do not tell me that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.560
 you 're never stressed there's a whole 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.159
 neighbor a boss or a beautiful mother who 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.509
 you take the lead 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.369
 and when in our body reacts to 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.650
 stress is well the pulse is accelerating 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.689
 our breath is cut off and inevitably 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.280
 oxygen less well your brain and for 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.829
 that was bothering our brain properly 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.590
 is the body well draws in a mineral 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.979
 which is called potassium and you know 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.060
 not what 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.130
 it's one of the richest fruits in 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.630
 potassium not fabulous his conclusion 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.700
 it's in bus tapeta beautiful mother ton 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.409
 boss your neighbor you breathe and you 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.909
 eat a banana is in any case 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.439
 it's better than antidepressants and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.210
 like all those fabulous fruits that 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.799
 grow on our planet earth the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.869
 banana is an antioxidant 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.540
 but then an antioxidant knows what in 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.850
 big knee schematizes our body it is 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.110
 made of cells 1 and 2 molecules and 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.500
 molecules are formed with 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.970
 atoms and all at all 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.710
 chemistry it's all a little boring 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.090
 but basically what to remember is 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.430
 that the molecule of times she loses a 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.790
 oxygen atom and then there she fartes a 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.100
 cable 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.330
 she twists the girl she shit all 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.860
 the world after she will fetch all 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.600
 the other molecules and she tries to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.770
 to graze oxygen atoms right 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.910
 on the left and that's what we will call 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.709
 free radicals 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.540
 and to counteract these 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.760
 free radicals it takes antioxidants 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.459
 and banana contains antioxidants 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.260
 which are vitamin c is dopamine 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.360
 and 7 dopamine besides being a 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.459
 very powerful antioxidant it's a 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.720
 neurotransmitter that helps regulate 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.660
 our motivation 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.540
 our movement our coordination and 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.730
 our muscular power 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.170
 just that and yeah but it's not over 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.890
 because in addition to containing the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.900
 vitamin C 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.120
 banana contains mostly 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.120
 vitamin B and especially a quarter of 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.800
 daily needs of vitamin b6 this 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.959
 Vitamin intervenes in the metabolism 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.239
 lipid proteins and 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.220
 carbs and she's going to favor the 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.350
 production of some of retransmitter 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.300
 which both should talk about there 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.989
 are related to mood and dopamine 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.209
 serotonin 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.130
 it's a work of equipped and to finish 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.110
 in beauty of course the banana contains 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.730
 a lot of fiber like all 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.650
 plants for that matter 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.000
 move fibers when you eat by 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.370
 example are some food residues 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.100
 sticks to the walls of your intestines 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.690
 and fiber is what it is 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.519
 ballet and ben it will alleviate the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.850
 intestines and all the toxins that are going 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.560
 with 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.900
 and yes they have strong fibers 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.180
 ability to retain water particles 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.610
 and so that's going to regulate the consistency and 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.260
 the volume of vaucelles her ease all 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.850
 intestinal transit so more than 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.980
 diarrhea more constipation you sink 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.540
 these are the main virtues of the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.400
 walk without forgetting of course she is 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.350
 rich in phosphorus and phosphorus we 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.640
 allows us to stay focused 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.380
 alert and alert 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.910
 intellectually it also contains 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.350
 many carbohydrates and 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.480
 carbon sheets sealed sugar 1 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.049
 mainly and sugar and what is 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.000
 our fuel 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.200
 it is necessary to consume and there it is a good 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.459
 fuel is a good sugar that is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.299
 directly assimilated by our 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.100
 organization 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.440
 unlike all its very sugars 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.820
 very very fast and very refined that 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.200
 make mass industries 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.010
 that is to say the chocolate bars the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.080
 marseillais real yesterday 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.120
 viennoiseries and all that so go for it 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.329
 for banana my next video 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.220
 will be called the dukan diet or storytelling 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.840
 I invite you to react in the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.180
 comments and to give your opinion on 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.300
 this next topic of course secular and 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.960
 subscribe to the chain and take care 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.960
 from you ciao
