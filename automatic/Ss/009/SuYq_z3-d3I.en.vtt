00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.259 
for in apartments and that's impact
sound<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:10.950> impact<00:03:11.370> sound<00:03:11.640> will<00:03:11.849> be<00:03:11.940> described

Jim<00:03:41.579> is<00:03:41.730> found<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.120> Pat's<00:03:42.390> house<00:03:42.659> does

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
Jim is found that Pat's house does

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.869 
Jim is found that Pat's house does
comply<00:03:43.560> with<00:03:43.769> building<00:03:44.099> regulations

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
comply with building regulations

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.479 
comply with building regulations
so<00:03:45.510> how<00:03:45.659> come<00:03:45.870> Pat<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.440> his<00:03:46.590> neighbors<00:03:47.040> can

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
so how come Pat and his neighbors can

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.490 
so how come Pat and his neighbors can
still<00:03:47.790> hear<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.450> much<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:48.810> each<00:03:48.900> other's<00:03:49.230> lives

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
still hear so much of each other's lives

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.259

itself<00:05:35.180> right<00:05:35.539> so<00:05:35.870> much<00:05:36.169> you<00:05:36.259> do<00:05:36.409> basically

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
itself right so much you do basically

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.369 
itself right so much you do basically
over<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.639> force<00:05:37.909> procedure<00:05:38.240> would<00:05:38.479> be<00:05:38.629> as<00:05:38.990> I

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:39.379 
over the force procedure would be as I

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:40.869 
over the force procedure would be as I
said<00:05:39.560> clean<00:05:39.800> off<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.039> world<00:05:40.219> prepare<00:05:40.759> the

said clean off the world prepare the

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.459 
said clean off the world prepare the
wall<00:05:41.030> if<00:05:41.210> there's<00:05:41.389> any<00:05:41.509> obvious<00:05:41.690> defects<00:05:42.259> to

wall if there's any obvious defects to
remedy<00:05:42.949> them<00:05:43.159> and<00:05:43.430> then<00:05:44.330> basically<00:05:44.690> we<00:05:44.900> use

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
remedy them and then basically we use

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.719 
remedy them and then basically we use
