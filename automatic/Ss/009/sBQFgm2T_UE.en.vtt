00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.060 

was<00:01:22.330> good<00:01:22.510> as<00:01:22.690> Asia<00:01:22.930> back<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.860> studio

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
was good as Asia back in the studio

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.560 
was good as Asia back in the studio
giving<00:01:24.850> my<00:01:25.000> thoughts<00:01:25.300> on<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.990> kobe<00:01:26.350> 8<00:01:26.380> system

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
giving my thoughts on the kobe 8 system

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.750 
giving my thoughts on the kobe 8 system
like<00:01:28.570> i<00:01:28.720> said<00:01:28.780> they<00:01:29.170> went<00:01:29.350> with<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.860> new<00:01:30.280> upper

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
like i said they went with the new upper

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.260 
like i said they went with the new upper
the<00:01:31.480> engineered<00:01:32.050> mesh<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.820> held<00:01:34.090> up

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
the engineered mesh and it held up

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.270 
the engineered mesh and it held up
really<00:01:34.540> well<00:01:34.690> you<00:01:35.410> would<00:01:35.560> think<00:01:35.710> it'd<00:01:35.920> be<00:01:35.950> kind

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
really well you would think it'd be kind

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.950 
really well you would think it'd be kind
of<00:01:36.400> flimsy<00:01:36.640> but<00:01:37.300> it<00:01:37.420> was<00:01:37.510> pretty<00:01:37.690> good<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
of flimsy but it was pretty good and it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.200 
of flimsy but it was pretty good and it
gave<00:01:40.960> great<00:01:41.410> breathability<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.400> it<00:01:43.090> was

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
gave great breathability and it was

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.390 
gave great breathability and it was
really<00:01:43.510> nice<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:44.590> second<00:01:44.860> thing<00:01:44.950> I'd<00:01:45.100> like<00:01:45.130> to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
really nice the second thing I'd like to

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.280 
really nice the second thing I'd like to
touch<00:01:45.580> on<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.090> flexibility<00:01:46.750> which<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.110> just

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
touch on is the flexibility which I just

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.010 
touch on is the flexibility which I just
showed<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.500> little<00:01:47.650> as<00:01:47.980> you<00:01:48.280> can<00:01:48.460> see<00:01:49.020> really

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
showed a little as you can see really

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.280 
showed a little as you can see really
flexible<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.970> was<00:01:52.120> really<00:01:52.330> nice<00:01:52.630> give<00:01:53.260> a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
flexible and that was really nice give a

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.050 
flexible and that was really nice give a
nice<00:01:53.530> one<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.950> one<00:01:54.100> fit<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:54.730> you<00:01:54.820> would<00:01:55.030> think

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
nice one to one fit so you would think

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.480 
nice one to one fit so you would think
that<00:01:55.480> it<00:01:56.140> wouldn't<00:01:56.560> be<00:01:56.680> really<00:01:56.950> nice<00:01:57.130> sort<00:01:57.400> of

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
that it wouldn't be really nice sort of

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.160 
that it wouldn't be really nice sort of
like<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.640> running<00:01:58.030> shoe<00:01:58.240> but<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.690> actually<00:01:58.870> had

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
like a running shoe but it actually had

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.110 
like a running shoe but it actually had
a<00:01:59.200> really<00:01:59.290> great<00:01:59.650> support<00:02:00.160> as<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.730> can<00:02:00.880> see

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
a really great support as you can see

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.110 
a really great support as you can see
the<00:02:01.270> heel<00:02:01.480> cup<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.990> back<00:02:02.820> okay<00:02:03.820> great

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
the heel cup in the back okay great

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.170 
the heel cup in the back okay great
lockdown<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.110> if<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.830> like<00:02:06.040> sum<00:02:06.250> up<00:02:06.460> all<00:02:06.730> the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
lockdown and if you like sum up all the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.370 
lockdown and if you like sum up all the
way<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.570> tight<00:02:08.430> it'll<00:02:09.430> be<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.580> 1<00:02:10.230> next<00:02:11.230> thing

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
way and tight it'll be a 1 next thing

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.160 
way and tight it'll be a 1 next thing
the<00:02:11.890> traction<00:02:12.340> pattern<00:02:12.520> as<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.570> know<00:02:13.750> they

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the traction pattern as you know they

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.010 
the traction pattern as you know they
have<00:02:14.440> herringbone<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.150> storytelling

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
have herringbone and then storytelling

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.810 
have herringbone and then storytelling
and<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:19.030> was<00:02:19.300> really<00:02:19.960> good<00:02:20.290> honestly<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.280> had

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
and that was really good honestly I had

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.510 
and that was really good honestly I had
no<00:02:22.180> grip<00:02:22.780> slips<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.440> um<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.760> great<00:02:25.030> um<00:02:26.520> so

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
no grip slips and um this is great um so

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.960 
no grip slips and um this is great um so
yeah<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.120> traction<00:02:28.600> was<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.959> one<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:30.430> probably

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
yeah the traction was a one you probably

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.690 
yeah the traction was a one you probably
won't<00:02:31.420> slip<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:31.990> nice<00:02:32.260> clean<00:02:32.650> floor<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.340> it's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
won't slip on a nice clean floor if it's

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.490 
won't slip on a nice clean floor if it's
a<00:02:33.790> little<00:02:33.910> dusty<00:02:34.240> he'll<00:02:34.690> slip<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.020> little<00:02:35.140> bit

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
a little dusty he'll slip a little bit

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.650 
a little dusty he'll slip a little bit
much<00:02:35.830> just<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.670> couple<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.030> swipes<00:02:37.209> like<00:02:37.510> we

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
much just a couple of swipes like we

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.740 
much just a couple of swipes like we
always<00:02:37.810> do<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.620> you'll<00:02:38.830> be<00:02:38.980> good<00:02:39.190> um<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.510> next

thing<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.959> wanted<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.410> touch<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.800> was<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
thing I wanted to touch on was the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.960 
thing I wanted to touch on was the
tongue<00:02:42.520> it's<00:02:43.120> really<00:02:43.630> thin<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:45.280> as<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.850> can

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
tongue it's really thin but as you can

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.090 
tongue it's really thin but as you can
see<00:02:46.209> there's<00:02:46.420> holes<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.410> gave<00:02:47.800> great

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
see there's holes so that gave great

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.860 
see there's holes so that gave great
breathability<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.200> um<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:51.489> was<00:02:51.640> nice<00:02:51.880> last

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
breathability and um that was nice last

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.240 
breathability and um that was nice last
thing<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.920> know<00:02:54.070> this<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.700> nike+<00:02:55.570> and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
thing is you know this is a nike+ and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.360 
thing is you know this is a nike+ and
with<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:58.390> was<00:02:58.660> pretty<00:02:59.380> good<00:02:59.680> what's<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
with that it was pretty good what's the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.510 
with that it was pretty good what's the
nike+<00:03:00.940> worth<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.480> no<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.770> don't<00:03:02.980> think<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.340> was

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
nike+ worth it no I don't think it was

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.300 
nike+ worth it no I don't think it was
but<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.050> was<00:03:05.050> still<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> great<00:03:05.680> experience<00:03:06.250> to

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
but it was still a great experience to

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.160 
but it was still a great experience to
try<00:03:06.670> but<00:03:07.540> uh<00:03:07.600> yeah<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.950> read<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.910> shoe<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.540> 10

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170

try but uh yeah I read this shoe a 10
out<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.380> 10<00:03:11.530> honestly<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:13.060> was<00:03:13.209> probably<00:03:13.660> one

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
out of 10 honestly it was probably one

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.930 
out of 10 honestly it was probably one
