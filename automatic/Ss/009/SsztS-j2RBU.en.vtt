00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.969
 hello and welcome people too 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.540
 a new combination on the small 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.160
 channel 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.160
 yes i have a little topic today 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.809
 tackled the whole gaming 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.089
 supporting things especially things 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.980
 the person an advantageous 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.750
 against the adversaries, especially those 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.920
 tv of services i mean the ones with the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.950
 worst pipes all over 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.950
 world 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.450
 and there I grabbed the things 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.740
 a bit yes everyone knows the man 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.110
 maybe even at home and has 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.330
 then maybe they are not 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.430
 everyone had one or the other too 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.640
 yes, this possible could say that too 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.080
 use is just shit or something 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.420
 So first I would have been there 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.290
 everyone has monument or almost everyone 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.790
 nowadays already a headset's halt 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.420
 a big difference I'm talking now 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.220
 really just from gaming headset 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.329
 Now just to add the game 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.300
 Sound is listening or 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.860
 redmond opponent hears if they load after 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.510
 they just throw a grenade or 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.440
 just the steps or if there is one 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.149
 defuse the bomb 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.770
 That's what you get with a gamer headset 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.750
 just a lot better than 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.930
 through the speakers from the television 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.130
 or through the boxes as the second hettich 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.360
 the energy drink may as well 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.220
 you know that you are a bit 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.479
 lethargic one does not get high and so and so 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.840
 then gamble and then you get on 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.360
 the eggs 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.270
 when it comes to concentrated trick and pure 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.670
 you shoot brother yes you just have 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.110
 I can take all the people away from me 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.400
 I would not do that very well 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.320
 high up in the training run s eye 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.400
 this has now tinted against the pervert 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.810
 as it should but does not matter 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.220
 as a third I would have monitor 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.010
 monitors are simply has these things 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.360
 one has connected his pc 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.160
 advantage the connection between 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.930
 controller and monitor is just a lot 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.180
 better with is called the reaction time 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.640
 shorter was a monitor than one 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.930
 TV also has a very large 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 advantage if you are simply faster 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.560
 very easily 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.840
 and then I packed some things 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.430
 now maybe one way or the other 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.530
 not a year only me and so on 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.880
 are open to banks 10 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.590
 because i just think it's very 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.360
 interesting what the gaming industry is doing 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.700
 Everything develops and so and yes I think 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.730
 the simple reason exciting and the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.560
 the theme of the face is first 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.620
 I would have primary school as a controller 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.540
 the controllers are the panels on the bottom 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.340
 Now let's take the xbox 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.950
 controller 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.270
 walter i have that in the eye shit 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:46.580
 I could cut it out now I do it 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:49.790
 but it does not continue to be true though 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.430
 the account let the xbox controller 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.560
 Now take the battery compartment away from 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.960
 put two small panels there 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.700
 panels replace the buttons on top 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.800
 the xbox and in meaning 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.880
 however, they only replace two buttons that 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.400
 can you then select if you 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.470
 You also ordered to say good 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.350
 I also want a small panel 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.230
 So a button customer or b 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.970
 or both or just xy so far then 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.640
 no matter 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.530
 that has the advantage that if you now 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.880
 want to mess with someone else yes 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.320
 Now let's do it with tactics 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.870
 if someone now mess it up with b 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.550
 then you have to thumb that you on the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.440
 right stick no longer fits beer 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.180
 but can live with it 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.720
 hand or middle finger easy b 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.280
 press or if you want to jump you 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.810
 you're just a lot faster then that 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.720
 It brings a lot 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.370
 that brings a lot I have myself 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.290
 ever played with such a thing that 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.590
 is really blatant so you think if you are 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.820
 needs must as one is to be in it 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.410
 But the reaction time is so much 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.690
 faster with the things than the real one 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.570
 unbelievable mannheim has the opponents real 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.640
 away so and all the time is from this 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.210
 controversial things I still have fps 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.920
 freaks fbs freaks are such sticks 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.960
 extension I say now times the 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.300
 are you sticking to your normal sticks 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.370
 it 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.770
 and then the dig is longer and has 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.120
 a better grip the extended 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.900
 stick has the advantage that you just 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.330
 can use a low level because 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.160
 by tilting so I guess 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.080
 Everyone had the leverage now 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.630
 top right in the picture of this thing then 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.540
 I'll let them know what I mean 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.580
 I have to explain then as a third 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.670
 We gamer grip gamer grip is a kind 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.710
 or seemed or or hand cream the one 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.460
 on the hand more at the whole 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.740
 Sniper very popular because it keeps number 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.140
 One's hands were always two like that 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.570
 name already says it has increased grip control 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.250
 means you do not slip so easily 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.230
 the sticks or the buttons or 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.800
 hold a general from the controller 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.890
 you do not slip off is as I said 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.200
 very popular with snipers because yes 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.150
 ever with cold hands the sniper 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.090
 that's really there it just does 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.990
 shit you meet nothing like that 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.990
 fourth 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.630
 in april i have exactly the same gamer 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.669
 Brake eyeglasses with an orange foil 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.990
 this has the advantage that the eyes are not 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.000
 get tired while gambling and it 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.080
 makes the picture more contrast means one 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.330
 the opponents see better 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.130
 I think that's a very good thing because 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.620
 I know that myself after three 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.300
 four hours are gambling 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.550
 ever very tired and you get 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.319
 headache and so now who 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.270
 itself says good I get very often 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.590
 headache while buying in the gamble 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.449
 you have such glasses it is worth it 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.550
 I really have those with myself 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.570
 look gizmos I played had the 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.280
 mostly of these things I now 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.910
 enumerate yourself already tried 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.710
 So I know what I'm talking about the things 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.590
 bring yourself a headache 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.220
 not for that and as a fifth 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.020
 I have the 44 is a very good one 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.180
 Energy drink in my opinion and 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.550
 Although you just tilts the stuff in the 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.919
 water shook parma and there they 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.210
 in different tastes 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.080
 janka not just so long 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.750
 Buy drink 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.639
 no that's not the same as much 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.590
 only has six calories 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.539
 you have to give that to yourself so I am 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.900
 now always as asparagus arrives to me 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.090
 be okay yes I clear but if you 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.580
 now so normal red bull next 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.979
 because times look how much calories it has 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.740
 that's extremely how much gram a10 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.349
 calories per energy drink so worth it 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.219
 Really so, even if my little one 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:35.320
 interruptions 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:36.789
 the whole is of course a lot of style and 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.349
 certainly not written down to me 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.300
 If I forgot something I'm sorry 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.710
 and so yes, of course I hope that 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.479
 Cabaret you like if yes 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.969
 a thumbs up if there is one 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.320
 a thumb down 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:51.000
 See you next time as 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.000
