that<00:00:29.070> slow<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.550> actually<00:00:30.000> fast<00:00:30.289> but<00:00:31.289> sometimes

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
that slow is actually fast but sometimes

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.310 
that slow is actually fast but sometimes
it<00:00:32.040> doesn't<00:00:32.250> react<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> touch<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:34.050> don't

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
it doesn't react to the touch I don't

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.700 
it doesn't react to the touch I don't
exactly<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:35.070> why<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.200> works

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
exactly know why but it's it works

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.950

like<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.100> weird<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:52.500> assume<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.280> someone

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
like it's weird I assume if someone

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.939 
like it's weird I assume if someone
would<00:00:53.789> love<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.390> pick<00:00:54.480> us<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:55.890> I

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
again I got out of that here we go see

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.359 
again I got out of that here we go see
you<00:01:21.150> only<00:01:21.299> click<00:01:21.869> certain<00:01:22.409> tabs<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.159> certain

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you only click certain tabs and certain

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.929 
you only click certain tabs and certain
times<00:01:24.020> it's<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.439> weird<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.729> works

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
times it's really weird but it it works

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.440 
times it's really weird but it it works
perfectly<00:01:27.600> when<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.229> assume<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> bit<00:01:29.520> doesn't

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
perfectly when I assume is a bit doesn't

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.260 
perfectly when I assume is a bit doesn't
work<00:01:30.600> perfectly<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:32.130> works<00:01:32.310> decently<00:01:32.759> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
work perfectly but it works decently I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
work perfectly but it works decently I
guess<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> side<00:01:34.350> views<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:34.950> do

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
guess the side views you can do

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.740 
guess the side views you can do
categories<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> sources<00:01:36.630> while<00:01:37.470> um<00:01:38.750> portrait

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
categories and sources while um portrait

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.749 
categories and sources while um portrait
you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:41.119> nothing<00:01:45.290> yeah<00:01:46.290> well<00:01:46.950> it's

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you can do nothing yeah well it's

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.109 
you can do nothing yeah well it's
glitchy<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:49.220> neighbors<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.729> search

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
glitchy and neighbors I can search

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.460 
glitchy and neighbors I can search
sources<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.750> stuff<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.439> anything

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
sources and stuff like I can do anything

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.240 
sources and stuff like I can do anything
I<00:01:52.890> wanted<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.970> regular<00:01:54.509> icing<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:56.070> there

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
I wanted with the regular icing so there
