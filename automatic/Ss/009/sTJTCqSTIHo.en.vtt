grippy material it does definitely feel
not<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.079> you're<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.710> drop<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.189> ever

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you that how you take the case apart in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.240 
you that how you take the case apart in
a<00:02:00.030> second<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:01.439> piece<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.130> is

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
a second on this piece here this is

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.060 
a second on this piece here this is
where<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.520> put<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.119> wrist<00:02:03.360> strap<00:02:03.659> on

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
where you put the little wrist strap on

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
where you put the little wrist strap on
this<00:02:05.070> side<00:02:05.310> they've<00:02:05.579> sealed<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.600> vibrate

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
this side they've sealed the vibrate

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.330 
this side they've sealed the vibrate
switch<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:08.069> there's<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
switch and you can see there's a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.809 
switch and you can see there's a
significant<00:02:08.970> gap<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:10.459> there's<00:02:11.459> quite<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
significant gap in there there's quite a

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.940 
significant gap in there there's quite a
distance<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.750> between<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.379> switch

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
distance in there between that switch

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.350 
distance in there between that switch
and<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.340> makes<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:14.910> bit<00:02:15.120> difficult

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and that makes it a little bit difficult

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.449 
and that makes it a little bit difficult
to<00:02:15.750> operate<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.650> kind<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.010> really

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
to operate you kind of have to really

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.550 
to operate you kind of have to really
push<00:02:18.000> your<00:02:18.180> finger<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.660> there<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.870> get<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.319> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
push your finger in there to get that to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.830 
push your finger in there to get that to
to<00:02:19.920> move<00:02:20.069> over<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.090> definitely<00:02:21.239> makes<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to move over so it definitely makes a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.030 
to move over so it definitely makes a
difference<00:02:21.870> there<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.650> feels<00:02:22.920> like

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
difference there but this feels like

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.430 
difference there but this feels like
it's<00:02:23.280> pretty<00:02:23.459> secure<00:02:23.760> your<00:02:24.720> volume<00:02:25.140> buttons

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
it's pretty secure your volume buttons

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.559 
it's pretty secure your volume buttons
are<00:02:25.590> pretty<00:02:25.860> easy<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.220> push<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.849> then<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
are pretty easy to push and then on the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.910 
are pretty easy to push and then on the
back<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.110> nice<00:02:28.230> cutout<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
back you have a nice cutout for the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.760 
back you have a nice cutout for the
camera<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.610> your<00:02:30.150> dual<00:02:30.690> LED<00:02:31.110> flash<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.650> it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
camera and your dual LED flash and it

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.460 
camera and your dual LED flash and it
works<00:02:31.980> well<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> bottom<00:02:33.390> these<00:02:34.050> ports

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
works well now on the bottom these ports

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.100 
works well now on the bottom these ports
are<00:02:34.650> covered<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:36.120> splash<00:02:36.510> proof<00:02:36.810> like

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
are covered so it is splash proof like

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.130 
are covered so it is splash proof like
it<00:02:37.230> said<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.730> does<00:02:39.000> degrade<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.690> sound<00:02:39.959> a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
it said and it does degrade the sound a

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780 
it said and it does degrade the sound a
little<00:02:40.290> bit<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.890> not<00:02:41.100> as<00:02:41.310> bad<00:02:41.430> as<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.730> think

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
little bit it's not as bad as I think

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.430 
little bit it's not as bad as I think
and<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.450> as<00:02:42.600> bad<00:02:42.750> as<00:02:42.870> some<00:02:43.019> other<00:02:43.170> cases

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and that as bad as some other cases

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.910 
and that as bad as some other cases
either

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
either

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.850 
either
I<00:02:43.980> tried<00:02:44.220> music<00:02:44.640> with<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> audio<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:46.410> it

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
I tried music with it and audio and it

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.590 
I tried music with it and audio and it
sounded<00:02:47.250> ok<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:47.760> sounded<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.390> turn

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
sounded ok it just sounded like you turn

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600 
sounded ok it just sounded like you turn
the<00:02:48.750> volume<00:02:48.780> down<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.290> little<00:02:49.500> bit<00:02:49.739> same<00:02:50.370> goes

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the volume down a little bit same goes

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.910 
the volume down a little bit same goes
for<00:02:50.640> up<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.209> as<00:02:51.690> well<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> bottom

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
for up here as well now on the bottom

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.289 
for up here as well now on the bottom

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
you can see there's a nice cutouts for

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.670 
you can see there's a nice cutouts for
everything<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.049> easy<00:02:55.380> enough<00:02:55.620> to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
everything and this is easy enough to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.009 
everything and this is easy enough to
just<00:02:55.830> push<00:02:56.190> back<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.610> place<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.120> really

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
just push back in place and really

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.840 
just push back in place and really

one one two and there we go you have to

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.229 
one one two and there we go you have to
push<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> little<00:03:16.739> bit<00:03:17.280> harder<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.670> get<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.030> to

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
push a little bit harder to get that to

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.660 
push a little bit harder to get that to
work<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:19.019> that's<00:03:19.230> something<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.769> note<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
work so that's something to note the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.870 
work so that's something to note the
voice<00:03:20.880> does<00:03:21.180> work<00:03:21.420> well<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.660> did<00:03:21.959> test<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.880> hi

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
voice does work well I did test that hi

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.710 
voice does work well I did test that hi

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
how are you today

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.370 
how are you today
question<00:03:25.260> mark<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.840> see<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.170> works

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
question mark you can see that works

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.289 
question mark you can see that works
okay<00:03:28.769> no<00:03:29.010> problems<00:03:29.400> there

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
okay no problems there

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.849 
okay no problems there
the<00:03:30.570> biggest<00:03:30.810> problem<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.320> right<00:03:31.500> along<00:03:31.709> this

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
the biggest problem is right along this

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.490 
the biggest problem is right along this
edge<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.489> can<00:03:32.940> pull<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.390> down<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.959> slide<00:03:34.290> up

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
edge you can pull this down and slide up

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.590 
edge you can pull this down and slide up
we'll<00:03:35.160> get<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.640> screen<00:03:35.910> here<00:03:36.090> can

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
we'll get out of this screen here can

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.449 
we'll get out of this screen here can
slide<00:03:36.900> up<00:03:37.079> from<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.320> bottom<00:03:37.410> with<00:03:37.859> no<00:03:37.980> problem

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
slide up from the bottom with no problem

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.640 
slide up from the bottom with no problem
it's<00:03:39.209> just<00:03:39.480> these<00:03:39.630> edges<00:03:40.019> like<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.260> said<00:03:40.500> but

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
it's just these edges like I said but

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.470 
it's just these edges like I said but
touch<00:03:40.829> sensitivity<00:03:41.310> seems<00:03:41.730> pretty<00:03:42.030> good<00:03:42.239> and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
touch sensitivity seems pretty good and

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.120 
touch sensitivity seems pretty good and
I<00:03:42.570> almost<00:03:42.750> thought<00:03:43.200> at<00:03:43.440> first<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.920> was<00:03:44.100> a

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
I almost thought at first this was a

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.009 
I almost thought at first this was a
glass<00:03:44.459> screen<00:03:44.640> protector<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:45.450> it's<00:03:45.570> not<00:03:45.750> so

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
glass screen protector but it's not so

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.900 
glass screen protector but it's not so
let's<00:03:46.200> take<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.560> case<00:03:46.829> apart<00:03:47.130> now<00:03:47.790> they

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
let's take this case apart now they

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.550 
let's take this case apart now they
should<00:03:48.150> include<00:03:48.480> some<00:03:48.540> better<00:03:48.930> instructions

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
should include some better instructions

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.030 
should include some better instructions
on<00:03:49.680> how<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.859> do<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.530> little<00:03:52.829> bit

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
on how to do that and it is a little bit

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.099 
on how to do that and it is a little bit
difficult<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.579> pull<00:03:53.820> apart<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.299> can<00:03:54.420> see<00:03:54.690> I'm

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
difficult to pull apart you can see I'm

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.809 
difficult to pull apart you can see I'm
just<00:03:55.170> kind<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.590> forcing<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.250> off<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.609> back

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
just kind of forcing it off the back

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.620 
just kind of forcing it off the back
here<00:04:00.410> it's<00:04:01.410> not<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.980> easiest<00:04:02.310> case<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:03.420> pull

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
here it's not the easiest case to pull

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.500 
here it's not the easiest case to pull
apart<00:04:03.720> there<00:04:04.260> we<00:04:04.410> go<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.910> can<00:04:05.970> see<00:04:06.090> what<00:04:06.420> you

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
apart there we go you can see what you

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.599 
apart there we go you can see what you
do<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:06.989> put<00:04:07.170> your<00:04:07.290> phone<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.069> front<00:04:08.400> of

way around it's all sealed and there you
have<00:04:58.110> it<00:04:58.289> now<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.490> screen<00:04:59.759> protector<00:04:59.939> is

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
have it now the the screen protector is

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.869 
have it now the the screen protector is
not<00:05:00.689> to<00:05:01.110> fingerprint<00:05:01.770> proof<00:05:02.009> I<00:05:02.279> do<00:05:02.370> have<00:05:02.669> some

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
not to fingerprint proof I do have some

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.459 
not to fingerprint proof I do have some
problems<00:05:03.090> with<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.599> that<00:05:04.139> I've<00:05:04.259> noticed

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:04.469 
problems with that that I've noticed

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:06.559 
problems with that that I've noticed
there's<00:05:05.219> been<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.430> lot<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.639> fingerprints<00:05:06.180> on<00:05:06.389> it

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
there's been a lot of fingerprints on it

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.490 
there's been a lot of fingerprints on it
and<00:05:06.889> it's<00:05:07.889> probably<00:05:08.699> like<00:05:09.419> any<00:05:09.599> other<00:05:09.840> plastic

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
and it's probably like any other plastic

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.890 
and it's probably like any other plastic
screen<00:05:10.740> protector<00:05:10.800> but<00:05:11.580> overall<00:05:11.969> there<00:05:12.569> is<00:05:12.599> no

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
screen protector but overall there is no

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.830 
screen protector but overall there is no
real<00:05:13.740> gap<00:05:14.069> between<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.759> screen<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.539> the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
real gap between the screen and the

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.029 
real gap between the screen and the
screen<00:05:15.930> protector<00:05:16.229> so<00:05:16.650> that's<00:05:16.800> pretty

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
screen protector so that's pretty

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.559 
screen protector so that's pretty
important<00:05:17.520> compared<00:05:17.849> to<00:05:17.909> some<00:05:18.150> others<00:05:18.389> out

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
important compared to some others out

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.350 
important compared to some others out
there<00:05:18.599> and<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.979> actually<00:05:20.189> like<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.819> after<00:05:21.029> I've

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
there and I actually like it after I've

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.379 
there and I actually like it after I've
used<00:05:21.389> it<00:05:21.810> for<00:05:21.839> a<00:05:22.110> full<00:05:22.589> day<00:05:22.830> had<00:05:23.789> no<00:05:23.969> problems

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
used it for a full day had no problems

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.600 
used it for a full day had no problems
with<00:05:24.569> it<00:05:24.689> and<00:05:24.779> it<00:05:24.900> feels<00:05:25.169> nice<00:05:25.499> like<00:05:26.490> you're

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
with it and it feels nice like you're

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.640 
with it and it feels nice like you're
not<00:05:26.729> going<00:05:26.939> to<00:05:27.120> harm<00:05:27.360> your<00:05:27.539> phone<00:05:27.779> ever<00:05:28.110> now

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
not going to harm your phone ever now

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.439 
not going to harm your phone ever now
obviously<00:05:29.069> if<00:05:29.159> we<00:05:29.249> dropped<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.759> directly<00:05:30.240> on

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
obviously if we dropped it directly on

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.329 
obviously if we dropped it directly on
the<00:05:30.599> screen<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.139> it<00:05:31.469> would<00:05:31.589> probably<00:05:31.830> crack

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:32.339 
the screen and it would probably crack

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.249 
the screen and it would probably crack
it<00:05:32.550> but<00:05:32.759> anywhere<00:05:33.419> else<00:05:33.629> you'll<00:05:33.810> probably<00:05:33.990> be

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
it but anywhere else you'll probably be

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.110 
it but anywhere else you'll probably be
okay<00:05:34.289> I'd<00:05:35.159> be<00:05:35.279> curious<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.759> hear<00:05:35.879> what<00:05:35.939> you
