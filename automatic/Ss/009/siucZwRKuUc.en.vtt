00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.720
 arriving at the taps of rua gomes 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.980

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.080
 dog 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.750
 Then when I turn on the tap, feel a 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 bad smell and dark water so I picked one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.900
 bottle 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510

 in the same kitchen many people from street 2 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.080

 I had to take my son to the hospital. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 He is 15 years old and he got to stay there. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.399
 some areas the mother of this teacher 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.180

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.110
 Been 88 years on top of a bed 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 diarrhea to drink coconut water in order to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.030
 improved since the second when the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.940
 problem the residents are spending with 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.280
 mineral water do not buy bottled water 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.829
 tried to wash the dishes with and despite 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.020
 everything still skal of the water around there 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.660
 to warm up the dishes but I 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.180
 I think the books morumbi things 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.090
 the neighbor is also suffering from 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.970
 cleaning the cistern and got all dirty 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.119
 Calling you a professional prepared 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.760
 my cistern that caused the rust 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.820
 it's all dirty rust both here in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.590
 as the top box there is no way to 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.659
 not compare the sewer that is 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.090
 here in the middle of the street with 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.189
 water that is coming to the taps of the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.979
 residents think that the sewerage 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.040
 ruptured and contaminated piping in 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.020
 taps is leaving sewage 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.140
 So what do not we get to 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.850
 conclusion is that the old pipe 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.299
 damaged is already mixed with water 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 Clean, come on, let's turn the faucet over. 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.250
 there is this water that is here that someone 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.770
 come here and talk to us and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.799
