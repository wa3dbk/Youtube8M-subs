00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.529 
should offer some fantastic image
quality<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.060> throw<00:00:27.300> together

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
quality so I'm just gonna throw together

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.779 
quality so I'm just gonna throw together
some<00:00:27.779> different<00:00:28.289> sample<00:00:28.740> footage<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.279> taken

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
some different sample footage here taken

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
some different sample footage here taken
at<00:00:29.970> different<00:00:30.269> times<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.170> mic<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> seems

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
at different times the mic on it seems

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.709 
at different times the mic on it seems
quite<00:00:32.219> good<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.550> terms<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.910> sensitivity<00:00:33.570> but

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
quite good in terms of sensitivity but

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.150 
quite good in terms of sensitivity but
of<00:00:33.840> course<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.230> want<00:00:34.410> an<00:00:34.500> external<00:00:34.980> mic

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
of course you want an external mic

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.510 
of course you want an external mic
system<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.730> get<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.910> best<00:00:36.149> results<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.520> yeah

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
system to get the best results but yeah

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.979 
system to get the best results but yeah
I'll<00:00:38.760> show<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> bunch<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.690> different

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
I'll show you a bunch of different

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.299 
I'll show you a bunch of different
footage<00:00:40.260> I've<00:00:40.410> captured<00:00:40.649> over<00:00:41.129> different

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
footage I've captured over different

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.430 
footage I've captured over different
times<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.660> course<00:00:42.899> there'll<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.170> more

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
times and of course there'll be more

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.240 
times and of course there'll be more
coming

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.799 

all<00:00:52.250> right<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:52.789> was<00:00:53.030> shooting<00:00:53.570> on<00:00:53.660> the

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
all right so this was shooting on the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.889 
all right so this was shooting on the
50ml<00:00:54.379> 1.2<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.640> that's<00:00:55.850> on<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.210> normal<00:00:56.660> mode

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
50ml 1.2 and that's on the normal mode

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.400 
50ml 1.2 and that's on the normal mode
in<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.769> second<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.309> kept<00:00:58.640> my<00:00:59.170> position<00:01:00.170> but

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
in a second I kept my position but

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.139 
in a second I kept my position but
changed<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:00.949> to<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.219> crop<00:01:01.519> mode<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.000> can

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
changed it to the crop mode and you can

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.600 
changed it to the crop mode and you can
see<00:01:02.329> how<00:01:02.600> much<00:01:02.750> closer<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:03.440> goes<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:03.920> quite<00:01:04.580> a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
see how much closer that goes in quite a

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.910 
see how much closer that goes in quite a
long<00:01:04.879> way<00:01:05.089> but<00:01:05.390> that's<00:01:05.479> still<00:01:05.810> full<00:01:06.080> HD<00:01:06.500> but<00:01:06.770> as

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
long way but that's still full HD but as

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.969 
long way but that's still full HD but as
you<00:01:07.130> will<00:01:07.520> notice<00:01:07.850> there<00:01:08.270> it's<00:01:08.930> much<00:01:09.440> easier

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
you will notice there it's much easier

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.649 
you will notice there it's much easier
to<00:01:10.040> get<00:01:10.310> handshake<00:01:10.909> coming<00:01:11.300> in<00:01:11.450> because

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
to get handshake coming in because

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.469 
to get handshake coming in because
you're<00:01:12.229> at<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.560> zooms<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.490> further<00:01:14.119> zoomed

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
you're at a zooms a further zoomed

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.080 
you're at a zooms a further zoomed
length<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.830> quality<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.460> really<00:01:16.759> really

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
length but the quality is really really

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:47.459 
length but the quality is really really
nice

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.899 

so<00:01:48.469> in<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.710> way<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:48.890> can<00:01:49.130> see<00:01:49.369> his<00:01:49.640> goats

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
so in that way you can see his goats

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.569 
so in that way you can see his goats
swinging<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.049> out<00:01:51.229> of<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.770> focus<00:01:52.219> area

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
swinging in and out of the in focus area

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.080 
swinging in and out of the in focus area
and<00:01:52.850> here<00:01:53.749> depending<00:01:54.350> on<00:01:54.469> what<00:01:54.850> setting<00:01:55.850> you

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
and here depending on what setting you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.330 
and here depending on what setting you
choose<00:01:56.359> same<00:01:56.810> as<00:01:56.990> your<00:01:57.170> pictures<00:01:57.649> for<00:01:57.859> JPEG

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
you can set it to monochrome or change

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.709 
you can set it to monochrome or change
