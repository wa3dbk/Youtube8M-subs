the interior remains the same to the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.740 
the interior remains the same to the
cars<00:00:36.780> basically<00:00:37.440> got<00:00:38.310> the<00:00:38.430> stock<00:00:39.000> them<00:00:39.210> look

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
cars basically got the stock them look

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.300 
cars basically got the stock them look
on<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> effect<00:00:40.650> other<00:00:41.160> than<00:00:41.310> the<00:00:41.490> wheels

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
on it the effect other than the wheels

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.890 
on it the effect other than the wheels
it's<00:00:44.310> kind<00:00:44.490> of<00:00:44.520> California<00:00:44.910> bumping<00:00:45.630> on<00:00:45.750> it

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
it's kind of California bumping on it

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.350 
it's kind of California bumping on it
which<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.560> a<00:00:46.590> one-piece<00:00:47.070> bumper<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:48.180> usually

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
which is a one-piece bumper they usually

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.330 
which is a one-piece bumper they usually
come<00:00:48.720> in<00:00:48.780> three<00:00:49.140> pieces<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.710> most<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.100> cars

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
come in three pieces on most your cars

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.790 
come in three pieces on most your cars
but<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.630> California<00:00:52.290> they<00:00:52.440> offered

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
but I think of California they offered

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
but I think of California they offered
the<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.070> piece<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:53.820> Canada<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:55.080> did

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the one piece and then Canada they did

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.820 
the one piece and then Canada they did
it<00:00:55.380> too

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
integrity out of it so he ended up

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.970 
integrity out of it so he ended up
flipping<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:50.570> foot<00:01:50.750> over<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.500> working<00:01:51.890> this
