very kindly sent me out one of each of
the<00:00:23.070> current<00:00:23.430> SIM<00:00:23.640> cards<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.269> what<00:00:24.720> I'm<00:00:24.779> going

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the current SIM cards so what I'm going

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.210 
the current SIM cards so what I'm going
to<00:00:24.930> show<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.439> video<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to show you in this video is the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.640 
to show you in this video is the
physical<00:00:26.580> differences<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.359> also<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.470> it's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
physical differences and also if it's

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.730 
physical differences and also if it's
possible<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.490> cut<00:00:29.699> down<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.240> micro<00:00:31.019> SIM<00:00:31.260> card<00:00:31.560> or

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
possible to cut down a micro SIM card or

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.430 
possible to cut down a micro SIM card or
a<00:00:31.820> standard<00:00:32.820> sized<00:00:33.030> SIM<00:00:33.360> card<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> new

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
a standard sized SIM card to the new

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.670 
a standard sized SIM card to the new
nano<00:00:34.980> size<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> let's<00:00:36.660> take<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> look<00:00:37.290> at<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
nano size so let's take a look at the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.170 
nano size so let's take a look at the
three<00:00:37.920> different<00:00:38.250> sizes<00:00:38.460> first<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.059> we've

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
three different sizes first of all we've

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
three different sizes first of all we've
got<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.300> standard<00:00:39.660> sized<00:00:40.230> SIM<00:00:40.530> card<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:41.070> we've

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
got a standard sized SIM card here we've

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.850 
got a standard sized SIM card here we've
got<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> micro<00:00:42.420> SIM<00:00:42.660> card<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.260> like

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
got a micro SIM card and that's like

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.160 
got a micro SIM card and that's like
what's<00:00:44.100> used<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.940> iPhone<00:00:45.270> 4<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
what's used in the iPhone 4 or the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.229 
what's used in the iPhone 4 or the
iPhone<00:00:46.620> 4s<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.670> then<00:00:47.820> we've<00:00:47.940> got<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> new

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
iPhone 4s and then we've got the new

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.779 
iPhone 4s and then we've got the new
nano<00:00:48.809> SIM<00:00:49.140> card<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.489> used

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
nano SIM card which is going to be used

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.720 
nano SIM card which is going to be used
in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> iPhone<00:00:51.809> 5<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.980> let's<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.280> take<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
in the iPhone 5 so let's just take the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
in the iPhone 5 so let's just take the
outer<00:00:53.969> cards<00:00:54.449> away<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.739> they

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
outer cards away now this is what they

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.290 
outer cards away now this is what they
normally<00:00:56.039> come<00:00:56.340> supplied<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.239> just

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
normally come supplied on and you just

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.590 
normally come supplied on and you just
sort<00:00:57.600> pop<00:00:57.840> them<00:00:58.020> out<00:00:58.280> like<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.420> let's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
sort pop them out like so and then let's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
sort pop them out like so and then let's
take<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.020> closer<00:01:01.350> look<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.430> three<00:01:02.670> SIM

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
take a closer look at all three SIM

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.390 
take a closer look at all three SIM
cards<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> left<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
cards so here we go on the left is the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
cards so here we go on the left is the
standard<00:01:05.820> size<00:01:06.000> SIM<00:01:06.299> card<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.110> this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
standard size SIM card and then this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.410 
standard size SIM card and then this
moved<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.040> new<00:01:08.310> micro<00:01:08.790> sized<00:01:09.060> SIM

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
moved down to the new micro sized SIM

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990 
moved down to the new micro sized SIM
card<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.960> when<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.890> happened<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.820> was

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
card and when this happened it was

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.230 
card and when this happened it was
possible<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:13.619> cut<00:01:14.100> them<00:01:14.280> down<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.119> if

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
possible to actually cut them down so if

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
possible to actually cut them down so if
I<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.600> show<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.350> obviously<00:01:16.799> people

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
I just show you here obviously people

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.370 
I just show you here obviously people
did<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.640> their<00:01:17.790> own<00:01:18.030> risk<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
did this at their own risk but the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
did this at their own risk but the
actual<00:01:19.770> contact<00:01:20.310> area<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> look<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
actual contact area if you look at the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480 
actual contact area if you look at the
gold<00:01:21.479> segment<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> middle<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.070> actual

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
gold segment in the middle the actual

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.539 
gold segment in the middle the actual
contacts<00:01:24.060> line<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> could<00:01:26.040> cut<00:01:26.310> round

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
contacts line up so you could cut round

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.030 
contacts line up so you could cut round
very<00:01:26.880> very<00:01:27.330> carefully<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> these

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
very very carefully and all of these

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
very very carefully and all of these
contacts<00:01:29.670> would<00:01:29.790> still<00:01:30.119> line<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:31.200> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
contacts would still line up when you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.710 
contacts would still line up when you
were<00:01:31.409> using<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> Micro<00:01:32.640> SIM<00:01:32.880> card<00:01:33.180> let's<00:01:33.509> just

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
were using the Micro SIM card let's just

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.600 
were using the Micro SIM card let's just
show<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.380> angle<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.460> can

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
show you it from that angle and you can

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.850 
show you it from that angle and you can
see<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> sort<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.750> three<00:01:37.020> segments<00:01:37.560> here

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
see that the sort of three segments here

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.249 
see that the sort of three segments here
relate<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> these<00:01:38.909> three<00:01:39.299> segments<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
relate to these three segments here and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.639 
relate to these three segments here and
it<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:41.220> easy<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> cut<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.150> so

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
it was really easy to cut it down so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
it was really easy to cut it down so
that<00:01:43.649> was<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.399> easy<00:01:44.490> solution<00:01:44.939> when<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.750> were

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that was an easy solution when we were

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.830 
that was an easy solution when we were
moving<00:01:46.170> down<00:01:46.500> from<00:01:46.740> standard<00:01:47.220> size<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:48.119> micro

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
moving down from standard size to micro

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.899 
moving down from standard size to micro
sized<00:01:49.079> SIM<00:01:49.380> card<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> nano<00:01:50.549> SIM

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
sized SIM card but with the nano SIM

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.660 
sized SIM card but with the nano SIM
card<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:52.140> quite<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.649> easy

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
card it's not quite so easy

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460 
card it's not quite so easy
