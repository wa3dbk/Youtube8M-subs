00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
interviews and they start waving their
arms<00:01:26.220> around<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.659> they're<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.930> close

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
arms around and because they're so close

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.390 
arms around and because they're so close
to<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> camera<00:01:28.619> at<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.710> point<00:01:29.009> their<00:01:29.130> arms

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
to the camera at that point their arms

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.450 
to the camera at that point their arms
come<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> TV<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.930> quite<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:32.250> those

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.109 
together they've just made the best 3d
gaming<00:02:01.110> experience<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.890> think<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:03.200> the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
gaming experience I think that the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.389 
gaming experience I think that the
passive<00:02:06.119> glasses<00:02:06.240> system<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.220> work

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
passive glasses system is going to work

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.029 
passive glasses system is going to work
a<00:02:08.520> lot<00:02:08.640> better<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.170> mean<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
a lot better just because I mean of the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.089 
a lot better just because I mean of the
time<00:02:11.220> I've<00:02:11.370> used<00:02:11.400> these<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
time I've used these the

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.890 
time I've used these the
the<00:02:14.280> glasses<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.969> not<00:02:15.540> given<00:02:15.689> me<00:02:15.870> any

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the glasses have not given me any

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.509 
the glasses have not given me any
problems<00:02:16.379> with<00:02:16.560> headaches<00:02:17.010> or<00:02:17.159> anything<00:02:17.310> like

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
problems with headaches or anything like

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.360 
problems with headaches or anything like
that<00:02:17.549> they're<00:02:18.389> very<00:02:18.629> comfortable<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.139> wear

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
that they're very comfortable to wear

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.059 
that they're very comfortable to wear
very<00:02:20.370> light<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:22.109> don't<00:02:22.319> have<00:02:22.439> to<00:02:22.530> charge<00:02:22.799> them

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
very light you don't have to charge them

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.860 
very light you don't have to charge them
you<00:02:23.249> can<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.430> hit<00:02:23.670> them<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.939> that's<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.329> they

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you can just hit them on that's it they

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.649 
you can just hit them on that's it they
don't<00:02:25.049> have<00:02:25.139> to<00:02:25.200> be<00:02:25.290> synched<00:02:25.590> with<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.799> TV<00:02:26.659> you
