hey welcome to jacket's draw and today
we're<00:00:02.460> gonna<00:00:02.550> learn<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.750> plankton<00:00:03.750> from

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
we're gonna learn a plankton from

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.860 
we're gonna learn a plankton from
spongebob<00:00:06.410> plankton<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.589> very<00:00:08.340> much<00:00:08.870> the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
spongebob plankton is very much the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.379 
spongebob plankton is very much the
proportions<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.769> thumb<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.340> at<00:00:12.000> least<00:00:12.150> my

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
proportions of a thumb or at least my

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.049 
proportions of a thumb or at least my
thumb<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.620> was<00:00:14.219> thinking<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.610> might<00:00:14.639> try

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
thumb so I was thinking I might try

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.980 
thumb so I was thinking I might try
tracing<00:00:15.660> my<00:00:15.809> thumb<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:16.890> kind<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.130> hard

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
tracing my thumb it's just kind of hard

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.450 
tracing my thumb it's just kind of hard
but<00:00:18.990> there<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:20.810> that<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.430> generally<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
but there we go that is generally the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.750 
but there we go that is generally the
shape<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.119> flankton<00:00:25.070> he's<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> little<00:00:26.640> bit

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
shape of flankton he's got a little bit

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.550 
shape of flankton he's got a little bit
of<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:28.550> sort<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.580> rounded<00:00:30.210> sort<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.900> squared<00:00:31.349> off

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
of a sort of rounded sort of squared off

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.010 
of a sort of rounded sort of squared off
bottom<00:00:32.009> sort<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.550> maybe<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.450> as<00:00:33.600> much<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
bottom sort of maybe not as much as I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.580 
bottom sort of maybe not as much as I
just<00:00:34.079> did

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
just did

just did
he's<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> round<00:00:35.880> top<00:00:36.210> he<00:00:37.200> does<00:00:37.380> curve<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.860> bit

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
he's got a round top he does curve a bit

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.889 
he's got a round top he does curve a bit
like<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> thumb<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:43.730> line<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.120> would<00:00:45.719> like

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
like a thumb so that line I would like

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.010 
like a thumb so that line I would like
it<00:00:46.020> straighter<00:00:46.910> like<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.030> had<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:48.989> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it straighter like I had it but then I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
it straighter like I had it but then I
drew<00:00:50.010> over<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:54.530> there<00:00:55.530> there's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
drew over it so here we go there there's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.479 
drew over it so here we go there there's
Plankton's<00:00:56.910> body<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.010> need<00:00:59.129> some<00:00:59.280> legs

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Plankton's body and we need some legs

Plankton's body and we need some legs
plankton<00:01:00.180> has<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.399> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.460> stick

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
legs I'm kind of making them point out

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.469 
legs I'm kind of making them point out
he's<00:01:06.689> got<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.010> sort<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> wide<00:01:08.400> stance<00:01:11.479> erase

body here we go

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:32.080 
body here we go
and<00:01:22.820> what<00:01:23.820> next<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:25.220> think<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.729> his

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.210 

eyeball<00:01:34.369> no<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.880> his<00:01:36.119> eyebrow<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
eyeball no will do his eyebrow so the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.030 
eyeball no will do his eyebrow so the
eyebrows<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.630> thick<00:01:40.040> it's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
eyebrows up here and it's thick it's

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480 
eyebrows up here and it's thick it's
like<00:01:41.220> three<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> lines<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:43.250> there<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.369> go

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
like three of the lines here there we go

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.980 
like three of the lines here there we go
it's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> black<00:01:45.090> eyebrow<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.600> he's<00:01:48.810> got<00:01:48.960> a

his forehead and now we will draw his

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
his forehead and now we will draw his
eyeball<00:01:58.380> it'll<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.799> from<00:01:59.040> here<00:01:59.460> to<00:02:00.090> about

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
eyeball it'll go from here to about

and it is oval so here we go

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.100 
and it is oval so here we go
Plankton's<00:02:13.319> eyeball<00:02:14.569> yeah<00:02:15.569> he's<00:02:15.810> got<00:02:15.989> an

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
Plankton's eyeball yeah he's got an

Plankton's eyeball yeah he's got an
eyelid<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:17.459> will<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.849> about<00:02:18.150> above<00:02:18.810> halfway

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
eyelid that will be about above halfway

the<00:02:32.310> original<00:02:33.090> eyeball<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.290> make<00:02:34.440> that

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the original eyeball there to make that

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.070 
the original eyeball there to make that
work<00:02:35.690> put<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> little<00:02:36.959> line<00:02:37.230> across<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:39.080> then

work put a little line across and then
I'll<00:02:40.410> draw<00:02:40.530> his<00:02:40.650> pupil<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.640> his<00:02:41.849> people<00:02:42.030> is

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330

that's fine and then we have a white
Center<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.069> gonna<00:02:56.280> be<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> right<00:02:56.700> kind<00:02:57.030> of

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
Center this is gonna be a right kind of
