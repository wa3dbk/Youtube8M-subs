00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello welcome again to zaira moss 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.910
 dot com 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.179
 if today I'm going to teach the color again 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.630
 pink but with because it ends is but 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.520
 figure that he had then he does not need you 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.939
 although it is not pink and it is that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.269
 It has a black line and I'm going to tell you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.470
 Why must one have in soils 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.470
 suit with a line 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.700
 so for this capsule where I 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.820
 always whole as a zero 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.410
 peak of his own self-portrait of goya 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.630
 establishing how they can play with the 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.970
 makeup is that so I can not use 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.950
 and how can they avoid it so that all the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.930
 community of head stay in that photo 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.760
 so stay during all this 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.280
 tutorial so that they learn how 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.730
 make up this the rest and the secret of 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.730
 why 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.559
 like the river 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.490
 for this makeup I will make a 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.460
 tuxedo 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.660
 so I'm going to use my black color 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.660
 that I have brilliant 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.500
 so that it looks like type 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.500
 France 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.590
 I'm using favorite money 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.320
 with pain 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.710
 and the black thing I did was 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.710
 align them a little bit 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.380
 I'm adjusting my hat 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.270
 so you have drama in the picture and now 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.569
 I'll tell you why you need a 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.070
 suit with the sides in black 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.070
 because it creates the illusion 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.340
 optics that you have a very body 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.490
 very thin as you will know in black 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.710
 lengthen things 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.290
 and the steels 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.380
 so this suit that I have not 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.980
 I chose with the deities - but a 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.780
 little square here in the termination 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.490
 because I want to see myself higher I am 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.370
 small for those who know me 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.090
 they know that I am pretty petit and a 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 little further back to create the illusion 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.820
 optics that I have many many 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.430
 chains so stay in what's left 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.070

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.580

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.320
 esports and see how I'm going to transform the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.320
 background so paris
