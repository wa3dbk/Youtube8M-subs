from<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> fans<00:00:47.270> originally<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.329> thought<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
from the fans originally I thought it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.740 
from the fans originally I thought it
was<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.820> cooler<00:00:50.820> master<00:00:51.030> fan<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
was just the cooler master fan that the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900 
was just the cooler master fan that the
case<00:00:51.930> came<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.680> bad<00:00:52.949> causing

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
case came with that was just bad causing

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.229 
case came with that was just bad causing
that<00:00:54.000> loud<00:00:54.180> noise<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> tried<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:56.550> top<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that loud noise so I tried this top that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
that loud noise so I tried this top that
over<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.199> Corsair<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.699> knew

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
over here it's a Corsair one and I knew

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
over here it's a Corsair one and I knew
to<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.149> quiet<00:01:00.539> from<00:01:00.719> another<00:01:00.960> case<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.440> tried

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
to be quiet from another case so I tried

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.850 
to be quiet from another case so I tried
it<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:01.940> it's<00:01:02.940> attached<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.860> switching

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it out it's attached to this switching

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.670 
it out it's attached to this switching
the<00:01:05.570> fan<00:01:06.570> controller<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:08.900> in<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.170> case<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the fan controller and in this case it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.760 
the fan controller and in this case it
turns<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.189> loud<00:01:12.110> when<00:01:13.110> put<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> full

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
turns out to be loud when put the full

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.460 
turns out to be loud when put the full
blast<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.340> turns<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:19.380> were

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
blast so it turns out that if you were

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.200 
blast so it turns out that if you were
to<00:01:19.560> take<00:01:19.740> these<00:01:19.890> front<00:01:20.280> fans<00:01:20.610> no<00:01:20.850> matter<00:01:21.000> what
