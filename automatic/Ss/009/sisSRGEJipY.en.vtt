three DS on the field and then send them
to<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.900> grave<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.530> all<00:02:32.680> know<00:02:32.860> how

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980

was a really quick way to do it we can

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.060 
was a really quick way to do it we can

have<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.210> reactor<00:03:01.660> name<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.140> could<00:03:02.440> just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
have the reactor name so you could just

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.890 
have the reactor name so you could just
teach<00:03:02.920> away<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.520> give<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.150> your<00:03:04.330> hand<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:04.870> i

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
teach away and give to your hand so i

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.410

guess<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.350> can<00:03:05.440> start<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.740> with<00:03:05.860> sang<00:03:06.070> in<00:03:06.420> you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
guess you can start you with sang in you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.890 
guess you can start you with sang in you
can<00:03:07.570> search<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.880> with<00:03:09.880> your<00:03:10.630> jug<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.650> again<00:03:12.370> x

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
can search it with your jug it again x

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.830 
can search it with your jug it again x
you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.080> search<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.590> with<00:03:15.040> Gen<00:03:15.459> X<00:03:15.610> neutron<00:03:16.120> so

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
you can search it with Gen X neutron so

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.630 
you can search it with Gen X neutron so
it<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:16.959> searchable<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:17.950> put<00:03:18.160> this<00:03:18.280> pieces

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
it is searchable so you put this pieces

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.660 
it is searchable so you put this pieces
together<00:03:18.760> pretty<00:03:19.180> quickly<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.709> makes<00:03:21.550> it

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
together pretty quickly so makes it

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.910 
together pretty quickly so makes it
competitive<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:23.440> like<00:03:23.590> things<00:03:23.830> that

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
competitive and I like things that

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.699 
competitive and I like things that
search<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.540> thought<00:03:26.080> that<00:03:26.230> was<00:03:26.350> pretty<00:03:26.440> cool

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
search so I thought that was pretty cool

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.430 
search so I thought that was pretty cool
I<00:03:27.030> felt<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.480> special<00:03:28.900> summoning<00:03:29.230> Clause

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.199 
I felt that the special summoning Clause
is<00:03:29.860> important<00:03:30.310> because<00:03:30.400> when<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.670> banish<00:03:31.000> it
