00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.900 
one time at this point you know usually
I<00:02:25.410> would<00:02:25.530> use<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> brayer<00:02:26.100> I'm<00:02:26.370> not<00:02:26.520> seeing<00:02:26.820> a

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
I would use the brayer I'm not seeing a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.550 
I would use the brayer I'm not seeing a
brayer<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.360> my<00:02:27.600> table<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.770> let's<00:02:29.040> take<00:02:30.560> use

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
brayer on my table so let's take use

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.270 
brayer on my table so let's take use
what<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.780> get<00:02:34.050> all<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.410> extra<00:02:34.830> glue

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
what you have you get all the extra glue

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.370 
what you have you get all the extra glue
out<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.640> there<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:39.140> would<00:02:40.140> normally

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
out of there and then I would normally

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.699 
out of there and then I would normally
let<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.270> kind<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.390> sit<00:02:42.959> up<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.230> just<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.530> little

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
let it kind of sit up for just a little

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.810 
let it kind of sit up for just a little
bit<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.130> want<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.520> too<00:02:44.670> long

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
bit you don't want to do it too long

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.990 
bit you don't want to do it too long
because<00:02:45.060> once<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.480> glue<00:02:46.190> sets<00:02:47.190> up<00:02:47.400> its<00:02:47.670> it

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
because once that glue sets up its it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.310 
because once that glue sets up its it
does<00:02:48.570> get<00:02:48.720> pretty<00:02:48.780> stiff<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.410> amazing<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
does get pretty stiff it's amazing and I

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.190 
does get pretty stiff it's amazing and I
just<00:02:52.430> start<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.910> cut<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.420> cut<00:02:54.720> around<00:02:54.870> you
