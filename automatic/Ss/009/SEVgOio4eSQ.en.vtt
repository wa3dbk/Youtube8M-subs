00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.810
 what's up my people and I'm Adriana de Vex 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.750
 welcome to another new video here in 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.130
 my channel in today's video I come to you 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.500
 talk about a little trick I gave myself 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.540
 account very recently and I think we're going 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.570
 to serve quite help us in general 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.669
 are 22 tricks to two things that very few 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.249
 we have realized and had given 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.980
 account then great basically well 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.289
 talk about the ub of this game the sat like 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.829
 you already know the ub that is the typical drone 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.509
 that is in the air that signals the 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.789
 enemies because in this game they have done 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.469
 like a guy like a box on the floor 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.809
 well designed not good we proceed to the 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.210
 visit but what I have talk about now 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.160
 are basically two things and how 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.579
 this new wow works 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.010
 This new uvb grape has 44 systems of 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.769
 function will not defend in four ways 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.579
 different and these are if we call a 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.039
 only satcom or to a single sample the 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.469
 enemies but if only the one that our 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.120
 comrades look towards them like this our 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.190
 company is our partner is directed 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 to an enemy show them if not then not 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.500
 shows it 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.380
 second if you show if you call two salt 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.770
 with just go up at the same time show 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.230
 minimum for as normal wobble not if 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 flames at three minimum sample pays at 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.820
 minimum for as shown to the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.360
 enemies on the minimap but so 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.990
 faster and if you call 44 bags at 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.850
 same time it points you it happens then you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.320
 will teach the enemies of the innova more 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 fast and will also teach you the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.490
 direction and this grace are 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.830
 pointing not then I think that that's 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.140
 something very useful I do not expect you to be is me 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.030
 realize not then you already know and the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.950
 second time watching to see is now 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.820
 on screen that is like distinguishing where 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.670
 are the enemies 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.619
 as you see in the mini map you already know 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.240
 Sometimes we see the map and we see three 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.119
 different types of circles not a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.460
 completely orange circle that 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.470
 means that the enemies are in the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.850
 same level that tubes are in the same 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.700
 plant is not thick that also 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.759
 it is on the floor 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.340
 and another that is an orange circle with 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.929
 black inside and an arrow down that 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.640
 means they are in the plant 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.810
 down basically means that they are 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:19.069
 below you are not on the 10th floor and 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.680
 the orange circle with black and a 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.220
 arrow up means they are 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.950
 above you 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.830
 if you are on the 2nd or 1st floor and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.510
 are one above is not also that 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.890
 goes the level of the ground and the buildings 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.790
 so we're going to levels not like that so 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.090
 these guys I hope you liked it 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.670
 the truth I found it very funny this 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.099
 and then we do not see in the next video and 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.280
 you know subscribe a like and until 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.280
 soon
