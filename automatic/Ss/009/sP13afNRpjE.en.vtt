one of the biggest complaints about

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.909 
one of the biggest complaints about
Drupal<00:00:06.120> 6<00:00:06.420> was<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.259> had<00:00:07.290> no<00:00:07.620> built-in

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
Drupal 6 was that it had no built-in

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.490 
Drupal 6 was that it had no built-in

image into a node took an HTML hack and

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.959 
image into a node took an HTML hack and
to<00:00:13.049> really<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.980> right<00:00:14.160> meant<00:00:14.429> installing

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
to really do it right meant installing

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
and configuring a half dozen modules

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.310 
and configuring a half dozen modules
Drupal<00:00:18.060> 7<00:00:18.210> attack<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.779> problem<00:00:18.990> by

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
Drupal 7 attack that problem by

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.170 
Drupal 7 attack that problem by
incorporating<00:00:19.890> those<00:00:20.130> half<00:00:20.400> dozen<00:00:20.760> modules

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
incorporating those half dozen modules

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.210 
incorporating those half dozen modules
into<00:00:21.510> its<00:00:21.630> core<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.650> results<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.039> pretty

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
into its core and the results are pretty

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.179 
into its core and the results are pretty
good<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:24.240> get<00:00:24.359> those<00:00:24.570> images<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.080> now<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.680> just

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
good to get those images in now you just

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.519 
good to get those images in now you just
add<00:00:26.369> an<00:00:26.670> image<00:00:26.880> field<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> content<00:00:28.080> type<00:00:28.170> as

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
add an image field to a content type as

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.800 
add an image field to a content type as
we<00:00:28.740> saw<00:00:28.920> earlier<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:30.029> approach<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.449> less

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
we saw earlier this approach is less

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240 
we saw earlier this approach is less
flexible<00:00:31.320> than<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.529> system<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.980> would<00:00:32.099> let

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
flexible than a system that would let

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
flexible than a system that would let
you<00:00:32.340> mix<00:00:32.579> graphics<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.270> text<00:00:33.300> freely<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
you mix graphics and text freely but you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.680 
you mix graphics and text freely but you
do<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.219> more<00:00:35.489> control<00:00:35.910> over<00:00:35.940> your<00:00:36.270> images

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
do get more control over your images

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.569 
do get more control over your images
that<00:00:36.840> way<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.040> apply<00:00:38.280> image

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that way because you can apply image

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.910 
that way because you can apply image
styles<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.840> impose<00:00:40.140> consistency

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
styles that impose consistency

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
styles that impose consistency
throughout<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> entire<00:00:41.879> site<00:00:42.300> i'll<00:00:43.140> show<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
throughout the entire site i'll show you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.080 
throughout the entire site i'll show you
how<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> by<00:00:44.219> changing<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.730> node<00:00:44.910> we

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
how to do that by changing a node we

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
how to do that by changing a node we
created<00:00:45.510> earlier<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> course<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:47.010> this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
created earlier in the course it's this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.910 
created earlier in the course it's this
pure<00:00:47.730> grade<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.300> olive<00:00:48.719> oil<00:00:48.899> 1<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.559> product

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
pure grade a olive oil 1 it's a product

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.369 
pure grade a olive oil 1 it's a product
node<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.360> scroll<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
node and as we scroll down we see that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.799 
node and as we scroll down we see that
we<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> graphic<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.449> original

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
we have the graphic here the original

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.900 
we have the graphic here the original
graphic<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.320> had<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:55.680> much<00:00:55.890> larger<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.550> we

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
graphic we had was much larger and we

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.610 
graphic we had was much larger and we
changed<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> medium<00:00:58.050> style<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
changed it to the medium style that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
changed it to the medium style that

let's<00:01:04.769> go<00:01:04.920> back<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.339> content<00:01:05.850> type<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
let's go back to that content type and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.359 
let's go back to that content type and
take<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> look<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:06.750> exactly<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.409> did<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:08.220> go

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
take a look at what exactly we did we go

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.750 
take a look at what exactly we did we go
up<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.610> structure<00:01:09.350> content<00:01:10.350> types<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
up to structure content types and that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
up to structure content types and that
particular<00:01:12.180> node<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> product

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
particular node is of the product

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800 
particular node is of the product
content<00:01:13.470> type<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.670> over<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> manage<00:01:15.270> display

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
content type I go over to manage display
and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> field<00:01:17.369> product

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and then I look at the field product

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
and then I look at the field product
photo<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.869> here's<00:01:19.380> where<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> information

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
widget here and instead of having image

that<00:03:39.389> actually<00:03:39.840> removes<00:03:40.260> part<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.769> your<00:03:40.919> image

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
that actually removes part of your image

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.119 
that actually removes part of your image
so<00:03:41.280> be<00:03:41.519> careful<00:03:41.939> when<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.180> use<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.540> the

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
so be careful when you use it the

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.099 
so be careful when you use it the
saturate<00:03:44.129> is<00:03:44.220> an<00:03:44.340> interesting<00:03:44.699> one<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.479> takes

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
saturate is an interesting one it takes

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.229 
saturate is an interesting one it takes
away<00:03:46.349> all<00:03:46.379> of<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.919> color<00:03:47.159> information<00:03:47.519> it

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
away all of the color information it

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.640 
away all of the color information it
could<00:03:48.509> just<00:03:48.540> as<00:03:48.780> well<00:03:48.840> be<00:03:48.989> called<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.439> black

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
could just as well be called the black

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.460 
could just as well be called the black

dimensions<00:03:54.509> you<00:03:54.629> want<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.349> will<00:03:55.650> distort

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
dimensions you want that will distort

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.369

the<00:03:56.280> image<00:03:56.310> however<00:03:57.019> rotate<00:03:58.019> as<00:03:58.139> you<00:03:58.229> can

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
the image however rotate as you can

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.740 
the image however rotate as you can
guess<00:03:58.560> rotates<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.189> image<00:03:59.569> scale<00:04:00.569> we've

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
guess rotates the image scale we've

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.649 
guess rotates the image scale we've
already<00:04:00.930> seen<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.620> scale<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.609> crop<00:04:02.849> changes

already seen and scale and crop changes

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.210 
already seen and scale and crop changes
one<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.019> dimensions<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.739> cuts<00:04:05.009> off

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
one of the dimensions but it cuts off

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.149 
one of the dimensions but it cuts off
the<00:04:05.459> other<00:04:05.639> one<00:04:06.290> most<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.439> these<00:04:07.590> has<00:04:07.949> their

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
the other one most of these has their

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.369 
the other one most of these has their
own<00:04:08.189> set<00:04:08.699> of<00:04:08.759> options<00:04:09.090> desaturate<00:04:10.079> doesn't

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
own set of options desaturate doesn't

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.629 
own set of options desaturate doesn't
because<00:04:10.560> all<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.799> does<00:04:10.829> is<00:04:11.099> take<00:04:11.310> away<00:04:11.430> the

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
because all it does is take away the

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.580 
because all it does is take away the
color<00:04:11.849> information<00:04:12.180> but<00:04:12.930> we'll<00:04:13.079> see<00:04:13.199> a<00:04:13.229> few<00:04:13.290> of

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
color information but we'll see a few of

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.430 
color information but we'll see a few of
those<00:04:14.389> so<00:04:15.389> first<00:04:15.689> thing<00:04:15.810> I'm<00:04:15.930> going<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.169> do<00:04:16.320> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
those so first thing I'm going to do is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.110 
those so first thing I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:16.560> going<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.769> change<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.280> scale<00:04:17.669> I'm<00:04:17.909> going

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
I'm going to change the scale I'm going

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.670 
I'm going to change the scale I'm going
to<00:04:18.209> make<00:04:18.389> it<00:04:18.570> 300<00:04:19.470> by<00:04:19.620> 300<00:04:19.979> instead<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:22.380> allow

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
to make it 300 by 300 instead the allow

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.350 
to make it 300 by 300 instead the allow
upscaling<00:04:23.340> by<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.669> way<00:04:23.849> lets<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.150> take<00:04:24.300> a

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
upscaling by the way lets you take a

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.010 
upscaling by the way lets you take a
smaller<00:04:24.779> graphic<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.440> make<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.770> larger<00:04:26.310> the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
smaller graphic and make it larger the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.689 
smaller graphic and make it larger the
them<00:04:27.169> with<00:04:27.289> that<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:28.039> those<00:04:28.220> larger

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
them with that is that those larger

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.100 
them with that is that those larger
graphics<00:04:29.120> after<00:04:29.389> they've<00:04:29.539> been<00:04:29.660> resized

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
graphics after they've been resized

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.080 
graphics after they've been resized
don't<00:04:30.740> look<00:04:30.979> as<00:04:31.129> good<00:04:31.340> there's<00:04:31.879> not<00:04:32.030> enough

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
don't look as good there's not enough

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.809 
don't look as good there's not enough
information<00:04:32.690> in<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.379> small<00:04:33.740> graphic<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.550> just

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
information in the small graphic it just

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.399 
information in the small graphic it just
takes<00:04:35.090> each<00:04:35.300> pixel<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:35.870> makes<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.199> bigger

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
takes each pixel and makes it bigger

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.950 
takes each pixel and makes it bigger
essentially<00:04:37.090> but<00:04:38.090> we'll<00:04:38.360> leave<00:04:38.539> this<00:04:38.659> as<00:04:38.840> it

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
essentially but we'll leave this as it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.360 
essentially but we'll leave this as it
is<00:04:39.110> 300<00:04:39.680> pixels<00:04:39.979> by<00:04:40.099> 300<00:04:40.699> and<00:04:40.849> update<00:04:41.509> effect

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
is 300 pixels by 300 and update effect

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.469 
is 300 pixels by 300 and update effect
then<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.460> think<00:04:43.669> I<00:04:43.729> want<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.000> try<00:04:44.060> that<00:04:44.330> black

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
then I think I want to try that black

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.899 
then I think I want to try that black
and<00:04:44.690> white<00:04:44.750> effect<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:45.680> i<00:04:45.710> select<00:04:45.919> desaturate

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
and white effect so i select desaturate

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.570 
and white effect so i select desaturate
and<00:04:47.090> add<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.840> as<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:48.919> see<00:04:49.129> there<00:04:49.310> are<00:04:49.430> no

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
and add and as you see there are no

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.909 
and add and as you see there are no
options<00:04:49.819> for<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.379> finally<00:04:51.379> I<00:04:51.409> think<00:04:51.710> I'll

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
options for that finally I think I'll

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.309 
options for that finally I think I'll
rotate<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.759> a<00:04:52.849> little<00:04:53.030> bit<00:04:53.300> let's<00:04:53.780> click

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
rotate it a little bit let's click

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.760 
rotate it a little bit let's click
rotate<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.159> add<00:04:55.690> make<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.900> subtle<00:04:57.319> negative

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
rotate and add make it a subtle negative

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.550 
rotate and add make it a subtle negative
15<00:04:58.220> degrees<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.940> for<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.720> background<00:04:59.960> color

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
15 degrees and for the background color

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.890 
15 degrees and for the background color
I'm<00:05:01.460> going<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.849> make<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.210> light<00:05:03.880> 0000<00:05:04.880> 66<00:05:05.539> you

I'm going to make it a light 0000 66 you

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.540 
I'm going to make it a light 0000 66 you

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
exactly what this background color is

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.659 
exactly what this background color is
after<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.590> see<00:05:12.710> what<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:12.919> rotation<00:05:13.400> effect

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
after you see what the rotation effect

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.950 
after you see what the rotation effect
does<00:05:13.909> so<00:05:14.900> I<00:05:14.930> then<00:05:15.169> click<00:05:15.440> add<00:05:15.620> effect<00:05:16.960> okay

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
does so I then click add effect okay

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.540 
does so I then click add effect okay
well<00:05:18.259> you<00:05:18.530> can<00:05:18.650> see<00:05:18.860> it's<00:05:19.009> made<00:05:19.190> quite<00:05:19.490> a

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
well you can see it's made quite a

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.700 
well you can see it's made quite a
difference<00:05:19.669> we<00:05:20.509> have<00:05:20.659> our<00:05:20.810> original<00:05:21.289> sample

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710

difference we have our original sample
here<00:05:22.039> and<00:05:22.219> this<00:05:22.639> is<00:05:22.789> the<00:05:22.909> sample<00:05:23.210> we<00:05:23.330> end<00:05:23.479> up

here and this is the sample we end up
with<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:24.139> really<00:05:24.830> don't<00:05:25.039> like<00:05:25.099> that<00:05:25.310> blue<00:05:25.940> color

with I really don't like that blue color
however<00:05:26.840> so<00:05:27.020> i<00:05:27.080> think<00:05:27.169> i'll<00:05:27.440> make<00:05:27.500> that<00:05:27.889> much

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
however so i think i'll make that much

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.399 
however so i think i'll make that much
subtler<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:28.759> i'll<00:05:29.180> make<00:05:29.509> the<00:05:29.690> rotation<00:05:30.349> a

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
subtler and i'll make the rotation a

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.379 
subtler and i'll make the rotation a
little<00:05:30.680> bit<00:05:30.830> less<00:05:31.099> again<00:05:31.699> you<00:05:31.819> can<00:05:31.940> always<00:05:32.240> go

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
little bit less again you can always go

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.480 
little bit less again you can always go
back<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:32.599> edit<00:05:32.870> these<00:05:33.110> things<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:34.250> i'll<00:05:34.370> make

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
back and edit these things so i'll make

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.760 
back and edit these things so i'll make
the<00:05:34.580> rotation<00:05:35.030> angle<00:05:35.360> only<00:05:35.780> seven<00:05:36.440> degrees

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
the rotation angle only seven degrees

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.140 
the rotation angle only seven degrees
i'll<00:05:37.669> make<00:05:37.849> the<00:05:37.909> background<00:05:38.210> color<00:05:39.880> let's<00:05:40.880> say

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
i'll make the background color let's say

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.879 
i'll make the background color let's say
a<00:05:41.180> grayish<00:05:41.659> color<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:42.909> update<00:05:43.909> effect<00:05:44.889> there

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
a grayish color and update effect there

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.490 
a grayish color and update effect there
that's<00:05:46.340> a<00:05:46.490> little<00:05:46.580> bit<00:05:46.819> better<00:05:47.349> finally<00:05:48.349> I'll

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
that's a little bit better finally I'll

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.959 
that's a little bit better finally I'll
just<00:05:48.650> remove<00:05:48.949> the<00:05:49.009> desaturate<00:05:49.759> I<00:05:51.849> like<00:05:52.849> the

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
just remove the desaturate I like the

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.999 
just remove the desaturate I like the
way<00:05:53.060> that<00:05:53.240> looks<00:05:53.590> since<00:05:54.590> we've<00:05:54.770> already

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
way that looks since we've already

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.550 
way that looks since we've already

Drupal<00:06:42.740> let's<00:06:43.280> take<00:06:43.490> a<00:06:43.520> very<00:06:43.820> quick<00:06:43.970> look<00:06:44.210> at

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
Drupal let's take a very quick look at

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.510 
Drupal let's take a very quick look at
how<00:06:44.510> they're<00:06:44.750> stored<00:06:45.050> on<00:06:45.170> the<00:06:45.320> server<00:06:45.400> to<00:06:46.400> do

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
how they're stored on the server to do

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.550 
how they're stored on the server to do
that<00:06:46.550> I'll<00:06:46.880> go<00:06:47.000> to<00:06:47.090> my<00:06:47.210> desktop<00:06:47.420> where<00:06:48.290> I<00:06:48.320> have

there's the graphic itself that's

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.290 
there's the graphic itself that's
important<00:07:09.470> because<00:07:09.890> we<00:07:10.220> haven't<00:07:10.580> changed<00:07:11.150> the
