00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
he also does custom rails as well and he

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.309 
he also does custom rails as well and he
also<00:02:13.770> does<00:02:14.100> custom<00:02:14.270> coloring<00:02:15.270> for<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.110> feet

and<00:02:16.530> legs<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.130> went<00:02:17.400> with<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.730> orange<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and legs I went with the orange and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.250 
and legs I went with the orange and
white<00:02:19.230> fade<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:21.000> kind<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> frost<00:02:21.780> I

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
white fade it's kind of like a frost I

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.490 
white fade it's kind of like a frost I
think<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.950> turned<00:02:23.160> out<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:23.340> well

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
think it turned out really well

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.780 
think it turned out really well
hopefully<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.739> guys<00:02:25.860> could<00:02:26.069> see<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.700> it

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
hopefully you guys could see that and it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.979 
hopefully you guys could see that and it

thing<00:03:26.220> with<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:26.760> rail<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.450> like<00:03:27.989> I

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
thing with this rail and like I

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.930 
thing with this rail and like I
mentioned<00:03:28.140> before<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.100> mild<00:03:29.640> or<00:03:30.799> mellow

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
mentioned before it is a mild or mellow

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.780 
mentioned before it is a mild or mellow
rainbow<00:03:32.940> rail<00:03:33.650> which<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:35.489> something<00:03:35.760> that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
rainbow rail which was something that

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.699 
rainbow rail which was something that
really<00:03:36.150> enjoyed<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.170> reason<00:03:37.470> why<00:03:37.680> I

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
really enjoyed and the reason why I

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.319 
really enjoyed and the reason why I
really<00:03:38.010> enjoyed<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.549> because<00:03:38.850> I've<00:03:39.060> used

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
really enjoyed it is because I've used

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.670 
really enjoyed it is because I've used
more<00:03:40.109> of<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:41.329> really<00:03:42.329> curved<00:03:42.720> rainbow<00:03:43.230> rail<00:03:43.440> and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
more of a really curved rainbow rail and

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.039 
more of a really curved rainbow rail and
I'm<00:03:43.769> not<00:03:44.130> saying<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.400> wasn't<00:03:44.820> fun<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.870> just

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
I'm not saying it wasn't fun but I just

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.170

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.940 
found that with this one I was it was a
lot<00:03:48.299> easier<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.690> maybe<00:03:48.959> trick<00:03:49.380> in<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.769> check

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
lot easier to maybe trick in and check

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.449 
lot easier to maybe trick in and check
out<00:03:50.070> if<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.400> wanted<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:52.010> if<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.190> wanted<00:03:53.310> to

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
out if you wanted to and if I wanted to

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.759 
out if you wanted to and if I wanted to
use<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.820> with<00:03:54.000> another<00:03:54.239> obstacle<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:55.140> was<00:03:55.320> it

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
use this with another obstacle it was it

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.410 
use this with another obstacle it was it
was<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.070> much<00:03:56.190> more<00:03:56.370> compatible<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.180> guess

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
was that much more compatible I guess

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.360 
was that much more compatible I guess
because<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.200> can<00:03:58.440> put<00:03:58.590> let's<00:03:58.769> say<00:03:58.890> like<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.130> box

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
because I can put let's say like a box

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.819 
because I can put let's say like a box
underneath<00:03:59.880> here<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.510> still<00:04:01.170> have<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.500> nice

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
underneath here and still have a nice

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.370 
underneath here and still have a nice
sesh<00:04:02.220> with<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:03.540> rail<00:04:03.690> like<00:04:03.930> coming<00:04:04.200> up<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
sesh with the rail like coming up the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.870 
sesh with the rail like coming up the
rail<00:04:04.560> landing<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.040> box<00:04:05.250> coming<00:04:05.609> from<00:04:05.760> the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
rail landing on the box coming from the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.789 
rail landing on the box coming from the
Box<00:04:06.090> going<00:04:06.420> onto<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> rail<00:04:06.870> whereas<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:07.680> it

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
Box going onto the rail whereas if it

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.949 
Box going onto the rail whereas if it
was<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.070> really<00:04:08.519> severe<00:04:09.060> rainbow<00:04:09.660> it

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
was like a really severe rainbow it

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.360 
was like a really severe rainbow it
probably<00:04:10.739> would<00:04:10.829> be<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:11.010> little<00:04:11.070> more

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
probably would be a little more

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.770 
probably would be a little more
difficult<00:04:11.579> so<00:04:12.000> that's<00:04:12.209> one<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.540> reasons

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
difficult so that's one of the reasons

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.509 
difficult so that's one of the reasons
why<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:12.930> really<00:04:13.440> really<00:04:13.680> enjoyed<00:04:14.070> this<00:04:14.250> rail

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
why I really really enjoyed this rail

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.000 
why I really really enjoyed this rail
and<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:15.390> also<00:04:15.480> has<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.959> zing<00:04:16.440> sound<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.979> it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
and it also has that zing sound to it

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.080 
and it also has that zing sound to it
for<00:04:17.220> any<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.459> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
for any of the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.150 
for any of the
that<00:04:18.269> are<00:04:18.359> wondering<00:04:18.799> now<00:04:19.799> another<00:04:20.070> thing

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
that are wondering now another thing

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.790 
that are wondering now another thing
that<00:04:20.579> didn't<00:04:21.419> happen<00:04:21.810> with<00:04:22.049> my<00:04:22.199> first<00:04:22.470> rail

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
that didn't happen with my first rail

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.300 
that didn't happen with my first rail
but<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.850> did<00:04:24.000> occur<00:04:24.090> with<00:04:24.480> this<00:04:24.660> one<00:04:24.949> and<00:04:25.949> when

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
but it did occur with this one and when

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.010 
but it did occur with this one and when
you<00:04:26.430> when<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:26.760> receive<00:04:26.970> an<00:04:27.240> earful<00:04:27.570> product

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
you when you receive an earful product

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.330 
you when you receive an earful product
that<00:04:28.139> comes<00:04:28.260> with<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> letter<00:04:28.710> saying<00:04:29.040> thank

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
that comes with a letter saying thank

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.790 
that comes with a letter saying thank
you<00:04:29.430> for<00:04:29.580> your<00:04:29.639> order<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.199> also<00:04:31.350> explains

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
you for your order and it also explains

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.640 
you for your order and it also explains
how<00:04:32.070> airflow<00:04:32.639> rails<00:04:32.970> may<00:04:33.780> have<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.020> tendency<00:04:34.620> to

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
how airflow rails may have a tendency to

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.100 
how airflow rails may have a tendency to
rust<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:36.360> do<00:04:36.960> have<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.440> little<00:04:37.650> bit<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.130> rust<00:04:38.520> here

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
rust I do have a little bit of rust here

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.219 
rust I do have a little bit of rust here
on<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.229> top<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.740> on<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.250> sides<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:42.110> mean<00:04:43.110> it's

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
on the top and on the sides I mean it's

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.340 
on the top and on the sides I mean it's
nothing<00:04:43.560> major<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:44.130> still<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.669> smooth<00:04:45.350> smooth

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
nothing major it's still a smooth smooth

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.670 
nothing major it's still a smooth smooth
surface<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.979> smooth<00:04:47.190> grind<00:04:47.550> um<00:04:48.080> an<00:04:49.080> earful<00:04:49.560> it

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
surface and smooth grind um an earful it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.370 
surface and smooth grind um an earful it
does<00:04:49.830> offer<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.520> rust-proof<00:04:50.970> kit<00:04:51.510> now<00:04:52.320> the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
does offer a rust-proof kit now the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.170 
does offer a rust-proof kit now the
reason<00:04:52.680> why<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:52.979> didn't<00:04:53.280> get<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.580> with<00:04:53.700> this<00:04:53.910> one

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
reason why I didn't get it with this one

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.060 
reason why I didn't get it with this one
is<00:04:54.389> because<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:54.810> like<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.470> said<00:04:55.650> before<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.979> have

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
is because I like I said before I have

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.230 
is because I like I said before I have
their<00:04:56.400> shotgun<00:04:56.910> rail<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.450> they<00:04:58.320> never<00:04:59.240> never

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
their shotgun rail and they never never

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.740 
their shotgun rail and they never never
rusted<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:00.870> i<00:05:00.900> figured<00:05:01.290> i'll<00:05:01.919> give<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.370> dumb

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
rusted so i figured i'll give it a dumb

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.270 
rusted so i figured i'll give it a dumb
try<00:05:03.750> my<00:05:03.870> luck<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.320> see<00:05:04.770> how<00:05:04.889> it<00:05:04.950> works<00:05:05.040> out

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
try my luck and see how it works out

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.250 
try my luck and see how it works out
well<00:05:05.850> unfortunately<00:05:06.210> i<00:05:06.510> did<00:05:06.870> get<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.080> little

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
well unfortunately i did get a little

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.670 
well unfortunately i did get a little
rust<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:08.250> um<00:05:08.880> but<00:05:09.600> like<00:05:09.750> i<00:05:09.870> said<00:05:09.900> not<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.440> big

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
rust so um but like i said not a big

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.620 
rust so um but like i said not a big
deal<00:05:10.889> if<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.190> guys<00:05:11.430> want<00:05:11.760> to<00:05:11.850> get<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.210> the

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
deal if you guys want to get the the

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.170 
deal if you guys want to get the the
rust<00:05:12.870> proof<00:05:13.050> kit<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.410> can<00:05:13.440> but<00:05:14.280> again<00:05:14.520> it's<00:05:14.850> i

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
rust proof kit you can but again it's i

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.420 
rust proof kit you can but again it's i
guess<00:05:15.510> it's<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.690> hit<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:15.900> miss<00:05:16.229> it<00:05:16.560> didn't<00:05:17.130> it

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
guess it's a hit and miss it didn't it

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.830 
guess it's a hit and miss it didn't it
didn't<00:05:17.580> happen<00:05:17.699> with<00:05:17.970> my<00:05:18.060> other<00:05:18.210> airflow<00:05:18.630> rail

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
didn't happen with my other airflow rail

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.990 
didn't happen with my other airflow rail
but<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.139> happens<00:05:19.770> with<00:05:19.949> this<00:05:20.100> one<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.639> don't

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
but it happens with this one I don't

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.230 
but it happens with this one I don't
know<00:05:21.060> why<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.860> just<00:05:22.919> does<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.550> airflow<00:05:23.970> does

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
know why it just does and airflow does

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.760 
know why it just does and airflow does
explain<00:05:24.570> that<00:05:24.750> in<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.050> letter<00:05:25.169> when<00:05:25.680> they

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
explain that in the letter when they

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.520 
explain that in the letter when they
send<00:05:26.010> it<00:05:26.250> send<00:05:26.490> your<00:05:26.639> product<00:05:27.080> but<00:05:28.080> again<00:05:28.289> all

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
send it send your product but again all

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.490 
send it send your product but again all
know<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:29.010> is<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.610> really<00:05:30.000> fun<00:05:30.419> rail<00:05:30.690> again<00:05:31.229> I

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
know it is a really fun rail again I
