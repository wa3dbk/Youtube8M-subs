 Valencia today however did not start 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.899
 we are now seeing a first play 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.060
 Espanyol attack that was better than the 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.510
 Celtic in the first time 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.040
 this shot of reeds came out as they see very 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.570
 near the goal post 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.310
 Sergio 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.730
 the Celtic improved in the second part 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.550
 he also had some choice but in the end 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.170
 won the Spanish thanks to the goal of 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.170
 caicedo a fair result 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.880

 drive salva sevilla a good move 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.629
 of the Spanish that ends with a very 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.030
 dangerous that detours in the last 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.410
 Cabral moment when it is ready 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.040
 to finish 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.040
 Sergio Garcia 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.720
 there they have the repetition of the play 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.680
 from Spanish the first clear opportunity 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:19.250
 by the local team 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.970
 this is a nolito action the referee 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.180
 he pointed out of play 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.090
 seeing the same repetition could be 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.510
 say that buckle dorsal 23 prevents the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.030
 out of play 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.450
 and now a Celtic attack play ' 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.120
 again with nolito in this case 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.630
 of the Celtic 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.630
 in the first part 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.500

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.720
 caicedo 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.210
 this is an opportunity for the ribei 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.720
 On top of the sources, the ribei can not 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.720

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.710
