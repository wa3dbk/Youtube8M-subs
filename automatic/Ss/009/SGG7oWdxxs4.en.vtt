basically yes I think we have to just
check<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> home<00:02:04.800> screen<00:02:04.830> for<00:02:05.220> us<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.540> we

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
check on to the home screen for us so we

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.800 
check on to the home screen for us so we
need<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.900> go<00:02:07.050> into<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.670> drag<00:02:09.600> the
