for that I've gotten rid of so many of
those<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.049> people's<00:01:07.350> computers<00:01:07.909> seriously

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
those on people's computers seriously

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.469 
those on people's computers seriously
now<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.220> select<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.760> scan<00:01:12.150> tight

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
now you have to select your scan tight

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.850 
now you have to select your scan tight
and<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.710> always<00:01:14.460> choose<00:01:14.900> quick<00:01:15.900> scan<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.470> I'm

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and I always choose quick scan if I'm

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.530 
and I always choose quick scan if I'm
running<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.360> once<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.840> day<00:01:18.869> for

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
running it like just once a day for

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
running it like just once a day for
maybe<00:01:21.680> four<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:22.710> five<00:01:22.979> days<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> week

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
maybe four or five days out of the week

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.990 
maybe four or five days out of the week
but<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.380> haven't<00:01:25.680> run<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> while<00:01:26.549> I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
but if you haven't run it in a while I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.880 
but if you haven't run it in a while I
would<00:01:27.060> suggest<00:01:27.479> running<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.140> complete<00:01:28.560> scan

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
would suggest running a complete scan

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.770 
would suggest running a complete scan
and<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.250> would<00:01:29.460> always<00:01:29.670> run<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> complete<00:01:30.360> scan

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and I would always run a complete scan

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.130 
and I would always run a complete scan
maybe<00:01:31.049> every<00:01:31.350> week<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.890> two<00:01:32.180> just<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> make

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
maybe every week or two just to make

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.410 
maybe every week or two just to make
sure<00:01:34.220> everything's<00:01:35.220> completely<00:01:35.610> checked<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
sure everything's completely checked and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
sure everything's completely checked and
then<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.350> click<00:01:37.530> scan

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
then what you do is you click scan

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.730 
then what you do is you click scan
computer<00:01:38.549> it'll<00:01:39.479> give<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.810> your<00:01:40.049> disks<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
computer it'll give you your disks and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.210 
computer it'll give you your disks and
your<00:01:41.310> drives<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.619> scan<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
your drives that that it will scan and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.200 
your drives that that it will scan and
then<00:01:45.470> usually<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.770> right<00:01:47.220> about<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.970> ones

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
then usually it's right about the ones

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690 
then usually it's right about the ones
it<00:01:48.390> excludes<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> don't<00:01:50.100> always<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.399> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
it excludes so you don't always have to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
it excludes so you don't always have to
worry<00:01:50.909> about<00:01:51.060> hey<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.720> excluded<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.380> have

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
worry about hey that's excluded I have

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.010 
worry about hey that's excluded I have
to<00:01:52.649> check<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.070> most<00:01:53.909> times<00:01:54.210> out<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.570> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to check that most times out of not it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.859 
to check that most times out of not it
knows<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:55.710> wants<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.310> check<00:01:56.729> mark<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.719> all

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
knows what wants to check mark then all

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.319 
knows what wants to check mark then all
you<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.399> high<00:01:59.610> boost<00:01:59.939> low

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
you do you could do it on high boost low

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.889 
you do you could do it on high boost low
boost<00:02:00.659> I'll<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.649> high<00:02:01.920> boost<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.899> low

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
boost I'll do it on high boost and low

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.950 
boost I'll do it on high boost and low
boots<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.469> means<00:02:04.740> it'll<00:02:05.340> run<00:02:05.700> slower<00:02:06.119> but

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
boots just means it'll run slower but

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080 
boots just means it'll run slower but
the<00:02:07.350> other<00:02:07.560> programs<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.369> your<00:02:08.399> computer<00:02:08.550> will

the other programs on your computer will

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.910 
the other programs on your computer will
run<00:02:09.270> faster<00:02:09.539> while<00:02:09.899> you're<00:02:10.050> doing<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.440> hi

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
run faster while you're doing it hi
