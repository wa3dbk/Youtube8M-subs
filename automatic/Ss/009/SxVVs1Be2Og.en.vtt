00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.190
 hi my name is up and I'm going to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.160
 show as a replacement in the file 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.259
 and no points that you modify to play in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.079
 the campaign of good and evil with everyone 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:17.389
 the powers the first thing that they have to 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.389
 make tiger when in play 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.390
 I do not even point that I name them with a 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.520
 point back to have a copy of the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.560
 original 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.240
 so when the case is clarified the sane 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 to establish it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.430
 when I'm an example, I'm going to the campaign 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.990
 of the evil that I have line and modified 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 copy 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.120
 I had it on so I replaced it 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.859
 and long the game is this what I did 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.960
 it's only for version 1.0 3 like this 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.609
 that there is a page I leave where 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.149
 download the files for the campaign 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.039
 of good and evil and like on the page 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.140
 where it takes us to be able to update the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.140
 game to version 1.0 3 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.909
 the Dark Lord Sauron has to 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.939
 get the unique ring 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.869
 with your power you can master all the 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.869
 middle Earth 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.300
 procure me an army that did not delay 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.020
 everything is equal to my army with branches 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.020
 and barks 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 follow me 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640
 the force 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.079
 for the enemy
