00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
if you look at the piston now see how

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.970 
if you look at the piston now see how
it's<00:00:12.929> pushed<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.320> there<00:00:13.469> all<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.679> way<00:00:15.980> again

now if we got in there and pushed if I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
now if we got in there and pushed if I
just<00:00:19.350> put<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> little<00:00:20.039> bit<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.310> foot<00:00:20.789> pressure

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
just put a little bit of foot pressure

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.870 
just put a little bit of foot pressure
on<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.300> brake<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.350> piston<00:00:22.769> let's<00:00:22.980> pop

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
on that brake that piston let's pop

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.529 
on that brake that piston let's pop
right<00:00:24.210> out<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:25.939> we<00:00:26.939> don't<00:00:27.060> want<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
right out and we don't want that to

the brake pedal we're going to reinstall
this<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> little<00:00:33.300> bit

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.310 
good and the bottom ones if you can turn
it<00:01:57.570> by<00:01:57.810> hand<00:01:58.520> okay<00:01:59.520> it's<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.360> stripped<00:02:01.049> or

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
it by hand okay it's not stripped or

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.520 
it by hand okay it's not stripped or
cross<00:02:02.219> threaded<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.079> turn<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.439> with

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
cross threaded if you can turn it with

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
cross threaded if you can turn it with
your<00:02:04.649> finger<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.040> remember<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.939> even<00:02:06.360> if

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
your finger just remember that even if

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.180 
your finger just remember that even if
you<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> socket<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.799> end<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you have a socket on at the end of it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.450 
you have a socket on at the end of it
you<00:02:09.090> will<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.929> able<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.289> turn<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
you will not be able to turn it

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.550 
you will not be able to turn it
with<00:02:12.460> your<00:02:12.640> hands<00:02:13.060> if<00:02:13.570> it's<00:02:13.900> cross<00:02:14.110> threaded

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
with your hands if it's cross threaded

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.920 
with your hands if it's cross threaded
so<00:02:15.370> as<00:02:15.640> long<00:02:15.790> as<00:02:15.850> it's<00:02:16.120> turned<00:02:16.270> by<00:02:16.540> fingers

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
so as long as it's turned by fingers

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.080 
so as long as it's turned by fingers
your<00:02:17.680> good<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:18.100> then<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.520> put<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> socket

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
your good and then you can put a socket

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.520 
your good and then you can put a socket
on<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:19.810> we're<00:02:19.960> going<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.140> tighten<00:02:20.440> those

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
on it so we're going to tighten those

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.750 
on it so we're going to tighten those
down<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.100> once<00:02:22.090> we<00:02:22.180> tighten<00:02:22.510> those<00:02:22.600> down<00:02:23.760> once

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
down and once we tighten those down once

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.610 
down and once we tighten those down once
you<00:02:24.850> tighten<00:02:25.060> those<00:02:25.270> two<00:02:25.510> bolts<00:02:25.750> down<00:02:25.900> we're

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
you tighten those two bolts down we're

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.330 
you tighten those two bolts down we're
ready<00:02:26.830> for<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.070> tire<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:29.140> then<00:02:29.860> went<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
ready for the tire and then went to the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.220 
ready for the tire and then went to the
back<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.730> back<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.120> little<00:02:31.210> different<00:02:31.750> with

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
back the back is a little different with

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.500 
back the back is a little different with
the<00:02:32.320> piston<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:33.130> piston<00:02:33.520> in<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> back<00:02:33.940> does

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
the piston the piston in the back does

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.830 
the piston the piston in the back does
not<00:02:34.690> get<00:02:34.960> pushed<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.830> with<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.160> c-clamp<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.690> it

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
not get pushed in with a c-clamp like it

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.860 
not get pushed in with a c-clamp like it
did<00:02:38.020> here<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.730> again<00:02:40.300> on<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.570> smaller

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
did here and again on the smaller

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.230 
did here and again on the smaller
vehicles<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.280> actually<00:02:42.640> use<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> big<00:02:43.030> pair

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
vehicles you can actually use a big pair

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.160 
vehicles you can actually use a big pair
of<00:02:43.270> pliers<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.930> push<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.800> piston<00:02:45.250> in<00:02:46.170> we're

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
of pliers to push that piston in we're

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.720 
of pliers to push that piston in we're
going<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.740> do<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> rears<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:51.040> piston<00:02:51.460> is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
going to do the rears and the piston is

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.070 
going to do the rears and the piston is
actually<00:02:52.060> kind<00:02:52.210> of<00:02:52.270> got<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.750> corkscrew

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
actually kind of got like a corkscrew

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.850 
actually kind of got like a corkscrew
set<00:02:53.650> up<00:02:53.770> on<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.070> but<00:02:54.700> we'll<00:02:54.880> go<00:02:55.000> over<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
set up on it but we'll go over that and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.840 
set up on it but we'll go over that and
that's<00:02:56.860> going<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.040> be<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.310> now<00:02:57.460> that's<00:02:57.760> a
