more Headroom in terms of the technical
features<00:00:32.970> of<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.150> hardware<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.809> you're

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
features of the hardware that you're

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.259 
features of the hardware that you're
working<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.379> but<00:00:35.309> also<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.580> your

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
working with but also just your

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.880 
working with but also just your
expectations<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.080> how<00:00:37.229> people<00:00:37.290> play<00:00:37.680> the

expectations for how people play the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
expectations for how people play the
game<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.250> very<00:00:38.430> very<00:00:38.909> different<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.809> know

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
game are very very different you know

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.439 
game are very very different you know
we've<00:00:40.110> been<00:00:40.140> making<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:41.309> console<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.970> PC<00:00:42.210> games

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
we've been making a console and PC games

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.780 
we've been making a console and PC games
for<00:00:42.720> almost<00:00:43.409> 20<00:00:43.710> years<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:44.159> some<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.460> our<00:00:44.519> cases

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
for almost 20 years in some of our cases

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.149 
for almost 20 years in some of our cases
and<00:00:45.150> so<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:46.019> a<00:00:46.049> certain<00:00:46.350> expectation<00:00:46.589> for

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
and so we have a certain expectation for

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.219 
and so we have a certain expectation for
somebody<00:00:47.970> sitting<00:00:48.239> down<00:00:48.449> at<00:00:48.629> their<00:00:48.750> desk<00:00:48.960> or

on their couch in their living room and
carving<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.299> three<00:00:51.600> hours<00:00:51.869> to<00:00:52.019> play<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> game

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
carving out three hours to play a game

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200 
carving out three hours to play a game
when<00:00:53.040> you<00:00:53.100> move<00:00:53.250> into<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.549> mobile<00:00:53.699> space<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
when you move into the mobile space you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.579 
when you move into the mobile space you
have<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.479> understand<00:00:54.869> that<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.019> lot<00:00:55.080> of<00:00:55.320> people

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
have to understand that a lot of people

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
taking to a clutch brake you have to

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.549 
taking to a clutch brake you have to
craft<00:00:59.940> experiences<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.869> are<00:01:00.930> rewarding<00:01:01.440> and

fun in little short segments of time and
so<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.589> definitely<00:01:04.920> been<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> transition

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
so that's definitely been a transition

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
for us to have to think that way but

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.040 
for us to have to think that way but
it's<00:01:08.610> also<00:01:08.729> been<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:08.970> fun<00:01:09.180> challenge<00:01:09.390> because

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
it's also been a fun challenge because

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.050 
it's also been a fun challenge because
to<00:01:10.620> give<00:01:10.770> somebody<00:01:10.980> that<00:01:11.250> challenge<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.820> hey

designers<00:01:18.240> what<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.500> advances<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
designers what has the advances that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.300 
designers what has the advances that
we've<00:01:20.430> seen<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.650> tablets<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> smartphones

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we've seen on tablets and smartphones

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.790 
we've seen on tablets and smartphones
I'm<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.150> processing<00:01:24.720> power<00:01:24.960> standpoint<00:01:25.500> open

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
I'm a processing power standpoint open

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.680 
I'm a processing power standpoint open
up<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.160> guys<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.550> that<00:01:26.670> transition<00:01:27.240> okay

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
up for you guys in that transition okay

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.390 
up for you guys in that transition okay
well<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.260> it's<00:01:28.410> not<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.980> processing

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
well I think it's not just processing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
well I think it's not just processing
power<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.210> opens<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.720> game<00:01:30.960> design<00:01:31.260> but<00:01:31.440> also

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
power that opens up game design but also

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
power that opens up game design but also
just<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.100> quality<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> screens<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
just the quality of the screens and the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870 
just the quality of the screens and the
richness<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> color<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.730> of<00:01:35.820> the

palettes<00:01:42.120> are<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.510> that's<00:01:42.930> something<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
palettes are and that's something that

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.960 
palettes are and that's something that
we<00:01:43.590> wouldn't<00:01:43.830> have<00:01:43.920> been<00:01:44.010> able<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.400> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
we wouldn't have been able to do you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.970 
we wouldn't have been able to do you
know<00:01:45.060> three<00:01:45.300> or<00:01:45.330> four<00:01:45.540> years<00:01:45.750> ago<00:01:45.960> even<00:01:46.620> if<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
know three or four years ago even if the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.410 
know three or four years ago even if the
hardware<00:01:47.370> had<00:01:47.490> been<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.760> same<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.120> terms<00:01:48.150> of

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
hardware had been the same in terms of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.850 
hardware had been the same in terms of
CPU<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.409> memory

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
CPU and memory

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.010 
CPU and memory
everything<00:01:50.220> else<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.510> quality<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
everything else it's the quality the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.360 
everything else it's the quality the
screens<00:01:52.350> i<00:01:52.470> think<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.100> helping

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
screens i think that are really helping

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.800 
screens i think that are really helping
to<00:01:53.490> bring<00:01:53.640> games<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.150> life<00:01:54.330> on<00:01:54.510> those<00:01:54.660> devices

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
to bring games to life on those devices

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.340 
to bring games to life on those devices
but<00:01:55.710> yeah<00:01:55.980> you<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.760> we<00:01:56.910> have<00:01:57.170> high<00:01:58.170> end

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
but yeah you know we have high end

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.500 
but yeah you know we have high end
processors<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.150> dedicated<00:02:00.150> graphics

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
processors now dedicated graphics

on<00:02:03.720> these<00:02:03.900> devices<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.910> for<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
on these devices and you know for the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.540 
on these devices and you know for the
first<00:02:06.330> time<00:02:06.540> we<00:02:07.260> can<00:02:07.410> really<00:02:07.620> look<00:02:07.830> at<00:02:08.009> taking

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
first time we can really look at taking

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.310 
first time we can really look at taking
the<00:02:08.700> kind<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:08.940> deep<00:02:09.210> immersive<00:02:09.720> experiences

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
the kind of deep immersive experiences

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.620 
the kind of deep immersive experiences
we've<00:02:10.890> always<00:02:11.100> made<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.520> PC<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.030> console<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
we've always made on PC and console and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.510 
we've always made on PC and console and
bring<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.650> mobile<00:02:13.890> platform<00:02:14.400> so

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
bring that to the mobile platform so

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.560 
bring that to the mobile platform so
that<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> haven't<00:02:14.910> your<00:02:15.030> pocket<00:02:15.330> wherever

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
that you haven't your pocket wherever

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.480 
that you haven't your pocket wherever
you<00:02:15.660> go<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.530> talk<00:02:16.709> about<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:17.010> immersive

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
you go can you talk about that immersive

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.449 
you go can you talk about that immersive
experience<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.209> me<00:02:18.450> guys<00:02:19.010> yeah<00:02:20.010> well<00:02:20.340> with

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
experience with me guys yeah well with

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.430 
experience with me guys yeah well with
moonrise<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.720> our<00:02:21.840> goal<00:02:22.050> was<00:02:22.260> to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
moonrise you know that our goal was to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.090 
moonrise you know that our goal was to
create<00:02:22.620> an<00:02:23.040> immersive<00:02:23.490> RPG<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.980> know

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
create an immersive RPG and you know

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.949 
create an immersive RPG and you know
combat<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.670> always<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> big<00:02:27.180> part<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.660> in

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
combat is always a big part of that in

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.070 
combat is always a big part of that in
any<00:02:28.170> RPG<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:30.270> know<00:02:30.360> what<00:02:30.510> we<00:02:30.600> didn't<00:02:30.900> want<00:02:31.020> to

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
any RPG you know what we didn't want to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.140 
any RPG you know what we didn't want to
do<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.380> kind<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> standard

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
do is kind of a standard

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.140 
do is kind of a standard
rock-paper-scissors<00:02:33.150> very<00:02:33.570> surface<00:02:33.989> level

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
rock-paper-scissors very surface level

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.000 
rock-paper-scissors very surface level
simplistic<00:02:36.150> combat<00:02:36.510> model<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:37.920> we

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
simplistic combat model and so what we

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.400 
simplistic combat model and so what we
started<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.400> actually<00:02:38.940> was<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.810> magic<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
started with actually was a magic the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.979 
started with actually was a magic the
gathering<00:02:40.620> style<00:02:41.280> combat<00:02:42.180> model<00:02:42.360> something

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
gathering style combat model something

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.840 
gathering style combat model something
that's<00:02:43.110> very<00:02:43.170> deep<00:02:43.530> very<00:02:44.040> sophisticated<00:02:44.340> easy

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
that's very deep very sophisticated easy

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.630 
that's very deep very sophisticated easy
to<00:02:45.030> learn<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.870> through<00:02:46.860> combinatorial

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
to learn but through combinatorial

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.570 
to learn but through combinatorial
effects<00:02:48.000> through<00:02:48.800> emergent<00:02:49.800> strategies<00:02:50.310> that

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
effects through emergent strategies that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.729 
effects through emergent strategies that
are<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:51.600> are<00:02:51.660> possible<00:02:52.170> because<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
are that are possible because of all the

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.949 
are that are possible because of all the
different<00:02:53.070> combinations<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.910> skills<00:02:54.630> and

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
different combinations of skills and

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.140 
different combinations of skills and
strategies<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.860> know<00:02:55.950> we<00:02:56.070> wanted<00:02:56.489> that<00:02:56.519> level

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
strategies you know we wanted that level

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.539 
strategies you know we wanted that level
of<00:02:57.330> sophistication<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.620> be<00:02:58.799> there<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
of sophistication to be there in the

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.600 
of sophistication to be there in the
combat<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.269> think<00:03:00.540> first<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.380> foremost

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
combat and so I think first and foremost

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.460 
combat and so I think first and foremost
that's<00:03:02.610> what<00:03:02.880> we<00:03:03.030> tackled<00:03:03.510> was<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.200> make<00:03:04.350> sure

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
that's what we tackled was to make sure

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.500 
that's what we tackled was to make sure
that<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.799> deep<00:03:05.070> immersive<00:03:05.790> interesting

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
that we have deep immersive interesting

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.199 
that we have deep immersive interesting
challenging<00:03:07.110> strategic<00:03:07.680> combat<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.970> talk<00:03:09.180> a

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
challenging strategic combat you talk a

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.720 
challenging strategic combat you talk a
little<00:03:09.540> bit<00:03:09.750> about<00:03:10.280> specifically<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.580> this

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
little bit about specifically for this

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.120 
little bit about specifically for this
game<00:03:11.910> how<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.180> guys<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.840> applied<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
game how you guys have applied the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.310 
game how you guys have applied the
shorter<00:03:14.670> gameplay<00:03:15.209> sessions<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.049> people

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
shorter gameplay sessions that people

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.620 
shorter gameplay sessions that people
typically<00:03:16.650> have<00:03:16.920> with<00:03:17.130> mobile<00:03:17.489> yeah<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.390> think

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
typically have with mobile yeah I think

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.490 
typically have with mobile yeah I think
one<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.930> things<00:03:18.989> you'll<00:03:19.200> notice<00:03:19.320> right

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
one of the things you'll notice right

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.530 
one of the things you'll notice right
off<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.280> for<00:03:20.820> example<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.239> notion<00:03:21.510> of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
off is that for example the notion of

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.170 
off is that for example the notion of
travel<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.080> very<00:03:22.290> different<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:22.860> game

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
travel is very different in this game

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.670 
travel is very different in this game
you<00:03:24.180> know<00:03:24.299> you're<00:03:24.480> not<00:03:24.600> wandering<00:03:25.140> around<00:03:25.230> in

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
you know you're not wandering around in

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.670 
you know you're not wandering around in
a<00:03:25.799> kind<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.340> virtual<00:03:26.700> 3d<00:03:27.350> universe<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.650> which

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
a kind of virtual 3d universe of which
