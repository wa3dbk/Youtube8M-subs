00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.230
 smart times lucerne switzerland bicycle 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:11.170
 smart electric and bike hello welcome 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.720
 to km 77 the web page 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.420
 of electric bicycles this is a 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.980
 more bikes to see if it looks all is 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.050
 that I do not have more angular like that especially 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.329
 I'll explain how this works 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.460
 the smart electric bicycle whose 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.370
 price in spain I do not know but I 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.860
 I will find out I do not know if it is sold 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.510
 and I'll put it on the video here 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.320
 embedded somewhere I'm going to upload 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.040
 because it's more comfortable, this is the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.890
 handlebar 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.890
 of the electric bicycle is more here 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.130
 there is a painting I have to put on 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.430
 so that it does not give good reflection if I give it 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:57.080
 here to the most in here has to the left 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.410
 of the handlebar has more and less if I give it 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.410
 to the most 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.120
 it means that it helps me to pedal 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.300
 you can normally go flat without this 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.900
 problems and when the rises come 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.900
 they give him more help I tried it yesterday and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.790
 it shows a lot the help say that the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.190
 autonomy are zinc that is 100 km 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.470
 it depends on the kilometers of how much 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.810
 of your life when the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.810
 autonomy varies a lot good when it goes 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.990
 in descent can be recovered if it is given 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.990
 at least 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.460
 on the bike recharges energy yo yesterday 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.340
 I was pedaling and going downhill 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.770
 I pedaled with the least because I did not 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.940
 It was hard to pedal a bit already worked 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.280
 helped and with this recharging I recovered 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.700
 some energy in the battery to 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.300
 back to help you have to give the most 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.300
 I give to the most 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.749
 and the help grows and I give it at least 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.359
 and the recharge starts the little arrows 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.300
 down that with all the reflections is not 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.980
 come good is a bit complicated this 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.540
 study here on the street is a bit 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.099
 complicated the little arrows below 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.370
 indicate if you are going from the bicycle to the 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.370
 drums 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:25.420
 or from the battery the bicycle is the hand 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.700
 left with the right hand and I have 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.379
 to take the camera with grab the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.269
 camera with the other hand 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.269
 we have the gear change here 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.590
 we have now I was in third I'm 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.840
 putting first 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.420
 as a normal change of car or of 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.030
 first bike you have to pedal 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.470
 a lot and you run little with little effort 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.010
 for the climbs 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.239
 in second normal for the plain and in 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.420
 third for the descent is very simple 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.930
 It seems complicated but when you go in 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.629
 March is very simple the only downside that 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.780
 the encounter is that the painting is not 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.370
 very down and if one looks at the beginning 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.290
 then I think that it is already customary and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.030
 you need to look at it to know in what 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.709
 point is therefore they lose much vision 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.340
 of the road if the front stops 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.680
 cars if you crash or if you stop 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.579
 low but except that in the rest very 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.930
 all right 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.930
 thanks bye
