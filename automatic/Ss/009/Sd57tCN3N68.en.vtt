00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.000 
platform as it was rising to get that uh
to<00:03:31.720> get<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:31.989> at<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.170> end<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.500> think<00:03:32.530> if<00:03:32.769> he<00:03:32.860> was

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
to get that at the end I think if he was

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.229 
to get that at the end I think if he was
a<00:03:33.040> little<00:03:33.280> bit<00:03:33.400> later<00:03:33.579> he<00:03:33.760> wouldn't<00:03:34.000> been<00:03:34.090> able

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
a little bit later he wouldn't been able

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.060 
a little bit later he wouldn't been able
to<00:03:34.360> get<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.600> do<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.840> yeah<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.860> I<00:03:36.010> think

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
to get to do that yeah and I think

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.130 
to get to do that yeah and I think
Eddie's<00:03:36.640> punishes<00:03:37.209> right<00:03:37.390> now<00:03:37.540> are<00:03:37.780> looking

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
Eddie's punishes right now are looking

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.280 
Eddie's punishes right now are looking
they're<00:03:38.290> insane<00:03:38.640> just<00:03:39.810> phenomenal<00:03:40.810> yeah<00:03:41.049> he

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
they're insane just phenomenal yeah he

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.960 
they're insane just phenomenal yeah he
was<00:03:41.410> just<00:03:41.560> doing<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:42.010> much<00:03:42.070> damage<00:03:42.190> every<00:03:42.760> time

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
was just doing so much damage every time

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.280 
was just doing so much damage every time
he<00:03:43.120> touches<00:03:43.329> vector

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
he touches vector

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.179 
he touches vector
oh<00:03:45.000> my<00:03:46.000> god<00:03:46.510> vector<00:03:47.409> is<00:03:47.530> gonna<00:03:47.709> have<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:47.950> take<00:03:48.129> a

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
oh my god vector is gonna have to take a

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.039 
oh my god vector is gonna have to take a
little<00:03:48.609> differently<00:03:48.969> I<00:03:49.030> think<00:03:49.329> man<00:03:49.510> yeah<00:03:49.810> like

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
little differently I think man yeah like

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.539 
little differently I think man yeah like
he<00:03:50.200> keeps<00:03:50.379> taking<00:03:50.769> in<00:03:50.890> but<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.129> other<00:03:51.280> thing

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
he keeps taking in but the other thing

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.039 
he keeps taking in but the other thing
is<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.790> that's<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.359> don't<00:03:52.420> think<00:03:52.689> that's<00:03:52.900> a

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
is that that's I don't think that's a

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.020 
is that that's I don't think that's a
particularly<00:03:53.290> easy<00:03:53.650> tech<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.129> hit<00:03:54.340> wavedash

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
particularly easy tech to hit wavedash

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.729 
particularly easy tech to hit wavedash
for<00:03:55.359> till<00:03:55.599> is<00:03:55.810> like<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.349> knocks<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.680> down

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
for till is like it knocks you down

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
the ground well you're obviously dying

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.429 
the ground well you're obviously dying
in<00:04:03.549> and<00:04:03.849> you<00:04:04.420> have<00:04:04.569> to<00:04:04.689> switch<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.109> control

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
in and you have to switch the control

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.289 
in and you have to switch the control
stick<00:04:05.680> very<00:04:06.010> quickly<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.670> then<00:04:06.879> he<00:04:07.000> Mexico

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
stick very quickly and then he Mexico

stick very quickly and then he Mexico
has<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.450> read<00:04:07.689> that<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.109> know<00:04:08.230> vector<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.829> not

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
has a read that you know vector is not

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.559 
has a read that you know vector is not
confident<00:04:09.400> comfortable<00:04:09.549> doing<00:04:09.909> that<00:04:10.030> right

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
confident comfortable doing that right

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.270 
confident comfortable doing that right
the<00:04:11.019> other<00:04:11.109> thing<00:04:11.349> is<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.530> expected<00:04:12.069> him<00:04:12.159> to

is just grew yeah that is that is Ruth
at<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.699> absolutely<00:04:31.330> no<00:04:31.690> CMU<00:04:32.470> p.m.<00:04:33.990> yeah<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.380> hope

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
at is absolutely no CMU p.m. yeah I hope

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.680 
at is absolutely no CMU p.m. yeah I hope
picture<00:04:36.220> any<00:04:36.400> time<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.789> transform<00:04:37.270> their<00:04:37.509> I

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
picture any time to transform their I

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.850 
picture any time to transform their I
think<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.349> night<00:04:38.530> was<00:04:38.590> absolutely

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
think that night was absolutely

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.499 
think that night was absolutely
middleweight<00:04:39.699> let<00:04:39.820> me<00:04:39.910> let<00:04:40.090> me<00:04:40.180> turn<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:40.360> back

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
middleweight let me let me turn it back

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.750 
middleweight let me let me turn it back
in<00:04:40.630> this
