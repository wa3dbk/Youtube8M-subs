around<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.700> edges<00:02:35.000> again<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.900> where<00:02:36.020> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
around the edges again this is where the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.720 
around the edges again this is where the
wooden<00:02:36.500> bowl<00:02:36.709> comes<00:02:36.980> into<00:02:37.160> play<00:02:37.340> if<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.580> was<00:02:37.700> a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
wooden bowl comes into play if it was a

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.310 
wooden bowl comes into play if it was a
metal<00:02:38.030> bowl<00:02:38.180> just<00:02:38.510> all<00:02:38.690> fall<00:02:38.930> down<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.290> the

metal bowl just all fall down to the
middle<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.820> process<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.570> how<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.750> put<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
middle the process of how you put the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.949 
middle the process of how you put the
ingredients<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.070> how<00:02:43.310> they<00:02:43.520> are<00:02:43.959> mixed

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
ingredients in and how they are mixed

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.229 
ingredients in and how they are mixed
together<00:02:45.050> is<00:02:45.410> just<00:02:45.620> as<00:02:45.739> important<00:02:46.220> same<00:02:47.090> thing

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
together is just as important same thing

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.490

now nice quality of a lot of people are

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.300 
now nice quality of a lot of people are
afraid<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.660> eggs<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.200> could<00:02:58.500> use<00:02:58.740> an<00:02:59.040> egg

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
afraid of eggs you could use an egg

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.970 
afraid of eggs you could use an egg
beater<00:02:59.550> I'm<00:03:00.420> not<00:03:00.660> afraid<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.680> put<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
beater I'm not afraid I like to put the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.270 
beater I'm not afraid I like to put the
egg<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.250> there<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:03.360> put<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.750> egg<00:03:03.960> yolk<00:03:04.290> that's

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
egg in there we put the egg yolk that's

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.340 
egg in there we put the egg yolk that's
what<00:03:05.580> actually<00:03:06.390> when<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.930> think<00:03:07.140> about<00:03:07.170> it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
what actually when you think about it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.540 
what actually when you think about it
we're<00:03:07.470> really<00:03:07.650> kind<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.130> making<00:03:08.370> a

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
we're really kind of like making a

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.980 
we're really kind of like making a
mayonnaise<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.230> need<00:03:10.410> egg<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.770> do<00:03:10.890> that

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
mayonnaise and you need egg to do that

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.820 
mayonnaise and you need egg to do that
so<00:03:12.990> there<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.680> go

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
so there we go

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:24.950 
so there we go
mixture<00:03:16.830> going<00:03:22.850> this<00:03:23.850> takes<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.900> little

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
mixture going this takes a little

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.380 
mixture going this takes a little
practice<00:03:25.470> we're<00:03:26.130> using<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.640> ends<00:03:27.210> of<00:03:27.300> the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
practice we're using the ends of the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.670 
practice we're using the ends of the
fork<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:28.260> pull<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:29.310> oil<00:03:29.540> slowly<00:03:30.540> pulling<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
fork to pull the oil slowly pulling the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.600 
fork to pull the oil slowly pulling the
oil<00:03:31.890> into<00:03:32.520> our<00:03:32.550> mixture<00:03:34.100> it's<00:03:35.100> as<00:03:35.280> if<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.520> were

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
oil into our mixture it's as if you were

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.250 
oil into our mixture it's as if you were
making<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.210> have<00:03:36.360> ever<00:03:36.540> made<00:03:36.750> mayonnaise

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
making if you have ever made mayonnaise

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.200 
making if you have ever made mayonnaise
in<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.800> blender<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.280> have<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.550> add<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.970> oil

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
in a blender you have to add the oil

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.100 
in a blender you have to add the oil
very<00:03:39.660> slowly<00:03:39.990> same<00:03:40.440> thing<00:03:40.650> here<00:03:41.690> so<00:03:42.690> you'll

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
very slowly same thing here so you'll

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.010 
very slowly same thing here so you'll
notice<00:03:43.500> I'm<00:03:44.310> using<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.670> edges<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.600> fork

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
notice I'm using the edges of the fork

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
notice I'm using the edges of the fork
to<00:03:46.740> pull<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.550> oil<00:03:47.750> slowly<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.710> you'll<00:03:49.860> see

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to pull in the oil slowly and you'll see

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.860 
to pull in the oil slowly and you'll see
it<00:03:50.160> whip<00:03:50.340> up

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.780 

I<00:03:57.930> go<00:03:58.560> around<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.950> bowl<00:04:00.860> pulling<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:02.010> up<00:04:02.190> to

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
I go around the bowl pulling it up to

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:21.160 
I go around the bowl pulling it up to
the<00:04:02.879> side<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.299> bowl

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.660 

and<00:04:22.170> now<00:04:22.500> for<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.070> lettuce<00:04:25.190> use<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.340> romaine

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
and now for the lettuce use the romaine

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
I don't use a knife I just tear it into

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.730 
I don't use a knife I just tear it into
pieces<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.419> kind<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.080> deveined<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.590> little

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
pieces I kind of deveined it a little

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.870 
pieces I kind of deveined it a little
bit<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:35.880> get<00:04:36.000> rid<00:04:36.180> of<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.830> white<00:04:38.040> but<00:04:38.760> it
