cantaloupe fresh-squeezed orange juice
and<00:00:17.850> kale<00:00:18.510> that's<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.529> no<00:00:20.160> other<00:00:20.340> things<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
and kale that's it no other things and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
combination together it's so complete

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.990 
combination together it's so complete
that<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.529> tastes<00:00:32.130> really<00:00:32.219> good<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> in

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that it just tastes really good and in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.479
