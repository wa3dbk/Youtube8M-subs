touch keyboard one of the things that we

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.869 
touch keyboard one of the things that we
realized<00:02:49.440> though<00:02:49.769> when<00:02:50.160> we<00:02:50.190> were<00:02:50.370> using<00:02:50.549> it

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
realized though when we were using it

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.330 
realized though when we were using it
was<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.480> typing<00:02:52.140> requires<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.099> with<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
was that typing requires you with to

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.610 
was that typing requires you with to
reach<00:02:53.519> all<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.090> way<00:02:54.120> into<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.870> middle<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.319> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
reach all the way into the middle of the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.619 
reach all the way into the middle of the
screen<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.879> designed<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.329> thumbs

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
screen and so we designed this thumbs

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.569 
screen and so we designed this thumbs
lab<00:02:57.930> which<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.379> sort<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> more<00:02:58.829> ergonomic<00:02:59.430> and

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
lab which is sort of more ergonomic and

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.410 
lab which is sort of more ergonomic and
it<00:03:00.060> feels<00:03:00.360> really<00:03:00.930> naturally<00:03:01.470> used<00:03:02.269> windows<00:03:03.269> 8

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
it feels really naturally used windows 8

it feels really naturally used windows 8
