00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.100 
I'm going to try to do is take out that
lead<00:00:44.670> ship<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> way<00:00:45.899> on

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
lead ship that you see all the way on

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.360 
lead ship that you see all the way on
the<00:00:46.140> left<00:00:48.079> my<00:00:49.079> first<00:00:49.350> raid<00:00:49.559> should<00:00:49.739> easily<00:00:49.890> do

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the left my first raid should easily do

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:02.720 
the left my first raid should easily do
it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.070 

again<00:01:03.730> online<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.180> best<00:01:04.420> positions<00:01:04.960> right

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
again online the best positions right

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.600 
again online the best positions right
now<00:01:05.200> because<00:01:05.380> so<00:01:05.530> my<00:01:05.740> ships<00:01:05.950> are<00:01:06.130> firing<00:01:06.550> on

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
now because so my ships are firing on

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.180 
now because so my ships are firing on
each<00:01:06.730> other<00:01:06.940> but<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:08.290> will<00:01:08.590> work<00:01:08.770> out<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.100> a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
each other but it will work out in a

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.980 
each other but it will work out in a
couple<00:01:09.310> minutes<00:01:09.580> where<00:01:09.940> you'll<00:01:10.090> see<00:01:10.360> how<00:01:10.930> the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
couple minutes where you'll see how the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:21.800 
couple minutes where you'll see how the
whole<00:01:11.290> strategy<00:01:11.530> works<00:01:11.860> up

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 

so<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.649> already<00:01:22.890> took<00:01:23.100> care<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so now I already took care of one of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.190 
so now I already took care of one of
their<00:01:23.759> ships<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:24.659> you're<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> see

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
their ships and now you're going to see

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.719 
their ships and now you're going to see
how<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> try<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> cut<00:01:26.280> off<00:01:26.430> their

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
how I'm going to try to cut off their

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:39.390 
how I'm going to try to cut off their
lines

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.850 

so<00:01:40.060> simply<00:01:40.450> by<00:01:40.480> moving<00:01:40.840> my<00:01:41.050> first<00:01:41.500> rate<00:01:41.710> in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
so simply by moving my first rate in

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.890 
so simply by moving my first rate in
front<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.190> their<00:01:42.340> lead<00:01:42.550> ship<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.300> slow<00:01:43.630> all

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
front of their lead ship you slow all

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.780 
front of their lead ship you slow all
their<00:01:44.110> ships<00:01:44.320> down<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.860> now<00:01:45.100> i'm<00:01:45.520> going<00:01:45.700> to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
their ships down and now i'm going to

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.610 
their ships down and now i'm going to
try<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.940> get<00:01:46.150> sort<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.750> kill<00:01:47.020> zone<00:01:47.050> i'm<00:01:47.500> gonna

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
try to get sort of a kill zone i'm gonna

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.560 
try to get sort of a kill zone i'm gonna
put<00:01:47.800> all<00:01:47.920> my<00:01:47.980> ships<00:01:48.370> around<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:50.220> french<00:01:51.220> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
put all my ships around the french and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:19.730 
put all my ships around the french and
just<00:01:52.570> keep<00:01:52.750> on<00:01:52.930> hitting<00:01:53.230> them<00:01:53.350> with<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.770> camp

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.650 

change<00:02:20.340> shot<00:02:20.610> also<00:02:20.850> helps<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.420> kind<00:02:21.630> of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
change shot also helps in this kind of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.890 
change shot also helps in this kind of
situation<00:02:21.780> where<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.620> want<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.750> alter<00:02:24.750> any

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
situation where you want to alter any

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.380 
situation where you want to alter any
basically<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.430> now<00:02:26.580> all<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.030> ships<00:02:27.270> are

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
basically so now all the ships are

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.270 
basically so now all the ships are
basically<00:02:27.750> slowed<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:28.950> gonna<00:02:29.070> get

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
basically slowed down I'm just gonna get

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160 
basically slowed down I'm just gonna get
around<00:02:29.550> them<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.970> probably<00:02:30.660> run<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> minute

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
around them in probably run a minute

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.110 
around them in probably run a minute
from<00:02:31.290> now<00:02:31.350> I'm<00:02:31.710> going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.070> them<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.460> sort

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
from now I'm going to get them in sort

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.550 
from now I'm going to get them in sort
of<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.330> kill<00:02:33.540> zone<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.990> just<00:02:34.230> keep<00:02:34.410> on

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
of a kill zone and just keep on

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.260 
of a kill zone and just keep on
bothering<00:02:34.740> them<00:02:35.040> at<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.820> ruler<00:02:36.060> out

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
bothering them at the the ruler out

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.050 
bothering them at the the ruler out
pretty<00:02:36.630> fast<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.430> really<00:02:38.430> take<00:02:38.670> care<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.000> this

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
the friendships because what Campbells

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.720 
the friendships because what Campbells
are<00:03:36.380> shot<00:03:36.590> close<00:03:36.770> range<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.160> keep<00:03:37.310> on<00:03:37.490> going

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
are shot close range to keep on going

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.890 
are shot close range to keep on going
across<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.120> ship's<00:03:38.300> neck<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.780> they're

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
across the ship's neck and they're

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.230 
across the ship's neck and they're
hitting<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.350> two<00:03:40.190> or<00:03:40.220> three<00:03:40.520> enemy<00:03:40.790> ships<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.090> lot
