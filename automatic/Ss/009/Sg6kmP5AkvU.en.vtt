00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
quite clean with this and do you think

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.420 
quite clean with this and do you think
Weber's<00:01:21.180> recent<00:01:21.509> success<00:01:21.840> has<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> him<00:01:22.430> no

I think that you know you got two guys
running<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.759> front<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.240> inevitable

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
running at the front it's inevitable

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.179 
running at the front it's inevitable
that<00:01:27.869> they're<00:01:28.020> gonna<00:01:28.200> erase<00:01:28.680> each<00:01:28.829> other<00:01:29.009> hard

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that they're gonna erase each other hard

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.440 
that they're gonna erase each other hard
but<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.579> thing<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.060> ask<00:01:30.240> is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
but the one thing that you do ask is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
but the one thing that you do ask is
that<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.689> give<00:01:30.840> each<00:01:30.869> other<00:01:31.170> space<00:01:31.380> which

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that they give each other space which

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.340 
that they give each other space which
they've<00:01:31.920> always<00:01:32.040> been<00:01:32.220> very<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.729> good<00:01:32.850> at

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
they've always been very very good at

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.539 
they've always been very very good at
today<00:01:35.090> neither<00:01:36.090> yielded<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
today neither yielded and you know the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.760 
today neither yielded and you know the
result<00:01:38.880> was<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.960> team<00:01:40.170> losing<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> lot<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
result was the team losing a lot of
