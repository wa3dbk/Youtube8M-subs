00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.910
 hi to all and axel of hostesses 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.580
 mobile.fr and watches point fr we are at 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.790
 cs 2014 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.340
 of mike chronos which is a brand 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.110
 Swiss who produces watches that is 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.779
 a watchmaker and who shows us here 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.640
 several smartphones here a world 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.580
 what's called the splash with a z 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.130
 is so I dare beach why because 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.779
 that it is protected against 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.580
 splashing attention l is not 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.989
 waterproof itself she is 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.330
 splash-proof it's 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.360
 still interesting for a watch 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.680
 it costs 149 euros 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.380
 she has one 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 240 million battery we lose it's 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.820
 a little battery but she 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.530
 still allows to have 90 hours 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.890
 Standby time 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:01.110
 we have a 1.54 thrust screen of 240 by 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.370
 240 with 256 mo of memory and that's at 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.510
 just about everything at the level of 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.870
 features but eventually that is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.670
 what we have 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.510
 Nabila on them like any 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 amount it is bluetooth compatible 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.940
 3.0 and connects with android and ios 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 so for example for ios you go 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.000
 to have syria just here toc 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.800
 if I can make it work 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.570
 this is where you are going to have syria 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.860
 of course just for ios and for android 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.680
 you'll be able to access your sms that kind 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.830
 of things it also allows for re 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.000
 receive calls and converse 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.040
 simply because she is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.800
 official bluetooth 3.0 and you 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.580
 here you have the interface with your 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.200
 smartphone 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.910
 of course when you receive a call 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.710
 see the name of the person calling 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.750
 you can have your notifications 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.110
 you can have the opportunity to be 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.970
 alerted if you deviate a little too much 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.920
 far from that world that's really 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.590
 pretty classic features there is a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
 pedometer can record voice and 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 you can also manage your reading 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.630
 musical so here for example here tells me 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.510
 I'm not connected that's why 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.180
 that I can not control 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.550
 music we have a calculator 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.510
 features like this it you 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.190
 nice on the side we have a button on / off 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.510
 fake 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.950
 here is hop there a button name that helps 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.960
 get back to this screen very quickly 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.430
 main 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.320
 there we can dial a number men 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.280
 here is for example I'm going to do that 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.720
 she is not connected so I'm going 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.780
 not be able to make a call but this 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.010
 would be entirely possible and I think 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.700
 that we did pretty much the trick there you 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.000
 have your your list of contacts 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.200
 pedometer recording his alarm 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.500
 Here I think we toured it 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.300
 rather nice watch with possibility a 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.190
 priori to change way the bracelet 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.570
 from what I see there that looks 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.920
 rather comfortable too I have not yet 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.730
 tried but we will surely have the opportunity 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.170
 to test it 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.170
 see you soon
