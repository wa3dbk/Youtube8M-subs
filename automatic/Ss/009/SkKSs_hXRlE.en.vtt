free-kick<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> goalkeeper<00:01:50.189> manages<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
free-kick but the goalkeeper manages to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.359 
free-kick but the goalkeeper manages to
just<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.720> his<00:01:52.200> hands<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.189> thought

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
just get his hands on that one I thought

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.740 
just get his hands on that one I thought
we<00:01:53.520> had<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> chance<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.270> score<00:01:54.509> right<00:01:54.689> there

we had a chance to score right there

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.810 
we had a chance to score right there
then<00:01:55.049> linic<00:01:55.380> astir<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.799> goal<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.610> thought

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
then linic astir on goal and I thought

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.520 
then linic astir on goal and I thought
if<00:01:57.000> anything<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.570> would<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.020> keeper<00:01:58.409> would

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
if anything that would the keeper would

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.830 
if anything that would the keeper would
save<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.610> fact<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.060> lovely<00:02:00.570> long

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
save that one but in fact a lovely long

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.039 
save that one but in fact a lovely long

defensive block from his defender

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.539 
defensive block from his defender
stopped<00:02:04.049> me<00:02:04.170> from<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.680> nil<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.189> before

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
stopped me from going to nil up before

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.100

half-time<00:02:05.820> we've<00:02:06.240> had<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> lot<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.719> shots<00:02:06.869> in

half-time we've had a lot of shots in
this<00:02:07.229> game<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> second<00:02:08.640> half<00:02:08.700> completely

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
this game but the second half completely

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.130 
this game but the second half completely
changed<00:02:09.660> everything

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
changed everything

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.740

Chicago<00:02:10.590> gets<00:02:10.890> through<00:02:11.250> Chicago<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.390> scores

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
Chicago gets through Chicago we scores

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.450 
Chicago gets through Chicago we scores
and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.040 
and
I thought<00:02:13.790> yeah<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.180> sort<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.540> slowed<00:02:14.810> down

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
I thought yeah I sort of slowed down

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.600 
I thought yeah I sort of slowed down
with<00:02:15.230> my<00:02:15.320> defender<00:02:15.770> because<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.100> thought<00:02:16.400> that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
with my defender because I thought that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.340 
with my defender because I thought that
he<00:02:16.670> was<00:02:16.760> gonna<00:02:16.940> sort<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.330> McGee<00:02:17.630> D<00:02:17.690> spin<00:02:18.080> into

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
he was gonna sort of McGee D spin into

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.830 
he was gonna sort of McGee D spin into
the<00:02:18.470> back<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.830> net<00:02:19.040> but<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.390> know<00:02:20.510> he<00:02:20.630> just

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
the back of the net but you know he just

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.180

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
towards the end there after a very

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.220 
towards the end there after a very
strong<00:03:01.910> first<00:03:02.120> half<00:03:02.330> which<00:03:02.690> was<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:03.050> bit

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
strong first half which was a bit

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.350

room<00:03:27.620> sometimes<00:03:28.070> sometimes<00:03:28.490> you<00:03:28.550> can<00:03:28.790> but

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
room sometimes sometimes you can but

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.480 
room sometimes sometimes you can but
this<00:03:29.300> particular<00:03:29.540> game<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.380> certainly<00:03:31.190> could

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
this particular game I certainly could

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.950 
this particular game I certainly could
no<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.670> had<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.090> one<00:03:32.120> or<00:03:32.480> two<00:03:32.510> opportunities

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
no I had like one or two opportunities

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.440 
no I had like one or two opportunities
to<00:03:33.530> get<00:03:33.710> through<00:03:34.010> when<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.280> did<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:34.850> don't<00:03:35.210> know<00:03:35.420> I

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
to get through when I did I don't know I

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.720 
to get through when I did I don't know I
just<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.930> was<00:03:36.080> outside<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:36.890> box<00:03:37.280> or<00:03:37.490> something

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
just it was outside the box or something

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.090 
just it was outside the box or something
like<00:03:37.820> that<00:03:37.880> because<00:03:38.180> if<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:38.480> took<00:03:38.540> an<00:03:38.810> extra

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
like that because if I took an extra

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.530 
like that because if I took an extra
stride<00:03:40.100> or<00:03:40.130> two<00:03:40.490> I<00:03:40.520> would<00:03:40.760> have<00:03:40.880> been<00:03:41.030> tackled

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
stride or two I would have been tackled

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.540 
stride or two I would have been tackled
and<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.780> was<00:03:41.900> just<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.560> wasn't<00:03:42.830> how<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.400> wanted

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
and it was just it wasn't how I wanted

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.060 
and it was just it wasn't how I wanted
it<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.300> go<00:03:44.330> down<00:03:44.510> now<00:03:45.170> from<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.440> coronary<00:03:45.860> play

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
it to go down now from a coronary play

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.350 
it to go down now from a coronary play
sit<00:03:46.250> with<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.430> goalkeeper<00:03:46.700> which<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.210> thought

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
sit with the goalkeeper which I thought

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.180 
sit with the goalkeeper which I thought
was<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.540> bit<00:03:47.690> stupid<00:03:47.930> but<00:03:48.320> look<00:03:48.800> for<00:03:48.920> what<00:03:49.040> my

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
was a bit stupid but look for what my

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.580 
was a bit stupid but look for what my
keeper<00:03:49.610> does<00:03:49.820> he<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.300> hurries<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:51.020> out<00:03:51.200> what

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
keeper does he just hurries it out what

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.690 
keeper does he just hurries it out what

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
Bravo you should not be doing that son

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.190 
Bravo you should not be doing that son
