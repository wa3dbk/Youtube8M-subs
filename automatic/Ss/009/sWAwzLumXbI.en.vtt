00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.320 
nice positive now one thing I have to
bring<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> he's<00:01:17.640> tackling<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.240> actually

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
bring up is he's tackling I was actually

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.420 
bring up is he's tackling I was actually
very<00:01:18.540> impressed<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:19.049> his<00:01:19.530> tracking<00:01:20.250> back

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
very impressed with his tracking back

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.550 
very impressed with his tracking back
and<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> fact<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.270> amid<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> tackles<00:01:22.200> he

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and the fact that amid the tackles he

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.870 
and the fact that amid the tackles he
didn't<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:22.920> feel<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.220> weak<00:01:23.640> when

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
didn't actually feel that weak when

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
didn't actually feel that weak when
tackling<00:01:24.090> which<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.420> our<00:01:24.540> obviously<00:01:24.900> quite

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
tackling which is our obviously quite

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.660 
tackling which is our obviously quite
impressive<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.040> he<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> wall

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
impressive but when he was on the wall

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
impressive but when he was on the wall
did<00:01:27.060> feel<00:01:27.270> pretty<00:01:27.299> weak<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.320> have

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
did feel pretty weak and if you do have

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.410 
did feel pretty weak and if you do have
him<00:01:29.040> him<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.460> possession<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.030> need<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
him him in possession you need to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.940 
him him in possession you need to
dribble<00:01:30.659> around<00:01:30.930> defenders<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.710> need<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
dribble around defenders you need to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.260 
dribble around defenders you need to
stay<00:01:32.100> away<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> strong<00:01:32.729> rich<00:01:32.880> fielders

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
stay away from the strong rich fielders

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.700 
stay away from the strong rich fielders
otherwise<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:34.020> will<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.350> hit<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> ball

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
otherwise they will just hit the ball

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.499 
otherwise they will just hit the ball
often<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.130> ease<00:01:35.310> which<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.880> am<00:01:36.030> pretty<00:01:36.360> much

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
often with ease which is am pretty much

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.030 
often with ease which is am pretty much
something<00:01:36.840> most<00:01:37.049> people<00:01:37.140> already<00:01:37.829> know

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
something most people already know

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.590 
something most people already know
anyway<00:01:38.159> cuz<00:01:38.430> he's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> pretty<00:01:38.790> weak<00:01:39.000> card<00:01:39.240> but

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
anyway cuz he's a pretty weak card but

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.880 
anyway cuz he's a pretty weak card but
he<00:01:39.689> has<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> agility<00:01:40.350> he's<00:01:40.619> got<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
he has got the agility he's got the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.410 
he has got the agility he's got the
dribbling<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.640> around<00:01:41.850> defenders<00:01:42.299> if

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
dribbling to get around defenders if

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.149 
dribbling to get around defenders if
need<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> pace<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:43.979> so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
need be and it's got the pace to do so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.950 
need be and it's got the pace to do so
as<00:01:44.250> well<00:01:44.280> talking<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.630> thing<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.869> need

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
as well talking to this one thing I need

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
as well talking to this one thing I need
to<00:01:46.079> bring<00:01:46.229> your<00:01:46.350> fears<00:01:46.530> his<00:01:46.770> acceleration<00:01:47.189> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
to bring your fears his acceleration is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.639 
to bring your fears his acceleration is
very<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:48.270> off<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> mark<00:01:48.869> he<00:01:49.049> feels<00:01:49.290> very

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
very good off the mark he feels very

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.350 
very good off the mark he feels very
freaking<00:01:50.159> quick<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.850> once<00:01:51.030> he<00:01:51.119> gets<00:01:51.240> going

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
freaking quick but once he gets going

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.149 
freaking quick but once he gets going
he's<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.140> he<00:01:52.290> slowed<00:01:52.619> down<00:01:52.649> because<00:01:53.009> he's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
he's like he slowed down because he's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.980 
he's like he slowed down because he's
sprint<00:01:53.729> speed<00:01:53.909> isn't<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> great<00:01:54.750> in

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
sprint speed isn't that great in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
sprint speed isn't that great in
comparison<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> his<00:01:55.710> acceleration<00:01:56.369> it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
comparison to his acceleration it's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.100 
comparison to his acceleration it's
principes<00:01:57.000> decent<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.540> others<00:01:57.750> say<00:01:57.899> in

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
principes decent the others say in

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.289 
principes decent the others say in
comparison<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.829> your<00:01:58.950> acceleration<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.909> kinda

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
comparison to your acceleration it kinda

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.730 
comparison to your acceleration it kinda
feels<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:01.020> he's<00:02:01.229> slowing<00:02:01.530> down

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
feels like he's slowing down

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.230 
feels like he's slowing down
but<00:02:02.159> back<00:02:02.310> onto<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> passing<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.119> that's

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
but back onto the passing so that's

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.730 
but back onto the passing so that's
definitely<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> best<00:02:03.840> thing<00:02:03.960> about<00:02:04.020> him<00:02:04.320> his

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
definitely the best thing about him his

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.389 
definitely the best thing about him his
set-pieces

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
set-pieces

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.100 
set-pieces
were<00:02:05.790> awesome<00:02:06.180> i've<00:02:06.299> speeded<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.780> clip<00:02:06.960> up

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
were awesome i've speeded this clip up

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
were awesome i've speeded this clip up
here<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.590> every<00:02:08.369> time<00:02:08.580> he<00:02:08.640> crossed<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
here because every time he crossed the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.660 
here because every time he crossed the
ball<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.509> found<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.259> found<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.250> head<00:02:11.430> or

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
ball and it found the found the head or

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.780 
ball and it found the found the head or
the<00:02:11.760> feet<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.120> 105

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
the feet of 105

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.490 
the feet of 105
who<00:02:13.209> were<00:02:13.330> meant<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.599> be<00:02:13.720> attacking<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.349> I

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
who were meant to be attacking and I

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.960 
who were meant to be attacking and I
just<00:02:14.680> kept<00:02:14.860> messing<00:02:15.040> up<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> chance<00:02:15.610> but

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
just kept messing up the chance but

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.580 
just kept messing up the chance but
obviously<00:02:16.269> eventually<00:02:16.870> which<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.439> always

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
obviously eventually which is always

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.380 
obviously eventually which is always
great<00:02:17.799> crossing<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:18.640> was<00:02:18.760> gonna<00:02:18.879> score<00:02:19.180> so

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
great crossing we was gonna score so

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
great crossing we was gonna score so
nice<00:02:19.720> assist<00:02:20.019> focus<00:02:20.620> all<00:02:20.739> there<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.069> he<00:02:21.280> set

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
nice assist focus all there but he set

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.309 
nice assist focus all there but he set
up<00:02:21.879> a<00:02:22.030> lot<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.299> chances<00:02:22.689> that<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.079> didn't

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
up a lot of chances that I just didn't

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.020 
up a lot of chances that I just didn't
compare<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.280> was<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.430> bit<00:02:24.549> frustrated

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
compare so that was a bit frustrated

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.069 
compare so that was a bit frustrated
because<00:02:25.150> he<00:02:25.239> should<00:02:25.510> have<00:02:25.599> definitely<00:02:25.959> add

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
because he should have definitely add

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.569 
because he should have definitely add
some<00:02:26.470> more<00:02:26.650> assists<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.040> his<00:02:27.159> card<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.459> my

for a midfielder it shootings great and
obviously<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.989> can<00:02:35.079> do<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.379> on<00:02:35.500> both<00:02:35.890> feet

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
obviously you can do it on both feet

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.380 
obviously you can do it on both feet
which<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.280> pretty<00:02:36.489> awesome<00:02:36.640> he's<00:02:36.909> passing<00:02:37.150> is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
which is pretty awesome he's passing is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.970 
which is pretty awesome he's passing is
probably<00:02:37.659> up<00:02:37.900> there<00:02:38.349> with<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.620> best<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
probably up there with the best in the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.649 
probably up there with the best in the
game<00:02:39.129> very<00:02:39.519> very<00:02:39.579> good<00:02:39.849> pass<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.359> I<00:02:40.450> said

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
game very very good pass and as I said

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.149 
game very very good pass and as I said
because<00:02:41.019> he<00:02:41.109> can<00:02:41.230> do<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.349> on<00:02:41.440> both<00:02:41.470> feet<00:02:41.769> is<00:02:41.950> a

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
because he can do it on both feet is a

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.819 
because he can do it on both feet is a
huge<00:02:42.459> positives<00:02:42.939> negatively<00:02:43.900> his<00:02:44.409> strength

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
huge positives negatively his strength

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.860 
huge positives negatively his strength
it's<00:02:45.640> pretty<00:02:46.000> much<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.299> same<00:02:46.420> things<00:02:46.720> he's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
it's pretty much the same things he's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.210 
it's pretty much the same things he's
normal<00:02:47.140> cat<00:02:47.260> about<00:02:47.470> his<00:02:47.650> strength<00:02:47.890> lets<00:02:48.099> him

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
normal cat about his strength lets him

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.770 
normal cat about his strength lets him
down<00:02:48.340> as<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.970> mentioned<00:02:49.299> about<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.540> sprint

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
down as I mentioned about the sprint

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.479 
down as I mentioned about the sprint
speed<00:02:49.959> that's<00:02:50.109> not<00:02:50.290> me<00:02:50.409> saying<00:02:50.560> he's<00:02:50.769> slow<00:02:51.040> but

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
speed that's not me saying he's slow but

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.129 
speed that's not me saying he's slow but
it<00:02:51.579> just<00:02:52.030> feels<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.599> he's<00:02:52.810> slowing<00:02:53.109> down

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
it just feels like he's slowing down

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.390 
it just feels like he's slowing down
once<00:02:53.440> he<00:02:53.500> gets<00:02:53.680> going<00:02:53.769> because<00:02:54.069> his

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
once he gets going because his

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.369 
once he gets going because his
acceleration<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.150> good<00:02:55.359> and<00:02:55.720> he's<00:02:55.870> stamina

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
acceleration is so good and he's stamina

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.619 
acceleration is so good and he's stamina
I<00:02:56.530> felt<00:02:56.829> like<00:02:56.980> he<00:02:57.579> was<00:02:57.609> really<00:02:57.730> tired<00:02:58.239> by<00:02:58.510> at

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
I felt like he was really tired by at

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.660 
I felt like he was really tired by at
the<00:02:58.720> 70th<00:02:59.049> minute<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.500> then<00:02:59.709> yeah<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.430> made

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
the 70th minute and then yeah it made

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.979 
the 70th minute and then yeah it made
him<00:03:00.790> quite<00:03:00.970> hard<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.209> use<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.690> he<00:03:01.810> just

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
him quite hard to use because he just

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.660 
him quite hard to use because he just
wasn't<00:03:02.349> moving<00:03:02.709> he<00:03:02.859> just<00:03:03.010> wasn't<00:03:03.159> sprinting

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
wasn't moving he just wasn't sprinting

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.550 
wasn't moving he just wasn't sprinting
