00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 talk jonas crusade a certain then today 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.660
 we are there with the 78 50 to 2gb safari 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.390
 for sail on b4 passes through the workbench 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.420
 first the standard teacher in our 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.580
 test and 7 37 78 gb memory motherboard 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.829
 gigabyte 75 GB and video card 78 50 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:37.340
 staff plus one stolen to the shows at 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:58.410
 I can not find a job here. 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:59.489
 holding amazon takes everything fans do not 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.489
 had a tripod 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.040
 but it is not only this species at home is more 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.260
 easy is fact always plays 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.659
 so I want the agent tested the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.240
 The little girl that we're going to go for a little while 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.460
 that we can actually play 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.460
 more this thing worth the 4 andreia 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.229
 details and also anything is me 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.630
 I played on the other floor, but we did 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.100
 that test of being four sides because 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 the c4 and dropped from 30 was at 29 each 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.450
 five six times until you drop 30 more 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.840
 as you know this is boring to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.909
 Dude, we will not let it pass. 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:43.470
 blank where so then we 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:46.290
 did is running in full hd high in ao 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.030
 Portuguese TV channel is high 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:56.880
 after 90 loud frames out now 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:01.350
 I will reveal here was brother does not affect 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.930
 very much so in the high quiet army is 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.250
 very demanding, I may never be lacking 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.050
 I played the other one more 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.840
 but you will not only see how it happened 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.210
 that fall I once did the people who 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.760
 I did c4 test and five times can 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.920
 do not again want but I think 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.920
 will have three truck that has a little 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.780
 also try to simulate the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.120
 Most hostile environment let's go so I did 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.760
 five times in one of them fell from 30 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.470
 then it lowers the quality to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.470
 People are boring to stay here then. 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.720
 ended up dying 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:59.040
 I think 47 is what I'm seeing here at high 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.810
 the plaid held quietly 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.850
 remember guy he'll have to speak 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.310
 so all the people that annoying me here 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.310
 Talk to you, pictures , we 'll do it. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.280
 the comparison between the plates on the single 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.350
 player on a map that people go people 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.209
 did not choose yet we'll play 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.709
 the entire campaign first not to end 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.110
 the game after choosing the map that the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.060
 people thought to be heavier and give 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.970
 to a relatively benchmarking 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.950
 fixed then I but compare the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.440
 plates and compare the graphic quality 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.870
 that each of the boards will achieve 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.549
 to play the game we'll make a new one 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.260
 probably video about this 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.269
 showing to other provinces 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.430
 two cards a little later 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.320
 I know we have not yet created a methodology 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.420
 and tips from you are always welcome 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.760
 You know that we create enough 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.340
 quite a test thing here I always with 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.260
 commend through the opinions of you 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.150
 leave the house then leave the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.579
 comments and how to apply 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.280
 well you will want to see the tests in the 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.660
 to compare the plates in the circus is fine 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.489
 important to leave the comments of 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.860
 ideas for us to do because as 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.370
 game was new aunt also lost agent 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.440
 also maps and everything else 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.900
 I know the maps of the jury 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.390
 234 bad faith but the sign that we already 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.959
 could notice that the amd boards do not 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:21.479
 they care very well we only fear dr 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:28.780
 but we only want 50 but the type 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:33.520
 super good size performance and if you stay 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.020
 prepared and another agent actually 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.910
 received some reports from people who 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.070
 are with nvidia board giving some 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.780
 procon some problems then more 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.520
 as we have not witnessed these 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.100
 Problems can not comment anything because 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.669
 we are kind of the information teacher 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.800
 incorrect 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.000
 so expensive that we will do now is 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.560
 the next we'll do some time 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.740
 to choose another plate there we 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.350
 Let's continue with the exit of staying 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.350
 changing drivers all the time nÃ© 78 73 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:08.350
 78 71 to order again and you can 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:10.419
 stay there, little beauty, you 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.370
 they saw the 78 50 holding a lightning bolt 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:17.200
 quiet as playing only when 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.220
 those situations everything else recommended 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.950
 playing within a 50-yard pass in the test 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.830
 no doubt much less now we go 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.530
 enter 78 70 which should probably 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.280
 hold another then 78 50 held 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.229
 almost safe the 707 should hold I guess 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.330
 who did not remember Maradona meanwhile 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.789
 then probably tomorrow comes out the test 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.650
 of this plate here and you can stay 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:56.080
 Quiet that we have a lot of 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:06:01.840
 blah and 64 gb 4 gb and a very 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:09.280
 important that has already been tested 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:13.260
 this book lacks a test the day before yesterday 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.260
 77 seventy running in the middle was 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:20.070
 memory that has been tested 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.320
 both a memory jig and held in the 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:27.270
 average in full hd time for him to think 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.370
 who thinks 3,062 with 0v to beast of 52,016 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.830
 That's it, that's not freshness. 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.880
 knows that it does not influence in barrel will do 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.350
 no excess in the channel in 2000 and 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.290
 people can do and redo external 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.900
 we can but it has been done and got it in 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.000
 compare in 4 gb teaching with auditors 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.760
 will also tell you then you can f 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.650
 do lots of tests and f4 you for you 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.060
 question you can find out if 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.620
 you do not have a chapter board 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.390
 completing upgrade some 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.430
 thing or buy a pc with some board 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.750
 But it's going to be a place to see you. 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.790
 how the board will run that 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.400
 It intends to acquire anywhere 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:06.510
 be reminding the guy that we have to 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.510
 line has to do merchan of the window to 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.040
 people have on the site the line f 4 who 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.080
 want some machines tomorrow there 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.210
 then a really cool price even if 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.740
 He has the make - up machine with a 770 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:21.810
 initial and goes through the next 285 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.730
 the top is also the machines that are 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.470
 in that line already by all the plates 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.780
 people have already been tested, we know 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.750
 that will get you into the quality of life 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.520
 the medium and high performance for full hd 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.500
 on top of the machines that are there then 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.570
 who is looking for a good value for money 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.820
 to play pf four and other games 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.980
 obviously there 's my 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.450
 description is the case of liked the video 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.400
 do not forget to leave white is very 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.110
 important your comment from tips to 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.300
 people new maps more we 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.260
 think after our one technology
