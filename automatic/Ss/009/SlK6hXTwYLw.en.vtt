right<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:11.850> you're<00:01:12.420> seeing<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:12.840> use<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> one

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
right now you're seeing me use the one

right now you're seeing me use the one
that<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.470> stand<00:01:14.039> it<00:01:14.159> used<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.729> standard<00:01:15.180> one

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
that I stand it used as a standard one

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.410 
that I stand it used as a standard one
which<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:18.060> pad<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.539> thumb<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:20.420> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
which is the pad of the thumb is on is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.580 
which is the pad of the thumb is on is
on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.860> right<00:01:22.860> below<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:24.140> distal<00:01:25.140> joint<00:01:25.440> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
on the right below the distal joint of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.190 
on the right below the distal joint of
my<00:01:25.740> room<00:01:25.950> my<00:01:26.250> forefinger<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
my room my forefinger and this this

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.919 
my room my forefinger and this this
actually<00:01:28.860> causes<00:01:29.130> fairly<00:01:29.670> unstable<00:01:29.940> so<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
actually causes fairly unstable so you

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.809 
actually causes fairly unstable so you
see<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.289> thumb<00:01:31.560> moving<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.429> lot<00:01:32.670> when

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
see my thumb moving like this a lot when

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.289 
see my thumb moving like this a lot when
I<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:32.970> triplets<00:01:33.569> so<00:01:34.340> what<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.789> try<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> do

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
I do triplets so what I when I try to do

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.370 
I do triplets so what I when I try to do
just<00:01:36.569> wrist<00:01:36.840> triplets<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:39.110> always<00:01:40.110> end<00:01:40.259> up

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
just wrist triplets I always end up

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.649 
just wrist triplets I always end up
flexing<00:01:40.860> my<00:01:40.979> thumb<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:41.789> that<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.270> gives<00:01:42.539> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
flexing my thumb now that that gives a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.120 
flexing my thumb now that that gives a
different<00:01:42.690> sound<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.679> necessarily

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
different sound it's just necessarily

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.399 
different sound it's just necessarily
good<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.340> bad<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.299> I'm<00:01:45.450> always<00:01:45.630> trying<00:01:45.929> to<00:01:46.049> see

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
good or bad but I'm always trying to see

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.419 
good or bad but I'm always trying to see
if<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.709> do<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:47.009> bit<00:01:47.190> better

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
if I can do a little bit better

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.570 
if I can do a little bit better
especially<00:01:48.030> since<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> very<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:49.580> banjo

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
especially since the very good banjo

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.910 
especially since the very good banjo
players<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.420> almost<00:01:52.050> entirely<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
players that I see almost entirely use a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.109 
players that I see almost entirely use a
hand<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.970> doesn't<00:01:54.179> flex<00:01:54.569> at<00:01:54.750> all<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.940> in

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
hand that doesn't flex at all and in

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.119 
hand that doesn't flex at all and in
fact<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:58.080> mechanic's<00:01:58.530> grip<00:01:58.649> which<00:01:58.950> we've

00:01:59.119 --> 00:01:59.129 
fact the mechanic's grip which we've

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:02.270 
fact the mechanic's grip which we've
discussed<00:01:59.789> in<00:02:00.209> the<00:02:00.239> past<00:02:00.500> like<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.739> makes<00:02:02.129> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
discussed in the past like this makes it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.900 
discussed in the past like this makes it
almost<00:02:02.429> impossible<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:04.489> flex<00:02:05.489> your<00:02:05.580> thumb

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
almost impossible to flex your thumb

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.669 
almost impossible to flex your thumb
because<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.539> flip<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.869> thumb<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.289> already

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
because you flip your thumb is already

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.780 
because you flip your thumb is already
in<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> maximum<00:02:08.550> flexed<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:11.099> can't<00:02:11.550> play

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
in a maximum flexed and I can't play

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.240 
in a maximum flexed and I can't play
very<00:02:12.060> well<00:02:12.120> but<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.739> sounds<00:02:14.069> something

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
very well but it so it sounds something

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:28.500 
very well but it so it sounds something
like<00:02:14.400> this

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.390 

the<00:02:29.510> problem<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.439> with<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.859> that<00:02:30.920> is

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the problem I have with it is that is

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.880 
the problem I have with it is that is
that<00:02:31.609> I<00:02:31.670> grip<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.090> pic<00:02:32.810> too<00:02:32.989> hard<00:02:33.260> it's

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
that I grip the pic too hard it's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.759 
that I grip the pic too hard it's
essential<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.519> when<00:02:34.790> you're<00:02:34.939> playing<00:02:35.769> any

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
essential that when you're playing any

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
instrument with the picker of plectrum

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.710 
instrument with the picker of plectrum
that<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.379> hold<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.060> pic<00:02:41.060> fairly<00:02:41.480> loose

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
that you hold the pic fairly loose

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.569 
that you hold the pic fairly loose
sometimes<00:02:42.530> tightening<00:02:43.129> it<00:02:43.220> up<00:02:43.340> when<00:02:43.489> you're

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
sometimes tightening it up when you're

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.580 
sometimes tightening it up when you're
trying<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.849> be<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:44.209> bit<00:02:44.329> louder<00:02:44.599> and

trying to be a little bit louder and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.459 
trying to be a little bit louder and
this<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.889> virtually<00:02:46.430> every<00:02:46.849> every<00:02:47.780> instructor

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 
this is virtually every every instructor

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.020 
this is virtually every every instructor
that<00:02:48.680> I've<00:02:48.799> had<00:02:49.010> too<00:02:49.189> said<00:02:49.430> exactly<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.909> same

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030

both<00:02:51.049> mandolin<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.769> banjo<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:53.030> what<00:02:53.209> I've

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
both mandolin and banjo so what I've

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.440 
both mandolin and banjo so what I've
decided<00:02:53.689> to<00:02:53.900> do<00:02:54.700> because<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.849> play<00:02:56.060> an<00:02:56.329> open

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
decided to do because I play an open

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.819 
decided to do because I play an open
hand<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:59.139> does<00:03:00.139> affect<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> tone

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
hand like this it does affect the tone

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.399 
hand like this it does affect the tone
because<00:03:01.579> I<00:03:01.609> have<00:03:01.790> my<00:03:01.909> head<00:03:02.090> on<00:03:02.269> me<00:03:02.450> my<00:03:02.959> hand<00:03:03.230> on

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
because I have my head on me my hand on

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.470 
because I have my head on me my hand on
the<00:03:03.530> hand<00:03:03.769> here<00:03:04.069> was<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.879> try<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.299> with<00:03:05.419> a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
the hand here was to try to do with a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.259 
the hand here was to try to do with a
closed<00:03:05.870> fist<00:03:06.430> actually<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.549> just<00:03:07.579> relaxed

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
closed fist actually it just relaxed

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:16.569 
closed fist actually it just relaxed
fist<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:15.230> notice<00:03:15.439> my<00:03:15.590> thumb<00:03:15.859> continues<00:03:16.430> to

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
fist you notice my thumb continues to

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.170 
fist you notice my thumb continues to
flex<00:03:16.879> like<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.359> so<00:03:18.290> I've<00:03:18.620> taken<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.340> page<00:03:19.909> out

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
flex like this so I've taken a page out

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.629 
flex like this so I've taken a page out
of<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.409> the<00:03:21.579> Mike<00:03:22.579> Marshall<00:03:23.000> Chris<00:03:23.659> Henry

method of holding the pick from mandolin

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.819

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
same area which which means that I'm

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.479 
same area which which means that I'm
actually<00:03:39.790> extending<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.329> thumb<00:03:41.629> and

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
actually extending this this thumb and

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.490 
actually extending this this thumb and
and<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.609> try<00:03:44.120> not<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.389> flex<00:03:44.720> I'm<00:03:44.900> still<00:03:45.199> capable

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
and I try not to flex I'm still capable

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.819 
and I try not to flex I'm still capable
of<00:03:45.859> flexing<00:03:46.400> but<00:03:46.579> not<00:03:46.760> quite<00:03:47.030> as<00:03:47.150> much<00:03:47.290> also<00:03:48.290> it

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
of flexing but not quite as much also it

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.770 
of flexing but not quite as much also it
changes<00:03:48.859> them<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.489> angle<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:49.909> I<00:03:50.030> that<00:03:50.389> that

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
changes them the angle that I that that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.469 
changes them the angle that I that that
the<00:03:51.220> pick<00:03:52.220> hits<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.639> strings<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.090> little<00:03:53.329> bit

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
the pick hits the strings a little bit

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.330 
the pick hits the strings a little bit
you<00:03:53.959> notice<00:03:54.260> I'm<00:03:54.379> only<00:03:54.530> using<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:55.010> very<00:03:55.220> small

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
you notice I'm only using a very small

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.210 
you notice I'm only using a very small
amount<00:03:55.639> of<00:03:56.000> pick<00:03:56.349> coming<00:03:57.349> out<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.709> here<00:03:57.919> this

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
amount of pick coming out of here this

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.699 
amount of pick coming out of here this
is<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:58.639> as<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:58.909> think<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.239> also<00:03:59.389> essential<00:03:59.989> but

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
is this as I think is also essential but

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.469 
is this as I think is also essential but
but<00:04:01.040> you'll<00:04:01.220> but<00:04:01.609> even<00:04:01.879> though<00:04:01.970> when<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.150> tried

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
but you'll but even though when I tried

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.020 
but you'll but even though when I tried
this<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.650> I'll<00:04:04.459> show<00:04:04.669> it<00:04:04.699> to<00:04:04.849> you<00:04:04.939> a

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
this and I'll show it to you a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.240 
this and I'll show it to you a
comparison<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.079> still<00:04:06.590> end<00:04:06.769> up<00:04:06.859> moving<00:04:06.979> my

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
comparison I still end up moving my

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.559 
comparison I still end up moving my
thumb<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.519> little<00:04:07.790> bit<00:04:07.909> but<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.180> does<00:04:08.329> sound

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
thumb a little bit but it does sound

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:28.710 
thumb a little bit but it does sound
different<00:04:08.629> so

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.540 

now<00:04:29.720> actually<00:04:30.050> I'm<00:04:30.139> not<00:04:30.290> doing<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:30.770> this<00:04:31.220> the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
now actually I'm not doing it this the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.680 
now actually I'm not doing it this the
way<00:04:31.729> that<00:04:31.910> they<00:04:32.060> recommend<00:04:32.690> they<00:04:32.900> recommend

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
way that they recommend they recommend

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.620 
way that they recommend they recommend
moving<00:04:35.690> your<00:04:35.840> thing<00:04:36.110> finger<00:04:36.530> like<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:36.770> and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
moving your thing finger like this and

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.450 
moving your thing finger like this and
instead<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.690> have<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.110> more<00:04:39.350> straight<00:04:39.710> more<00:04:40.370> of

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
instead I have it more straight more of

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.670 
instead I have it more straight more of
a<00:04:40.520> straight<00:04:40.790> down<00:04:41.030> finger<00:04:41.750> because<00:04:42.169> this<00:04:42.440> this

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
a straight down finger because this this

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.890 
a straight down finger because this this
locks<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.280> entirely<00:04:43.669> on<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.540> don't<00:04:44.660> have

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
locks it entirely on you you don't have

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.439 
locks it entirely on you you don't have
to<00:04:44.990> have<00:04:45.199> much<00:04:45.440> strength<00:04:46.130> in<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:47.270> can<00:04:47.419> just

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
to have much strength in it you can just

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.379 
to have much strength in it you can just
pull<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:47.960> out<00:04:48.110> and<00:04:48.350> miss<00:04:49.130> Dario<00:04:49.520> Connor<00:04:50.060> says

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
pull it out and miss Dario Connor says

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.379 
pull it out and miss Dario Connor says
everybody<00:04:51.110> loses<00:04:51.290> picks<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:52.550> he<00:04:52.639> really

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
everybody loses picks and he really

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.300 
everybody loses picks and he really
recommends<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.930> very<00:04:54.139> loose<00:04:55.180> loose<00:04:56.180> grip<00:04:56.419> too

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
recommends a very loose loose grip too

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.570 
recommends a very loose loose grip too
so<00:04:58.310> let's<00:04:58.460> see<00:04:58.580> how<00:04:58.699> that<00:04:58.729> works<00:05:00.430> trying<00:05:01.430> at

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
so let's see how that works trying at

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:22.290 
so let's see how that works trying at
the<00:05:01.699> angle<00:05:01.940> right<00:05:02.000> here

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.670 

now<00:05:23.300> that's<00:05:23.479> not<00:05:23.719> comfortable<00:05:24.319> for<00:05:24.379> me<00:05:24.560> and

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
now that's not comfortable for me and

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.709 
now that's not comfortable for me and
you<00:05:24.740> know<00:05:24.860> as<00:05:25.009> I<00:05:25.099> still<00:05:25.340> flex<00:05:25.610> my<00:05:25.819> thumb<00:05:26.120> that's

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
you know as I still flex my thumb that's

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.379 
you know as I still flex my thumb that's
what<00:05:26.870> I'm<00:05:26.960> gonna<00:05:27.080> do<00:05:27.289> is<00:05:27.439> move<00:05:27.830> back<00:05:28.099> to<00:05:28.389> back

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
what I'm gonna do is move back to back

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.990 
what I'm gonna do is move back to back
to<00:05:29.599> the<00:05:29.629> deck<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:30.229> this<00:05:30.620> server<00:05:31.400> compromise

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
to the deck to this server compromise

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.619 
to the deck to this server compromise
halfway<00:05:32.419> in<00:05:32.569> between<00:05:32.620> relax<00:05:33.620> a<00:05:33.830> lot<00:05:40.539> so<00:05:41.539> the

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
halfway in between relax a lot so the

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.110 
halfway in between relax a lot so the
main<00:05:41.780> thing<00:05:41.990> is<00:05:42.169> just<00:05:42.729> try<00:05:43.729> and<00:05:43.819> figure<00:05:44.000> out

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
main thing is just try and figure out

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.080 
main thing is just try and figure out
what<00:05:44.360> what<00:05:45.020> pick<00:05:45.259> grip<00:05:45.500> is<00:05:46.129> best<00:05:46.460> for<00:05:46.669> you<00:05:46.849> and

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
what what pick grip is best for you and

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.790 
what what pick grip is best for you and
sometimes<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:48.050> one<00:05:48.169> that's<00:05:48.409> uncomfortable

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
sometimes the one that's uncomfortable

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.740 
sometimes the one that's uncomfortable
initially<00:05:49.610> is<00:05:49.939> going<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.270> give<00:05:50.389> you<00:05:50.509> a<00:05:50.539> much

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
initially is going to give you a much

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.450 
initially is going to give you a much
better<00:05:50.990> tone<00:05:51.729> for<00:05:52.729> example<00:05:54.039> if<00:05:55.039> you<00:05:55.159> if<00:05:55.340> you

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
better tone for example if you if you

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.390 
better tone for example if you if you
just<00:05:55.639> hold<00:05:55.789> it<00:05:56.000> like<00:05:56.120> this<00:05:56.680> like<00:05:57.680> this<00:05:57.979> which

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
just hold it like this like this which

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.100 
just hold it like this like this which
is<00:05:58.580> which<00:05:58.789> is<00:05:58.819> a<00:05:58.969> way<00:05:59.330> a<00:05:59.360> lot<00:05:59.539> of<00:05:59.689> people<00:05:59.930> hold

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
is which is a way a lot of people hold

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.459 
is which is a way a lot of people hold
it

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469 
it

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:03.939 
it
fingertip<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:02.000> fingertip<00:06:02.029> pad<00:06:02.650> it's<00:06:03.650> very

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
fingertip to fingertip pad it's very
