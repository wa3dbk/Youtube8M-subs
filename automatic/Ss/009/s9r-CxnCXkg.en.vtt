 Hello, Mr. Oliver here. Today we will cook scrambled eggs in three ways. 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.759
 We will cover it in English, French and American style. 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.759
 Beautiful scrambled eggs, very tasty. Chicken eggs are tasty 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.840
 And the cheapest and coolest types of protein on the planet, this is a fact. It contains a lot of micronutrients. 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.540
 Its numbers are very fast. So, eggs are in the English way. On medium heat .. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:48.600
 I will prepare two eggs per person. I will prepare it for two people. Well, the eggs just failed .. 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.280
 Now, ask for a small one - I hate chicken eggs factories, so the minimum for me is natural and hatch eggs .. 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.480
 Of course free or free chicken that feeds on organic matter is the best. So, let's start .. 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.430
 First I will start with a good room of butter. A little salt. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.159
 And here we are. For me, the best way to move the eggs is the spatula, so .. 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.880
 So, I just moved it, and immediately you can see it starting to ripen ... 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.500
 Around the bottom. You can see mature and immature egg parts. So I'll leave it. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.979
 Almost every five seconds I will move it a bit, we do not want it to mature completely .. 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.830
 Some love adding milk, others add gracious. If cooked correctly .. 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.090
 You do not need any of this. The eggs are ripe now, but remember, the frying pan is still hot .. 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.510
 So you will continue to cook eggs. So all I do - when I go to this stage - I put it down. 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.140
 On one side of the frying pan, this way will not over-cook the desired. Bring.. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.700
 Toast bread. You can butter the toast, but remember that you added a good amount of butter to cook the eggs. 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 And here we are, we got the wonderful and delicious English eggs. 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 You can see egg blocks with some softness. Hmmm is very tasty. And also.. 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.530
 Still maintaining the soft texture .. English eggs, finished. Soft, exquisite and appetizing. Next, the French way .. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.500
 Good morning, I'm Jimmy. I like eggs, eggs? Bye? Bleed? Anyway, eggs are on the French way .. 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.200
 A little spice on four of the free chicken eggs and failed. We have about ... 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.260
 Boiling water. We will cook this on the Pine Mary, a water bath, okay? 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 Here's the command, eggs will mature at a very low temperature and this takes some time. 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.550
 Well, you can notice the formation of some blocks. You can see them here .. 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.750
 Now is the time to add some butter. So I will change now .. 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.590
 I used the spatula rather than the bumper. It will start seeing ... 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.010
 Some delicious and wonderful blocks. here we are. Good level .. 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:39.100
 In the end, unlike English eggs, it is very smooth. 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:45.590
 Very luxurious. We are the guys you guys are, French style eggs. Very delicious. And finally .. 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:55.300
 YouTube cooks, we will end up with American eggs. Well, we'll start the same way .. 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.650
 Place a little salt on four eggs. We will use a pan to fry the eggs. Start with a room of .. 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.420
 Butter. Let it boil and show the bubbles. Then add the eggs. You will see.. 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.230
 It started to knit, I will bring these beautiful plates. 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:21.400
 You will get these wonderful folds for dinner eggs. Do you see the formation of these beautiful plates? 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.849
 You guys. The same rules apply to French and English eggs, we want to cook eggs gently .. 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:32.990

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.219

 Very delicious. Now all these methods; French, English and American .. 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.659
 They all asked for the same eggs, the same salt pinch, the same amount of butter, but the way they .. 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.860
 We used to cook, not only changed texture and shape but also taste. 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.669
 We prepared eggs on the English, French and American style, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
