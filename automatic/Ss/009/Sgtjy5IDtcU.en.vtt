00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
of the five stops killers and you know I

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.610 
of the five stops killers and you know I
believe<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.600> don't<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:18.840> need<00:02:19.020> skill<00:02:19.530> is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
believe you don't really need skill is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.990 
believe you don't really need skill is
for<00:02:19.830> sentence<00:02:20.070> offense<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> mid<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.550> sin<00:02:20.850> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
for sentence offense the mid and sin and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
for sentence offense the mid and sin and
while<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> two<00:02:21.840> center<00:02:22.080> defensive<00:02:22.500> mids<00:02:22.710> I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
while the two center defensive mids I

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
while the two center defensive mids I
think<00:02:23.460> it's<00:02:23.550> bit<00:02:23.670> pointless<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.270> need<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
think it's bit pointless you need to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.750 
think it's bit pointless you need to
sort<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.750> two<00:02:25.140> good<00:02:25.380> players<00:02:25.590> there<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.670> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
sort of two good players there just to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.050 
sort of two good players there just to
hold<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.090> line<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.960> know<00:02:28.050> give<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.320> good

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
hold the line and you know give a good

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.790 
hold the line and you know give a good
estrella<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.150> balls<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.720> passes<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
estrella of balls and passes in the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.760 
estrella of balls and passes in the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
like Robinho these two players are

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.080 
like Robinho these two players are
pretty<00:02:54.660> small<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.440> think<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> will<00:02:56.160> see<00:02:56.190> they

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
pretty small I think you will see they

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.560 
pretty small I think you will see they
are<00:02:57.120> around<00:02:57.570> 5<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:59.360> Giovinco<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
are around 5 for a and Giovinco is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.630 
are around 5 for a and Giovinco is
actually<00:03:01.290> five<00:03:01.500> foot<00:03:01.680> five<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.190> both<00:03:02.490> too

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
actually five foot five so both too

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.790 
actually five foot five so both too
pretty<00:03:02.940> small<00:03:03.240> players<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.620> going

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
pretty small players but this is going

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.070 
pretty small players but this is going
to<00:03:04.890> be<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.280> main<00:03:05.550> man<00:03:05.880> in<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.270> team<00:03:06.540> from<00:03:06.870> my

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
to be the main man in this team from my

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.770 
to be the main man in this team from my
opinion<00:03:07.700> yavitt<00:03:08.700> itch<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.180> probably<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.600> best

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
opinion yavitt itch is probably the best

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.480 
opinion yavitt itch is probably the best
player<00:03:10.020> ever<00:03:10.200> played<00:03:10.560> with<00:03:10.710> an<00:03:10.860> ultimate<00:03:11.280> team

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
player ever played with an ultimate team

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.370 
player ever played with an ultimate team
and<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.540> lot<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.780> people<00:03:12.900> can<00:03:13.230> vouch

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
and I think a lot of people can vouch

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.650 
and I think a lot of people can vouch
for<00:03:13.410> me<00:03:13.740> if<00:03:14.070> they've<00:03:14.310> played<00:03:14.670> with<00:03:15.210> him<00:03:15.360> at<00:03:15.510> all

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
for me if they've played with him at all

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.840 
for me if they've played with him at all
