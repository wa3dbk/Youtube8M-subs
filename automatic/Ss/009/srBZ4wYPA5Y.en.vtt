00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
that she's going to give a response I

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.860 
that she's going to give a response I
mean<00:04:23.280> every<00:04:23.640> every<00:04:24.030> one<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.330> us<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.570> don't<00:04:24.599> have

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
mean every every one of us I don't have

any<00:04:25.050> muddies<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.470> water<00:04:25.890> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
any muddies the water the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.280 
any muddies the water the
I<00:04:26.250> think<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.970> we<00:04:27.090> have<00:04:27.270> more<00:04:27.450> conversations

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
I think that we have more conversations

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.140 
I think that we have more conversations
like<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.500> it'll<00:04:28.920> be<00:04:29.100> good<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.640> think<00:04:30.000> that

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
like that it'll be good so I think that

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.880 
like that it'll be good so I think that
she's<00:04:30.330> going<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.690> make<00:04:30.840> sure<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.530> we're

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
she's going to make sure that that we're

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.290 
she's going to make sure that that we're
holding<00:04:32.220> our<00:04:32.310> presidents<00:04:32.760> feet<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.120> fire
