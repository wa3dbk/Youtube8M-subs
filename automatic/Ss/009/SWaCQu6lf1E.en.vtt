this is a review on the echo 1 er 25k

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.280 
this is a review on the echo 1 er 25k
first<00:00:05.640> off<00:00:05.879> we're<00:00:06.270> gonna<00:00:06.359> start<00:00:06.690> off<00:00:06.839> saying

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
first off we're gonna start off saying

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.089 
first off we're gonna start off saying
that<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:08.280> gun<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.639> fully<00:00:09.150> metal<00:00:09.650> now<00:00:10.650> that's

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
that this gun is fully metal now that's

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.400 
that this gun is fully metal now that's
pretty<00:00:11.340> nice<00:00:11.550> but<00:00:11.940> it's<00:00:12.540> also<00:00:12.840> pretty<00:00:13.110> heavy

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
pretty nice but it's also pretty heavy

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.919 
pretty nice but it's also pretty heavy
with<00:00:14.130> everything<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.120> weighs<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.719> comes

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
with everything on it it weighs it comes

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.800 
with everything on it it weighs it comes
in<00:00:16.049> about<00:00:16.260> 2<00:00:16.529> 11<00:00:16.890> pounds<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.480> kind<00:00:18.720> of

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
in about 2 11 pounds so it's kind of

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.779 
in about 2 11 pounds so it's kind of
hard<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> carry<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:20.279> you're<00:00:20.400> running<00:00:20.670> with

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
hard to carry when you're running with

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.470 
hard to carry when you're running with
it<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.180> at<00:00:21.539> least<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.170> not<00:00:22.289> gonna<00:00:22.439> break<00:00:22.769> um

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
it but at least it's not gonna break um

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.870 
it but at least it's not gonna break um
this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> box<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.109> came<00:00:25.320> in

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
but I bought that separately it also

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.899 
but I bought that separately it also
comes<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.740> eleven<00:01:20.280> point<00:01:20.460> five<00:01:20.640> inch

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
comes with eleven point five inch

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.580 
comes with eleven point five inch
silencer<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:23.360> use<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.540> because<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.259> doesn't

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
silencer I use it because it doesn't

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.990 
silencer I use it because it doesn't
make<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> much<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.280> difference<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.759> sound

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
make that much of a difference in sound

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.179 
make that much of a difference in sound
but<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> makes<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> lot<00:01:28.979> more

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
but it I think it makes it a lot more

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.060 
but it I think it makes it a lot more
accurate<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.630> easily<00:01:31.020> take<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.229> off

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it also comes with a flash hider and the

it also comes with a flash hider and the
stick<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:40.020> case<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.500> gets<00:01:40.590> jammed<00:01:41.240> um

my<00:02:27.269> brother<00:02:27.540> he<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.049> bought<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> sniper<00:02:28.650> it's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
my brother he just bought a sniper it's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.110 
my brother he just bought a sniper it's
the<00:02:29.129> utg<00:02:29.609> shadow<00:02:30.299> ops<00:02:30.569> sniper<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.739> we<00:02:32.670> tested

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
the utg shadow ops sniper and we tested

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.020 
the utg shadow ops sniper and we tested
it<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.599> shoots<00:02:34.220> almost<00:02:35.220> as<00:02:35.400> far<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:35.819> that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
it and this shoots almost as far as that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.170 
it and this shoots almost as far as that
and<00:02:36.329> it's<00:02:37.140> really<00:02:37.620> accurate<00:02:37.799> too<00:02:38.189> so<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and it's really accurate too so this is
