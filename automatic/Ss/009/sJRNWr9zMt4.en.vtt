00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 kindness that bruno is already teaching 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.279
 you accommodate this program that in three 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.620
 minutes so let's go there quickly without 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.750
 lose brain time think a sai 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.450
 file here have some new options 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.700
 obviously there are a few things here 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 resolution pixel can also 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 change here do not make it too small in the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.250
 quality of your drawings will stay 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.350
 bad to the shock I already have things here one 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.949
 side are the layers and can create layers 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.140
 huh 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.000
 you're drawing right in several 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.789
 layers here after how they are 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.199
 separate and can change 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.880
 individually to exclude just clicking 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.590
 on it and click on the trash can you 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.320
 also change the opacity here of the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.510
 layers in this bar and the way 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.160
 multiplication overlap with scroll 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.600
 mouse you can zoom in if you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.420
 tighten control t 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.460
 you can move your drawing and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 Also here on the side you can turn 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.399
 vertically horizontally a thing 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 interesting is that he can 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.600
 rotational drawing very easy on top and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.579
 also mirror here on the good side here in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.590
 we have some options for a 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.359
 This is the first one right here. 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 You and have concluded that you can 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.559
 choosing the colors is much easier here 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 we have some underneath some 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.210
 tools is the brush 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.490
 The air brush right here for a rubber 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.140
 delete things bucket of paint and here 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.939
 below we have some options with 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.159
 opacity to change the size of the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.049
 brush here in size is very simple 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.210
 also if you have multiple layers 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.860
 and you want to join just click on the top 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 tight control and that it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.580
 will automatically join with the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.320
 down always from top to bottom one 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.880
 interesting stabilizing thing that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.740
 also that you can change to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.110
 make your stroke a bit firmer 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.270
 but you also need a table 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.310
 not a mouse will not scan 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.170
 to advance anything if you have a drawing that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.820
 is to change the color of it come here in filter 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 tone and saturation you will achieve 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.040
 easily change if any of these 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.829
 Panels disappear come here window and looks 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 It will only activate. You can give z control to 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.490
 back to sound control and to 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.860
 front or up here you too 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.689
 good if you use the mouse on your 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.030
 site a scheme called la in gold that 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.490
 You come here with the pity you can do. 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.799
 so edit the points is fine 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.540
 simple to click and then edit and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.000
 if you want to change the pressure only 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.770
 the printout clicks on the point and goes to 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.390
 left or right and by 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.040
 chance you want to turn this 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.540
 layer 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.180
 take her from there in mogi to get 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.430
 painting normally I only came here in layer 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.750
 and masterize newark layer 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.730
 if you want to select a certain 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.510
 space just click on the magic wand and 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.980
 click here 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.109
 if you have not given any error you have 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.239
 passing you can change everything here 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.819
 It is so then only you decrease here and 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.769
 remember to click on the right layer that 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.349
 This is not going to happen after I've only seen 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.329
 file will save and if you want to save 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.700
 a file and then open and edit the 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.739
 layers you save with a point it out 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.780
 not only save as normal image 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.549
 remembering that if your traits do not come out 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.750
 children so it comes out that way because 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.030
 is doing with the mouse you need to 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.230
 a digitizer table then you must 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.930
 it's very worth it 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.090
 I recommend bigger with many 480 is cheap 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.220
 is good and I hope it has helped if 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.389
