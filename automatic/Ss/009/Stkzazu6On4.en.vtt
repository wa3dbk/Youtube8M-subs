back there okay let's take a look this

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.210 
back there okay let's take a look this
is<00:03:29.250> settled<00:03:29.580> down<00:03:29.730> somewhere<00:03:33.860> I'll<00:03:34.860> turn<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
is settled down somewhere I'll turn the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.000 
is settled down somewhere I'll turn the
heat<00:03:35.250> off<00:03:35.430> at<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.450> point<00:03:36.570> as<00:03:36.959> well<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.890> is

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
heat off at this point as well that is

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.210 
heat off at this point as well that is
cooking<00:03:41.250> down<00:03:41.489> really<00:03:42.090> nicely<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:43.160> don't<00:03:44.160> even

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
cooking down really nicely I don't even

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.550 
cooking down really nicely I don't even
see<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:44.820> really<00:03:45.269> come<00:03:45.570> along<00:03:45.810> there's<00:03:46.380> about

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
twelve minutes in fact pressure pressure

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.699 
twelve minutes in fact pressure pressure
cooking<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.360> just<00:03:54.570> really<00:03:55.170> quick<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.440> mean<00:03:55.560> if

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
liquid in there enough for us to

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.060 
liquid in there enough for us to
pressure<00:04:57.729> cook<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:59.320> again<00:04:59.590> I'm<00:04:59.770> gonna<00:04:59.889> go

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
pressure cook and again I'm gonna go

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.320 
pressure cook and again I'm gonna go
back<00:05:00.310> on<00:05:00.340> with<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:00.790> lid<00:05:00.970> I<00:05:03.120> think<00:05:04.120> maybe

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
back on with the lid I think maybe

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.870 
back on with the lid I think maybe
another<00:05:05.229> five<00:05:05.530> or<00:05:05.710> six<00:05:05.950> minutes<00:05:06.310> maybe<00:05:06.550> once

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
another five or six minutes maybe once

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.600 
another five or six minutes maybe once
it's<00:05:07.090> reached<00:05:07.360> its<00:05:07.660> pressure<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.610> what

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
it's reached its pressure and what

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.000 
it's reached its pressure and what
should<00:05:09.880> happen<00:05:10.090> or<00:05:10.479> I<00:05:10.600> hope<00:05:11.080> will<00:05:11.290> happen<00:05:11.590> it's

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
should happen or I hope will happen it's

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.760 
should happen or I hope will happen it's
those<00:05:12.160> tomatoes<00:05:12.669> will<00:05:12.850> really<00:05:13.120> break<00:05:13.389> down

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
those tomatoes will really break down

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.960 
those tomatoes will really break down
thicken<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.889> sauce<00:05:15.100> slightly<00:05:15.729> and<00:05:15.880> we'll

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
thicken the sauce slightly and we'll

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.279 
thicken the sauce slightly and we'll
have<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.120> viewer<00:05:16.479> former<00:05:16.900> sila<00:05:19.080> see<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.200> when

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
masala now we've speeded up this process

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.150 
masala now we've speeded up this process
by<00:05:46.210> probably<00:05:46.690> five<00:05:46.960> times<00:05:47.410> by<00:05:47.800> using<00:05:47.979> the
