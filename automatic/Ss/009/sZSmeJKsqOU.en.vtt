horses making changes often can show a
sudden<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.120> drastic<00:04:37.270> improvement<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.620> other

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
sudden and drastic improvement the other

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.469 
sudden and drastic improvement the other
thing<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.039> look<00:04:39.130> for<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.400> towed<00:04:39.789> action<00:04:40.300> I

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
thing to look for is towed action I

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.180 
thing to look for is towed action I
don't<00:04:40.900> talk<00:04:41.110> about<00:04:41.260> this<00:04:41.500> very<00:04:41.680> often<00:04:41.979> because

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
don't talk about this very often because

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.529 
don't talk about this very often because
I<00:04:42.400> don't<00:04:42.550> think<00:04:42.700> it's<00:04:42.789> relevant<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:43.270> lot<00:04:43.419> of

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
I don't think it's relevant a lot of

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:44.159 
I don't think it's relevant a lot of
times<00:04:43.750> with<00:04:43.930> older
