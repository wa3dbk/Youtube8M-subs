you<00:02:38.230> know<00:02:38.350> I've<00:02:38.470> recorded<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.700> couple<00:02:40.120> days

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
you know I've recorded it a couple days

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.600 
you know I've recorded it a couple days
ago<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.870> just<00:02:40.900> now<00:02:41.110> getting<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
ago and just now getting to it the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.600 
ago and just now getting to it the
editing<00:02:42.970> part<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.450> I've<00:02:43.810> already<00:02:44.610> progressed

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
editing part and I've already progressed

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.780 
editing part and I've already progressed
a<00:02:45.790> lot<00:02:45.940> farther<00:02:46.239> in<00:02:46.569> Minecraft<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:48.099> in<00:02:48.700> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
a lot farther in Minecraft and in the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.059 
a lot farther in Minecraft and in the
world<00:02:49.080> than<00:02:50.080> what<00:02:50.500> you're<00:02:50.650> seeing<00:02:50.680> right<00:02:50.950> now

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
world than what you're seeing right now

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.809 
world than what you're seeing right now
so<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.550> funny<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.880> me<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:54.340> look<00:02:54.519> at<00:02:54.670> it

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
so it's funny to me to look at it

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.940 
so it's funny to me to look at it
because<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.350> doesn't<00:02:56.680> look<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.890> same

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
because this it doesn't look the same

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.309 
because this it doesn't look the same
anymore

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
anymore

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.030 
anymore
Wow<00:02:59.620> really<00:03:00.580> progressive<00:03:01.060> forward<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:02.040> couple

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
Wow really progressive forward a couple

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.240 
Wow really progressive forward a couple
of<00:03:03.130> things<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.930> guess<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.019> could<00:03:05.170> add<00:03:05.380> as<00:03:05.950> far<00:03:06.160> as

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
of things I guess I could add as far as

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.830 
of things I guess I could add as far as
to<00:03:06.340> what<00:03:06.459> I'm<00:03:06.580> doing<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:10.150> me<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> lot<00:03:10.810> more

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
to what I'm doing of me a lot more

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.740 
to what I'm doing of me a lot more
pillars<00:03:11.380> since<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.310> last<00:03:12.489> ones<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.910> saw<00:03:13.180> a

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
pillars since the last ones you saw a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.740 
pillars since the last ones you saw a
lot<00:03:14.140> more<00:03:14.200> bases<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.880> what<00:03:16.239> I've<00:03:16.360> done<00:03:16.540> right

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
lot more bases and what I've done right

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.289 
lot more bases and what I've done right
now<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:18.340> not<00:03:18.489> gonna<00:03:18.610> be<00:03:18.730> seen<00:03:18.910> in<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.120> video

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
now it's not gonna be seen in this video

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.539 
now it's not gonna be seen in this video
but<00:03:19.660> I've<00:03:19.810> already<00:03:20.019> made<00:03:21.510> three<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.049> walls

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
but I've already made three of the walls

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.940 
but I've already made three of the walls
that<00:03:24.549> make<00:03:24.700> sense<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.000> those<00:03:25.150> large<00:03:25.950> missing

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
that make sense to those large missing

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.039 
that make sense to those large missing
gaps<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.120> sides<00:03:28.329> because<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.720> know<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.900> did

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
gaps on the sides because you know I did

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.099 
gaps on the sides because you know I did
it<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.260> flat<00:03:29.470> world<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:31.120> there's<00:03:31.359> there's

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
it in a flat world so there's there's

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.229 
it in a flat world so there's there's
nothing<00:03:32.440> here<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.709> start<00:03:33.010> with<00:03:33.160> because<00:03:34.060> I

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
nothing here to start with because I

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.580 
nothing here to start with because I
wanted<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.750> way<00:03:34.900> because<00:03:34.989> it's<00:03:35.230> easier

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
wanted it that way because it's easier

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.190 
wanted it that way because it's easier
because<00:03:35.799> if<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:36.250> had<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.579> dig<00:03:36.820> and<00:03:37.180> flatten<00:03:38.109> out

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
because if I had to dig and flatten out

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.410 
because if I had to dig and flatten out
all<00:03:38.380> those<00:03:38.470> crap<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:38.920> take<00:03:39.070> forever<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.609> I<00:03:40.180> have

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
all those crap it take forever so I have

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.880 
all those crap it take forever so I have
to<00:03:40.570> build<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.870> walls<00:03:41.079> in<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.350> ceiling<00:03:41.739> and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
to build the walls in the ceiling and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.400 
to build the walls in the ceiling and
that's<00:03:42.190> gonna<00:03:42.400> take<00:03:42.579> a<00:03:42.640> long<00:03:42.850> time<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:44.019> as<00:03:44.290> I

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
that's gonna take a long time but as I

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.479 
that's gonna take a long time but as I
said<00:03:44.560> I've<00:03:44.650> already<00:03:44.709> built<00:03:44.950> three<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.400> the

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
said I've already built three of the

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.759 
said I've already built three of the
walls<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:46.359> quarter<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.140> ceiling<00:03:47.500> that

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
walls and a quarter of the ceiling that

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.170 
walls and a quarter of the ceiling that
covers<00:03:48.130> all<00:03:48.250> those<00:03:48.430> pillars<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.790> are<00:03:49.030> over

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
covers all those pillars that are over

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.300 
covers all those pillars that are over
there<00:03:49.329> right<00:03:49.450> now<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.709> next<00:03:50.950> video

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
there right now so in the next video

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.090 
there right now so in the next video
you'll<00:03:52.239> get<00:03:52.359> to<00:03:52.480> see<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.109> any<00:03:53.980> other

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
you'll get to see that and any other

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.349 
you'll get to see that and any other
progression<00:03:54.609> um<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.850> we'll<00:03:54.970> try<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.150> build

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
progression um and we'll try to build

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.550 
progression um and we'll try to build
all<00:03:55.540> those<00:03:55.690> pillars<00:03:56.079> that<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.290> already<00:03:56.470> have

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
all those pillars that I already have

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.430 
all those pillars that I already have
the<00:03:56.680> basis<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.209> before<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.380> upload<00:03:59.380> another

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
the basis for before I upload another

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.630 
the basis for before I upload another
video<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:01.319> yeah<00:04:02.319> I'm<00:04:03.010> looking<00:04:03.280> forward<00:04:03.549> to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
video and yeah I'm looking forward to

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.979
