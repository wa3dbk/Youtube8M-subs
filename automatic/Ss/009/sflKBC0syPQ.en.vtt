00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 Hahaha 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.090
 games like ralph and quote that is one of 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.470
 the best players in this football 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.470
 Virtual is considered 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.450
 best 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.570
 here reading your tab, we have won 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.610
 is the champion of Spain of the past 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 league of video games of professions of the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.920
 final cap and his world champion of the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.270
 electronic sport world cup that has 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.330
 had to take a lot of hours 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.160
 compete a lot and the truth that you 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.750
 you have to like a lot this you do not have 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.450
 that put a lot of passion many works 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.310
 many graphics 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.760
 and the luck necessary if the work 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.760
 necessary 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.660
 because one when a video game comes out 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.450
 he has to throw many, many, many 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.070
 many hours to be able to beat 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.390
 rivals as strong as those that we 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.970
 let's find that life by typing 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.880
 if they the very important city 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.100
 give him hours but surely I each 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.050
 time 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.210
 these years sr 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.290
 at least because of weight that although 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 it is the work to be done 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.479
 of having gained tranquility 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.479
 in them 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.090
 an obligatory question competition is not going 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.580
 how is the digital league that starts 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.860
 here in this final phase in valencia in 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.340
 the city and that excites new 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.710
 competitions and new challenges 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.000
 I am repaired maría to the past levante 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.170

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.170
 support and now the world 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.120
 a stimulus that all of us are excited about 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.890
 and playing with type game counting 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.380
 the soccer muscle I do not have in my 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.679
 team madrid 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.789
 we tell you that it has been 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.149
 in that class that has won many 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.149
 people 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.930
 and it is true that there are places in this 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.230
 reality madrid-barça 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.230
 in real life 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.200
 to be competitive 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.650
 What must be emphasized is that 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.470
 As he says in Real Madrid, it's the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.760
 favorite team within what is the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.760
 video game and you 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.110
 This organ is the best in the game 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.440
 3 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.970
 changes quite that way 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:01.760
 individual you can manage a 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:04.780
 little the team your way but to the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.780
 two years 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.370
 but you need 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.090
 this company has been individual and sees it 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.090
 how does this student come out 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.180
 because we media using well to 3 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.830
 to enjoy meeting people but about 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.310
 everything we compete yes of course everything is 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.310
 important 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.950
 friends rafa thank you very much and 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.950

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.450

 world knows him I'll read it as the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.710
 text and because I'm in sex 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.710
 not be small we are playing 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.200
 inventing names and dating does not have a 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.680
 reason but you're aware that that's not 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.490
 is the logo that name has made you 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.920
 internationally well known inside 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.480
 of the world of videogamers if 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.520
 too much for all walkers of the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.500
 world now all the people have added me 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.700
 which intends to follow then center of 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.140
 invitations and take action 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.240
 let's focus on what is the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.680
 championship in this digital league is the 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.900
 first that this final phase takes place 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.930
 good what expectations you have within 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.430
 this tournament that motivates you excites you and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.560
 I'm excited because I'm from veron 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.060
 madrid from the cradle and represent my 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.410
 pool team since it can not be the 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.750
 actual field is a virtual field 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.910
 huge opportunity 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.190
 You have won countless trophies of 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.650
 individual way but this tournament is 3 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.200
 x 3 that changes a lot changes a lot 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.450
 because obviously the individual of the 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.920
 collective game is only for machines 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.290
 individual here in this city 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.730
 fellow experts the collective game or 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.980
 the organization does not have failures in 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.920
 defense as in attack and so on 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.050
 between us that of defending the little hand 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.090
 the great madrid that deludes there is no 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.620
 digital league if you always hope 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.000
 I am also a Madridista until my last 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.250
 heartbeat then yes it will be many 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.750
 teammates projects too 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.400
 of very high normal level that too 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.840
 motivates if rafa and the calculations are very 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.300
 good players races champion of spain 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.510
 which are many lathes we also have a 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.510
 good team 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.179
 questions or the theoretical this is all 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:36.680
 to be one of the best three hours 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.419
 one day do not play in five days do not 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.969
 depends on the free time you have to 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.559
 leave the studies other things 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:45.169
 you have to practice it quite a 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:47.929
 team formation and from there 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.779
 here I would win again and you have here to 

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:52.129
 take the trophy not win this this 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.929

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.989
 lose I would stay at home 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.110
 thank you very much and very many 

00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:02.110
 surprises 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.160
 the champion mountains of this first 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.490
 digital league 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.580
 the real madrid formed by alfonso bouquets 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:30.560
 al jasser text rafael sánchez anger will be 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.210
 rosita and oscar martín alias klose 14 there 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.710
 are the three champions that before 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.450
 that they leave already the last interview 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.000
 farewell 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.449
 alfonso repeat this experience for 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.180
 supposed 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.279
 what happens with colleagues or do you stay with 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.199
 these I stay with these we will try 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.820
 revalidate the title how the 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.700
 competition 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.490
 good are going to continue wearing the colors 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.530
 del madrid you like this part 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.570
 of the official team if in addition to me 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.150
 much like reality a little bit is the 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:04.450
 better so try to revalidate the 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.630
 title that's important in the game if 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:10.660
 better depart with a small advantage and 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.910
 I deprived him but good and about the night 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.640
 14 perry not at your feet 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.360
 he has enjoyed too much re - adaptation 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.189
 experience from some unique experience 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.389
 the question is bound what do you think it is 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:26.370
 good in competitions of this kind that 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.659
 they are different that look for the factor 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.330
 competitive from the point of view 

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:32.099
 group not only individual power 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.990
 many things the truth is that I 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:35.819
 I have always sincerely preferred a 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.219
 competition that is a group because the 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:40.229
 experience is group and you play as a team 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:42.680
 and share that guy with great 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:42.680
 players
