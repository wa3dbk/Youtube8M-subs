upon<00:00:57.930> seeing<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> word<00:00:58.440> disabled<00:00:58.949> my<00:00:59.070> brain

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
upon seeing the word disabled my brain

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
upon seeing the word disabled my brain
was<00:00:59.430> massive<00:00:59.730> new<00:00:59.820> started<00:01:00.180> thinking<00:01:00.510> why<00:01:00.960> are

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
was massive new started thinking why are

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.599 
was massive new started thinking why are
they<00:01:01.109> telling<00:01:01.320> me<00:01:01.500> about<00:01:01.590> disabilities<00:01:02.280> if

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
they telling me about disabilities if

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.759 
they telling me about disabilities if

they aren't going to offer me a place my

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.020 
they aren't going to offer me a place my
reasoning<00:01:05.070> was<00:01:05.100> correct<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.880> letter

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
reasoning was correct because the letter

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.640 
reasoning was correct because the letter
was<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> offer<00:01:06.390> me<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> place<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> read<00:01:07.200> PP<00:01:07.530> at

actually<00:02:03.390> my<00:02:03.600> back-up<00:02:04.049> plan<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.860> my

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
actually my back-up plan all of my

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
actually my back-up plan all of my
offers<00:02:05.340> were<00:02:05.460> AAA<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.600> didn't<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.840> my

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
offers were AAA so if I didn't get my

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.389 
offers were AAA so if I didn't get my
Oxford<00:02:07.290> offer<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.560> wouldn't<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.890> gotten<00:02:08.069> any

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.059 
of
if<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.569> did<00:02:09.750> happen<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.409> my<00:02:10.649> plan<00:02:10.709> was<00:02:11.039> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
if that did happen then my plan was to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.710 
if that did happen then my plan was to
do<00:02:11.190> an<00:02:11.280> apprenticeship<00:02:11.730> instead<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.420> my<00:02:12.510> last

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
do an apprenticeship instead so my last

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360 
do an apprenticeship instead so my last
piece<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> advice<00:02:13.049> is<00:02:13.500> trying<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.980> set<00:02:14.190> your

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
piece of advice is trying to set your

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.910 
piece of advice is trying to set your
entire<00:02:14.790> heart<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.510> soul<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.590> idea<00:02:16.830> of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
entire heart and soul on the idea of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.670 
entire heart and soul on the idea of
getting<00:02:17.280> me<00:02:17.340> into<00:02:17.549> Oxford<00:02:18.000> because<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:19.319> won't

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
getting me into Oxford because it won't

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.890 
getting me into Oxford because it won't
be<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.099> end<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> world<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.870> don't
