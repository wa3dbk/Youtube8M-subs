pretty<00:00:36.239> plain<00:00:36.890> actually<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.250> quite

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
pretty plain actually I like it's quite

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.420 
pretty plain actually I like it's quite
simplistic<00:00:38.960> it's<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:40.219> majority<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
simplistic it's got majority of it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.160 
simplistic it's got majority of it
yellow<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> black<00:00:42.570> stripe<00:00:42.870> over<00:00:42.960> here

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
carries on into the flap another thing I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.139 
carries on into the flap another thing I
like<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.570> deck<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.440> opens<00:01:02.399> from

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
like about this deck is it opens from

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.520 
like about this deck is it opens from
the<00:01:03.270> side<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.690> that's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:04.110> bit<00:01:04.260> unique

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the side so that's a little bit unique

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.190 
the side so that's a little bit unique
little<00:01:04.830> bit<00:01:04.920> unorthodox<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.049> take<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
little bit unorthodox so if we take a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.620 
little bit unorthodox so if we take a
look<00:01:07.380> inside<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.860> box

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
look inside the box

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.260 
look inside the box
same<00:01:09.630> deal<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.020> completely<00:01:10.560> yellow<00:01:11.270> it

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
same deal it's completely yellow it

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
same deal it's completely yellow it
would<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.479> been<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.820> nicer<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.950> they'd

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
would have been I just nicer if they'd

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.830 
would have been I just nicer if they'd
carry<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> black<00:01:17.729> stripe<00:01:18.240> inside<00:01:18.600> but

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
carry it on the black stripe inside but

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.420 
carry it on the black stripe inside but
I<00:01:18.990> mean<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.439> mind<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.860> my<00:01:19.950> preference

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
I mean I don't mind just my preference

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.630 
I mean I don't mind just my preference
um<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.860> not<00:01:22.860> sure<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.400> but

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
um so not sure if you can see this but

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
um so not sure if you can see this but
on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.180> flap<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.720> has<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> reveal<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.530> says

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
on the flap it has a reveal that says

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.730 
on the flap it has a reveal that says
your<00:01:26.310> card<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.939> two<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> Hearts<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.229> that's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
your card is the two of Hearts so that's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.429 
your card is the two of Hearts so that's
pretty<00:01:28.920> neat<00:01:29.450> yeah<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.659> overall<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
pretty neat yeah so overall I think this

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.480 
pretty neat yeah so overall I think this
box<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.400> quite<00:01:32.820> cool<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:35.009> side<00:01:35.280> flap

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
box is actually quite cool the side flap

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.060 
box is actually quite cool the side flap
really<00:01:35.759> gets<00:01:35.909> me<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.509> let's<00:01:37.500> take<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> look<00:01:37.950> at

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
really gets me so let's take a look at

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.370 
really gets me so let's take a look at
the<00:01:38.130> car<00:01:38.250> okay<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.020> cards

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
themselves pretty nice I'll get into the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.600 
themselves pretty nice I'll get into the
back<00:01:43.350> design<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> short

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
back design for a bit in just a short

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.999 
back design for a bit in just a short
while<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:47.520> deck<00:01:47.759> comes<00:01:48.060> with<00:01:48.680> two<00:01:49.680> jokers

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
of spades because mostly because of the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.350 
of spades because mostly because of the
shape<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.610> it

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360

shape of it
it's<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:11.349> don't<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.250> shape<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.489> kind<00:03:12.940> of

seemed a little bit weird to me
the<00:03:16.650> iris<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:18.010> seems<00:03:18.190> really<00:03:18.400> standard<00:03:18.819> but<00:03:19.239> I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
the iris it seems really standard but I

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.650 
the iris it seems really standard but I
know<00:03:20.260> it's<00:03:20.410> not<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:21.700> just<00:03:21.910> looks<00:03:22.060> weird<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.569> me

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660

cuts<00:05:00.510> well<00:05:05.310> flourishes<00:05:08.190> great<00:05:10.140> double<00:05:11.140> this

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210

what<00:05:13.210> does<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.390> single<00:05:13.600> quarter<00:05:14.010> double<00:05:15.010> this

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
what does a single quarter double this

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.840 
what does a single quarter double this
kind<00:05:17.470> of<00:05:17.620> sloppy<00:05:17.890> I<00:05:18.070> guess<00:05:18.340> or<00:05:18.610> is<00:05:18.700> that<00:05:18.790> just

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
kind of sloppy I guess or is that just

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.680 
kind of sloppy I guess or is that just
me<00:05:19.060> I'm<00:05:19.240> not<00:05:19.390> sure

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
me I'm not sure

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.150 
me I'm not sure
hey<00:05:20.140> check<00:05:22.290> it's<00:05:23.290> kinda<00:05:23.530> hard<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.710> control<00:05:23.950> for

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
hey check it's kinda hard to control for

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.000 
hey check it's kinda hard to control for
double<00:05:24.370> lives<00:05:24.550> but<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.510> don't<00:05:26.470> really<00:05:26.620> mind

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
double lives but I don't really mind

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.850 
double lives but I don't really mind
I<00:05:27.390> guess<00:05:28.390> you<00:05:28.510> after<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.110> while<00:05:29.320> it<00:05:29.470> gets<00:05:29.590> it

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
I guess you after a while it gets it

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.350 
I guess you after a while it gets it
gets<00:05:29.919> easier<00:05:30.370> so<00:05:31.470> if<00:05:32.470> you<00:05:32.710> were<00:05:32.830> to<00:05:33.010> do<00:05:33.360> color

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
gets easier so if you were to do color

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:44.550 
gets easier so if you were to do color
changers<00:05:36.810> it<00:05:37.810> is<00:05:39.000> fairly<00:05:40.410> good<00:05:41.410> at<00:05:41.530> those<00:05:43.560> sure

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
changers it is fairly good at those sure

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.930 
changers it is fairly good at those sure
they're<00:05:44.770> cut<00:05:44.950> again<00:05:46.380> kind<00:05:47.380> of<00:05:47.440> good<00:05:47.560> yes<00:05:48.010> so

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
they're cut again kind of good yes so

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.560 
they're cut again kind of good yes so
overall<00:05:49.540> I'd<00:05:49.900> give<00:05:49.960> this<00:05:50.620> deck<00:05:51.240> 4<00:05:52.240> out<00:05:52.330> of<00:05:52.419> 5

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
overall I'd give this deck 4 out of 5

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.140 
overall I'd give this deck 4 out of 5
for<00:05:52.750> design<00:05:53.080> and<00:05:53.320> a<00:05:53.890> 3<00:05:54.370> out<00:05:54.490> of<00:05:54.520> 5<00:05:54.729> for<00:05:54.850> handling

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
for design and a 3 out of 5 for handling

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.890 
for design and a 3 out of 5 for handling
that<00:05:55.390> might<00:05:55.750> be<00:05:55.870> a<00:05:55.900> bit<00:05:56.140> strict<00:05:56.650> but<00:05:57.780> not<00:05:58.780> my

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
that might be a bit strict but not my

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.080 
that might be a bit strict but not my
favorite<00:05:59.200> kind<00:05:59.350> of<00:05:59.440> deck<00:05:59.560> I<00:05:59.800> guess<00:06:00.700> the<00:06:00.820> 4<00:06:00.970> out

favorite kind of deck I guess the 4 out

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.440 
favorite kind of deck I guess the 4 out
of<00:06:01.150> 5<00:06:01.300> would<00:06:01.450> probably<00:06:01.990> because<00:06:02.320> of<00:06:03.450> the

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
of 5 would probably because of the

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.540 
of 5 would probably because of the
sights<00:06:05.020> that<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.350> know<00:06:05.410> this<00:06:05.620> thing<00:06:05.890> really<00:06:06.190> is
