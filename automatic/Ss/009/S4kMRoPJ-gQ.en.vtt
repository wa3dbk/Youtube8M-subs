00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
with the polymer medium then it's able

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.730 
with the polymer medium then it's able
to<00:00:27.860> wash<00:00:28.190> off<00:00:28.520> here's<00:00:29.510> another<00:00:29.840> one<00:00:30.109> here<00:00:30.440> so

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
runs off pressure just faintly on the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.240 
runs off pressure just faintly on the
edge<00:02:28.430> here<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:33.530> what<00:02:33.680> I'm<00:02:33.769> into<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.130> I'm

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
edge here and now what I'm into is I'm

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.009 
edge here and now what I'm into is I'm
just<00:02:34.280> gonna<00:02:34.579> let<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:34.910> dry<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.480> then<00:02:35.750> from

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
there I'm gonna build up more layers

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.310 
there I'm gonna build up more layers
