00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.270 
sure you can you can bleed the fish
there<00:04:08.120> on<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:08.390> spot<00:04:08.560> some<00:04:09.560> people<00:04:09.890> think<00:04:10.070> that

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
there on the spot some people think that

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.950 
there on the spot some people think that
maybe<00:04:10.490> it's<00:04:10.730> not<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.000> most<00:04:11.150> humane<00:04:11.510> thing<00:04:11.570> to

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
maybe it's not the most humane thing to

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.670 
maybe it's not the most humane thing to
do<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.620> don't<00:04:13.040> have<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:14.050> most<00:04:15.050> big<00:04:15.380> fish

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
do so you don't have to most big fish

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.620 
do so you don't have to most big fish
most<00:04:15.980> fish<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:16.640> buy<00:04:16.850> at<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:17.120> market<00:04:17.510> or

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
most fish that you buy at a market or

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.500 
most fish that you buy at a market or
bled<00:04:17.930> on<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.710> boat<00:04:18.920> but<00:04:19.880> what<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:20.120> do<00:04:20.239> is<00:04:20.359> you

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
bled on the boat but what you do is you

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.080 
bled on the boat but what you do is you
bleed<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.900> fish<00:04:21.140> get<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.160> ice<00:04:22.340> then<00:04:22.880> when

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
bleed the fish get it on ice then when

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.790 
bleed the fish get it on ice then when
you<00:04:23.180> get<00:04:23.300> it<00:04:23.450> back<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.870> dock<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.170> it<00:04:24.680> was

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
you get it back to the dock and it was

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.320 
you get it back to the dock and it was
actually<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.130> tip<00:04:25.310> from<00:04:25.430> one<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:25.640> our<00:04:25.820> captain's

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
actually a tip from one of our captain's

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.840 
actually a tip from one of our captain's
like<00:04:26.600> is<00:04:26.750> that<00:04:27.380> when<00:04:27.830> you're<00:04:27.980> using<00:04:28.250> saltwater

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
like is that when you're using saltwater

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.810 
like is that when you're using saltwater
fish<00:04:29.210> take<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:30.380> fish<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:30.980> put<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.430> in<00:04:31.550> ice

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
fish take that fish and put it in ice

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.450 
fish take that fish and put it in ice
water<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:33.080> has<00:04:33.290> salt<00:04:33.740> water<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.430> and

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
water that has salt water in it and

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.610 
water that has salt water in it and
that'll<00:04:35.180> cool<00:04:35.480> down<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.900> fillet<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.440> you

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
that'll cool down the fillet and you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.500 
that'll cool down the fillet and you
won't<00:04:36.860> get<00:04:37.010> that<00:04:37.190> fresh<00:04:37.460> water<00:04:37.790> intrusion<00:04:38.210> it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
won't get that fresh water intrusion it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.420 
won't get that fresh water intrusion it
won't<00:04:38.690> soak<00:04:38.990> up<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.320> whole<00:04:39.500> bunch<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.920> freshmen

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
won't soak up a whole bunch of freshmen

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.950 
won't soak up a whole bunch of freshmen
that's<00:04:40.640> a<00:04:40.760> very<00:04:40.970> important<00:04:41.390> tip<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.660> use<00:04:41.780> that

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
that's a very important tip to use that

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.370 
that's a very important tip to use that
saltwater<00:04:42.320> right<00:04:42.980> on<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.430> fish<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:44.380> when

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
saltwater right on that fish and when

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.320 
saltwater right on that fish and when
you<00:04:45.470> come<00:04:45.620> back<00:04:45.770> home<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.610> want<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.940> get<00:04:47.150> that

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
you come back home you want to get that

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.260 
you come back home you want to get that
stuff<00:04:47.540> frozen<00:04:48.350> sealed<00:04:49.070> as<00:04:49.310> soon<00:04:49.520> as<00:04:49.700> possible

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
stuff frozen sealed as soon as possible

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.810 
stuff frozen sealed as soon as possible
you<00:04:50.690> can<00:04:51.020> either<00:04:51.140> use<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.440> zip<00:04:51.860> top<00:04:52.130> bag<00:04:52.190> and

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
you can either use a zip top bag and

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.790 
you can either use a zip top bag and
then<00:04:53.360> squeeze<00:04:53.750> all<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:53.990> air<00:04:54.140> out<00:04:54.320> of<00:04:54.530> it<00:04:54.740> that

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
then squeeze all the air out of it that

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.490 
then squeeze all the air out of it that
works<00:04:55.250> for<00:04:55.520> short<00:04:55.730> periods<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.180> time<00:04:56.500> you've

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
works for short periods of time you've

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.710 
works for short periods of time you've
got<00:04:57.740> one<00:04:57.950> of<00:04:58.070> those<00:04:58.160> vacuum<00:04:58.520> sucker<00:04:59.060> things<00:04:59.450> it

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
got one of those vacuum sucker things it

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.420 
got one of those vacuum sucker things it
sucks<00:04:59.960> all<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.290> air<00:05:00.320> out<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.860> bag<00:05:01.040> it's<00:05:01.370> a

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
sucks all the air out of the bag it's a

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.130 
sucks all the air out of the bag it's a
great<00:05:01.700> thing<00:05:01.940> right<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.690> you<00:05:02.780> can<00:05:02.930> say<00:05:03.110> that
