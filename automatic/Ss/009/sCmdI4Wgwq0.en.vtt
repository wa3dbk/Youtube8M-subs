00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:09.120
 Hi guys, how are you? I came here. 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.099
 record my first video finally 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.799
 I recorded the video as I had agreed 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.199
 there on the blog ask you to leave the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:22.289
 questions and gradually I 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.109
 quick videos to clarify doubts 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:32.090
 So you can keep sending in questions. 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:35.040
 so today about pain on pain 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.070
 Then how did it go? 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:44.489
 so I 'll tell you a little bit when 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:52.289
 I was still waking up in the living room. 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:59.039
 I surgery but soon after I woke up 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:04.350
 there actually I was in fourth 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:09.299
 even on the same day because of the pain 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 because I was in a lot of pain and 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:24.840
 she was crying for pain but it was not 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:27.240
 nose was right on the chin so I got it 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.310
 remedy every three spent four hours 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.930
 the night sleeping and waking up and it was a 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.780
 pain because my everything was so much 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.329
 swollen though much more in this region 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:46.110
 cnaa like this but the nose itself did not hurt 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:49.049
 but the nose is always and is sensitive 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:57.630
 even when I play from the south when I 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:59.690
 the main donor was 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.870
 on the chin 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.190
 and even today when it's raining or 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.220
 when there has been a shower of love to the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.430
 my that I got there he points them 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.550
 pound meter points so they give 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.930
 a hoe and stay up and / or feel 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.360
 discomfort so the pain in this whole 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.970
 This recovery of mine well that always me 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.970
 accompanied so is part of it 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.570
 Good, I was fine, I was coming to 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.760
 soul I was going back to my routine 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.860
 President 15 days to recover 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.390
 I think mainly was in function 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.060
 of the chin because I do not 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.500
 I hoped to go through as much work as 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.140
 I went through the nose chin 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.340
 I was donated everyone said marison hurts 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.960
 It hurts 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.310
 if I had to do something else today 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.310
 nose surgery I would do 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.750
 then that's it 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.000
 one of the questions and if you have any 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:20.350
