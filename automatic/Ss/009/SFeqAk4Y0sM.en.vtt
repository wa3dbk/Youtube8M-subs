throttle on brake linkage and basically
I've<00:00:13.769> had<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.549> maybe<00:00:15.049> know<00:00:16.049> four<00:00:16.410> or

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
five fuel tanks worth of Bashan and I've

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.140 
five fuel tanks worth of Bashan and I've
had<00:00:20.789> no<00:00:20.820> problems<00:00:21.300> with<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:23.640> original<00:00:24.029> one

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
had no problems with it the original one

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.540 
had no problems with it the original one
that<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.359> had<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:26.330> basically<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:28.550> in

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that I had on there basically it's in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.400 
that I had on there basically it's in
which<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> Roman<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:31.820> spring<00:00:32.820> which

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
which is the Roman one the spring which

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.590 
which is the Roman one the spring which
separated<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.910> throttle<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
separated the the throttle from the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.160 
separated the the throttle from the
brake<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:38.280> seized<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.360> basically<00:00:39.780> I

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
brake it seized up so basically I

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.490 
brake it seized up so basically I
couldn't<00:00:40.739> break<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> thought<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:42.960> run

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
couldn't break and so I thought well run

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.729 
couldn't break and so I thought well run
this<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> I'll<00:00:44.100> try<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.370> new<00:00:44.670> system<00:00:45.739> RC

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this off and I'll try this new system RC

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
this off and I'll try this new system RC
