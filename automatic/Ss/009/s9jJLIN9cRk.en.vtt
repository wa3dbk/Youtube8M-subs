cherry trees here in Minnesota now this

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.020 
cherry trees here in Minnesota now this
might<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.380> different<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> pan<00:00:14.040> where<00:00:14.340> you're

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
might be different the pan where you're

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
might be different the pan where you're
at<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.230> Minnesota<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.039> what<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
at but here in Minnesota this is what a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.160 
at but here in Minnesota this is what a
cherry<00:00:17.789> tree<00:00:18.000> will<00:00:18.119> look<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.690> how<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
cherry tree will look like and how to

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.689 
cherry tree will look like and how to
spot<00:00:19.529> them<00:00:19.770> all<00:00:20.130> right<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.490> come<00:00:20.670> over

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
spot them all right so if we come over

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.759 
spot them all right so if we come over
here<00:00:21.330> there's<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.869> couple<00:00:21.990> cherry<00:00:22.350> trees<00:00:22.560> over

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
here there's a couple cherry trees over

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.710 
here there's a couple cherry trees over
here<00:00:22.800> actually<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.789> small<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.269> here

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
here actually this small one right here

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960 
here actually this small one right here
at<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> cherry<00:00:25.500> tree<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.519> one<00:00:26.640> back

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
at the cherry tree and that one back

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.269 
at the cherry tree and that one back
there<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.449> bigger<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> comes<00:00:29.099> close

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
there that bigger one if it comes close

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.299 
there that bigger one if it comes close
to<00:00:29.730> consumes<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.119> bark<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.570> she<00:00:30.689> looks<00:00:30.869> like

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
to consumes a bark like she looks like

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.950 
to consumes a bark like she looks like
it's<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.610> scaly<00:00:33.090> flaky<00:00:33.690> looking

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
it's this really scaly flaky looking

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
it's this really scaly flaky looking
bark<00:00:34.370> kind<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> almost<00:00:35.610> looks<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> pine

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
bark kind of almost looks like a pine

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.580 
bark kind of almost looks like a pine
tree<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> cherry<00:00:37.380> tree

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
tree but that's what the cherry tree

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.580 
tree but that's what the cherry tree
bark<00:00:37.850> actually<00:00:38.850> looks<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.530> there's<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
bark actually looks like and there's a

lot of these things around here that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
lot of these things around here that
goes<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.950> those<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.969> both

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
goes to right there those are both

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.119 
goes to right there those are both
cherry<00:00:45.329> trees<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.660> well<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.950> come

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
cherry trees as well so as we come

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.470 
cherry trees as well so as we come
through<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.550> here's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> couple<00:00:48.000> more

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
this one right there is cherry tree at

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.060 
this one right there is cherry tree at
the<00:00:50.610> cherry<00:00:50.879> tree<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.890> back

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the cherry tree that one right back

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.189 
the cherry tree that one right back
there<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> cherry<00:00:53.820> tree<00:00:54.410> this<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:56.840> see<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
there is a cherry tree this one see that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
there is a cherry tree this one see that
one<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.609> sorry<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.149> there's<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.750 
one there is it sorry that one there's a
cherry<00:01:00.660> tree<00:01:00.809> over<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:02.399> broken

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
cherry tree over here that's broken

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.390 
cherry tree over here that's broken
there<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.120> cherry<00:01:03.449> tree<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:04.400> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there that's cherry tree as well so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.480 
there that's cherry tree as well so
again<00:01:05.519> here's<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.090> bark<00:01:06.390> looks<00:01:06.630> like

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
again here's what that bark looks like

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.770 
again here's what that bark looks like
now<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.670> they're<00:01:08.820> younger<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:09.600> have

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
now when they're younger they don't have

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
now when they're younger they don't have
that<00:01:09.960> style<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.409> bark<00:01:10.680> they'll<00:01:11.520> start<00:01:11.820> looking

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that style of bark they'll start looking

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.410 
that style of bark they'll start looking
like<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:12.869> smooth<00:01:13.280> ish<00:01:14.280> bark<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.180> older

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
like this very smooth ish bark the older

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600 
like this very smooth ish bark the older
they<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:16.049> rough<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.470> gets<00:01:16.610> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
they get the more rough it gets and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.609 
they get the more rough it gets and
there's<00:01:17.790> more<00:01:18.030> ants

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.440 

that's<00:01:24.619> what<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:25.009> younger<00:01:25.880> cherry<00:01:26.180> tree<00:01:26.360> will

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
that's what a younger cherry tree will

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.190 
that's what a younger cherry tree will
look<00:01:26.479> like<00:01:27.220> there's<00:01:28.220> another<00:01:28.369> one<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:29.049> told<00:01:30.049> you

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
look like there's another one I told you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.560 
look like there's another one I told you
they're<00:01:30.320> everywhere<00:01:31.060> there's<00:01:32.060> another<00:01:32.360> one

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
they're everywhere there's another one

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.660 
they're everywhere there's another one
right<00:01:32.720> there

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
right there

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.810 
right there
right<00:01:34.670> there's<00:01:35.000> no<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:37.220> there

right there's no and there

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.690 
right there's no and there
that<00:01:38.690> one's<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.899> cherry<00:01:39.140> tree<00:01:39.520> I'm<00:01:40.520> back

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
that one's a cherry tree I'm back

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.450 
that one's a cherry tree I'm back
there's<00:01:40.909> cherry<00:01:41.210> trees<00:01:41.450> wall<00:01:42.220> so<00:01:43.220> here's<00:01:43.399> a

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
there's cherry trees wall so here's a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.139 
there's cherry trees wall so here's a
look<00:01:43.549> at<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.759> leaves

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
look at the leaves

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.649 
look at the leaves
they're<00:01:45.080> oblong<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:45.799> they<00:01:46.159> have<00:01:46.659> some

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
they're oblong and they have some

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.980 
they're oblong and they have some
serrations<00:01:48.200> along<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.530> edges<00:01:48.799> there<00:01:49.840> but<00:01:50.840> by

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
serrations along the edges there but by

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.380 
serrations along the edges there but by
far<00:01:51.289> it's<00:01:51.530> going<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.740> be<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.920> bark<00:01:52.210> at<00:01:53.210> least

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
far it's going to be the bark at least

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.359 
far it's going to be the bark at least
to<00:01:53.570> me<00:01:53.689> that's<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.050> it's<00:01:54.590> very<00:01:54.800> distinctive

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
to me that's but it's very distinctive
