00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 one - before it became prof 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.680
 yo mama people and welcome to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.200
 this new fashion review of the spiderman 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.200
 mods for the 1 points in luck for the 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.099
 1.3.2011 my room he in my room 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.820
 pure no idea ramps this and yes 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.710
 this mod adds armor 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.510
 with a new armor parts of the hand 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.140
 you just a handle and yes nothing 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.460
 normal badermann armor yes die 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.270
 times of flight I can do that now 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.040
 so shoes currently yes that the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.090
 chest and the helmet and here you see 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.370
 Already the first act unfortunately the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.980
 Armor has no texture when you turn it on 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.080
 but that's not so bad 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.539
 because the function of the is extremely cool 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.970
 is it always I can give you that 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:13.350
 crafting recipes show so force 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 the helmet of the parliament force her so 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.750
 with the cobweb 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.770
 in the middle because the pants like one 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.840
 normal pants and here the cobwebs 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.340
 this one is good as normal good and so 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.620
 a kind of crossing without the point here 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.990
 at the top of cobwebs and last but not least 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.840
 The gloves will come with three 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.200
 railroad in the middle cracked and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.190
 Right and left hold like cobwebs 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.580
 so now I can give you that one 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.650
 Function of the mod or this armor 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.260
 show here and if this 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.530
 Glove here in hand in hand 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.750
 have a right click you can press 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.070
 you as with the wiener a pearl with 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.650
 the end of august still the eye where he 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.240
 teleport back says he has, I use 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:08.340
 thereby also from this glove 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.470
 but yes and he does not have that much 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.670
 reach and ask for sure 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.550
 Now why you all these things 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.140
 that is when you are the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.240
 gloves the hand has or the in 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.130
 but your inventory is so and 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.280
 her armor here at abdi ball more 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.470
 Armor you can do this here 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.330
 you can work on all materials and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.530
 simply climb up minecraft and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.130
 just run against and flip up 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.840
 I think a very cool thing because 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.870
 adventure with this motto does it 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.580
 determined a lot of fun or with 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.989
 friends together so i can 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.560
 I think I'm pretty cool 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.610
 before and that's why I wanted you the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.630
 mother say again because the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.950
 actually pretty much so far 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:59.260
 is unknown and I try the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:01.540
 pumpkins to jump on it okay that 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.440
 I can always say what it looks like 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.060
 be f1 motor 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.810
 he just believed like a spider 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:16.010
 well you can also over 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.260
 materials hold up 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.610
 and you can also, as I already do 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.099
 shown we can gaps here 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.989
 you can also climb over 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.680
 and if you're good you can do it that way 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:33.110
 what jump up there edge 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:36.379
 yes because yes this is already the second lady 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.879
 and I wanted them all 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.000
 second shot I was the first x 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.739
 Factor in any case makes the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.739
 mods for a lot of fun and is still 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.079
 relatively unknown, I just wanted to 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.340
 show and we'll see you soon 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.390
 an installation i hope it has you 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.190
 like 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.150
 until ok if you have the mod now 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.340
 want to install 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.549
 then I would first of all the two 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.980
 files that is the modder and the 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.739
 tensions and therefore the real ones 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.359
 motto yes there you go I'll do the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.079
 on the left in the description for the modder 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:21.019
 and above all a motto and then invites 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:22.970
 everyone here that fun and the 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.270
 model or can you also here the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.610
 immediately linked then you have that 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.410
 made down at the windows 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.740
 Drew percent of the data center goes 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.900
 on the roaming folder and it goes up 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.740
 The zero point minecraft folder became the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.690
 winter finds there goes out and gives 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.630
 right click for the minecraft 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.099
 Here's a simple one crafting road 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:55.610
 open with indra archivar or senegal 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:57.410
 We're there now as ten 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.770
 meter in shape must be in any case 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.590
 Clear 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.840
 he finds that you are installing pug 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.050
 can 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:12.160
 so then we would all be up 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:15.040
 that's the motto because without a team you give 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.310
 a holistic and marked all 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.080
 files and you just pull the things 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.139
 from all over the world 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.139
 only doing the same with the 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.490
