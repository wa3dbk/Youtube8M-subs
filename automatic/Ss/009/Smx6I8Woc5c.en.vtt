and more expensive things as you go
along<00:01:01.659> so<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.780> interesting<00:01:05.320> parts<00:01:05.500> of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
along so one of the interesting parts of

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.360 
along so one of the interesting parts of
it<00:01:05.800> is<00:01:05.950> your<00:01:06.190> starting<00:01:06.520> cards<00:01:06.910> you<00:01:07.540> start<00:01:07.840> with

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
it is your starting cards you start with

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.670 
it is your starting cards you start with
five<00:01:09.480> wilds<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.570> five<00:01:11.610> basic<00:01:12.610> letters<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
five wilds and five basic letters the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.290 
five wilds and five basic letters the
rst<00:01:14.680> NL<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:16.660> no<00:01:16.870> vowels<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.580> each<00:01:18.580> we<00:01:19.000> score

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
rst NL so no vowels and each we score

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.440 
rst NL so no vowels and each we score
for<00:01:19.540> one<00:01:19.690> point<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:21.010> five<00:01:21.250> wild<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.150> start

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
for one point the five wild you start

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.710 
for one point the five wild you start
with<00:01:22.630> I'll<00:01:23.260> score<00:01:23.770> 4-0<00:01:24.040> but<00:01:24.640> it<00:01:25.450> can<00:01:25.600> be

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
with I'll score 4-0 but it can be

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.330 
with I'll score 4-0 but it can be
anything<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.380> they<00:01:26.830> allow<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.190> lot<00:01:27.310> of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
anything so they allow you a lot of

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.100 
anything so they allow you a lot of
flexibility<00:01:27.940> but<00:01:28.540> they<00:01:28.690> don't<00:01:28.840> want<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.020> be

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
flexibility but they don't want to be

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.620 
flexibility but they don't want to be
score<00:01:29.410> as<00:01:29.560> much<00:01:29.730> so<00:01:30.730> you<00:01:30.790> start<00:01:31.300> with<00:01:31.420> just

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
score as much so you start with just

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.660 
score as much so you start with just
these<00:01:32.020> basic<00:01:32.230> points<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.010> then<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.310> start<00:01:33.550> to

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
these basic points and then you start to

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.530 
these basic points and then you start to
work<00:01:33.820> your<00:01:34.000> way<00:01:34.150> up

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
work your way up

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.180 
work your way up
now<00:01:34.870> these<00:01:35.050> piles<00:01:35.380> are<00:01:35.650> each<00:01:35.860> have<00:01:36.160> a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
now these piles are each have a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.070 
now these piles are each have a
different<00:01:36.370> amount<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:37.060> they<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.930> they

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
different amount that they that they

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.200 
different amount that they that they
cost<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.980> this<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.400> three<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.670> four<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
cost so this is the three the four the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.230 
cost so this is the three the four the
five<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:41.140> know<00:01:41.260> and<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:41.980> on<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:42.400> they<00:01:42.880> cost

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
five you know and so on so they cost

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.350 
five you know and so on so they cost
more<00:01:43.510> and<00:01:43.660> less<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.940> know<00:01:45.970> so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
more and less and you can you know so

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.120 
more and less and you can you know so
based<00:01:46.540> on<00:01:46.690> how<00:01:46.810> much<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:46.960> make<00:01:47.260> you<00:01:47.440> can<00:01:47.620> you

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
based on how much you make you can you

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.500 
based on how much you make you can you
could<00:01:48.280> buy<00:01:48.400> two<00:01:48.460> cheaper<00:01:49.030> cards<00:01:49.300> or<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.480> can

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
could buy two cheaper cards or you can

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.070 
could buy two cheaper cards or you can
buy<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:49.870> more<00:01:50.050> expensive<00:01:50.500> card<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
buy one more expensive card so the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.460 
buy one more expensive card so the
balance<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.650> as<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.430> go<00:01:54.580> along<00:01:55.470> sometimes

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
balance is as you go along sometimes

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.750

I'm forming word I can use this e if
it's<00:02:36.930> currently<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.530> e<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.310> my<00:02:38.550> word<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.660> I

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
it's currently the e in my word so I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.940 
it's currently the e in my word so I
could<00:02:40.650> do<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.130> could<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:42.030> red<00:02:43.190> are<00:02:44.190> E<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.030> T<00:02:45.950> that

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
could do I could do red are E and T that

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.690 
could do I could do red are E and T that
was<00:02:47.070> my<00:02:47.390> then<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.110> also<00:02:49.710> scores<00:02:50.280> one<00:02:50.490> so

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
was my then and this also scores one so

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.880 
was my then and this also scores one so
I'd<00:02:50.790> give<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.000> two<00:02:51.450> three<00:02:51.930> four<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.410> add<00:02:52.560> four

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
I'd give one two three four and add four

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.710 
I'd give one two three four and add four
I<00:02:53.130> could<00:02:53.550> buy<00:02:53.670> from<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:53.970> pile<00:02:54.210> is<00:02:54.240> probably

cards<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.640> your<00:03:09.270> next<00:03:09.510> turn<00:03:09.840> you're<00:03:10.230> going<00:03:10.440> to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
cards so your next turn you're going to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.600 
cards so your next turn you're going to
draw<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.400> say<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.970> one<00:03:12.210> if<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.870> play<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.230> R

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
draw so say this one if you play this R

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.270 
draw so say this one if you play this R
then<00:03:14.720> you're<00:03:15.720> gonna<00:03:15.870> get<00:03:16.050> tricks<00:03:16.710> or<00:03:16.890> kresnik

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
then you're gonna get tricks or kresnik

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.949 
then you're gonna get tricks or kresnik
since<00:03:17.520> you're<00:03:17.670> gonna<00:03:17.790> draw<00:03:17.970> eight<00:03:18.360> cards<00:03:18.780> next

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
since you're gonna draw eight cards next

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.210 
since you're gonna draw eight cards next
turn<00:03:19.200> which<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.350> getting<00:03:19.650> gonna<00:03:19.920> give<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.190> a

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
turn which is getting gonna give you a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.490 
turn which is getting gonna give you a
lot<00:03:20.400> more<00:03:20.580> flexibility<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.720> what<00:03:22.170> words<00:03:22.350> you

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
lot more flexibility in what words you

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.680 
lot more flexibility in what words you
can<00:03:22.680> create<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.820> trick<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.360> powers

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
can create the trick is with the powers

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.850 
can create the trick is with the powers
though<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.620> only<00:03:25.860> get<00:03:26.160> powers<00:03:26.670> for<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.860> one

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
though you only get powers for the one

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.460 
though you only get powers for the one
for<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.400> letters<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.180> use<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.930> word<00:03:31.110> if

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
for the letters you use in the word if

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.810 
for the letters you use in the word if
you<00:03:31.650> left<00:03:31.860> them<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.040> your<00:03:32.190> hand

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
you left them in your hand

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.880 
you left them in your hand
you<00:03:33.030> don't<00:03:33.209> get<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.450> effect<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.680> trick

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
you don't get the effect so the trick

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.040 
you don't get the effect so the trick
sometimes<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.420> cool<00:03:36.660> powers<00:03:36.959> you

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
sometimes is you have to cool powers you

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.510 
sometimes is you have to cool powers you
want<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.320> use<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.650> gotta<00:03:37.800> figure<00:03:37.980> out<00:03:38.130> to

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
want to use but you gotta figure out to

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.280 
want to use but you gotta figure out to
the<00:03:38.610> both<00:03:38.790> together<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.390> word<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:40.140> that's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
the both together in a word and that's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.890 
the both together in a word and that's
kind<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.530> some<00:03:40.770> of<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.890> tension<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.370> game

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
kind of some of the tension in the game

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.090 
kind of some of the tension in the game
there's<00:03:42.900> also<00:03:43.080> things<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.680> give<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.980> more

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
there's also things that give you more

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.810 
there's also things that give you more
score<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.230> if<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:47.100> know<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.610> first

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
score so if you know this is the first

they<00:03:59.489> score<00:03:59.760> pretty<00:04:00.030> well<00:04:00.230> but<00:04:01.280> you<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.310> to

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
they score pretty well but you have to

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.430 
they score pretty well but you have to
use<00:04:02.730> them<00:04:02.910> yet<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.450> use<00:04:03.510> both<00:04:03.750> letters<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.290> this

or ease first person to get a seven

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.540 
or ease first person to get a seven
letter<00:04:09.570> word<00:04:09.750> gets<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.769> actually<00:04:11.100> take<00:04:11.340> this

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
letter word gets to actually take this

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.610 
letter word gets to actually take this
and<00:04:11.790> put<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.300> in<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.510> deck<00:04:12.690> you'll<00:04:12.959> notice<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
and put it in the deck you'll notice the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.990 
and put it in the deck you'll notice the
common<00:04:13.950> vowel<00:04:14.100> is<00:04:14.220> actually<00:04:14.489> worth<00:04:14.610> your<00:04:14.850> trip

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
common vowel is actually worth your trip

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.370 
common vowel is actually worth your trip
twice<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.600> gives<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.900> battle<00:04:16.080> for<00:04:16.260> your

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
twice so it gives you a battle for your

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.819 
twice so it gives you a battle for your
deck<00:04:16.530> and

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
deck and

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.420 
deck and
and<00:04:18.479> now<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.509> common<00:04:20.019> vowel<00:04:20.169> has<00:04:20.289> changed<00:04:20.769> but

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
and now a common vowel has changed but

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.950 
and now a common vowel has changed but
to<00:04:21.789> get<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.030> next<00:04:22.210> one<00:04:22.449> it's<00:04:22.630> not<00:04:22.780> going<00:04:22.900> to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
to get the next one it's not going to

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.089 
to get the next one it's not going to
take<00:04:23.139> an<00:04:23.259> eight-letter<00:04:23.740> word<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:24.819> on<00:04:25.000> so

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
take an eight-letter word and so on so

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.469 
take an eight-letter word and so on so
some<00:04:27.099> players<00:04:27.490> can<00:04:27.759> actually<00:04:28.060> shoot<00:04:28.210> for

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
some players can actually shoot for

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.939 
some players can actually shoot for
longer<00:04:28.810> words<00:04:29.020> in<00:04:29.229> other<00:04:29.349> players<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.830> you

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
longer words in other players that you

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.180 
longer words in other players that you
for<00:04:30.130> shorter<00:04:30.460> words<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:32.199> game<00:04:32.380> ends<00:04:32.860> when

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
for shorter words so the game ends when

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.820 
for shorter words so the game ends when
either<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:34.000> victory<00:04:34.389> piles<00:04:34.630> are<00:04:34.780> gone<00:04:34.930> or<00:04:35.199> all

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
either to victory piles are gone or all

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.659 
either to victory piles are gone or all
of<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.280> common<00:04:37.180> battles<00:04:37.479> are<00:04:37.599> gone<00:04:38.669> these

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
of the common battles are gone these

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.879 
of the common battles are gone these
different<00:04:40.449> victory<00:04:40.960> cards<00:04:41.319> have<00:04:41.560> different

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
different victory cards have different

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.999 
different victory cards have different
amounts<00:04:42.190> than<00:04:42.310> them<00:04:42.460> so<00:04:42.490> they<00:04:43.560> cost<00:04:44.560> more<00:04:44.830> and

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
amounts than them so they cost more and

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.439 
amounts than them so they cost more and
more<00:04:45.190> but<00:04:45.430> they<00:04:45.520> also<00:04:45.639> give<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.000> more<00:04:46.120> victory

more but they also give you more victory

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.450 
more but they also give you more victory
points<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:46.960> they<00:04:47.080> all<00:04:47.259> function<00:04:47.770> as<00:04:47.949> wilds

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
points but they all function as wilds
