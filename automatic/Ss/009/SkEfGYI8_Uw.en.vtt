now I guess getting taller and taller
and<00:06:13.700> taller<00:06:13.909> so<00:06:14.419> you<00:06:14.479> started<00:06:14.990> as<00:06:15.169> a<00:06:15.200> defender

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
and taller so you started as a defender

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.540 
and taller so you started as a defender
but<00:06:16.400> obviously<00:06:16.880> won't<00:06:17.450> until<00:06:17.960> the<00:06:18.380> mid<00:06:19.280> court
