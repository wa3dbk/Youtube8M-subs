think I think that it's it's founded on

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.050 
think I think that it's it's founded on
sort<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.379> exploitation<00:02:51.860> not<00:02:52.280> really<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.940> know

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
sort of exploitation not really you know

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.140 
sort of exploitation not really you know
what<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.329> would<00:02:53.450> feel<00:02:53.599> from<00:02:53.750> your<00:02:53.870> child
