00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello good morning welcome one more day 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.860
 to the grave odds and ends on this occasion 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.180
 I'm going to bring you a little kid to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.920
 panama is how you know great 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.460
 defect hard drives in lens format 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.830
 efe s / a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.169
 the format that we usually have then 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.509
 you will have 16 gb hard disk that we have 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.099
 had the equipment with windows and others 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.630
 this time our behavior 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.940
 what is called tok sera 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.500
 the program itself is paid but 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.809
 good if you search the Internet for more 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.550
 you can find it cracker and such 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.470
 this one that I'm going to be I think it 's 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.720
 face that has given a little of all 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.610
 forms if it is not created are 15 days 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.489
 try what I have case of needing it 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.890
 what he would do and so on 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 the installation of the program itself is very 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.379
 simple voucher we would give to install 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.090
 if it tells us that we want it to be 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.500
 we have downloaded from the internet and they want 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.199
 your safe site blah blah blah blah blah 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.890
 blah that if we say yes what 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.890
 we want to install 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 will execute the software confirmation 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.060
 we accept 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.450
 installs very quickly once 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.659
 installed has asked us to start the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.609
 team 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.820
 trial version if we had license 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:45.960
 we use patched we would have the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.850
 file with the serial number hand 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.740
 the partial and masters and you're 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.150
 as this does not usually use then you 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.630
 we would continue 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.770
 not to ask for the password 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.479
 the installation is exactly like you 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.180
 I said we asked as initial 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.890
 once it is started, there is no need to execute 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.019
 no program nor do you have to do anything 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.640
 more simply put will connect 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.680
 our hard drives in format was of 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.260
 fs al al pp and we will not be able to 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.000
 read how to write or modify data 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.790
 do what we want with the hard drive 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.640
 as if it were a sx native hard drive 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.299
 good whose condition and now when what 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.940
 I start recording again so that 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.690
 you see that if you want the hard drives I 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.020
 I just connected my ntfs hard drive 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.450
 I train the connector base for what 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.450
 the system is not known 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.260
 and as we see they have appeared here this is 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.880
 one and this would be another 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.870
 they are data from windows voucher of games of 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.450
 Xbox and so it can do what 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.650
 want with them 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.360
 copy images copy videos remove 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.790
 data all 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.390
 you can do anything with it with 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.340
 the hard drive 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.060
 and as I say this comes very well because that 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.680
 if we want to spend something some pen that we 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.050
 have left or some hard drive that we 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.420
 have left and we do not have the option of 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.990
 can you format it to put it in 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.320
 xxv format to a format that is native 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.350
 of sx because it comes perfect because 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.050
 we installed a small application worth and 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.040
 As you can see, he lets us do everything with him 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:49.560
 with the hard drive and nothing this is all the 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.270
 download link of the program I'll put 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.200
 I'll put the information box 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.110
 although downloaded from the page 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.040
 official and as we 've already seen it has 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.200
 15 day trial if you want it the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.819
 patch to see if I find it and in 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.900
 the case that finds it patched os 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.849
 I will also put in the box 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.260
 information the link where you will put 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.540
 patched is worth so that you can 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.670
 download and you can use it without the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.620
 time limit and nothing because this is 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.459
 all thanks for watching me and see you the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.459
 next video chao
