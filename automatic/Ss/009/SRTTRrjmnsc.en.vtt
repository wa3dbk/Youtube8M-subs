transformation of this figure it's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.520 
transformation of this figure it's
pretty<00:01:08.939> simple

in the original primal he had just the
face<00:02:50.260> guard<00:02:50.590> they've<00:02:51.130> now<00:02:51.340> included<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.060> lips

the cartoon I didn't really like the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.380 
the cartoon I didn't really like the
lips<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.290> being<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.310> Beast<00:03:00.580> Wars<00:03:00.760> had<00:03:01.150> it

lips but being that Beast Wars had it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.880 
lips but being that Beast Wars had it
it's<00:03:01.660> nice<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:01.930> they've<00:03:02.290> included<00:03:02.470> that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
it's nice that they've included that

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.650 
it's nice that they've included that
with<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.160> figure<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.060> way<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.300> gimmicks

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
with the figure in the way of gimmicks

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.600 
with the figure in the way of gimmicks
for<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:07.989> mode<00:03:08.260> there<00:03:08.709> are<00:03:08.769> there<00:03:09.580> are

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
for this mode there are there are

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.199 
for this mode there are there are
actually<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.150> couple<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:12.340> very<00:03:12.580> similar<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
actually a couple is very similar to the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.819 
actually a couple is very similar to the
original<00:03:13.330> primal<00:03:14.730> there's<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.910> mace<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:17.620> fit

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
original primal there's a mace just fit

yeah there we go it brings forward to

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.379 
yeah there we go it brings forward to
missile<00:04:31.830> launchers<00:04:34.940> there<00:04:35.940> are<00:04:36.120> additional

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
missile launchers there are additional

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.260 
missile launchers there are additional
missiles<00:04:36.930> at<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.169> top<00:04:37.610> exact<00:04:38.610> same<00:04:38.880> as<00:04:39.090> the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
missiles at the top exact same as the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:56.689 
missiles at the top exact same as the
the<00:04:39.300> original<00:04:39.960> prime<00:04:40.440> primal<00:04:55.250> now<00:04:56.250> like<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.580> had

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
the original prime primal now like I had

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.150 
the original prime primal now like I had
mentioned<00:04:56.820> I<00:04:57.240> as<00:04:57.750> much<00:04:58.380> as<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.650> wanted<00:04:59.039> the

Megatron I really wanted this guy I

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.430 
Megatron I really wanted this guy I
would<00:05:02.910> highly<00:05:03.240> recommend<00:05:03.660> getting<00:05:03.750> this<00:05:04.139> set

would highly recommend getting this set
if<00:05:04.889> nothing<00:05:05.669> more<00:05:05.880> than<00:05:06.090> just<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.419> get<00:05:06.539> the

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
if nothing more than just to get the

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.200 
if nothing more than just to get the
Optimus<00:05:07.110> Primal<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:08.430> is<00:05:08.610> very<00:05:08.820> nice<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.030> see

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
Optimus Primal it is very nice to see

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.590 
Optimus Primal it is very nice to see
the<00:05:09.449> new<00:05:09.539> paint<00:05:09.810> scheme<00:05:10.139> on<00:05:10.169> them<00:05:11.360> much<00:05:12.360> more

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
the new paint scheme on them much more

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.020 
the new paint scheme on them much more
so<00:05:12.870> accurate<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:14.870> if<00:05:15.870> you<00:05:16.110> already<00:05:16.260> have<00:05:16.410> it

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
so accurate and if you already have it

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
guy up or pick the Megatron to pack up

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.150 
guy up or pick the Megatron to pack up
obviously<00:05:26.300> just<00:05:27.380> good<00:05:28.380> good<00:05:28.650> addition<00:05:29.070> to
