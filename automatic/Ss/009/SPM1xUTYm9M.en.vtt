00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.740
 personal team opes was out of the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.279
 muove night in what did not see the name June 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.050
 exceeds in 371 today literally turn the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.619
 picasso phase that we have to paint 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.509
 very different things very funny not 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.660
 do the inter our paint the 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.809
 I'm going to show 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.610
 Let's start with saviola is here 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.890
 inside the game and it's just not basically 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.870
 Say we have there are other people 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.239
 to come back we have several tools 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.160
 we can use we'll take a break 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.140
 only when it's beautiful 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.399
 When we come in, let's see what this 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.879
 super curious moment to see if any 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:01.329
 Great thing, you just have to make it beautiful. 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.859
 lion shock was easy and just let's 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.860
 quickly try to do something 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:10.240
 interesting that it even looks like a shower 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.150
 Okay, hospital. Okay, let's paint. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.520
 blue as it is obvious the sky is blue 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.740
 It was great 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.049
 Now let's try to find out 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.530
 butterfly did not make a beautiful 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.020
 we want a little sky clamp 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.060
 only has basically all things 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.990
 we have here our hand 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.490
 therefore we do not have and my subjects 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.850
 try to do our best as it is obvious 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.939
 Okay, I'm going to paint this guide so the team 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.909
 It seems good, can I do this? 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.630
 so the country did not go as well as I did 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.039
 I was waiting 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.890
 ok great try to delete this from the onu 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.610
 bissau from ata to the lens but do not bill 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.180
 cassol 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.990
 We want to plan the edges. I did not deceive. 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.409
 recover first, as it is obvious that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.939
 Let's do something like this. 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.579
 I do not know if I can do the same 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.990
 this is the biggest problem of 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.260
 I do not know if I will be able to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.010
 do is my butterfly the same as 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.120
 two sides 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.820
 this is not good, okay you were told 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.980
 It's under construction if I leave but I think 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.470
 this curious one we intend 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.010
 to do okay ok 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.450
 so to say rock and you go 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.610
 staying the same probably will not 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.040
 But I think I'll try and 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.990
 a little to not be too 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.060
 they are not quite the same 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:42.820
 shall we say is if it looks pretty great 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.580
 only you guys find my December ox 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.560
 2015 I have no idea 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.420
 it's you who read this part of the city 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.300
 of the province store will be the first fight 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.360
 against other people and such 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.590
 this is what is whatever happens 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.730
 but he's always going down to the hospital. 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.660
 now it's no use trying to sit 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.290
 so blue paint and paint is like this 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.050
 from this short view different schemes 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.720
 now I want to stay like this now we think 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:19.350
 so let's try to catch it in a light blue 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:27.930
 and make sure a beautiful pattern is magnificent 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.930
 It looks okay so ok guys is better 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.989
 take this part we have maybe come back 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.280
 to paint esad blue and hide and 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.810
 The part was, my god, I can not. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.470
 hide part was but let's try 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.120
 hide part fahel what to say is chaotic 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.280
 magnificent but now try to do it there 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:04:00.130
 underneath also anything like that 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:02.620
 pink saying is one of the best athlete of 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:14.320
 always try to make a mini butterflies 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:16.959
 on the way back to and as he waits 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.000
 staff is likely not to but never 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.460
 Do you know how you 're going to do something? 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.090
 minute by minute and forget about that part 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.280
 Okay, ok, you're doing some 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.890
 butterflies and if apart is ours 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.720
 insistence on asking what I 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.070
 I think it's super piccinato with time and 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.500
 main but something 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.139
 ok let's support it ok it 's getting sub 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.610
 9 they quoted doing stupid things personal 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.320
 come on 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:55.080
 it means something like that I have a lot 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:58.289
 Time is not me too fast I am 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.449
 fast not ok is not like I have not 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.729
 more time I just did with my time 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.560
 I did it - I'm going to win now I'm going to 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.320
 dance we're going to have to get in 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.180
 especially will not win me for sure 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.070
 We're going to have four butterflies of 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.259
 other people and we have to take a 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.490
 best medal 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:21.690
 I think the dory is this I think change 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.449
 to be here is so simple and 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.430
 win I'm going to be sad, just shock 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.770
 This step is really interested. 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.440
 I 'm going to give this one and it's going to win like this. 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.720
 It seems to me almost a pokemon I'm doing. 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.180
 four auditorium drawings of each 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:45.210
 person and my father can already if they want 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:54.539
 see now ok ok ok ok just a graphics 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:06:02.880
 that the military believes in me than 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:05.610
 to win because that 's what they show is that 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.180
 we reached the semi- finals something like 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.460
 pheromones thank you this is so unfair 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.650
 in me no 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:19.500
 thank you thank you and vote for me this 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:22.889
 It is more free of everything I give but it was the 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.470
 speaking people is vital and four hours is 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.690
 I think between these two is that they are 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.940
 generating the finals is 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.960
 semifinal exactly zé eduardo will say 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:37.590
 what is going to be this is going to be this? 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.530
 against this and not only in gaining this 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.849
 You have to win, no doubt this one does not win. 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.229
 Guys, I do not know what's to 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:46.039
 to happen to mankind 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.039
 this will produce 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.840
 I think I was able to tell me not 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:58.230
 biological is that the gain was 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.260
 can and completion month and is only 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.180
 do not drip millet request a level that 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.310
 surpasses any super interesting that 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.440
 now I want to do more at the end 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.210
 of everything but that's the way to do it. 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.170
 that we want and how you are doing 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.060
 subtle picasso minecraft is very maceió 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.180
 fear that the staff of someone who 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.670
 samsung i gain is street rock 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.650
 Is she who won won? 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.750
 The yellow one that won nobody in me. 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.380
 in the comments and the super curious 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.720
 I think now she has gained from blur not 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.580
 only for the butterfly but for the rest but it is 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.600
 much to my two walk under April 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.550
 you have 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.350
 I do not think that although I 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.800
 our strength of a language is there 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:43.280
 the text is thank you, you moved in 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.280
 proof
