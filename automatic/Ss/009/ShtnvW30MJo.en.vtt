level were you worried about stepping

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.819 
level were you worried about stepping
down<00:00:57.799> to<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.219> pro<00:00:58.699> continental<00:00:59.350> no<00:01:00.350> not<00:01:00.620> at<00:01:00.710> all

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
down to a pro continental no not at all

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.399 
down to a pro continental no not at all
because<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.339> think<00:01:01.579> for<00:01:02.239> me<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:04.489> team<00:01:04.790> can

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
because I think for me this team can

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.990 
because I think for me this team can
offer<00:01:06.409> me<00:01:06.830> more<00:01:07.549> opportunities<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:08.570> mean<00:01:10.000> I've

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.880 
offer me more opportunities I mean I've
had<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.570> great<00:01:11.899> time<00:01:12.229> with<00:01:12.500> Omega

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
had a great time with Omega

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.249 
had a great time with Omega
pharma-quickstep<00:01:13.479> however<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:15.110> wasn't

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
pharma-quickstep however it wasn't

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.230 
pharma-quickstep however it wasn't
always<00:01:15.500> easy<00:01:15.649> to<00:01:15.920> get<00:01:16.640> into<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.939> biggest

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
always easy to get into the biggest

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.289 
always easy to get into the biggest
races<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:19.149> for<00:01:20.149> example<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:22.789> two<00:01:22.969> de<00:01:23.090> France

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
races and for example the two de France

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.660 
races and for example the two de France
is<00:01:23.509> still<00:01:23.750> raised<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.710> really<00:01:25.280> love<00:01:25.460> to

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
is still raised that I really love to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.279 
is still raised that I really love to
ride<00:01:26.240> one<00:01:26.450> day<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:30.369> yeah<00:01:31.369> I<00:01:31.430> think<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:31.820> were<00:01:32.000> in

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
ride one day and yeah I think we were in

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.630 
ride one day and yeah I think we were in
empty<00:01:33.289> and<00:01:33.350> Quebec<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:33.979> might<00:01:34.189> have<00:01:34.219> a<00:01:34.399> chance

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
empty and Quebec I might have a chance

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.480 
empty and Quebec I might have a chance
to<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:36.229> get<00:01:36.380> into<00:01:36.439> their<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.039> frosting

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
to to get into their to the frosting

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.359 
to to get into their to the frosting
what<00:01:38.270> do<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.450> think<00:01:38.539> of<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.929> new<00:01:38.960> signings<00:01:39.770> 32

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.560 

I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:46.370> they<00:01:47.370> will<00:01:47.580> rediscover<00:01:48.120> themselves

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
I think they will rediscover themselves

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.090 
I think they will rediscover themselves
in<00:01:49.050> some<00:01:49.260> way<00:01:49.410> and<00:01:50.330> maybe<00:01:53.510> yeah<00:01:54.510> I<00:01:55.020> guess<00:01:55.920> they

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
in some way and maybe yeah I guess they

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.310 
in some way and maybe yeah I guess they
dig<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.940> will<00:01:57.090> win<00:01:57.210> some<00:01:57.450> races<00:01:57.480> again<00:01:58.110> it's

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
dig they will win some races again it's

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.420 
dig they will win some races again it's
always<00:01:58.920> hard<00:01:59.130> to<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:01.200> say<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.590> vows<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.190> but
