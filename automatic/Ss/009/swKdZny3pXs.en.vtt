00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello welcome to a new chapter of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.750
 recommends books on this occasion diego 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.120
 will tell us about the cursed kings and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.530
 now I wanted to talk about that novel and to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.420
 many who know him probably have 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.400
 seen and that is really about 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.160
 seven volumes 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 I wanted to recommend I do not know if the work 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.609
 complete one we can not consider the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.080
 1 to 6 as a single work or are 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.289
 different books but I want 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.630
 recommend from 1 to 6 and not at 7 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.730
 already because 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.270
 it turns out that the story when this 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.260
 subject wrote it I do not remember the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 name we are the beach 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.800
 when he wrote the subject he wrote us 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.829
 Narrated is a story from the first 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.870
 book until the sixth and there he concluded it 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.329
 and there everything ends and when he did the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.809
 seventh he did change the style of 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.320
 narration in time that's the first 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.879
 second third person and how do I deal 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.979
 to go back a little bit in the end 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.640
 of what had been the cursed kings 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.640
 until 6 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.900
 actually, someone may like it or 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.460
 no but I believe that luck the work 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.790
 is up to the sixth book that is where 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.979
 it ends already already and well well if free it is 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.990
 like a little long the books simple and 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.330
 dresses are not so long and the work 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.360
 They are complete but not overwhelming 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.430
 for nothing is super easy to read you see 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.550
 long I am big but in reality they are 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.830
 the letters are also great as 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.350
 open the pillars of the earth 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.750
 and entertaining spend super fast is super 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.750
 here in the book and this also why 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.210
 as it is a historical novel takes a 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.369
 lots of processes that really happened 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.810
 and it is this person the author narrates and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.270
 the novels with a way but also 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.590
 this research reference 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 historical saying look was not 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.580
 well this happened like this 2a but also no more 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.679
 well this one actually had what 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.549
 stalked gold and sounds pretty realistic 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.610
 it seems yes and quite quite realistic and 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.040
 so you know it comes to the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.049
 end of the Carolingian dynasty if I do not 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.890
 I'm wrong, I'll finish you from felipe el 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.890
 beautiful and her children 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.400
 in france for a curse he threw 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.590
 the leader of the Templars when what 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.750
 burned there is the whole explanation 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.400
 of the book because it grabs with the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.010
 Templar can be scary and because 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.530
 they burned everything and from there it starts with that and 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.470
 serving the kings damn really 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:46.520
 there is a very bad title is believed in 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.620
 that and even though that's a respect that 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.680
 book and I would actually recommend 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.409
 for older people d 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.129
 18 20 years 18 if you like the 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.500
 history that people had but not 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.590
 I know if someone is asked 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.819
 too heavy the subject before may 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.049
 not because someone now that what 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.230
 I think not I would not recommend with a 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.780
 I design up just that I feel that 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.430
 normally what people call more adult 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.870
 or young adults are the ones who 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.030
 they begin to interest more in novel 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.189
 historical of all and before we are interested 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.730
 more for adventure these things clear but 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:24.919
 by reading by content I do 16 years 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.139
 up already that is the filter is here 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.299
 in the subject more than the ease of 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.220
 reading or the showy exactly the 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.049
 perfect subject good thank you diego 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.760
 thanks to all of us who are 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.980
 accompanying and we will be watching 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.980
 so I'm very good, I'm here
