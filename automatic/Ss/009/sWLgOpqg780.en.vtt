Chrysler Town and Country 's and they
described<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.530> fluid<00:00:33.860> drive<00:00:34.100> something<00:00:34.460> like

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
described the fluid drive something like

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.150 
described the fluid drive something like
three<00:00:35.570> different<00:00:35.899> ways<00:00:36.050> something<00:00:36.680> can<00:00:36.800> break

oh<00:01:21.770> my<00:01:22.040> god<00:01:22.189> is<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:22.399> seven<00:01:22.670> o'clock<00:01:22.820> already

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
oh my god is it seven o'clock already

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:35.539 
oh my god is it seven o'clock already
I'm<00:01:23.450> sorry<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:23.899> have<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.229> go

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.410 

this<00:01:36.549> is<00:01:37.259> bulletproof<00:01:38.259> because<00:01:38.829> there's<00:01:39.040> no

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this is bulletproof because there's no

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.580 
this is bulletproof because there's no
electromechanical<00:01:40.420> stuff<00:01:41.049> on<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.350> there's<00:01:41.470> no

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
electromechanical stuff on it there's no

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.359 
electromechanical stuff on it there's no
relays<00:01:42.040> there's<00:01:42.939> no<00:01:43.119> solenoids<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.740> this

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
relays there's no solenoids so this

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.539 
relays there's no solenoids so this
enables<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.149> do<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:47.649> come<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.159> complete

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
enables you to do is come to a complete

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.370 
enables you to do is come to a complete
halt<00:01:48.789> and<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:50.200> have<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.500> put<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.770> into<00:01:50.860> neutral

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
halt and not have to put it into neutral

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.120 
halt and not have to put it into neutral
okay<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.759> system<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.479> Chrysler<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:57.070> a

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
okay the system in the Chrysler was a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.690 
okay the system in the Chrysler was a
dual<00:01:57.490> range<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:58.210> speed<00:01:58.539> okay<00:01:59.259> which<00:01:59.740> up<00:02:00.009> was

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
dual range to speed okay which up was

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.350 
dual range to speed okay which up was
high<00:02:01.600> range<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:02.110> guess<00:02:02.350> or<00:02:02.590> down<00:02:03.039> was<00:02:03.369> low<00:02:04.060> range

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
high range I guess or down was low range

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.520 
high range I guess or down was low range
or<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.720> might<00:02:04.899> even<00:02:04.929> have<00:02:05.200> been<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.409> other

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
or you might even have been the other

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.440 
or you might even have been the other
way<00:02:05.740> around<00:02:06.070> which<00:02:06.310> was<00:02:06.460> totally<00:02:06.880> confusing

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
way around which was totally confusing

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.449 
way around which was totally confusing
that's<00:02:08.019> a<00:02:08.140> completely<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:08.979> does<00:02:09.250> have<00:02:09.429> a

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
that's a completely so this does have a

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.360 
that's a completely so this does have a
clutch<00:02:09.759> yeah<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.810> what<00:02:11.680> would<00:02:11.830> happen<00:02:12.069> there

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
clutch yeah and what would happen there

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.039 
clutch yeah and what would happen there
was<00:02:12.489> all<00:02:12.640> kinds<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:12.970> relays<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.510> solenoids

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
was all kinds of relays and solenoids

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.170 
was all kinds of relays and solenoids
that<00:02:14.290> would<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:15.400> would<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.549> be<00:02:15.700> an<00:02:15.760> automatic

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
that would it would it be an automatic

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.030 
that would it would it be an automatic
up<00:02:16.510> shift<00:02:16.840> you'd<00:02:17.230> start<00:02:17.500> out<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.799> when<00:02:17.920> you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
up shift you'd start out and when you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.270 
up shift you'd start out and when you
lifted<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.819> would<00:02:19.420> sense<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.500> would<00:02:20.680> shut

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
lifted it would sense it it would shut

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.780 
lifted it would sense it it would shut
off<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.640> ignition<00:02:22.860> momentarily<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.640> could

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
off the ignition momentarily so it could

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.210 
off the ignition momentarily so it could
make<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.180> shift<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:26.019> was<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:26.830> paddle

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
make the shift it was like paddle

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:37.289 
make the shift it was like paddle
shifting<00:02:27.750> without<00:02:28.750> all<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:29.230> good<00:02:29.410> stuff<00:02:36.299> in

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
shifting without all the good stuff in

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.940 
shifting without all the good stuff in
the<00:02:37.420> real<00:02:37.599> world<00:02:37.870> especially<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.560> small

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the real world especially in small

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.460 
the real world especially in small
country<00:02:39.370> or<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.850> wet<00:02:40.720> ball<00:02:40.959> they<00:02:41.170> let<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.440> know

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
country or in wet ball they let you know

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.580 
country or in wet ball they let you know
stop<00:02:41.920> horse<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:43.660> engine<00:02:44.019> does<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.320> have

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
stop horse so what engine does this have

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.330 
stop horse so what engine does this have
this<00:02:44.859> has<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> rip-snorting<00:02:46.709> 230<00:02:47.709> cubic<00:02:48.190> inch

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
this has a rip-snorting 230 cubic inch

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.830 
this has a rip-snorting 230 cubic inch
flat<00:02:48.640> head<00:02:49.380> all<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:51.010> hundred<00:02:51.609> so<00:02:52.600> that's

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
flat head all of a hundred so that's

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.970 
flat head all of a hundred so that's
really<00:02:53.019> that's<00:02:53.230> all<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.530> need

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
really that's all you need

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.180 
really that's all you need
