00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.660
 terrine of all is hands with 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.939
 Vegetables full of vegetables were better 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.320
 in order an aura of vegetables they 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.699
 can longer and longer 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.019
 then we will put the vegetables they 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.419
 cook 8 so that cooking 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.730
 be homogeneous even the recipe its part 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.380
 I start with children's oil 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.020
 a tajine so as to bring back the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.970

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.930
 bringing her caramelise a tiny 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.030
 little dry the successes because amelie of the juices 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.680
 it gives more flavor then there you 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.940
 looking to caramelize past what their 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.750
 lack that's what will give taste to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.550
 are agile 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.200
 we had done quite brisk we are doing well 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.250
 colored in poultry for now 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.590
 we are not racing pigeons 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.390
 I would never put a scoop on these 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.910
 coloring chords 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.830
 we will be able to start faye and all 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.580
 tastes then we will start with the 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.730
 carrots were simple there we are at the 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.730
 House 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.399
 then at home except it with 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.990
 hf at home cube and and vegetables 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.579
 you start with the carrots to leave 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.490
 at the bottom of the tajine dish and it starts 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:19.840
 to simmer had we will be simple if I 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.490
 do not make jaws irregular and because 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:29.759
 that it's true mattis chef 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.649
 do something all the spice the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.470
 Moroccan and oriental touch 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.899
 I'm pointing briefly there are mills 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.180
 watch out there I'm just going to do that and 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.140
 there prefer handed two sides he should 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.149
 said soup spoon 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.130
 you put it in now had to 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.770
 do you go do you see the equivalent 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.549
 a tablespoon of pine nuts there and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.679
 there what will be done 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.450
 so how does the missive by handing over to 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.759
 continue value and before notary of 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.140
 jo winter is that it's tanks 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.080
 close it's a yes it's fine 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.119
 that's what it takes, it seems to me 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.220
 during our trek well why 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.869
 these hearty functions the manager has put 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.299
 the vegetables they cook more 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.880
 a long time first and now that you 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.509
 will stay the only one so you have it light 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.510
 lightweight 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.640
 that's because having cumin is the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.769
 moment of putting it there by m I'm going 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.970
 put the ends this cut in half then 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.220
 the second is indigestible in all 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.440
 world knows it see I cut it again 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.450
 a little in sight the ouch 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.010
 ok I'm not laurels but 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.359
 this is we usually he had 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.609
 too sadly always worry about exacerbating 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:35.459
 vegetable and animal proteins 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.109
 I will cover 100 m broth lala 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.040
 gerard about ten minutes I said 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.570
 two minutes on low heat 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.709
 it's going well with me, it'll be okay 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.299
 worth its weekends and during this 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.160
 time you go game but how can I 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.560
 carve the prophet who will be the last 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.600
 element before the end of cooking 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.280
 I had the cup is bigger than d 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.959
 other vegetables okay that's for the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.790
 keep a little bit too much when does that 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.290
 the agreement is good it's good when 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.329
 we chew a little end of cooking 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.930

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.790

 medium heat for how long such 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.569
 I think it's 10 minutes 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.110
