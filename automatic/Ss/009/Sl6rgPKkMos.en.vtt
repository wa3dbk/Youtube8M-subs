00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
I just took my Urban Decay all nighter

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.730 
I just took my Urban Decay all nighter
spray<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.840> sprayed<00:00:55.080> it<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.380> brush<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
spray and I sprayed it on to a brush and

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.980 
spray and I sprayed it on to a brush and
dipped<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.280> into<00:00:56.400> the<00:00:56.580> silver<00:00:57.000> eyeshadow<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
dipped it into the silver eyeshadow and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.200 
dipped it into the silver eyeshadow and
put<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.590> line<00:00:58.950> on<00:00:58.980> my<00:00:59.250> eyes<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.820> since<00:01:00.090> i

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
put like a line on my eyes and since i

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
put like a line on my eyes and since i
used<00:01:00.240> the<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.320> nighter<00:01:01.530> spray<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:02.130> made<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
used the all nighter spray it made it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
used the all nighter spray it made it
like<00:01:02.640> creamier<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.510> guess<00:01:03.810> so<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.290> easier

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
like creamier i guess so it was easier

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
like creamier i guess so it was easier
to<00:01:04.830> make<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> line<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> basically<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.689> i

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
to make the line and basically what i

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
to make the line and basically what i
did<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.200> i<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.409> kept<00:01:07.799> taking<00:01:08.009> like<00:01:08.340> darker

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
did was i just kept taking like darker

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.050 
did was i just kept taking like darker
and<00:01:09.030> darker<00:01:09.619> blues<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.310> try<00:01:11.579> to<00:01:11.610> make<00:01:11.880> an

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and darker blues and I try to make an

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.640 
and darker blues and I try to make an
ombre<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.200> guess<00:01:13.440> you<00:01:13.620> could<00:01:13.680> say<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> after<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
ombre I guess you could say so after the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
ombre I guess you could say so after the
silver<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.580> used<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.210> silvery<00:01:18.720> blue

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
silver I just used like a silvery blue

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
silver I just used like a silvery blue
and<00:01:19.620> after<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.460> use<00:01:20.880> kind<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and after that I just use kind of like a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.310 
and after that I just use kind of like a
teal<00:01:21.870> ish<00:01:22.140> color<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.970> I<00:01:23.970> think<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.870> you<00:01:25.080> get

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
teal ish color and I think that you get

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.550 
teal ish color and I think that you get
the<00:01:25.530> point<00:01:26.060> at<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> end<00:01:27.300> just<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> add<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the point at the end just to add a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.670 
the point at the end just to add a
little<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> pizzazz<00:01:30.290> after<00:01:31.290> putting<00:01:31.470> like

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
little bit of pizzazz after putting like

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
little bit of pizzazz after putting like
the<00:01:31.800> darkest<00:01:32.190> blue<00:01:32.370> I<00:01:32.580> added<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> bit<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.120> purple

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the darkest blue I added a bit of purple

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.930 
the darkest blue I added a bit of purple
as<00:01:33.690> well<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.260> don't<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.159> why<00:01:35.430> i<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.880> many

it to cover the eyeshadow because that
kind<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.070> defeats<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> purpose<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.810> yeah

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
kind of like defeats the purpose so yeah
