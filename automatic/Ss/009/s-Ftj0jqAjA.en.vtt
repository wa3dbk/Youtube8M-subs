when you make sudden movements it's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.310 
when you make sudden movements it's
possible<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> sensor<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.869> lose<00:01:43.110> track

possible that the sensor can lose track

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.280 
possible that the sensor can lose track

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
of its position and it loses accuracy so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.580 
of its position and it loses accuracy so

the missing information this makes for a

another<00:02:09.569> big<00:02:09.810> feature<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.440> mouse<00:02:10.709> is

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
another big feature of this mouse is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.530 
another big feature of this mouse is
Delta<00:02:11.640> 0

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
Delta 0

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.080 
Delta 0
gee<00:02:12.689> this<00:02:13.500> basically<00:02:14.040> means<00:02:14.280> no<00:02:14.459> cursor

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
gee this basically means no cursor

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.179 
gee this basically means no cursor
acceleration<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.439> what<00:02:16.650> happens<00:02:17.010> with<00:02:17.159> a

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
acceleration so what happens with a

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.699
