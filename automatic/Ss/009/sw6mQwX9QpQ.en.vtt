hey<00:00:01.920> it's<00:00:02.190> Bruce<00:00:02.429> with<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.909> weeders<00:00:03.179> digest

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hey it's Bruce with the weeders digest

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.869 
hey it's Bruce with the weeders digest
and<00:00:03.959> today<00:00:04.290> we're<00:00:04.740> looking<00:00:04.950> at<00:00:05.220> de-icing

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
and today we're looking at de-icing

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.570 
and today we're looking at de-icing
equipment<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.990> if<00:00:07.470> you've<00:00:07.620> got<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.010> doc<00:00:08.280> like

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
equipment and if you've got a doc like

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.330 
equipment and if you've got a doc like
I've<00:00:08.790> got<00:00:09.030> here<00:00:09.590> it<00:00:10.590> certainly<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.160> not<00:00:11.280> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I've got here it certainly is not a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.039 
I've got here it certainly is not a
doctor<00:00:11.730> would<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:11.969> able<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> stand<00:00:12.450> up<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> ice

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
doctor would be able to stand up to ice

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.499 
doctor would be able to stand up to ice
movement<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.769> ice<00:00:13.950> pressure<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
movement and ice pressure and so the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.300 
movement and ice pressure and so the
great<00:00:15.870> opportunity<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.859> able<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.070> just

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
great opportunity is to be able to just

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.980 
great opportunity is to be able to just
take<00:00:17.550> something<00:00:17.880> like<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.270> which<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> half

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
take something like this which is a half

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.609 
take something like this which is a half
horsepower<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:20.189> has<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> prop<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.779> it's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
horsepower it has a prop and so it's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.700 
horsepower it has a prop and so it's
able<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.430> move<00:00:23.730> water<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.810> clear<00:00:25.470> an<00:00:25.619> area

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
able to move water and clear an area

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.450 
able to move water and clear an area
around<00:00:26.519> oh<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> 50<00:00:27.630> feet<00:00:27.930> across<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
around oh up to 50 feet across and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.220 
around oh up to 50 feet across and
that's<00:00:29.550> very<00:00:30.060> dependent<00:00:30.570> upon<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.080> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
that's very dependent upon a lot of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860 
that's very dependent upon a lot of
different<00:00:31.880> factors<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.480> might<00:00:33.719> imagine

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
different factors as you might imagine

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.290 
different factors as you might imagine
it<00:00:34.350> depends<00:00:34.680> upon<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.040> flow<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.850> depends<00:00:36.180> upon

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
it depends upon the flow it depends upon

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.940 
it depends upon the flow it depends upon
the<00:00:36.600> rate<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> water<00:00:38.940> temperature

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
the rate of the water temperature

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.959 
the rate of the water temperature
surface<00:00:40.950> temperature<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.610> those<00:00:41.760> type<00:00:41.940> of

surface temperature all those type of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
surface temperature all those type of
things<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.390> ultimately<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.739> give<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
things and ultimately we can give you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.069 
things and ultimately we can give you
the<00:00:44.129> advice<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.640> need<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the advice you need but it's the the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.470 
the advice you need but it's the the
depth<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> surrounding<00:00:47.039> water

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
depth of the surrounding water

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.819 
depth of the surrounding water
obstructions<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> water<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
obstructions in the water and the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
obstructions in the water and the
geographic<00:00:50.489> location<00:00:51.059> those<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
geographic location those are all the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.630 
geographic location those are all the
things<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.649> need<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> discuss<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.489> it's

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
things that we need to discuss now it's

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.240 
things that we need to discuss now it's
very<00:00:53.940> easy<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.390> put<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.620> install<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
very easy to put on to install one of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.599 
very easy to put on to install one of
these<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> case<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.440> simply<00:00:58.739> putting

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
these in in this case I'm simply putting

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.260 
these in in this case I'm simply putting
a<00:00:59.879> rope<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.809> each<00:01:01.199> end<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.850> area<00:01:03.149> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
a rope on each end of the the area that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.030 
a rope on each end of the the area that
I<00:01:03.300> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> keep<00:01:03.750> open<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> dock<00:01:04.530> post<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
I want to keep open on the dock post and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.399 
I want to keep open on the dock post and
then<00:01:05.640> simply<00:01:06.299> dropping<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> into<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> water

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
then simply dropping it into the water

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.760 
then simply dropping it into the water
and<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and you can see that that this is just a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.620 
and you can see that that this is just a
half<00:01:10.950> horsepower<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.580> sell<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:11.880> half<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
half horsepower we sell them half up to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.960 
half horsepower we sell them half up to
you<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.920> horsepower<00:01:14.280> two<00:01:14.700> horsepower

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you know one horsepower two horsepower

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.490 
you know one horsepower two horsepower
we<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> lot<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.689> options<00:01:15.960> when<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.380> comes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
we have a lot of options when it comes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
we have a lot of options when it comes
to<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:16.860> de-icers<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.119> number<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to our de-icers and the number of

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.600 
to our de-icers and the number of
different<00:01:18.750> brands<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.920> where

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
different brands but this is not where

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.039 
different brands but this is not where
you<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:20.909> ever<00:01:21.090> want<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
you would ever want to have that kind of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.590 
you would ever want to have that kind of
flow<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.950> reason<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.090> although

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
flow and the reason is is that although

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.929 
flow and the reason is is that although
that<00:01:24.930> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.409> flow<00:01:26.280> activity<00:01:26.790> would

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that kind of flow activity would

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.359 
that kind of flow activity would
certainly<00:01:27.240> keep<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.320> water<00:01:28.590> open<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
certainly keep the water open in that

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
certainly keep the water open in that
area<00:01:29.700> ultimately<00:01:30.299> wanted<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.170> as

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
area ultimately wanted to do is be as

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.800 
area ultimately wanted to do is be as
low<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> water<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
low in the water as you can so that you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.380 
low in the water as you can so that you
can<00:01:34.200> close<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> bottom<00:01:35.520> where<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.150> earth

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
can close to the bottom where the earth

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
can close to the bottom where the earth
is<00:01:36.720> warming<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.560> water<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
is warming up that water down there and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.230 
is warming up that water down there and
you're<00:01:39.150> driving<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.960> water<00:01:40.430> upward<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:42.060> be

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you're driving that water upward to be

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050 
you're driving that water upward to be
able<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:43.829> keep<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.460> eat<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> ice

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
able to you know keep and eat the ice

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
able to you know keep and eat the ice
and<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.390> will<00:01:45.810> it'll<00:01:46.020> literally<00:01:46.439> eat<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> ice

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and it will it'll literally eat the ice

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.490 
and it will it'll literally eat the ice
and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.030> other<00:01:48.630> options<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.409> it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and you get the other options to have it

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.039 
and you get the other options to have it
a<00:01:49.590> horizontal<00:01:50.189> flow<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:51.600> we'll<00:01:51.750> look<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.020> some

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
a horizontal flow and we'll look at some

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.410 
a horizontal flow and we'll look at some
options<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.490> another<00:01:53.759> great<00:01:54.149> option

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
options there now another great option

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.410 
options there now another great option
is<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.960> able<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.470> literally<00:01:55.799> take<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
is to be able to just literally take it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.639 
is to be able to just literally take it
put<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.509> down<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.780> bottom<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.469> see

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
put it down on the bottom like you see

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.810 
put it down on the bottom like you see
right<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.009> would<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.610> typical

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
right here this would be more typical

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940 
right here this would be more typical
what<00:02:00.240> you'd<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.930> surface<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.680> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
what you'd see on the surface not that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.550 
what you'd see on the surface not that
big<00:02:02.280> flow<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.570> comes<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:04.049> bringing<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
big flow and so it comes up bringing the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.219 
big flow and so it comes up bringing the
warm<00:02:04.860> air<00:02:05.100> upwards<00:02:05.810> there<00:02:06.810> are<00:02:06.930> three

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
warm air upwards there are three

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.499 
warm air upwards there are three
different<00:02:07.560> methods<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.640> carry<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
different methods that we carry and that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.960 
different methods that we carry and that
we<00:02:09.989> recommend<00:02:10.470> most<00:02:10.770> often<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.610> sling

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
we recommend most often is the sling

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.460 
we recommend most often is the sling
method<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.540> what<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> call

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
method is what I call

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.020 
method is what I call
and<00:02:13.560> that's<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.160> saw<00:02:14.400> me<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and that's what you saw me do on the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.480 
and that's what you saw me do on the
dock<00:02:15.240> there<00:02:15.510> where<00:02:16.080> you've<00:02:16.200> got<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:17.160> far

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
dock there where you've got this far

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.840 
dock there where you've got this far
left<00:02:17.760> picture<00:02:18.150> where<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.450> get<00:02:18.780> two<00:02:19.080> ropes<00:02:19.850> you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
left picture where you get two ropes you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.060 
left picture where you get two ropes you
know<00:02:20.880> being<00:02:21.180> supported<00:02:21.720> across<00:02:21.960> from<00:02:22.530> two

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
know being supported across from two

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.190 
know being supported across from two
piers<00:02:23.430> or<00:02:23.700> two<00:02:23.880> docks<00:02:24.120> or<00:02:24.420> slip<00:02:24.840> or<00:02:24.990> whatever

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
piers or two docks or slip or whatever

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.500 
piers or two docks or slip or whatever
the<00:02:25.320> case<00:02:25.470> might<00:02:25.710> be<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.060> second

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the case might be and then the second

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.420 
the case might be and then the second
option<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.260> able<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.590> do<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> dock<00:02:29.160> mount

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
option is to be able to do a dock mount

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.950 
option is to be able to do a dock mount
now<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.640> dock<00:02:29.880> mount<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.240> be<00:02:30.270> going<00:02:30.690> down

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
now the dock mount can be going down

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.050 
now the dock mount can be going down
much<00:02:31.290> lower<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.100> pointed<00:02:32.460> upwards<00:02:32.790> in

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
much lower and then pointed upwards in

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.330 
much lower and then pointed upwards in
this<00:02:33.540> case<00:02:33.750> I'm<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.500> showing<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.040> flow

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
this case I'm just showing it to flow

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.870 
this case I'm just showing it to flow
across<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.120> then<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.500> third<00:02:37.770> option<00:02:38.010> would

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
across and then the third option would

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.420 
across and then the third option would
be<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> float<00:02:39.510> method<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.200> with<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.220> float

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
be a float method and with the float

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.790 
be a float method and with the float
method<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.030> don't<00:02:42.300> aren't<00:02:42.780> down<00:02:43.170> deep<00:02:43.500> enough

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
method you don't aren't down deep enough

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.280 
method you don't aren't down deep enough
to<00:02:44.040> bring<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.430> warm<00:02:44.760> water<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.930> certainly

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
to bring up warm water but you certainly

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.890 
to bring up warm water but you certainly
can<00:02:46.620> create<00:02:46.980> water<00:02:47.430> flow<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.510> would<00:02:48.750> be

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
can create water flow so this would be

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.680 
can create water flow so this would be
just<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.950> know<00:02:49.980> really<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.700> my<00:02:50.970> opinion<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
just you know really in my opinion the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.170 
just you know really in my opinion the
third<00:02:51.990> best<00:02:52.380> option<00:02:52.950> would<00:02:53.490> be<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.820> set<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.120> up

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
third best option would be to set it up

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.240 
third best option would be to set it up
on<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.390> float<00:02:54.660> now<00:02:55.440> another<00:02:55.650> thing<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:56.070> people

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
on a float now another thing that people

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.070 
on a float now another thing that people
do<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.760> they<00:02:56.910> will<00:02:57.060> actually<00:02:57.210> mount<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.840> down

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
do is they will actually mount this down

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.230 
do is they will actually mount this down
at<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> bottom<00:02:59.040> where<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.790> Lake<00:03:00.090> is

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
at the bottom where it's that Lake is

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.090 
at the bottom where it's that Lake is
not<00:03:00.420> going<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.660> freeze<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.500> they'll<00:03:01.680> simply

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
not going to freeze and they'll simply

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.390 
not going to freeze and they'll simply
turn<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.730> only<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.440> spring<00:03:04.710> at<00:03:05.130> when

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
turn it on only in the spring at when

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.790 
turn it on only in the spring at when
the<00:03:05.520> ice<00:03:05.670> might<00:03:06.030> start<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.540> move<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.050> they<00:03:07.410> let

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
the ice might start to move and they let

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.440 
the ice might start to move and they let
it<00:03:07.920> freeze<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.700> wintertime<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.120> then

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
it freeze in in the wintertime and then

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.960 
it freeze in in the wintertime and then
just<00:03:09.690> turn<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.020> on<00:03:10.110> just<00:03:10.710> only<00:03:11.130> at<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.610> point

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
just turn it on just only at that point

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.150 
just turn it on just only at that point
that's<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.900> great<00:03:13.110> option<00:03:13.500> because<00:03:13.710> you<00:03:13.920> don't

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
that's a great option because you don't

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.310 
that's a great option because you don't
have<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.400> run<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.700> power<00:03:14.910> throughout<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.900> the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
have to run the power throughout the the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.770 
have to run the power throughout the the
coldest<00:03:16.710> months<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.220> winter<00:03:17.520> now<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.690> of

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
coldest months of the winter now one of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360 
coldest months of the winter now one of
the<00:03:18.870> other<00:03:18.989> options<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.920> case<00:03:20.130> like<00:03:20.310> this

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the other options is in a case like this

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.310 
the other options is in a case like this
you<00:03:21.060> don't<00:03:21.270> want<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.630> have<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.870> use<00:03:22.020> power

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
you don't want to have to use power

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.979 
you don't want to have to use power
throughout<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:23.010> whole<00:03:23.310> season<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.570> we<00:03:24.720> carry

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
throughout this whole season so we carry

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.810 
throughout this whole season so we carry
a<00:03:25.080> thermostat<00:03:25.800> that<00:03:25.830> will<00:03:26.160> actually<00:03:26.340> turn<00:03:26.670> it

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
a thermostat that will actually turn it

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.479 
a thermostat that will actually turn it
on<00:03:26.940> at<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.300> certain<00:03:27.600> point<00:03:28.020> of<00:03:28.290> temperature<00:03:29.280> so

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
on at a certain point of temperature so

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.580 
on at a certain point of temperature so
you<00:03:29.520> might<00:03:29.730> set<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.030> at<00:03:30.270> 28<00:03:30.810> degrees<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.410> every

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
you might set it at 28 degrees so every

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
you might set it at 28 degrees so every
time<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.800> reaches<00:03:32.220> 28<00:03:32.580> degrees<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.209> will<00:03:33.510> turn

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
time it reaches 28 degrees it will turn

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.290 
time it reaches 28 degrees it will turn
on<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.290> very<00:03:34.730> inexpensive<00:03:35.730> way<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.940> do<00:03:36.150> it

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
on it's a very inexpensive way to do it

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.610 
on it's a very inexpensive way to do it
and<00:03:36.660> these<00:03:36.930> are<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.200> showing<00:03:37.500> the
