00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
within like 30 seconds into the heat so

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.850 
within like 30 seconds into the heat so
that<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:38.480> got<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.200> ball<00:02:39.319> rolling<00:02:39.379> and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.280 
then from there I got a seven and then
another<00:02:42.319> seven<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.329> by<00:02:44.329> then<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.540> issue<00:02:45.170> is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.289 
another seven and by then the issue is
pretty<00:02:45.530> much<00:02:45.650> over<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.280> i<00:02:46.549> don't<00:02:47.060> know<00:02:47.150> i<00:02:47.180> just
