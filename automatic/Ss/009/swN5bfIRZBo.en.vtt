00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.459 

my<00:00:01.999> dad<00:00:02.179> brought<00:00:02.389> over<00:00:02.570> a<00:00:02.720> toy<00:00:02.929> that<00:00:03.169> he<00:00:03.379> had

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:03.469 
my dad brought over a toy that he had

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.950 
my dad brought over a toy that he had
had<00:00:03.620> when<00:00:03.860> he<00:00:04.189> was<00:00:04.310> a<00:00:04.340> kid<00:00:04.609> and<00:00:04.880> I<00:00:05.300> remember<00:00:05.359> him

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
had when he was a kid and I remember him

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.990 
had when he was a kid and I remember him
showing<00:00:05.990> it<00:00:06.319> to<00:00:06.439> me<00:00:06.470> when<00:00:06.740> I<00:00:06.830> was<00:00:06.979> again<00:00:07.309> and

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
showing it to me when I was again and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.909 
showing it to me when I was again and
then<00:00:08.090> he<00:00:08.210> brought<00:00:08.360> it<00:00:08.510> over<00:00:08.599> to<00:00:08.750> show<00:00:09.049> my<00:00:09.559> kids

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:09.919 
then he brought it over to show my kids

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.159 
then he brought it over to show my kids
and<00:00:10.370> it's<00:00:10.610> usually<00:00:10.730> a<00:00:10.940> button<00:00:11.419> with<00:00:11.660> a<00:00:11.690> string

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:12.169 
and it's usually a button with a string

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:13.779 
and it's usually a button with a string
running<00:00:12.349> through<00:00:12.740> it<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.039> you<00:00:13.099> twirl<00:00:13.669> it

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
running through it and you twirl it

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.879 
running through it and you twirl it
around<00:00:13.910> and<00:00:14.419> then<00:00:14.509> you<00:00:14.539> can<00:00:14.629> put<00:00:15.440> tension<00:00:15.799> on

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
around and then you can put tension on

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.070 
around and then you can put tension on
the<00:00:16.010> string<00:00:16.309> and<00:00:16.460> kind<00:00:16.640> of<00:00:16.670> get<00:00:16.790> the<00:00:16.970> button<00:00:17.810> to

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
the string and kind of get the button to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.010 
the string and kind of get the button to
spin<00:00:18.530> in<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.190> middle<00:00:19.490> so<00:00:20.420> I<00:00:20.450> looked<00:00:20.660> up<00:00:20.810> online

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
spin in the middle so I looked up online

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.530 
spin in the middle so I looked up online
what<00:00:21.470> these<00:00:21.650> were<00:00:21.920> in<00:00:22.220> it<00:00:22.370> one<00:00:23.180> of<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.360> places

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
what these were in it one of the places

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.140 
what these were in it one of the places
I<00:00:23.720> found<00:00:24.020> called<00:00:24.350> it<00:00:24.470> a<00:00:24.590> sawmill<00:00:25.160> toy<00:00:25.490> which<00:00:25.970> I

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
I found called it a sawmill toy which I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.480 
I found called it a sawmill toy which I
really<00:00:26.360> like<00:00:26.510> that<00:00:26.690> idea<00:00:27.080> as<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:27.380> it<00:00:27.980> kind<00:00:28.460> of

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
really like that idea as it it kind of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.670 
really like that idea as it it kind of
went<00:00:28.640> back<00:00:28.730> to<00:00:28.850> woodworking<00:00:29.410> but<00:00:30.410> it<00:00:30.500> looks

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
went back to woodworking but it looks

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.709 
went back to woodworking but it looks
like<00:00:30.860> it's<00:00:31.160> been<00:00:31.520> in<00:00:31.730> many<00:00:32.360> different

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
like it's been in many different

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.340 
like it's been in many different
cultures<00:00:33.109> over<00:00:33.769> time<00:00:34.039> and<00:00:34.780> it's<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:36.019> really

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
cultures over time and it's a really

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.989 
cultures over time and it's a really
simple<00:00:36.559> toy<00:00:37.039> and<00:00:37.370> I<00:00:37.429> thought<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:37.760> would<00:00:37.879> be

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:37.999 
simple toy and I thought it would be

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.419 
simple toy and I thought it would be
nice<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.570> make<00:00:39.440> something<00:00:39.679> like<00:00:39.920> this<00:00:40.129> on<00:00:40.309> the

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:40.429 
nice to make something like this on the

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.040 
nice to make something like this on the
lathe<00:00:40.640> it<00:00:41.510> seemed<00:00:41.780> like<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.019> perfect

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
lathe it seemed like the perfect

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.919 
lathe it seemed like the perfect
woodturning<00:00:42.769> project<00:00:43.059> so<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.089> made<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.420> really

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
woodturning project so I made a really

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.520 
woodturning project so I made a really
quick<00:00:45.199> circle<00:00:45.710> on<00:00:45.859> the<00:00:45.980> lathe<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:47.319> see<00:00:48.319> if<00:00:48.440> I

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
quick circle on the lathe to see if I

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.569 
quick circle on the lathe to see if I
could<00:00:48.649> make<00:00:48.679> something<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.249> little<00:00:49.460> better

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
could make something a little better

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.419 
could make something a little better
than<00:00:49.909> what<00:00:50.510> my<00:00:50.659> dad<00:00:50.839> had<00:00:51.019> brought<00:00:51.199> over<00:00:51.370> so<00:00:52.370> I

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
than what my dad had brought over so I

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.520 
than what my dad had brought over so I
made<00:00:52.640> a<00:00:52.670> circle<00:00:53.179> and<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.449> drilled<00:00:53.839> two<00:00:54.019> holes<00:00:54.050> in

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
made a circle and I drilled two holes in

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.290 
made a circle and I drilled two holes in
it<00:00:54.679> that<00:00:54.859> were<00:00:55.460> roughly<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.059> same<00:00:56.239> distance

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
it that were roughly the same distance

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.639 
it that were roughly the same distance
from<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:56.899> center<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:02.359> Calvin<00:01:03.260> came<00:01:03.409> out<00:01:03.499> to

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
from the center and Calvin came out to

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.940 
from the center and Calvin came out to
the<00:01:03.739> shop<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.159> we<00:01:04.250> tried<00:01:04.519> it<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:05.770> it<00:01:06.770> actually

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
the shop and we tried it and it actually

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.609 
the shop and we tried it and it actually
worked<00:01:07.250> really<00:01:07.340> well<00:01:07.810> but<00:01:08.810> one<00:01:09.200> of<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.380> things

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
worked really well but one of the things

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.520 
worked really well but one of the things
I<00:01:09.950> found<00:01:10.520> when<00:01:11.240> researching<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:11.960> was<00:01:12.290> that

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
I found when researching this was that

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.580 
I found when researching this was that
they<00:01:12.860> tend<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.579> make<00:01:13.729> noise<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:15.409> would<00:01:15.500> be

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
they tend to make noise and it would be

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.109 
they tend to make noise and it would be
nice<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.770> make<00:01:16.039> one<00:01:16.189> that<00:01:16.310> made<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> sound<00:01:16.880> when

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
nice to make one that made a sound when

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.100 
nice to make one that made a sound when
it<00:01:17.270> spun<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.680> we<00:01:18.770> tried<00:01:18.979> drilling<00:01:19.159> holes<00:01:19.549> in<00:01:19.789> it

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
it spun so we tried drilling holes in it

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.080 
it spun so we tried drilling holes in it
so<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:21.530> for<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.740> first<00:01:22.009> try<00:01:22.310> we<00:01:22.520> we<00:01:22.729> drilled<00:01:23.000> a

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
so so for the first try we we drilled a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.289 
so so for the first try we we drilled a
hole<00:01:23.119> on<00:01:23.899> each<00:01:24.140> side<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:25.939> helped<00:01:26.210> a

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
hole on each side and that helped a

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.940 
hole on each side and that helped a
little<00:01:26.420> bit<00:01:26.659> with<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.960> sound<00:01:27.229> but<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.469> still

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
little bit with the sound but it still

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.370 
little bit with the sound but it still
didn't<00:01:28.189> really<00:01:28.340> make<00:01:28.460> any<00:01:28.700> sound<00:01:29.259> then<00:01:30.259> I

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
didn't really make any sound then I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.170 
didn't really make any sound then I
thought<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:30.920> should<00:01:31.250> drill<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.549> hole<00:01:31.820> at<00:01:32.030> an

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
thought we should drill a hole at an

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.870 
thought we should drill a hole at an
angle<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.770> circumference<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> circle

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
angle to the circumference of the circle

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.359 
angle to the circumference of the circle
and<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:36.560> actually<00:01:36.859> worked<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.039> little<00:01:37.159> better

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
and that actually worked a little better

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.609 
and that actually worked a little better
for<00:01:37.729> making<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:38.090> sound<00:01:38.390> then<00:01:39.170> I<00:01:39.289> thought<00:01:39.469> I

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
for making a sound then I thought I

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.529 
for making a sound then I thought I
would<00:01:40.039> just<00:01:40.070> make<00:01:40.399> one<00:01:40.430> that<00:01:40.670> wasn't<00:01:40.820> round<00:01:41.210> I

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
would just make one that wasn't round I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.749 
would just make one that wasn't round I
would<00:01:41.689> just<00:01:42.079> take<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.289> square<00:01:43.009> scrap<00:01:43.520> piece<00:01:43.729> of

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
would just take a square scrap piece of

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.730 
would just take a square scrap piece of
wood<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.359> just<00:01:44.390> drill<00:01:44.810> two<00:01:44.990> holes<00:01:45.020> in<00:01:45.409> it<00:01:45.530> and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
wood and just drill two holes in it and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.249 
wood and just drill two holes in it and
string<00:01:46.579> that<00:01:46.729> up<00:01:46.969> and<00:01:47.509> see<00:01:47.719> how<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:47.899> worked

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
string that up and see how that worked

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.990 
string that up and see how that worked
that<00:01:48.560> worked<00:01:49.100> really<00:01:49.310> well<00:01:49.399> as<00:01:49.700> far<00:01:49.729> as<00:01:49.880> the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
that worked really well as far as the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.700 
that worked really well as far as the
spinning<00:01:50.299> went<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.109> made<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.289> little<00:01:51.560> more

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
spinning went and it made a little more

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.580 
spinning went and it made a little more
sound<00:01:52.009> than<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.700> circle<00:01:53.149> did<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:54.200> was<00:01:54.350> at<00:01:54.469> this

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
sound than the circle did it was at this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.990 
sound than the circle did it was at this
point<00:01:54.799> I<00:01:54.920> thought<00:01:55.039> it'd<00:01:55.159> be<00:01:55.189> really<00:01:55.280> cool<00:01:55.670> if<00:01:55.729> I

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
point I thought it'd be really cool if I

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.149 
point I thought it'd be really cool if I
could<00:01:56.030> put<00:01:56.359> a<00:01:56.390> whistle<00:01:56.840> into<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.499> hole<00:01:57.770> at

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
could put a whistle into the hole at

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.170 
could put a whistle into the hole at
that<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.670> could<00:01:59.060> drill

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that I could drill

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.810 
that I could drill
side<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.690> square<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.980> I<00:02:02.280> drilled<00:02:02.640> two

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
side of the square so I drilled two

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
side of the square so I drilled two
holes<00:02:02.850> into<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> square<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.050> made<00:02:04.260> two

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
holes into the square and I made two

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.170 
holes into the square and I made two
reeds<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:08.280> made<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.460> whistle<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:11.820> would<00:02:12.030> go

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
reeds and I made a whistle that would go

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.930 
reeds and I made a whistle that would go
on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> side<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.110> square<00:02:13.580> but<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.820> air

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
on the side of the square but the air

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.770 
on the side of the square but the air
didn't<00:02:15.330> really<00:02:15.480> go<00:02:15.660> into<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> hole<00:02:16.490> I<00:02:17.660> need<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
didn't really go into the hole I need to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.510 
didn't really go into the hole I need to
know<00:02:18.930> more<00:02:19.140> about<00:02:19.200> fluid<00:02:19.740> dynamics<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.340> air

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
know more about fluid dynamics and air

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.640 
know more about fluid dynamics and air
flow<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.880> actually<00:02:21.300> make<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.570> work<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.620> I

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
flow to actually make that work so I

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.060 
flow to actually make that work so I
tried<00:02:23.040> putting<00:02:23.760> little<00:02:24.120> fins<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.830> fins

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
tried putting little fins on it the fins

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.610 
tried putting little fins on it the fins
made<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.490> spin<00:02:26.910> as<00:02:27.060> well<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.320> whistle

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
made it not spin as well and the whistle

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:43.160 
made it not spin as well and the whistle
still<00:02:28.860> didn't<00:02:29.130> work<00:02:37.850> OSU<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.720> was<00:02:42.870> at<00:02:43.020> this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
still didn't work OSU so it was at this

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.410 
still didn't work OSU so it was at this
point<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.620> figured<00:02:44.070> if<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.090> couldn't<00:02:45.360> make

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
point that I figured if I couldn't make

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.840 
point that I figured if I couldn't make
it<00:02:45.540> work<00:02:45.900> well<00:02:46.170> then<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.770> would<00:02:47.430> try<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.760> make

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
it work well then I would try and make

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.740 
it work well then I would try and make
it<00:02:47.970> look<00:02:48.030> good<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:50.880> started<00:02:51.239> making<00:02:51.420> a

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
it look good so I started making a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.160 
it look good so I started making a
segmented<00:02:52.650> circle<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.690> could<00:02:54.870> turn<00:02:55.020> on

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
segmented circle that I could turn on

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.640 
segmented circle that I could turn on
the<00:02:55.260> lathe<00:02:59.209> so<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.270> cut<00:03:00.510> two<00:03:00.959> different<00:03:01.290> colors

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the lathe so I cut two different colors

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
the lathe so I cut two different colors
of<00:03:01.680> wood<00:03:02.280> one<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.880> birch<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.480> one<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.110> kaya

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.500 

and<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.440> made<00:03:17.650> four<00:03:18.070> triangles<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:22.240> glued

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
and I made four triangles and I glued

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.560 
and I made four triangles and I glued
those<00:03:22.690> together<00:03:23.160> my<00:03:24.160> glue<00:03:24.400> bottle<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.910> getting

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
those together my glue bottle is getting

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.780 
those together my glue bottle is getting
ahead<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.810> itself<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.830> I<00:03:30.130> glued<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.580> four

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
ahead of itself and I glued the four

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.730 
ahead of itself and I glued the four
pieces<00:03:31.090> together<00:03:33.930> with<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:34.960> four<00:03:35.230> pieces<00:03:35.560> and

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
pieces together with the four pieces and

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.250 
pieces together with the four pieces and
I<00:03:35.890> thought<00:03:36.070> was<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.460> could<00:03:36.700> balance<00:03:37.120> two<00:03:37.660> clamps

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
I thought was I could balance two clamps

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.590 
I thought was I could balance two clamps
pushing<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.280> four<00:03:39.520> sides<00:03:39.760> in<00:03:40.060> towards<00:03:40.420> the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
pushing the four sides in towards the

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.390 
pushing the four sides in towards the
center<00:03:40.960> and<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.950> worked<00:03:42.190> really<00:03:42.280> well

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:54.930 

and<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.510> clouds<00:03:46.750> came<00:03:47.049> off<00:03:52.049> huh<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.909> drew<00:03:54.909> a

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
and the clouds came off huh I drew a

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.539 
and the clouds came off huh I drew a
circle<00:03:55.299> on<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.870> piece<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.799> I<00:03:56.920> cut<00:03:57.159> out<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
circle on the piece and I cut out the

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:03.360 
circle on the piece and I cut out the
cut<00:03:57.909> circle<00:03:58.390> on<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.200> bandsaw

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.600 

and<00:04:04.370> I<00:04:04.610> had<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.760> circle<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:06.010> drilled<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.099> hole<00:04:07.129> in

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
and I had a circle I drilled a hole in

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.059 
and I had a circle I drilled a hole in
the<00:04:07.700> center<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.390> what<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.319> was<00:04:09.500> thinking<00:04:09.830> is<00:04:09.920> I

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
the center and what I was thinking is I

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.910 
the center and what I was thinking is I
I<00:04:10.280> would<00:04:10.610> put<00:04:10.819> a<00:04:10.849> dowel<00:04:11.209> at<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.319> center<00:04:12.739> and

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
I would put a dowel at the center and

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.350 
I would put a dowel at the center and
then<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.220> would<00:04:13.340> give<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.670> lathe<00:04:13.879> something

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
then that would give the lathe something

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.840 
then that would give the lathe something
to<00:04:14.450> hold<00:04:14.629> on<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:16.070> could<00:04:16.340> turn<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.639> on<00:04:16.760> the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
to hold on to so I could turn it on the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.170 
to hold on to so I could turn it on the
lathe<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.359> would<00:04:17.989> use<00:04:18.139> my<00:04:18.260> little<00:04:18.470> jaws<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.970> hold

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
lathe I would use my little jaws to hold

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.590 
lathe I would use my little jaws to hold
that<00:04:20.359> dowel<00:04:21.610> now<00:04:22.610> if<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:22.940> could<00:04:23.000> just<00:04:23.150> harness

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
that dowel now if I could just harness

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.050 
that dowel now if I could just harness
the<00:04:23.960> energy<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.620> seven-year-old<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.460> could

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
the energy of a seven-year-old I could

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.930 
the energy of a seven-year-old I could
run<00:04:26.240> my<00:04:26.270> shop<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.290> started<00:04:30.740> by<00:04:30.919> turning<00:04:31.850> this

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
run my shop so I started by turning this

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.210 
run my shop so I started by turning this
round<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:36.550> then<00:04:37.550> worked<00:04:37.850> on<00:04:38.000> each<00:04:38.210> side<00:04:38.570> I

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
round and then worked on each side I

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.890 
round and then worked on each side I
think<00:04:40.220> with<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.639> physics<00:04:41.150> of<00:04:41.270> this<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.600> want<00:04:41.840> a

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
think with the physics of this I want a

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.710 
think with the physics of this I want a
heavier<00:04:42.229> thicker<00:04:43.010> band<00:04:43.400> at<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.270> outside<00:04:44.660> of

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
heavier thicker band at the outside of

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.680 
heavier thicker band at the outside of
the<00:04:45.020> circle<00:04:45.229> so<00:04:45.590> that's<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.639> section<00:04:47.030> right

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:00.570 

and<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:55.490> turned<00:04:55.760> off<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:55.940> ends<00:04:56.270> of<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.419> dowels

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.249 

then<00:05:01.580> once<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:01.969> dowels<00:05:02.360> were<00:05:02.509> gone<00:05:02.689> I<00:05:02.960> had<00:05:03.139> to

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
then once the dowels were gone I had to

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.799 
then once the dowels were gone I had to
hold<00:05:03.439> it<00:05:03.680> in<00:05:03.889> a<00:05:04.159> bigger<00:05:04.610> Chuck<00:05:04.969> this<00:05:05.539> worked

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:05.809 
hold it in a bigger Chuck this worked

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:11.129 
hold it in a bigger Chuck this worked
pretty<00:05:05.960> well<00:05:06.169> I<00:05:06.439> cleaned<00:05:07.009> up<00:05:07.129> the<00:05:07.309> phases<00:05:07.729> I

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.179 

thought<00:05:12.139> at<00:05:12.289> this<00:05:12.409> point<00:05:12.529> that<00:05:12.889> I<00:05:12.919> probably

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.189 
thought at this point that I probably

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:14.739 
thought at this point that I probably
should<00:05:13.460> have<00:05:13.490> drilled<00:05:14.119> the<00:05:14.300> two<00:05:14.509> holes

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:14.749 
should have drilled the two holes

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.689 
should have drilled the two holes
through<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.110> string<00:05:15.499> before<00:05:16.039> I<00:05:16.309> started

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
through the string before I started

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.700 
through the string before I started
turning<00:05:16.909> it<00:05:17.180> so<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.389> wouldn't<00:05:17.659> get<00:05:17.809> blow<00:05:18.319> out<00:05:18.529> of

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
turning it so I wouldn't get blow out of

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.579 
turning it so I wouldn't get blow out of
the<00:05:18.919> hole<00:05:19.460> but<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.389> just<00:05:20.569> turned<00:05:20.839> the<00:05:21.080> drill

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:21.589 
the hole but I just turned the drill

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.469 
the hole but I just turned the drill
press<00:05:21.710> up<00:05:22.009> fast<00:05:22.369> enough<00:05:22.520> in<00:05:22.849> it<00:05:22.969> it<00:05:23.300> worked

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
press up fast enough in it it worked

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.600 
press up fast enough in it it worked
fine<00:05:23.659> and<00:05:25.449> I<00:05:26.449> put<00:05:26.629> on<00:05:26.749> a<00:05:26.779> little<00:05:26.930> finish<00:05:27.610> and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
fine and I put on a little finish and

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.899 
fine and I put on a little finish and
the<00:05:29.360> bigger<00:05:29.539> one<00:05:29.779> looked<00:05:30.680> good<00:05:30.919> but<00:05:31.339> it<00:05:31.550> was

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
the bigger one looked good but it was

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:40.839 
the bigger one looked good but it was
really<00:05:32.240> hard<00:05:32.539> to<00:05:32.599> make<00:05:32.689> work<00:05:39.669> after<00:05:40.669> some

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
really hard to make work after some

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.899 
really hard to make work after some
practicing<00:05:41.419> I<00:05:41.629> got<00:05:42.169> it<00:05:42.319> together<00:05:42.669> and<00:05:43.669> it<00:05:43.819> was

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
practicing I got it together and it was

00:05:43.909 --> 00:06:06.480 
practicing I got it together and it was
pretty<00:05:44.119> much

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.699 

thanks<00:06:07.490> for<00:06:07.580> watching
