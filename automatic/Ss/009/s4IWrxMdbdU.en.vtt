00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
if you can as I think you probably can

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
if you can as I think you probably can
as<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.360> we're<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.750> guys

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
as well but what we're going to do guys

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.749 
as well but what we're going to do guys
just<00:01:25.229> quickly<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.650> cut<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.100> seal<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
just quickly just cut this seal on the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.060 
just quickly just cut this seal on the
back<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.259> think<00:01:28.259> that's<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> only<00:01:28.590> seal

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
back I think that's the only seal

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.380 
back I think that's the only seal
involved<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.790> we're<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> pop

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
involved and we're just going to pop

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.780 
involved and we're just going to pop
open<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.840> top<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> box<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> let's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
open the top of the box so let's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.700 
open the top of the box so let's
actually<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:33.810> these<00:01:34.079> actually<00:01:34.560> come

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
actually see how these actually come

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
actually see how these actually come
packaged<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.090> I've<00:01:36.150> seen<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> u.s.<00:01:36.780> versions

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
packaged so I've seen the u.s. versions

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.190 
packaged so I've seen the u.s. versions
I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.530> they're<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:38.009> different

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
I think they're a little bit different

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.539 
I think they're a little bit different

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
stuff being quite small but I really do

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.670 
stuff being quite small but I really do
like<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.630> design<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:27.990> think<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.320> really<00:04:28.590> really

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
like the design I think is really really

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.200 
like the design I think is really really
slim<00:04:29.130> lined<00:04:29.340> as<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.640> can<00:04:29.760> see<00:04:29.880> got<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
slim lined as you can see got the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.180 
slim lined as you can see got the
PlayStation<00:04:30.810> logo<00:04:30.840> there<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.740> middle<00:04:31.950> of

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
PlayStation logo there on the middle of

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.010 
PlayStation logo there on the middle of
the<00:04:32.310> Wrights<00:04:32.580> it's<00:04:33.240> actually<00:04:33.510> got<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> shiny

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
the Wrights it's actually got a shiny

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.720 
the Wrights it's actually got a shiny
finish<00:04:34.260> mixed<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.950> matte<00:04:35.130> finish<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:35.670> it

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
finish mixed of a matte finish so it

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.100 
finish mixed of a matte finish so it
definitely<00:04:35.880> helps<00:04:36.300> with<00:04:36.420> the<00:04:36.540> aesthetics<00:04:37.020> of

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
definitely helps with the aesthetics of

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.650 
definitely helps with the aesthetics of
the<00:04:37.260> design<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.830> little<00:04:38.370> bit<00:04:38.580> different<00:04:39.150> looks

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
the design a little bit different looks

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.330 
the design a little bit different looks
like<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.900> have<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.080> power<00:04:40.440> light<00:04:40.770> down<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
like you have a power light down the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.820 
like you have a power light down the
front<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.570> sony<00:04:42.810> logo<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.560> ps4

front<00:04:46.380> USB<00:04:46.770> ports<00:04:47.250> obviously<00:04:47.610> probably<00:04:47.850> want

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
front USB ports obviously probably want

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.810 
front USB ports obviously probably want
for<00:04:48.300> camera<00:04:48.600> one<00:04:48.780> for<00:04:49.080> controller<00:04:49.590> charger<00:04:50.160> it

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
for camera one for controller charger it

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.370 
for camera one for controller charger it
looks<00:04:50.970> like<00:04:51.120> you've<00:04:51.240> got<00:04:51.450> some<00:04:51.480> good<00:04:51.900> cooling

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
looks like you've got some good cooling

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.310 
looks like you've got some good cooling
on<00:04:52.530> this<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.919> perm<00:04:53.160> on<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:54.330> ps4<00:04:54.630> as<00:04:54.990> well<00:04:55.169> as

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
you can see via the back there is a lot

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.490 
you can see via the back there is a lot
of<00:04:57.090> cooling<00:04:57.450> going<00:04:57.600> on<00:04:57.840> there<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.140> have<00:04:58.320> the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
of cooling going on there you have the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.060 
of cooling going on there you have the
optical<00:04:59.280> audio<00:04:59.550> the<00:05:00.270> AC<00:05:00.960> adapter<00:05:01.590> input<00:05:01.950> the

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
optical audio the AC adapter input the

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.000 
optical audio the AC adapter input the
HDMI<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.820> ethernet<00:05:03.350> another<00:05:04.350> USB<00:05:04.800> port

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
HDMI the ethernet another USB port

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.450 
HDMI the ethernet another USB port
potentially<00:05:05.880> no<00:05:06.180> aux<00:05:06.480> port<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:08.040> you<00:05:08.190> just

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
potentially no aux port and so you just

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.760 
potentially no aux port and so you just
got<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.850> front<00:05:09.120> USBs<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:09.990> you've<00:05:10.620> actually
