00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:42.739
 is to teach to let forward dressed with 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.260
 the style clothes change 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.590
 so to make a treatment is to invest 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.470
 In mine , it's super easy to do well. 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.170
 exercise and take care of your exercise 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.379

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.730
 none and he does not loose ask with the 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.780
 not win 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.350
 so I hope you get well elegant 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 and give a repaginada in your piece crazy 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:19.310
 reached her and want to change then it is 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:26.330
 only to make this transformation that is the team 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:29.240
 longer and in total sent the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.959
 Beast girls are super formed by 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.149
 this I train and she's very beautiful 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.940
 then as not the full nor a kind 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.149
 essay style in this style that I 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:02:08.660
 explain only in mine then you can 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:02:13.300
 use with a goal from the side of the two 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.300
 sides and joint 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.240
 in the middle 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:32.989
 the middle stitching to that you place 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.989
 so on the table 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.440
 can dial or 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.750
 What is the Utah format? 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.230
 Ufa 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:05:12.030
 so that's right or so my name 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:31.030
 girl I'm right small 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.250
 comments on this video then the following 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.620
 in the course of the video spoke boy but 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.750
 it's actually called fear is a word 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.430
 foreigners then some of the 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.440
 written then I wonder why I 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.200
 I spoke on the principal team. 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.240
 Another observation is that when you are 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.820
 cut the dress you have seen that 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.040
 EliÃ¡n in your body you have to dial 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.890
 I scored a little above the knee already 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.480
 Are not you so curious that you do not stay 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.640
 the way I wanted it could cut 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.130
 A little more then you too have 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.380
 be careful when cutting your faith if you do not 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.440
 very short because you can run the 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.620
 risk of losing you there so you wear 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.680
 is the use a pen a brush or 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.630
 those of having been one day 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.520
 normal I think it works and marks a 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.740
 little where you want to cut 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.200
 so it's interesting, you do it 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.230
 another thing scissors on that is fine 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.790
 If she is not 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.360
 spoil the fabric it will stay with the 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.580
 Dad's going to be full of flaws then. 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.660
 you have to be voided ideally be 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.370
 an Iranian broadcaster and how I used it 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.890
 It's really cheap, it's not much. 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.610
 face and has two ways of cutting the 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:46.610
 dress will keep a trim send 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.800
 you can cut into u like me format 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.450
 I liked I think the thirst of the dress that 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.700
 Forgive me for drawing more than 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.850
 explain why it might be that your 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.710
 success is not the same as mine and 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.150
 these two ways will leave the addiction of the 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.700
 cayman 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.890
 so here's the party wearing if you can 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.669
 cut in yoga format my son here 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.010
 O 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.660
 or else you invest after you like 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.400
 so do not get the way you 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.400
 that he does not look pretty trim 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.850
 you can count on pieces in this format 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.940
 and diagonal a little base paste brings 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:22.460
 the tac the seam of the side investing here 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.190
 the front part is you cut pass 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.220
 by this side seam to teach that no 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:31.610
 I do and it impacts or you can 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.740
 cut straight away so it's easier 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.860
 leaving just the way you want in 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.660
 human style and are coming down than we 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:42.110
 then there are two ways of cutting 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:46.100
 I dress the skirt so that it stays very 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:49.550
 the girls something else 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.380
 the more the dress is or the fire skirt 

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:56.139
 is published 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:59.150
 listed is how I say but 

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:01.160
 rodadinha knows rodadinha will stay 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:05.290
 more beautiful then I came to do the 

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.290
 strange observations do not
