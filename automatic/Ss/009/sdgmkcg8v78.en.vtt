00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
driven the beach I've got stuck but I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.100 
driven the beach I've got stuck but I
was<00:02:22.620> told<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.640> drive<00:02:23.849> slow<00:02:24.150> you're

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
was told that if you drive slow you're

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.530 
was told that if you drive slow you're
going<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.290> get<00:02:25.379> stuck<00:02:25.680> that's<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.420> is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
going to get stuck that's that is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.350 
going to get stuck that's that is
incorrect<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.849> your<00:02:29.849> getting<00:02:30.120> stuck

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
incorrect that's just your getting stuck

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.850 
incorrect that's just your getting stuck
probably<00:02:30.629> because<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.080> had<00:02:31.230> too<00:02:31.410> much<00:02:31.560> air

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
probably because you had too much air

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.570 
probably because you had too much air
the<00:02:32.040> tires

the tires
you<00:02:34.540> go<00:02:34.720> slow<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.380> okay<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.420> pretty

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
you go slow it's okay that's a pretty

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.390 
you go slow it's okay that's a pretty
common<00:02:37.990> misconception<00:02:38.830> people<00:02:38.860> thinking

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400

right here people think if they slow

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.300 
right here people think if they slow
down<00:02:44.050> they're<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.590> get<00:02:44.680> stuck<00:02:45.010> which

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
down they're going to get stuck which

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.010 
down they're going to get stuck which
makes<00:02:45.610> them<00:02:45.760> drive<00:02:46.030> pretty<00:02:46.270> dangerously

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
makes them drive pretty dangerously

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.810 
makes them drive pretty dangerously
because<00:02:47.410> they<00:02:47.620> won't<00:02:47.800> slow<00:02:48.130> down<00:02:48.160> for

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
because they won't slow down for

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.780 
because they won't slow down for
anything<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:50.020> are<00:02:50.080> afraid<00:02:50.610> there's<00:02:51.610> no

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
anything as they are afraid there's no

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.430 
anything as they are afraid there's no
reason<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.180> be<00:02:52.360> scared<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.080> have<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> good

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
reason to be scared you just have a good

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.920 
reason to be scared you just have a good
time<00:02:53.500> cruising<00:02:54.190> around<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.820> think<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.750> should

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
time cruising around I think you should
