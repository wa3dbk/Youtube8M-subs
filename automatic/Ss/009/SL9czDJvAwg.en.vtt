take him out but it's not the case at

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.170 
take him out but it's not the case at
all<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.480> then<00:03:15.110> after<00:03:15.500> i'm<00:03:16.250> at<00:03:16.459> minus-2

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
all and then after i'm at minus-2

but<00:06:08.759> I'll<00:06:09.419> just<00:06:09.659> hoping<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.139> could<00:06:10.199> do

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
but I'll just hoping I could do

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.320 
but I'll just hoping I could do
something<00:06:10.770> with<00:06:11.280> bullet<00:06:11.789> seed<00:06:12.030> and

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
something with bullet seed and

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.540 
something with bullet seed and

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
technician and yada yada yada I should

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.709 
technician and yada yada yada I should
have<00:06:14.639> probably<00:06:14.789> put<00:06:15.090> him<00:06:15.180> asleep<00:06:15.330> if<00:06:15.479> I<00:06:15.569> put

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
have probably put him asleep if I put

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.209 
have probably put him asleep if I put
him<00:06:15.810> to<00:06:15.870> sleep<00:06:15.900> i'll<00:06:16.620> probably<00:06:16.979> had<00:06:17.159> a<00:06:17.190> better

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
him to sleep i'll probably had a better

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.270 
him to sleep i'll probably had a better
chance<00:06:17.400> of<00:06:17.669> one<00:06:17.789> of<00:06:17.880> this<00:06:18.000> but<00:06:18.300> i<00:06:18.330> didn't<00:06:19.280> I

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
chance of one of this but i didn't I

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.219 
chance of one of this but i didn't I
mean<00:06:21.150> he<00:06:21.240> had<00:06:21.330> natural<00:06:21.599> care<00:06:21.750> anyway<00:06:21.960> we<00:06:22.139> had

mean he had natural care anyway we had

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.779 
mean he had natural care anyway we had
to<00:06:22.289> switch<00:06:22.440> out<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:22.889> just<00:06:23.069> whatever<00:06:23.400> but<00:06:23.639> if<00:06:23.729> I
