00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
if you get stuck on three or four you're

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
if you get stuck on three or four you're
okay<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.130> get<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
okay you know you you get it you get a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
okay you know you you get it you get a
lot<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> play<00:01:29.670> out<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> oars<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.240> deck<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.140> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
lot of play out of the oars up deck so I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.920 
lot of play out of the oars up deck so I
prefer<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.070> guild<00:01:32.310> Boros<00:01:32.790> over<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> other

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
prefer the guild Boros over the other

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.780 
prefer the guild Boros over the other
four<00:01:34.200> by<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> large<00:01:34.619> margin<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.250> rest<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.610> kind

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
four by a large margin the rest are kind

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520 
four by a large margin the rest are kind
of<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> second<00:01:36.689> tier<00:01:36.900> him<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.200> my<00:01:37.320> mind

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
of all in the second tier him in my mind

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.620 
of all in the second tier him in my mind
I<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.579> looking<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.880> draft<00:01:39.150> Boros<00:01:39.450> when

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I really was looking to draft Boros when

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.200 
I really was looking to draft Boros when
I<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:41.130> takes<00:01:41.369> kind<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> big

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I got here and it takes kind of a big

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
I got here and it takes kind of a big
bomb<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.630> another<00:01:42.840> Gail<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.290> move<00:01:43.649> me<00:01:43.799> off

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
bomb and another Gail to move me off

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.539 
bomb and another Gail to move me off
that<00:01:44.130> strategy<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.759> think<00:01:45.570> Boros<00:01:46.159> uses<00:01:47.159> its<00:01:47.310> bad

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that strategy I think Boros uses its bad

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.510 
that strategy I think Boros uses its bad
cards<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.390> best<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.899> some<00:01:49.079> sense<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
cards the best in some sense like the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.649 
cards the best in some sense like the
bad<00:01:50.700> cards<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.060> boards<00:01:51.240> are<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> weak

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
bad cards and boards are kind of weak

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.999 
bad cards and boards are kind of weak
creatures<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.380> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.619> help<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
creatures but they all kind of help the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.380 
creatures but they all kind of help the
strategy<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> attacking<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.729> three<00:01:53.909> guys<00:01:54.030> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
strategy of attacking with three guys of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.539 
strategy of attacking with three guys of
being<00:01:54.540> aggressive<00:01:55.159> it<00:01:56.159> doesn't<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.399> get

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
being aggressive it doesn't really get

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.859 
being aggressive it doesn't really get
the<00:01:56.670> awkward<00:01:57.030> draws<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.509> something<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the awkward draws that something like a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.300 
the awkward draws that something like a
Simic<00:01:58.320> deck<00:01:58.500> even<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.159> well

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
Simic deck even if it's really well

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.520 
Simic deck even if it's really well
drafted<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:00.270> well<00:02:00.420> built<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:01.320> kind<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
drafted really well built you kind of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.569 
drafted really well built you kind of
have<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.680> draw<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:01.979> curve<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.430> right

have to draw your curve in the right
order<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.090> kind<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.270> one<00:02:03.360> draw<00:02:03.540> your<00:02:03.750> involved

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
order you kind of one draw your involved

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.070 
order you kind of one draw your involved
guys<00:02:04.229> first<00:02:04.530> your<00:02:04.799> non<00:02:04.950> evolved<00:02:05.219> guys<00:02:05.369> second

guys first your non evolved guys second
you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.440> each<00:02:07.620> girl<00:02:07.830> has<00:02:07.860> kind<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.130> its

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
you know that each girl has kind of its

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.560 
you know that each girl has kind of its
own<00:02:08.369> weakness<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.910> my<00:02:09.000> problem<00:02:09.240> with<00:02:09.300> gruel

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
own weakness like my problem with gruel

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.470 
own weakness like my problem with gruel
is<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.930> you<00:02:10.410> can't<00:02:10.650> switch<00:02:10.920> gears<00:02:11.480> blood

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
is that you can't switch gears blood

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.380 
is that you can't switch gears blood
rush<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.840> always<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.260> about<00:02:13.530> attacking<00:02:14.390> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
rush is always just about attacking and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.910 
rush is always just about attacking and
if<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.810> need<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> be<00:02:16.350> defensive<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.830> you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
if you need to be defensive if you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.500 
if you need to be defensive if you
stumbled<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.460> mulligans<00:02:17.880> you're<00:02:18.330> kind<00:02:18.480> of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
stumbled if you mulligans you're kind of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.090 
stumbled if you mulligans you're kind of
already<00:02:18.720> dead<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.560> can't<00:02:19.890> actually

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
already dead because you can't actually

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.530 
already dead because you can't actually
play<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.490> defensive<00:02:20.880> game<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.180> can't<00:02:21.360> try<00:02:21.480> to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
play a defensive game you can't try to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.610 
play a defensive game you can't try to
play<00:02:21.690> for<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.870> long<00:02:21.990> game<00:02:22.140> none<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.320> your<00:02:22.440> cards

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
play for a long game none of your cards

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.190 
play for a long game none of your cards
really<00:02:22.800> work<00:02:22.980> well<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.280> axis<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.390> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
really work well in that axis so you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.100 
really work well in that axis so you
know<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.320> really<00:02:25.560> prefer<00:02:25.740> Boros<00:02:26.220> because<00:02:27.110> all

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
know I really prefer Boros because all

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.170 
know I really prefer Boros because all
the<00:02:28.320> cards<00:02:28.560> kind<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.800> synergize<00:02:29.190> well<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.700> you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the cards kind of synergize well and you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.600 
the cards kind of synergize well and you
get<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.570> don't<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.110> kind<00:02:31.260> of

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
get and you don't have the kind of

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.100 
get and you don't have the kind of
specific<00:02:32.610> glaring<00:02:33.180> weakness<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.960> other

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
specific glaring weakness that the other

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.800 
specific glaring weakness that the other
skills<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.820> they're<00:02:35.820> all<00:02:35.940> very<00:02:36.150> balanced

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
skills have they're all very balanced

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.440 
skills have they're all very balanced
but<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.410> damier<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.240> one<00:02:39.390> too

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
but like damier is I like that one too

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.570 
but like damier is I like that one too
just<00:02:39.750> because<00:02:39.960> of<00:02:40.260> all<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.470> removal<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.400> you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
just because of all the removal that you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.430 
just because of all the removal that you
have<00:02:41.730> access<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:42.990> lot<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.140> people<00:02:43.350> like

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
have access to not a lot of people like

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.890 
have access to not a lot of people like
that<00:02:43.650> grizzly<00:02:44.640> spectacles<00:02:45.120> pretty<00:02:45.630> much<00:02:45.750> got

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
that grizzly spectacles pretty much got

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.840 
that grizzly spectacles pretty much got
to<00:02:46.020> be<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.170> best<00:02:46.290> common<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:47.340> zov<00:02:47.670> and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
to be the best common for zov and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.400 
to be the best common for zov and
probably<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.300> set<00:02:48.480> but<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:48.959> mean<00:02:49.140> everyone

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
probably in the set but I mean everyone

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.020 
probably in the set but I mean everyone
knows<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:50.100> there's<00:02:50.610> something<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.910> I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
knows that if there's something that I

knows that if there's something that I
think<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.480> better<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:52.050> maybe<00:02:52.230> other<00:02:52.320> people

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
think is better that maybe other people

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.840 
think is better that maybe other people
are<00:02:52.709> under<00:02:52.860> rating<00:02:53.130> or<00:02:53.160> something<00:02:53.459> it's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
are under rating or something it's

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.130 
are under rating or something it's
probably<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.180> next<00:02:54.300> best<00:02:54.540> comments<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.080> the

probably the next best comments for the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
probably the next best comments for the
oars<00:02:55.290> off<00:02:55.410> deck<00:02:55.620> which<00:02:55.800> are<00:02:55.920> probably

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
oars off deck which are probably

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.040 
oars off deck which are probably
kingpins<00:02:56.550> patents<00:02:56.910> might<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.300> syndicate<00:02:58.020> of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
tithes I mean I don't know how to like

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.310 
tithes I mean I don't know how to like
really<00:02:59.820> say<00:03:00.270> like<00:03:00.480> which<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.900> those<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.170> my

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
want my oars off decks to be fleshed out

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.600 
want my oars off decks to be fleshed out
with<00:03:05.370> as<00:03:05.490> many<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.970> kingpin<00:03:06.810> pets<00:03:07.310> basa<00:03:08.310> looks

with as many of kingpin pets basa looks
creature<00:03:08.910> i<00:03:08.940> think<00:03:09.090> it's<00:03:09.180> called<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.420> one<00:03:09.570> to

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
creature i think it's called the one to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.990 
creature i think it's called the one to
bat<00:03:09.870> with<00:03:10.230> extort<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.770> Syndic<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.700> tithes

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
bat with extort a Syndic of tithes

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.820 
bat with extort a Syndic of tithes
that's<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.570> two<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.989> four<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.320> extort<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.680> think

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
that's the two to four to extort I think

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.280 
that's the two to four to extort I think
I'm<00:03:13.980> bad<00:03:14.310> with<00:03:14.340> names<00:03:14.550> I'm<00:03:14.760> sorry<00:03:15.080> smite<00:03:16.080> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
I'm bad with names I'm sorry smite and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.350 
I'm bad with names I'm sorry smite and
grisly<00:03:16.620> spectacle<00:03:17.070> those<00:03:17.550> five<00:03:17.760> Commons<00:03:18.209> are

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
grisly spectacle those five Commons are

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.600 
grisly spectacle those five Commons are
like<00:03:18.510> really<00:03:19.170> ideal<00:03:19.830> for<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> extort<00:03:20.459> deck

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
like really ideal for the extort deck

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.890 
like really ideal for the extort deck
you<00:03:20.730> want<00:03:20.910> as<00:03:21.000> many<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.300> them<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.540> get

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
you want as many of them as you get

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.080 
you want as many of them as you get
things<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.440> blood<00:03:22.860> rush<00:03:23.070> cipher<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.700> extort

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
things like blood rush cipher and extort

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.090 
things like blood rush cipher and extort
they're<00:03:24.239> more<00:03:24.360> like<00:03:24.480> bonuses<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.140> cards<00:03:25.530> you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
they're more like bonuses on cards you

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.740 
they're more like bonuses on cards you
know<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:26.340> take<00:03:26.519> any<00:03:26.790> card<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.390> you

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
know if you just take any card and you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.940 
know if you just take any card and you
kind<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:27.959> put<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.170> those<00:03:28.290> mechanics<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.860> it

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
kind of put on those mechanics on it it

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.009 
kind of put on those mechanics on it it
just<00:03:28.980> gets<00:03:29.250> better<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.510> still<00:03:30.720> play<00:03:30.900> it

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
just gets better and you still play it

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.530 
just gets better and you still play it
but<00:03:31.200> kind<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.769> build<00:03:32.010> around

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
but kind of you have to build around

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.210 
but kind of you have to build around
battalion<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.660> evolve<00:03:33.959> when<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.590> are

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
battalion and evolve when you are

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.680 
battalion and evolve when you are
drafting<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.850> have<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.060> dropped<00:03:36.269> around<00:03:36.390> them

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
drafting you have to dropped around them

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.170 
drafting you have to dropped around them
something<00:03:37.470> like<00:03:37.500> battalion<00:03:38.070> which<00:03:38.519> makes

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
something like battalion which makes

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.520 
something like battalion which makes
your<00:03:39.269> creatures<00:03:39.510> much<00:03:39.840> better<00:03:40.080> when<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.380> on

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
your creatures much better when it's on

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.140 
your creatures much better when it's on
and<00:03:40.739> makes<00:03:41.220> them<00:03:41.340> much<00:03:41.459> worse<00:03:41.670> when<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:41.910> off

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and makes them much worse when it's off

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.120 
and makes them much worse when it's off
is<00:03:42.360> definitely<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.230> builder<00:03:43.560> on<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.800> end<00:03:43.920> draft

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
is definitely a builder on the end draft

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.960 
is definitely a builder on the end draft
you<00:03:44.310> want<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> make<00:03:44.610> sure<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.790> have<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:44.910> right

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you want to make sure you have the right

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.370 
you want to make sure you have the right
number<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.300> creatures<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:46.110> want<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.290> make

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
number of creatures you want to make

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.380 
number of creatures you want to make
sure<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.680> cards<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:46.980> are<00:03:47.160> creatures<00:03:47.430> focus

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
sure the cards that are creatures focus

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.759 
sure the cards that are creatures focus
on<00:03:48.510> getting<00:03:48.600> your<00:03:48.780> creatures<00:03:49.110> through<00:03:49.470> or

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
on getting your creatures through or

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.610 
on getting your creatures through or
survive<00:03:50.070> in<00:03:50.190> combat<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.810> know<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.320> evolve

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
survive in combat so you know and evolve

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.780 
survive in combat so you know and evolve
obviously<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.100> want<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.280> make<00:03:53.370> sure<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.519> you

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
obviously you want to make sure that you

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.100 
obviously you want to make sure that you
have<00:03:53.910> kind<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.150> all<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.480> pieces<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.840> let

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
have kind of all the pieces that let

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.759 
have kind of all the pieces that let
evolve<00:03:55.560> trigger<00:03:55.860> multiple<00:03:56.670> times<00:03:56.820> preferably

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
evolve trigger multiple times preferably

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.979 
evolve trigger multiple times preferably
so<00:03:58.769> those<00:03:58.920> two<00:03:59.010> mechanics<00:03:59.370> definitely<00:03:59.989> reward

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
so those two mechanics definitely reward

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.960 
so those two mechanics definitely reward
drafting<00:04:01.470> around<00:04:01.709> them<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.040> using<00:04:02.550> them<00:04:02.670> kind

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
drafting around them and using them kind

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.820 
drafting around them and using them kind
of<00:04:03.030> focusing<00:04:03.420> your<00:04:03.450> draft<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:03.870> them<00:04:04.080> I've<00:04:04.680> been

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
of focusing your draft on them I've been

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.710 
of focusing your draft on them I've been
dressing<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> magic<00:04:05.700> online<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.480> seems

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
dressing on a magic online and it seems

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.810 
dressing on a magic online and it seems
that<00:04:06.870> our<00:04:07.140> service<00:04:07.739> way<00:04:07.950> under<00:04:08.220> drafted<00:04:08.610> there

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
that our service way under drafted there

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.600 
that our service way under drafted there
so<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.570> get<00:04:09.810> cards<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.440> executioner<00:04:11.310> swing

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
so you get cards like executioner swing

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.590 
so you get cards like executioner swing
late<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.470> we<00:04:13.470> scope<00:04:13.769> confessor<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:15.000> one<00:04:15.300> tree

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
late and we scope confessor the one tree

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.740 
late and we scope confessor the one tree
that

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.020 
that
makes<00:04:16.900> him<00:04:17.019> discard<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.440> card<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.859> those<00:04:18.549> are<00:04:18.579> I

think<00:04:19.390> really<00:04:19.420> good<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:19.959> our<00:04:20.140> sub<00:04:20.380> but<00:04:20.560> they

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
think really good in our sub but they

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.730 
think really good in our sub but they
can<00:04:20.890> relate<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.549> think<00:04:22.050> burst<00:04:23.050> of<00:04:23.260> strength<00:04:23.500> is

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
can relate I think burst of strength is

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.370 
can relate I think burst of strength is
very<00:04:23.950> good<00:04:24.100> in<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.670> green<00:04:24.940> decks<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.480> ivyland

Dennison<00:04:26.890> is<00:04:27.040> probably<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:28.300> high<00:04:28.570> pick<00:04:28.870> as<00:04:29.110> it

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
Dennison is probably the high pick as it

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.200 
Dennison is probably the high pick as it
should<00:04:29.560> be<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:29.770> most<00:04:30.100> people<00:04:30.400> it's<00:04:30.520> super

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
should be for most people it's super

things<00:04:35.020> one<00:04:35.730> take<00:04:36.730> removal<00:04:37.240> at<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.360> priority

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
things one take removal at a priority

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.560 
things one take removal at a priority
because<00:04:38.200> even<00:04:38.680> if<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:39.040> have<00:04:39.220> a<00:04:39.430> bad<00:04:39.910> draft<00:04:40.330> at

just end up a mess blood rush is a

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.670 
just end up a mess blood rush is a
mechanic<00:04:50.919> is<00:04:51.100> a<00:04:51.880> lot<00:04:52.780> worse<00:04:53.050> when<00:04:53.200> everybody's

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
mechanic is a lot worse when everybody's

mechanic is a lot worse when everybody's
a<00:04:53.710> good<00:04:53.890> player<00:04:54.330> basically<00:04:55.330> it's<00:04:55.630> kind<00:04:55.960> of

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
a good player basically it's kind of

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.600 
a good player basically it's kind of
forces<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.830> play<00:04:56.980> in<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.100> very<00:04:57.250> narrow

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
forces you to play in a very narrow

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.159 
forces you to play in a very narrow
window<00:04:57.730> kind<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.660> have<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:58.870> use<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.020> in<00:04:59.110> the

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
window kind of you have to use it in the

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.940 
window kind of you have to use it in the
attacking<00:04:59.440> step<00:04:59.770> it's<00:05:00.190> almost<00:05:00.370> reactive<00:05:01.950> all

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
attacking step it's almost reactive all

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.590 
attacking step it's almost reactive all
right<00:05:03.070> like<00:05:03.310> if<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:03.880> try<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.090> use<00:05:04.360> it<00:05:04.510> your

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
right like if you try to use it your

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.480 
right like if you try to use it your
opponent<00:05:04.810> can<00:05:04.900> always<00:05:05.080> respond<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.430> you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
opponent can always respond and so you

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.970 
opponent can always respond and so you
kind<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.210> get<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.450> these<00:05:07.540> situations<00:05:08.169> where<00:05:08.500> as

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
kind of get in these situations where as

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.700 
kind of get in these situations where as
a<00:05:09.360> removal<00:05:10.360> spell<00:05:10.630> or<00:05:10.840> as<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:10.990> damaged<00:05:11.410> source

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
a removal spell or as a damaged source

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.470 
a removal spell or as a damaged source
it<00:05:11.950> could<00:05:12.430> only<00:05:12.520> be<00:05:12.640> used<00:05:12.820> very<00:05:12.910> specifically

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
it could only be used very specifically

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.420 
it could only be used very specifically
whereas<00:05:14.110> Boros<00:05:14.500> kind<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:14.830> battalion<00:05:15.190> happens

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
whereas Boros kind of battalion happens

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.310 
whereas Boros kind of battalion happens
when<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:15.640> attack<00:05:15.940> makes<00:05:16.870> your<00:05:16.990> creatures<00:05:17.200> all

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
when you attack makes your creatures all

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.780 
when you attack makes your creatures all
better<00:05:17.560> your<00:05:17.800> poem<00:05:18.010> has<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.250> do<00:05:18.370> something<00:05:18.580> and

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
better your poem has to do something and

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.820 
better your poem has to do something and
then<00:05:18.940> your<00:05:19.060> tricks<00:05:19.300> become<00:05:19.540> live<00:05:19.750> gruel<00:05:20.710> if

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
then your tricks become live gruel if

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.380 
then your tricks become live gruel if
you<00:05:20.919> attack<00:05:21.130> kind<00:05:21.340> of<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.610> bad<00:05:21.910> feature<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.330> a

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
you attack kind of a bad feature to a

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.310 
you attack kind of a bad feature to a
good<00:05:22.540> creature<00:05:22.690> they<00:05:22.870> know<00:05:22.990> your<00:05:23.169> blood

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
good creature they know your blood

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.570 
good creature they know your blood
rushing<00:05:23.710> they<00:05:23.830> can<00:05:23.979> save<00:05:24.130> all<00:05:24.250> their<00:05:24.400> tricks

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
rushing they can save all their tricks

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.070 
rushing they can save all their tricks
and<00:05:24.790> you<00:05:24.910> just<00:05:25.030> get<00:05:25.150> kind<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.479> hammered<00:05:25.780> for<00:05:25.930> it

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
and you just get kind of hammered for it

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.260 
and you just get kind of hammered for it
so<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:26.830> think<00:05:26.979> rule<00:05:27.340> is<00:05:27.430> definitely<00:05:27.790> overrated

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
so I think rule is definitely overrated

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.750 
so I think rule is definitely overrated
right<00:05:28.390> now<00:05:28.510> well<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:29.500> wouldn't<00:05:29.860> say<00:05:29.979> Boris<00:05:30.610> is

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
right now well I wouldn't say Boris is

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.270 
right now well I wouldn't say Boris is
overrated<00:05:31.479> because<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.870> very<00:05:31.900> good<00:05:32.380> but<00:05:33.220> I

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
overrated because it is very good but I

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.430 
overrated because it is very good but I
know<00:05:33.640> like<00:05:34.030> as<00:05:34.360> soon<00:05:34.510> as<00:05:34.630> we<00:05:34.720> saw<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:34.930> spoiler

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
know like as soon as we saw a spoiler

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.810 
know like as soon as we saw a spoiler
since<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.770> start<00:05:35.950> talking<00:05:36.220> to<00:05:36.280> people<00:05:36.340> on<00:05:36.580> moto

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
since I start talking to people on moto

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.310 
since I start talking to people on moto
it<00:05:36.970> just<00:05:37.120> seems<00:05:37.270> like<00:05:37.360> everybody's<00:05:37.960> like<00:05:38.110> all

about<00:05:38.740> Boris<00:05:39.190> and<00:05:39.460> I<00:05:39.790> don't<00:05:40.000> think<00:05:40.090> it's

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
about Boris and I don't think it's

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.670 
about Boris and I don't think it's
particularly<00:05:40.660> overpowered<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.560> other

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
particularly overpowered to the other

particularly overpowered to the other
guilds<00:05:42.070> I<00:05:42.220> think<00:05:42.790> it's<00:05:42.910> good<00:05:43.090> i<00:05:43.330> think<00:05:43.810> it's

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
guilds I think it's good i think it's

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.750 
guilds I think it's good i think it's
deep<00:05:44.169> i<00:05:44.380> think<00:05:44.650> it's<00:05:44.740> i<00:05:45.100> think<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.460> ignores

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
deep i think it's i think it ignores

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.400 
deep i think it's i think it ignores
over<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.150> two<00:05:46.270> deepest<00:05:46.630> can<00:05:46.900> both<00:05:47.050> support

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
over the two deepest can both support

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.860 
over the two deepest can both support
two<00:05:47.530> to<00:05:47.620> three<00:05:47.770> drafters<00:05:48.130> per<00:05:48.280> table<00:05:48.720> it<00:05:49.720> has<00:05:49.840> a

commons<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.010> I<00:05:54.040> mean<00:05:54.160> it's<00:05:54.280> good<00:05:54.430> but<00:05:54.640> uh<00:05:54.880> I

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
commons so I mean it's good but uh I

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.870 
commons so I mean it's good but uh I
don't<00:05:55.570> think<00:05:55.750> it's<00:05:56.050> like<00:05:56.290> far<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.250> away<00:05:57.340> above

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
don't think it's like far and away above

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.219 
don't think it's like far and away above
the<00:05:58.060> other<00:05:58.180> guilds<00:05:58.510> or<00:05:58.600> anything<00:05:58.870> I<00:05:59.020> think<00:05:59.169> a

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
the other guilds or anything I think a

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.930 
the other guilds or anything I think a
lot<00:05:59.260> of<00:05:59.380> people<00:05:59.440> do<00:05:59.770> seem<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.070> take<00:06:00.250> that<00:06:00.490> well

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
lot of people do seem to take that well

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.330 
lot of people do seem to take that well
at<00:06:01.240> the<00:06:01.450> moment<00:06:01.630> I<00:06:02.140> like<00:06:02.380> drafting<00:06:02.800> gatecrash

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
at the moment I like drafting gatecrash

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.460 
at the moment I like drafting gatecrash
because<00:06:03.640> it's<00:06:03.820> a<00:06:03.910> new<00:06:04.060> set<00:06:04.600> so<00:06:04.840> it<00:06:04.900> feels<00:06:05.080> fresh

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
because it's a new set so it feels fresh

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.469 
because it's a new set so it feels fresh
and<00:06:05.500> you're<00:06:05.950> not<00:06:06.190> tired<00:06:06.490> of<00:06:06.669> all<00:06:06.820> the<00:06:06.970> old<00:06:07.210> like

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
and you're not tired of all the old like

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.890 
and you're not tired of all the old like
interactions<00:06:08.200> and<00:06:09.360> like<00:06:10.360> one<00:06:10.780> of<00:06:10.810> the

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
interactions and like one of the

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.020 
interactions and like one of the
problems<00:06:11.290> I<00:06:11.410> think<00:06:11.590> wit<00:06:11.800> both<00:06:12.580> of<00:06:12.700> these<00:06:12.790> sets

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
problems I think wit both of these sets

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.420 
problems I think wit both of these sets
is<00:06:13.390> that<00:06:13.690> your<00:06:14.440> kind<00:06:14.650> of<00:06:14.710> tied<00:06:14.890> to<00:06:15.100> drafting

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
is that your kind of tied to drafting

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.560 
is that your kind of tied to drafting
one<00:06:15.610> guild<00:06:15.850> can't<00:06:16.660> really<00:06:16.960> go<00:06:17.140> like<00:06:18.210> be<00:06:19.210> super

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
one guild can't really go like be super

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.500 
one guild can't really go like be super
creative<00:06:19.840> but<00:06:20.229> I<00:06:20.460> like<00:06:21.460> I<00:06:21.580> crafting<00:06:22.300> and<00:06:22.450> I

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
creative but I like I crafting and I

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.420 
creative but I like I crafting and I
think<00:06:22.720> the<00:06:22.960> set<00:06:23.350> has<00:06:23.500> nice<00:06:23.740> balance<00:06:24.190> and

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
think the set has nice balance and

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.029 
think the set has nice balance and
there's<00:06:24.640> some<00:06:24.970> kind<00:06:25.390> of<00:06:25.539> nice<00:06:26.470> synergies

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
there's some kind of nice synergies

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.680 
there's some kind of nice synergies
between<00:06:27.070> guilds<00:06:27.760> and<00:06:27.880> cars<00:06:28.150> that<00:06:28.390> you<00:06:28.510> might

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
between guilds and cars that you might

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.279 
between guilds and cars that you might
not<00:06:28.870> think<00:06:28.930> of<00:06:29.320> like

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
not think of like

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.100 
not think of like
example<00:06:30.770> Simic<00:06:31.249> you<00:06:31.939> have<00:06:32.059> metropolis<00:06:32.719> pride

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
example Simic you have metropolis pride

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.159 
example Simic you have metropolis pride
and<00:06:33.379> the<00:06:33.409> 24<00:06:34.159> bug<00:06:34.339> guy<00:06:34.639> I<00:06:34.909> think<00:06:35.419> combined<00:06:35.990> were

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
and the 24 bug guy I think combined were

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.980 
and the 24 bug guy I think combined were
well<00:06:36.379> to<00:06:36.619> like<00:06:36.770> attack<00:06:37.249> for<00:06:37.879> basically<00:06:38.839> like

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
well to like attack for basically like

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.299 
well to like attack for basically like
fireball<00:06:39.559> them<00:06:39.770> if<00:06:39.949> you<00:06:40.039> have<00:06:40.099> enough

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:40.309 
fireball them if you have enough

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.790 
fireball them if you have enough
violence<00:06:40.719> stuff<00:06:41.719> like<00:06:41.869> that<00:06:41.899> small<00:06:42.379> things<00:06:42.589> I

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
violence stuff like that small things I

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.079 
violence stuff like that small things I
like<00:06:43.279> that<00:06:43.369> it's<00:06:43.490> a<00:06:43.520> little<00:06:43.699> bit<00:06:43.789> of<00:06:43.849> a<00:06:43.909> change

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:44.089 
like that it's a little bit of a change

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:48.040 
like that it's a little bit of a change
of<00:06:44.300> pace<00:06:44.569> in<00:06:44.960> terms<00:06:45.349> of<00:06:45.649> card<00:06:46.639> evaluations<00:06:47.270> the

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
of pace in terms of card evaluations the

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.779 
of pace in terms of card evaluations the
format's<00:06:48.349> very<00:06:48.529> aggressive<00:06:49.069> your<00:06:49.369> curb<00:06:49.639> is

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
format's very aggressive your curb is

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:52.839 
format's very aggressive your curb is
very<00:06:50.089> very<00:06:50.300> important<00:06:51.309> three<00:06:52.309> colors<00:06:52.550> isn't

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
very very important three colors isn't

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.779 
very very important three colors isn't
as<00:06:52.909> about<00:06:53.089> isn't<00:06:53.419> as<00:06:53.539> I<00:06:53.869> guess<00:06:54.409> viable<00:06:54.860> so<00:06:55.580> it's

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
as about isn't as I guess viable so it's

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.459 
as about isn't as I guess viable so it's
kind<00:06:55.999> of<00:06:56.059> a<00:06:56.149> switch<00:06:56.569> up<00:06:56.779> if<00:06:56.990> you<00:06:57.080> just<00:06:57.259> kind<00:06:57.409> of

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:57.469 
kind of a switch up if you just kind of

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:59.019 
kind of a switch up if you just kind of
take<00:06:57.619> in<00:06:57.740> what<00:06:57.889> you<00:06:57.949> learn<00:06:58.159> in<00:06:58.309> RT<00:06:58.550> are<00:06:58.699> taking

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029 
take in what you learn in RT are taking

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.159 
take in what you learn in RT are taking
what<00:06:59.119> you<00:06:59.149> learned<00:06:59.330> in<00:06:59.389> innistrad<00:06:59.629> which<00:07:00.050> are

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
what you learned in innistrad which are

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.529 
what you learned in innistrad which are
both<00:07:00.229> kind<00:07:00.409> of<00:07:00.499> more<00:07:00.740> kind<00:07:01.009> of<00:07:01.039> open<00:07:01.430> kind<00:07:02.389> of

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
both kind of more kind of open kind of

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.290 
both kind of more kind of open kind of
good<00:07:03.319> stuff<00:07:03.349> formats<00:07:04.249> then<00:07:04.610> wouldn't<00:07:05.119> be<00:07:05.180> as

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
good stuff formats then wouldn't be as

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.429 
good stuff formats then wouldn't be as
applicable<00:07:05.539> here<00:07:05.779> this<00:07:06.139> is<00:07:06.259> a<00:07:06.289> much<00:07:06.409> more

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
applicable here this is a much more

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.559 
applicable here this is a much more
aggressive<00:07:06.649> format<00:07:07.219> it's<00:07:07.520> kind<00:07:07.699> of<00:07:07.849> flipped

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:08.569 
aggressive format it's kind of flipped

traditional<00:07:09.110> card<00:07:09.289> evaluations<00:07:09.770> I<00:07:09.860> think

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:10.009 
traditional card evaluations I think

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:11.709 
traditional card evaluations I think
this<00:07:10.099> is<00:07:10.219> basically<00:07:10.849> as<00:07:10.999> close<00:07:11.180> to<00:07:11.300> zendikar

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:11.719 
this is basically as close to zendikar

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:13.119 
this is basically as close to zendikar
as<00:07:11.839> we've<00:07:11.959> ever<00:07:12.110> gotten<00:07:12.289> in<00:07:12.619> terms<00:07:12.800> of<00:07:12.949> where
