mean<00:03:55.549> that's<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.940> conflict<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.570> book<00:03:56.780> is

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
mean that's the conflict of the book is

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.670 
mean that's the conflict of the book is
one<00:03:57.620> ideology<00:03:57.980> versus<00:03:58.489> another<00:03:59.530> well<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.560> think

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
one ideology versus another well I think

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.759 
one ideology versus another well I think
