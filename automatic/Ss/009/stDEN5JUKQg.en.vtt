there<00:01:41.799> was<00:01:41.920> no<00:01:42.070> epiphany<00:01:42.670> there<00:01:43.179> was<00:01:43.270> no<00:01:43.450> road

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
there was no epiphany there was no road

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.279 
there was no epiphany there was no road
to<00:01:43.960> Damascus<00:01:44.560> experience<00:01:45.630> he<00:01:46.630> simply<00:01:47.020> slipped

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
to Damascus experience he simply slipped

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.539 
to Damascus experience he simply slipped
away<00:01:47.969> quietly<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.299> gently<00:01:49.929> like<00:01:50.770> flotsam<00:01:51.340> on

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
away quietly and gently like flotsam on

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.190 
away quietly and gently like flotsam on
the<00:01:51.939> appetite<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:54.329> from<00:01:55.329> then<00:01:55.509> on<00:01:55.659> religion

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
the appetite and from then on religion

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.109 
the appetite and from then on religion
played<00:01:56.409> no<00:01:56.649> significant<00:01:57.310> part<00:01:57.579> in<00:01:57.729> my<00:01:57.909> life

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
played no significant part in my life

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.410 
played no significant part in my life
and<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.289> may<00:01:59.439> have<00:01:59.619> remained<00:02:00.149> had<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.270> not

there's the rub how do we deal with

clearly evidential arguments are not
going<00:05:28.949> to<00:05:29.039> work<00:05:29.280> I<00:05:30.440> suspect<00:05:31.440> that<00:05:31.710> in<00:05:32.130> dealing

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
going to work I suspect that in dealing

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.490 
going to work I suspect that in dealing
with<00:05:32.639> a<00:05:32.669> problem<00:05:33.000> of<00:05:33.210> religion<00:05:33.720> which<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:34.440> do

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
with a problem of religion which I do

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.140 
with a problem of religion which I do
believe<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:35.070> be<00:05:35.160> a<00:05:35.190> problem<00:05:35.430> that<00:05:35.610> has<00:05:35.910> to<00:05:36.060> be

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
believe to be a problem that has to be

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.020 
believe to be a problem that has to be
done<00:05:36.360> with<00:05:36.570> purely<00:05:37.289> factual<00:05:37.740> evidence<00:05:38.370> based

done with purely factual evidence based

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.909 
done with purely factual evidence based
arguments<00:05:39.720> are<00:05:39.990> not<00:05:40.050> going<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.620> be<00:05:40.740> sufficient

I<00:05:41.870> suspect<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:43.020> answer<00:05:43.220> lies<00:05:44.220> in<00:05:44.250> an

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
I suspect the answer lies in an

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.120 
I suspect the answer lies in an
understanding<00:05:45.150> of<00:05:45.240> psychology<00:05:46.130> an

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
understanding of psychology an

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.040 
understanding of psychology an

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.740 
displacement of religions has never been
explained<00:06:55.410> by<00:06:55.680> any<00:06:56.280> theists<00:06:56.760> of<00:06:57.480> whatever

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
explained by any theists of whatever

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.430 
explained by any theists of whatever
denomination<00:06:58.550> in<00:06:59.550> any<00:06:59.730> meaningful<00:07:00.030> way<00:07:00.350> and<00:07:01.350> I

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
denomination in any meaningful way and I

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.050 
denomination in any meaningful way and I
would<00:07:01.500> certainly<00:07:01.800> like<00:07:02.160> to<00:07:02.190> hear<00:07:02.490> arguments

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
would certainly like to hear arguments

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.810 
would certainly like to hear arguments
from<00:07:03.210> the<00:07:03.300> theists<00:07:03.930> to<00:07:04.200> explain<00:07:04.590> this<00:07:04.820> but

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820 
from the theists to explain this but

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.060 
from the theists to explain this but
just<00:07:06.030> going<00:07:06.180> back<00:07:06.390> to<00:07:06.450> my<00:07:06.690> first<00:07:06.930> prayer<00:07:07.320> in

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
just going back to my first prayer in

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.830 
just going back to my first prayer in
which<00:07:08.370> as<00:07:08.550> I<00:07:08.670> say<00:07:08.850> I<00:07:09.090> asked<00:07:09.570> for<00:07:09.660> forgiveness

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
which as I say I asked for forgiveness

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
which as I say I asked for forgiveness
for<00:07:10.380> my<00:07:10.500> doubts<00:07:10.770> and<00:07:11.160> evidence<00:07:12.000> for<00:07:12.480> my<00:07:12.600> god<00:07:12.870> so

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
for my doubts and evidence for my god so

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.790 
for my doubts and evidence for my god so
far<00:07:14.100> as<00:07:14.190> the<00:07:14.340> first<00:07:14.550> is<00:07:14.790> concerned<00:07:15.240> I<00:07:15.530> have<00:07:16.530> no

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
far as the first is concerned I have no

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.010 
far as the first is concerned I have no
idea<00:07:17.190> whether<00:07:17.670> I<00:07:17.790> have<00:07:17.940> been<00:07:18.210> forgiven<00:07:18.390> or<00:07:18.810> not

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 
idea whether I have been forgiven or not

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.890 
idea whether I have been forgiven or not
but<00:07:19.800> I<00:07:19.830> can<00:07:20.130> say<00:07:20.370> so<00:07:20.850> far<00:07:21.120> as<00:07:21.210> the<00:07:21.330> second<00:07:21.690> part

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
but I can say so far as the second part

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.890 
but I can say so far as the second part
of<00:07:22.020> the<00:07:22.140> prayer<00:07:22.380> is<00:07:22.500> concerned<00:07:22.950> I<00:07:23.660> have<00:07:24.660> seen

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
of the prayer is concerned I have seen

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.550 
of the prayer is concerned I have seen
no<00:07:25.230> credible<00:07:25.500> evidence<00:07:26.100> for<00:07:26.700> a<00:07:26.730> god<00:07:27.440> yet<00:07:28.440> I

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 
no credible evidence for a god yet I

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.230 
no credible evidence for a god yet I
have<00:07:28.890> seen<00:07:29.190> a<00:07:29.430> lot<00:07:30.330> of<00:07:30.600> evidence<00:07:30.920> for<00:07:31.920> man

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 
have seen a lot of evidence for man

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.860 
have seen a lot of evidence for man
having<00:07:33.240> created<00:07:33.780> a<00:07:33.990> lot<00:07:34.590> of<00:07:35.040> gods

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
having created a lot of gods

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.080 
having created a lot of gods
that's<00:07:36.870> why<00:07:37.170> religion<00:07:37.890> does<00:07:38.250> not<00:07:38.280> scour<00:07:38.790> for

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090 
that's why religion does not scour for

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.450 
that's why religion does not scour for
me
