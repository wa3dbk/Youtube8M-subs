aha

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.110 

single<00:00:17.230> point<00:00:17.470> of<00:00:17.590> light

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
single point of light

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.780 
single point of light
an<00:00:19.480> orb<00:00:19.930> whatever<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.010> city<00:00:21.220> there's<00:00:21.400> a<00:00:21.460> plane

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
an orb whatever the city there's a plane

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.550 
an orb whatever the city there's a plane
there's<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.870> plane<00:00:23.320> and<00:00:23.800> there<00:00:24.670> is<00:00:25.000> an<00:00:25.270> orb<00:00:25.660> then

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
there's a plane and there is an orb then

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.240 
there's a plane and there is an orb then
they<00:00:26.800> look<00:00:26.980> like<00:00:27.100> they're<00:00:27.280> about<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.520> crash

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
they look like they're about to crash

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.910 
they look like they're about to crash
come<00:00:30.250> on<00:00:30.400> come<00:00:30.580> on<00:00:30.700> focus<00:00:34.470> there's<00:00:35.470> a<00:00:35.560> plane<00:00:35.770> in

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
come on come on focus there's a plane in

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.880 
come on come on focus there's a plane in
there's<00:00:36.070> an<00:00:36.190> orb

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.340 

the<00:00:42.430> plane<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:42.940> there's<00:00:43.120> an<00:00:43.239> orb<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:44.140> orb

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
the plane and there's an orb and the orb

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:55.680 
the plane and there's an orb and the orb
is<00:00:44.530> flashing<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.489> orb<00:00:48.760> is<00:00:48.940> flashing

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.390 

the<00:00:56.690> orb<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.080> a<00:00:57.110> solid<00:00:57.560> ball<00:00:57.740> of<00:00:57.770> light<00:00:58.070> there

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
the orb is a solid ball of light there

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:11.420 
the orb is a solid ball of light there
is<00:00:58.430> no

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.480 

and<00:01:12.030> now<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.480> gone

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and now it's gone

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.810 
and now it's gone
oh<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.299> done<00:01:15.649> now<00:01:16.649> it<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.759> all

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
oh it's done now it is not there at all

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:29.560 
oh it's done now it is not there at all
anymore<00:01:21.049> there's<00:01:22.049> no<00:01:22.259> orb<00:01:22.610> The<00:01:23.610> Orb<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.939> gone

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.719 

you<00:01:30.200> see<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.409> norm<00:01:30.620> I<00:01:30.800> see<00:01:31.190> no<00:01:31.340> orb<00:01:33.130> or<00:01:34.130> was<00:01:34.520> there

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
you see a norm I see no orb or was there

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.460 
you see a norm I see no orb or was there
it<00:01:34.970> was<00:01:35.060> flashing<00:01:35.390> outgun<00:01:35.930> there's<00:01:36.140> nothing

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
it was flashing outgun there's nothing

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.990 
it was flashing outgun there's nothing
there<00:01:36.650> there's<00:01:36.830> nothing<00:01:37.159> in<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> shot<00:01:43.000> that's

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
there there's nothing in the shot that's

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.590 
there there's nothing in the shot that's
a<00:01:45.070> star

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.530 

but<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.320> focus

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:08.690 

no<00:01:59.200> work

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.940 

see<00:02:09.390> him<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.840> plane<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.560> flashing

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
see him the plane see the flashing

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.400 
see him the plane see the flashing
lights<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.510> flashing<00:02:13.140> lights

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
lights you have to have flashing lights

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.509 
lights you have to have flashing lights
on<00:02:13.739> an<00:02:14.040> aircraft<00:02:14.989> flying<00:02:15.989> at<00:02:16.170> night<00:02:16.230> at<00:02:16.800> least

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
on an aircraft flying at night at least

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:25.790 
on an aircraft flying at night at least
two<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.879> them<00:02:18.030> red<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.790> white<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:25.590> if

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
two of them red and white and that if

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.410 
two of them red and white and that if
you<00:02:26.010> go<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> rewind<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.030> video<00:02:27.330> you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
you go and you rewind this video you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.839 
you go and you rewind this video you
will<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:28.099> even<00:02:29.099> i<00:02:29.130> zoomed<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.519> there<00:02:29.640> for<00:02:29.819> a

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
will see even i zoomed in there for a

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.790 
will see even i zoomed in there for a
second<00:02:30.209> there<00:02:30.690> was<00:02:30.810> no<00:02:30.989> flashing<00:02:31.380> lights<00:02:31.560> it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
second there was no flashing lights it

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.160 
second there was no flashing lights it
was<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.950> solid<00:02:32.220> ball<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.610> light<00:02:33.180> that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
was a solid ball of light that

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.970 
was a solid ball of light that
disappeared<00:02:34.950> where<00:02:35.640> did<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.849> go<00:02:39.709> where<00:02:40.709> did<00:02:40.890> it

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
disappeared where did it go where did it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.850 
disappeared where did it go where did it
go<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:43.650> not<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.340> out<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.459> focus<00:02:45.860> if

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
go it's not that this is out of focus if

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.910 
go it's not that this is out of focus if
that<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> plane<00:02:47.459> flying<00:02:47.819> away<00:02:48.030> from<00:02:48.150> this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
that was a plane flying away from this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.259 
that was a plane flying away from this
camera<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.280> would<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.519> faded<00:02:50.730> off<00:02:50.970> into<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
camera it would have faded off into the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.340 
camera it would have faded off into the
distance<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:54.000> gone

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.130 

anyways
