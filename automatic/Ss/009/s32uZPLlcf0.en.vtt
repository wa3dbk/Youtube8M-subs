and<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.730> guide<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.149> where<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.420> set

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and kind of a guide to where you set

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.369 
and kind of a guide to where you set
your<00:01:00.750> voltages<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> whatnot<00:01:03.110> but<00:01:04.110> there's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
your voltages up and whatnot but there's

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
your voltages up and whatnot but there's
several<00:01:04.619> different<00:01:05.100> ones<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> memory

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
several different ones in the memory

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.910 
several different ones in the memory
card<00:01:07.939> she's<00:01:08.939> still<00:01:09.150> fully<00:01:09.450> functional<00:01:09.920> has

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
card she's still fully functional has

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.000 
card she's still fully functional has
the<00:01:11.400> three<00:01:11.700> original<00:01:12.180> test<00:01:12.450> leads<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:13.010> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the three original test leads with you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.499 
the three original test leads with you
know<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> alligator<00:01:14.760> clip<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
know the alligator clip and then you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.810 
know the alligator clip and then you
unscrew<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:18.390> has<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.200> UM<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:20.159> pointed

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
unscrew it it has the UM no pointed

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.069 
unscrew it it has the UM no pointed
probe

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
probe

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.190 
probe
so<00:01:23.649> that's<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.369> she's<00:01:25.060> working<00:01:25.359> she<00:01:25.990> works

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
so that's it she's working she works

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.830 
so that's it she's working she works
with<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.469> powerpack<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.210> used<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.600> work<00:01:28.780> with

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
with the powerpack it used to work with

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.919 
with the powerpack it used to work with
the<00:01:29.320> battery<00:01:29.740> alone<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.539> battery

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
the battery alone but the battery

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.990 
the battery alone but the battery
doesn't<00:01:32.320> seem<00:01:32.679> to<00:01:32.829> be<00:01:32.950> honing<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.700> charge

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
doesn't seem to be honing the charge

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.809 
doesn't seem to be honing the charge
very<00:01:34.329> long<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.920> works<00:01:36.159> fine<00:01:36.399> with<00:01:36.670> the

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
very long so it works fine with the

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.940 
very long so it works fine with the
plugged<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.479> at<00:01:37.630> all<00:01:37.750> if<00:01:38.109> you<00:01:38.289> want<00:01:38.469> to<00:01:38.590> use<00:01:38.799> it

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
plugged in at all if you want to use it

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.520 
plugged in at all if you want to use it
remotely<00:01:39.310> without<00:01:39.819> the<00:01:40.179> cord<00:01:40.659> you'll

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
remotely without the cord you'll

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.959 
remotely without the cord you'll
probably<00:01:41.799> need<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:42.219> get<00:01:42.369> yourself<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.819> new

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
probably need to get yourself a new

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.730 
probably need to get yourself a new
