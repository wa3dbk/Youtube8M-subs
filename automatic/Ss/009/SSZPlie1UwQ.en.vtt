what<00:00:35.969> were<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> thinking<00:00:37.250> well<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> needed<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
what were you thinking well I needed to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.400 
what were you thinking well I needed to
change<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:39.840> playing<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.170> little

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
change the way I was playing a little

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.810 
change the way I was playing a little
bit<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.100> felt<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.550> was<00:00:41.670> hitting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
bit because I felt like I was hitting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.520 
bit because I felt like I was hitting
the<00:00:41.940> ball<00:00:42.149> pretty<00:00:42.329> well<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.840> maybe<00:00:43.170> trying<00:00:43.469> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the ball pretty well but maybe trying to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
the ball pretty well but maybe trying to
do<00:00:43.680> too<00:00:43.860> much<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.309> wasn't<00:00:44.579> using<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
do too much it wasn't using the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.360 
do too much it wasn't using the
conditions<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> my<00:00:46.140> advantage<00:00:46.800> sometimes

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
conditions to my advantage sometimes

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.880 
conditions to my advantage sometimes
when<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:47.910> breezy<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> core<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.649> need<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
when it's breezy on the core you need to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.410 
when it's breezy on the core you need to
give<00:00:50.039> yourself<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.399> bit<00:00:50.550> more<00:00:50.670> margin

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
give yourself a bit more margin

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.180 
give yourself a bit more margin
sometimes<00:00:51.809> players<00:00:52.050> some<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.440> topspin<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
sometimes players some more topspin and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
sometimes players some more topspin and
not<00:00:53.520> aim<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.879> closer<00:00:54.270> lying<00:00:54.480> because

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
not aim so closer lying because

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
not aim so closer lying because
obviously<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.320> one's<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> move<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
obviously the one's going to move the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.049 
obviously the one's going to move the
ball<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.730> bit<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.590> when<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> did<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.059> started

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
ball a bit and when I did that started

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.729 
ball a bit and when I did that started
to<00:01:00.120> play<00:01:00.300> much<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:00.989> better<00:01:01.199> i<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:01.440> able<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
to play much much better i was able to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.619 
to play much much better i was able to
dictate<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.489> rallies<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> i<00:01:03.329> was

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
important and what about the speed to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.770 
important and what about the speed to
the<00:01:05.280> court<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.760> changes<00:01:06.150> every<00:01:06.360> year<00:01:06.390> but

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the court and I changes every year but

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.469 
the court and I changes every year but
what<00:01:06.869> about<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> year<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:08.060> mean<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.450> that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
what about this year I mean was that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
what about this year I mean was that
they<00:01:09.990> might<00:01:10.110> break<00:01:10.439> should<00:01:10.740> suggest<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.490> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
they might break should suggest that it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.340 
they might break should suggest that it
was<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.390> fairly<00:01:12.750> slow<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.770> high<00:01:14.549> bouncing

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
was is fairly slow but as high bouncing

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.560 
was is fairly slow but as high bouncing
things<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> pretty<00:01:16.740> fair<00:01:17.250> surfaces<00:01:18.030> it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
things is a pretty fair surfaces it's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910 
the clay-court season as well which is
you<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.210> surface<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> takes<00:01:46.079> me<00:01:46.259> normally<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
you know surface it takes me normally a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.969 
you know surface it takes me normally a
bit<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.189> time<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:48.180> used<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.890> know

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
bit of time to get used to you know

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.740 
bit of time to get used to you know
important<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> go<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.759> being<00:01:51.270> matched<00:01:51.450> tight

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
important to go and being matched tight

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.410 
important to go and being matched tight
so<00:01:52.049> rather<00:01:52.710> than<00:01:52.950> having<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:54.000> matches

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
so rather than having to get matches

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.270 
so rather than having to get matches
under<00:01:54.600> my<00:01:54.810> belt<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.229> also<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.860> used<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.219> the
