2.5<00:01:06.000> k<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> moment<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:08.189> experience

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
2.5 k at the moment but in my experience

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
2.5 k at the moment but in my experience
these<00:01:08.939> lot<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.270> players<00:01:09.420> grow<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:09.930> five

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
these lot of players grow to about five

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.600 
these lot of players grow to about five
thousand<00:01:10.950> coins<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.490> he's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
thousand coins just because he's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.429 
thousand coins just because he's
brazilian<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.330> he<00:01:12.390> has<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.960> pace<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
brazilian and he has a for pace and a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.230 
brazilian and he has a for pace and a
dribbling<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.010> people<00:01:14.700> might<00:01:14.850> want<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> buy

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
dribbling and people might want to buy

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
dribbling and people might want to buy
them<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.220> they<00:01:17.369> might<00:01:17.490> want<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> get

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
them but you know they might want to get

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.550 
them but you know they might want to get
like<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> very<00:01:18.630> fast<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.170> back<00:01:19.350> but

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
like you know a very fast right back but

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.340 
like you know a very fast right back but
they<00:01:19.650> probably<00:01:19.860> can't<00:01:20.130> afford<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.580> people

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
they probably can't afford like people

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
they probably can't afford like people
sort<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.650> Cecilia<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.909> think

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
sort of you know Cecilia because I think

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340 
sort of you know Cecilia because I think
so<00:01:24.299> senior<00:01:24.600> will<00:01:24.689> probably<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.290> like

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
so senior will probably going for like

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.780 
so senior will probably going for like
20k<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:25.860> something<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> game

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
20k or something like that when the game
