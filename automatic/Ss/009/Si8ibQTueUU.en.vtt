 hello everyone and everyone welcome to a 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.880
 new techno android video in this new 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.480
 video I will show you a new room 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:19.250
 I found for the samsung galaxy 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:21.949
 7 s5830 imc I repeat 5,832 does not apply to the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.619
 l nor version for version 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.650
 normal without lyrics well let's go there 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.890
 today I'm not going to teach you how to install 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.470
 since we all know that it is very simple 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.070
 we just have to turn off the phone if 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.989
 good if our mobile belongs to 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.620
 versions that I said we have to 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.890
 turn off our mobile as I said 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 we press 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.430
 a start button volume button in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.489
 up and power at the same time we enter the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.440
 recovery mode and from there we will proceed to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.370
 install is room but before this 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.380
 we have to download these two files 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 that I am going to teach you now 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.090
 and then I was explaining to you all 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.539
 ways on my channel there is another video of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.770
 another rom for this terminal that 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.770
 I explain step by step 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.429
 not in this way but teaching the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.859
 mobile and such and where if you have any 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.570
 problem you can go to that video that you 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:28.260
 I will leave in the description and 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.260
 and good 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.390
 and good 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.729
 as I said 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.250
 I'm going to show you the files that you 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.979
 you have to download it well, I already 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.110
 I have here as you are seeing one of 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.180
 they are the word club more 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.970
 who knows what serves to enter 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.430
 recovery mode and making them waves 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.420
 cache like 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.479
 like darwin and 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.790
 the partition and on the other hand good 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.820
 they do not have the mystery either, I'm going to leave 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.170
 the link in the description to download 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.750
 this and nothing we are going to download here 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.910
 enter this already directly and yerbal 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.870
 cancel will be downloaded and on the other 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.740
 side we have the rom that simulates 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.030
 totally the 7 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.690
 surprisingly it is sharing I return to 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.170
 repeat the 12th and well here also has 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.850
 wrote great mystery continues to be him 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.850
 good dais this is advertising 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.890
 good 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.150
 as I said if I already have the link 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:46.290
 since a while ago but it is going to 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.290
 give a start 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.260
 it takes 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.709
 because I have the link to the page 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.709
 a while 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.340
 and now yes 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.340
 you give to guided to the side without having yes 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.540
 good more publicity a lot of poverty 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.269
 everywhere you go back to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.790
 and that's it and it's downloading there as 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.280
 you can see in 43 minutes depends on 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.510
 connection that you have has been downloaded 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.980
 once done this connects is your 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.040
 samsung galaxy gates 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.620
 and it makes me to our pc 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.890
 and you commit these two files that we 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.099
 have downloaded what you put at the root of the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.140
 sd card once done this we turn off 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.180
 our terminal and ume said before 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.120
 press start button 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.340
 I've been through this thinking many times 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:54.650
 a start button volume up and power 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.170
 enter there you will enter it 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.040
 I can not teach it to you since not as I have 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.040
 said in 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.300
 another video of mine that she was not going to upload 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.310
 many videos of the galaxy and because 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.100
 I have another terminal but good 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.750
 I will try to upload roms that I think this 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.820
 is what we like the most for all 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.130
 to customize the mobile no you do not 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.130
 always in the same good way with what 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.410
 what would it be like when you go into mother recovery 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.880
 but everything I'm saying I've 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.760
 done to our video of mine and you can 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.450
 see with the mobile and everything 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.300
 you enter in recovery and you give facts and 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.360
 from ricart you give cord clockwork mont 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.970
 and it will open another recovery but it is the cro 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.260
 work mod and do what waves I'm going 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.540
 to leave in the description and nothing after 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.920
 install is the room when it's finished 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.920
 install reboot and 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.580
 restart and you're done and little more 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.800
 you are going to check the appearance 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.680
 of the rom how is it going to go I 've tried it 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.900
 in a while but good I decided 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.880
 to make the video now I tried it 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.460
 time and it's pretty fluid and I have not 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.390
 having problems so this is all 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:15.110
 for today do not forget to subscribe 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.740
