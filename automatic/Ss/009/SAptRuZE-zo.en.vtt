00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.120 
I think if he did play his Vantage he
probably<00:02:50.690> would've<00:02:51.170> given<00:02:51.350> Beasley<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
probably would've given Beasley the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.520 
probably would've given Beasley the
second<00:02:52.460> yellow<00:02:52.580> card<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.540> say<00:02:53.720> cat5<00:02:54.350> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
second yellow card and to say cat5 the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.680 
second yellow card and to say cat5 the
loose<00:02:54.710> ball<00:02:54.950> comes<00:02:55.340> back

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
loose ball comes back

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.030 
loose ball comes back
let's<00:02:57.260> shake<00:02:57.530> away

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.390

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
that was that was a better chance than

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.789 
that was that was a better chance than
the<00:03:19.700> one<00:03:19.849> previous

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799
