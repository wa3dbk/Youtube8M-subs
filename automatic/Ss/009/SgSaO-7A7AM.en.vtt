00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.750
 d 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.750
 Y 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 well first I tell them we have to 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.460
 make the clippers after making them 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.430
 weaver partition to our sd and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 telling them that when participating the sd 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.100
 will erase everything we have in the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.390
 I was recommended to make a copy of your 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.210
 this idea to the pc and already do the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.059
 good partition to do the partition 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.670
 let's go love recovery as if where 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.730
 arrives at the advanced option 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.160
 and then we're going to measure partitions from 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.530
 kart 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.560
 then there you choose how much 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.210
 they want to press their partition PC 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:57.379
 of partitions of 512 mb good and then 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.090
 of having done that they are going to download these 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.310
 applications go to some alpha 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.860
 is a single application in the first an alpha 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.900
 and a zip file that will leave you in the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.760
 description of this state 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.320
 this is here this 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.409
 and good we go 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.780
 as the first 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.350
 what we have to do is go to the link 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.350
 where that of 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 and we enter the cute ccd and disappear 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.200
 something like that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.470
 and you give juliaca lluis and 512 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.180
 mb from there but if you do not give it 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 something like this 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.950
 they look for the way he is from 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.100
 any of these three good and one 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.500
 Once they have done, they accept it and they 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.530
 say that they restart your device and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.600
 let's start it once rebooted go 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.190
 to go to the in the app first 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.730
 malfa good say tops look 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.970
 where you say universal inc are going to act 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.630
 what is here, I am going to charge you and go 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.670
 to say yes they are going to start in the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.790
 device to the loom in jerry boat 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.560
 and after that it has restarted returning to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.830
 the same application slide low 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.270
 universal and then down to the last and 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.940
 check if everything'm ready and then we 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.870
 of having done that but the only thing that 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.340
 is is going to recovery 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.340
 I call you recovery 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.550
 and we wait a while 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.720
 and I tell them that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.610
 the credits are for a friend who in the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.200

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.390
 ready already there do not we in a reduced 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.640
 finished they do not go to mod 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:45.630
 woods and export 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:50.010

 the truth 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.349
 it's time to have internal memory 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.599
 and good 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.740

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:55.430
 everything we have to go to settings apps and 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.430
