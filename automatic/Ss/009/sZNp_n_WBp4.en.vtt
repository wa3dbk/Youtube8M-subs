00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.520 
rolling away so all of our combat
designed<00:01:41.010> to<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.160> fast<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.700> fluid<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:43.500> can

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
designed to be fast and fluid you can

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.040 
designed to be fast and fluid you can
switch<00:01:43.920> between<00:01:44.070> melee<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> ranged<00:01:45.050> the

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
switch between melee and ranged the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:02:03.749 
switch between melee and ranged the
press<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.500> button

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.580 

so<00:02:04.759> up<00:02:04.880> here<00:02:04.909> we<00:02:05.090> see<00:02:05.359> we<00:02:05.479> have<00:02:05.659> a<00:02:05.689> range<00:02:06.439> an

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
so up here we see we have a range an

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.990 
so up here we see we have a range an
opportunity<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.009> our<00:02:07.130> bigger<00:02:07.340> range<00:02:07.609> enemies

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
opportunity of our bigger range enemies

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
there's a fury meter so theory is one of
