you might you guys may think that this
is<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.300> best<00:00:39.450> gun<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> game<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> all

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
is the best gun in the game but it all

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
is the best gun in the game but it all
comes<00:00:41.070> down<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.550> play<00:00:41.760> style<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
stuff like that I'll get into explaining

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.690 
stuff like that I'll get into explaining
that<00:00:45.200> but<00:00:46.200> yeah<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.550> just

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that but yeah it's just like it's just

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.020 
that but yeah it's just like it's just
like<00:00:48.680> kind<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.829> everyone<00:00:50.370> has<00:00:50.789> their<00:00:51.000> own

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
like kind of like everyone has their own

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.290 
like kind of like everyone has their own
opinion<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.840> said<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:53.129> m16<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
opinion like I said but the m16 it's it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.540 
opinion like I said but the m16 it's it
shoots<00:00:54.539> pretty<00:00:54.809> slow<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.160> it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
shoots pretty slow and it's it's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
shoots pretty slow and it's it's
actually<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.840> think<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
actually you know it I think it's a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
actually you know it I think it's a
little<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.829> weaker<00:00:59.160> than<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> then<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> type

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
little bit weaker than the then the type

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.270 
little bit weaker than the then the type
95<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.230> haven't<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:01.770> looked<00:01:01.859> at<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> stats

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
95 I haven't really looked at the stats

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
95 I haven't really looked at the stats
or<00:01:02.489> anything<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> definitely<00:01:03.270> shoots

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
or anything but it definitely shoots

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.660 
or anything but it definitely shoots
slower<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> little<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.220> weaker<00:01:05.489> from

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
slower and it's a little bit weaker from

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.310 
slower and it's a little bit weaker from
what<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.540> more<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.140> hit

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
what I see I get a lot more you know hit

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.539 
what I see I get a lot more you know hit
markers<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.770> stuff<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.369> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
markers and stuff like that but that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
markers and stuff like that but that
just<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.090> might<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.720> me<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> think<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
just that might just be me I think the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.640 
just that might just be me I think the
type<00:01:11.010> 95<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.700> actually<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> 22<00:01:12.720> bullet<00:01:13.170> kill<00:01:13.409> up

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
type 95 is actually a 22 bullet kill up

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.609 
type 95 is actually a 22 bullet kill up
at<00:01:13.920> close<00:01:14.430> range<00:01:14.729> while<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> m16<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.439> think

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
at close range while the m16 I think

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.179 
at close range while the m16 I think
it's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> full<00:01:17.070> full<00:01:17.580> burst<00:01:18.330> kill<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:20.009> not

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it's a full full burst kill so I'm not

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
it's a full full burst kill so I'm not
quite<00:01:20.400> sure<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.700> i<00:01:20.790> said<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.200> anyway<00:01:22.200> guys

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
duty's up to this point but most of them

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.080 
duty's up to this point but most of them
actually<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.040> like<00:01:35.040> i<00:01:35.159> said<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.000> know

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
actually but like i said this you know

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.789 
actually but like i said this you know
there's<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.750> reason<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.409> use<00:01:37.619> this

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
there's not really a reason to use this

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.980 
there's not really a reason to use this
gun<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> type<00:01:38.729> 95<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.960> i

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
gun if you have the type 95 but i

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
gun if you have the type 95 but i
haven't<00:01:40.470> unlocked<00:01:40.829> rapid<00:01:41.369> fire<00:01:41.520> yet<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:41.970> this

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
haven't unlocked rapid fire yet for this

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.810 
haven't unlocked rapid fire yet for this
for<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.630> m16<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.590> basically<00:01:44.579> what<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
for this m16 and basically what that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
for this m16 and basically what that
does<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.140> allows<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
does is you know you know allows you to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.289 
does is you know you know allows you to
shoot<00:01:46.770> faster<00:01:47.280> between<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> burst<00:01:48.000> there's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
shoot faster between the burst there's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.520 
shoot faster between the burst there's
less<00:01:48.479> time<00:01:48.720> between<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.140> verse<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> i

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
less time between the verse and i

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.749 
less time between the verse and i
actually<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.100> will<00:01:50.310> probably<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
actually think that will probably be a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.300 
actually think that will probably be a
good<00:01:50.880> attachment<00:01:51.439> for<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.740> i<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.890> unlock

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
good attachment for this one i do unlock

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.240 
good attachment for this one i do unlock
it<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.149> i<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.810> unlock<00:01:55.200> rapid<00:01:55.590> fire<00:01:55.740> i<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:56.070> use

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it and i do unlock rapid fire i will use

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.359 
it and i do unlock rapid fire i will use
it<00:01:56.399> probably<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:58.110> basically<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.159> said

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
it probably so and basically like I said

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.010 
it probably so and basically like I said
the<00:01:59.520> m16<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> learn<00:02:00.719> how<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the m16 you just have to learn how to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
the m16 you just have to learn how to
play<00:02:01.229> with<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> m16<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.610> make<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> actually<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
play with the m16 to make it actually a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.749 
play with the m16 to make it actually a
good<00:02:03.630> weapon<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> mean<00:02:05.250> by<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.430> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
good weapon and what I mean by that is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.700 
good weapon and what I mean by that is
how<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.420> can't<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.140> obviously<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.649> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
how you can't this is obviously not a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.580 
how you can't this is obviously not a
rushers<00:02:08.160> weapon<00:02:08.580> whereas<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.780> type<00:02:09.989> 95<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
rushers weapon whereas the type 95 you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.110 
rushers weapon whereas the type 95 you
can<00:02:10.770> get<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.310> closer<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.940> get<00:02:12.270> kind<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.870> gay

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
can get up closer and get kind of gay

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.940 
can get up closer and get kind of gay
close-quarter<00:02:13.569> combat<00:02:13.720> with<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.440> not

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
close-quarter combat with it not

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.979 
close-quarter combat with it not
necessarily<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:15.610> shotgun<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.569> know<00:02:16.690> range

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
necessarily like shotgun you know range

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.330 
necessarily like shotgun you know range
and<00:02:17.200> stuff<00:02:17.379> like<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.159> get<00:02:18.310> up

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
and stuff like that but you can get up

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.880 
and stuff like that but you can get up
closer<00:02:18.670> than<00:02:18.909> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.150> with<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.390> m16<00:02:19.900> because

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
closer than you can with the m16 because

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.009 
closer than you can with the m16 because
the<00:02:21.040> type<00:02:21.190> 95<00:02:21.489> not<00:02:22.000> only<00:02:22.209> shoots<00:02:22.450> faster<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:22.989> I

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
the type 95 not only shoots faster but I

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.420 
the type 95 not only shoots faster but I
think<00:02:23.319> it's<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.500> little<00:02:23.680> bit<00:02:23.830> stronger<00:02:24.040> up<00:02:24.280> at

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
think it's a little bit stronger up at

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.160 
think it's a little bit stronger up at
close<00:02:24.610> range<00:02:24.909> like<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.150> said<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.599> think<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:26.080> a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
close range like I said I think it's a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.960 
close range like I said I think it's a
two<00:02:26.319> bullet<00:02:26.650> kill<00:02:26.799> while<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.159> m16<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.790> still<00:02:27.940> a

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
two bullet kill while the m16 is still a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.140 
two bullet kill while the m16 is still a
full<00:02:28.269> burst<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:30.579> actually<00:02:30.970> just

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
full burst so it's it's actually just

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.569 
full burst so it's it's actually just
your<00:02:31.299> preference<00:02:31.720> guys<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:32.560> i<00:02:32.680> said<00:02:32.920> this

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
your preference guys like i said this

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.309 
your preference guys like i said this
gun<00:02:33.849> I<00:02:34.090> as<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.659> see<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:34.959> game<00:02:35.140> play

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
gun I as you can see in this game play

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.569 
gun I as you can see in this game play
you'll<00:02:35.470> see<00:02:35.620> coming<00:02:35.860> up<00:02:35.950> here<00:02:36.099> at<00:02:36.190> towards<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
you'll see coming up here at towards the

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.589 
you'll see coming up here at towards the
end<00:02:36.730> when<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:36.909> was<00:02:37.060> trying<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.360> get<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
end when I was trying to get the

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.229 
end when I was trying to get the
juggernaut<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:39.310> playing<00:02:39.549> at<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> long-range

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
juggernaut I was playing at a long-range

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.780 
juggernaut I was playing at a long-range
battle<00:02:40.780> kinda<00:02:41.079> I<00:02:41.110> was<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.459> sitting<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.700> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
battle kinda I was just sitting in the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.940 
battle kinda I was just sitting in the
back<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.150> map<00:02:43.299> trying<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.750> trying<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.739> pick

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
back of the map trying to trying to pick

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.199 
back of the map trying to trying to pick
off<00:02:45.069> people<00:02:45.370> out<00:02:45.459> at<00:02:45.519> long<00:02:45.730> range<00:02:46.000> and

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
off people out at long range and

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.250 
off people out at long range and
obviously<00:02:46.510> that's<00:02:46.660> what<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.930> want<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.109> do

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
obviously that's what you want to do

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.319 
obviously that's what you want to do
when<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.620> guns<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.099> this<00:02:48.280> with<00:02:49.239> the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
when you have guns like this with the

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.990 
when you have guns like this with the
m16<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:49.989> obviously<00:02:50.349> a<00:02:50.440> high<00:02:50.650> damage<00:02:51.000> it's

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
m16 it's obviously a high damage it's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.150 
m16 it's obviously a high damage it's
actually<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.629> really<00:02:53.200> high<00:02:53.349> damage<00:02:53.620> if<00:02:53.859> you<00:02:53.890> can

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
actually a really high damage if you can

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.849 
actually a really high damage if you can
hit<00:02:54.250> all<00:02:54.310> three<00:02:54.609> bullets<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.180> burst<00:02:55.390> but

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
hit all three bullets of the burst but

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.470 
hit all three bullets of the burst but
it<00:02:56.859> does<00:02:57.069> its<00:02:57.250> damage<00:02:57.609> at<00:02:57.760> long<00:02:57.940> range<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.390> I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
it does its damage at long range like I

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.729 
it does its damage at long range like I
said<00:02:58.690> it's<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.170> close-range

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
said it's not really a close-range

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.830 
said it's not really a close-range
weapon<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:01.090> know<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.239> don't<00:03:01.420> really<00:03:01.510> see

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
weapon and you know you don't really see

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.509

people using this weapon a lot but if

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.449 
people using this weapon a lot but if
you<00:03:03.640> do<00:03:03.790> it's<00:03:04.000> definitely<00:03:04.480> at<00:03:04.599> long<00:03:04.810> range

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459

like that but like i said if you're
going<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.000> use<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.329> probably<00:03:19.660> one<00:03:19.840> tip<00:03:20.049> would

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
going to use this probably one tip would

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.080 
going to use this probably one tip would
be<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.410> use<00:03:20.620> rapid<00:03:20.980> fire<00:03:21.160> like<00:03:21.790> i<00:03:21.910> said<00:03:21.970> i

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
be to use rapid fire like i said i

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.400

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.740 
haven't unlocked that one yet but i

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
probably will use it on this weapon when

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.150 
probably will use it on this weapon when
I'm<00:03:25.780> unlocking<00:03:26.290> challenges<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:26.889> stuff<00:03:27.040> like

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
to wrap it up it's definitely a

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.170

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
kind of playing a little bit more

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.259 
kind of playing a little bit more
defensively<00:03:41.859> towards<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> long-range<00:03:42.910> side

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
defensively towards the long-range side

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.900 
defensively towards the long-range side
of<00:03:43.480> battles<00:03:44.230> then<00:03:45.099> definitely<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:45.639> is<00:03:45.819> the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
of battles then definitely this is the

the worst one of the worst weapons in
the<00:03:49.599> game<00:03:49.629> in<00:03:49.959> last<00:03:50.079> video<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.430> actually

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
the game in last video but it actually

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.970

from those tips that I just gave you so
I<00:04:19.720> think<00:04:20.229> here<00:04:20.590> i'm<00:04:20.709> using<00:04:20.739> hardline<00:04:21.630> which

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
I think here i'm using hardline which

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.560 
I think here i'm using hardline which
obviously<00:04:23.409> gives<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.979> hardline<00:04:24.640> pro<00:04:24.789> which

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
obviously gives you hardline pro which

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.770 
obviously gives you hardline pro which
gives<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.020> two<00:04:26.320> assists

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
gives you two assists

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.360 
gives you two assists
every<00:04:26.990> two<00:04:27.110> assists<00:04:27.440> counts<00:04:27.860> as<00:04:27.950> one<00:04:28.100> kill

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
every two assists counts as one kill

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.000 
every two assists counts as one kill

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
across the map and kind of put myself in

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.659 
across the map and kind of put myself in
danger<00:05:23.120> what<00:05:23.330> I'd<00:05:23.450> like<00:05:23.870> to<00:05:23.930> do<00:05:24.169> with<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.669> m16

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
guy and then I look I look around on the

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.140 
guy and then I look I look around on the
map<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:30.950> if<00:05:31.040> my<00:05:31.190> teammates<00:05:31.550> are<00:05:31.700> near<00:05:31.940> where<00:05:32.120> I

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
I'm just going to let my teammates get

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.050 
I'm just going to let my teammates get
the<00:05:50.080> pic<00:05:51.080> pick<00:05:51.410> it<00:05:51.530> up<00:05:51.650> you<00:05:52.610> still<00:05:52.880> get<00:05:53.030> the

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
the pic pick it up you still get the

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.279 
the pic pick it up you still get the
point<00:05:53.330> it's<00:05:53.570> not<00:05:53.630> like<00:05:53.870> they<00:05:54.020> steal<00:05:54.260> your

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
point it's not like they steal your

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.380 
point it's not like they steal your
points<00:05:54.710> or<00:05:54.800> anything<00:05:55.130> and<00:05:55.370> also<00:05:55.789> they<00:05:56.120> get<00:05:56.270> the

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
points or anything and also they get the

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.500 
points or anything and also they get the
point<00:05:56.510> so<00:05:56.780> it<00:05:56.900> helps<00:05:57.080> them<00:05:57.229> level<00:05:57.530> up<00:05:57.650> i<00:05:57.770> guess

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
point so it helps them level up i guess
