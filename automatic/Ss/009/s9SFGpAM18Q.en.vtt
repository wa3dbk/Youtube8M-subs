okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.949> then<00:00:02.129> i<00:00:02.429> guess<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:02.939> triple<00:00:03.240> threat

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480

match<00:00:03.510> they've<00:00:04.110> really<00:00:04.140> been<00:00:04.650> building<00:00:05.009> up<00:00:05.100> to

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
match they've really been building up to

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.110 
match they've really been building up to
be<00:00:05.460> one<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.819> more<00:00:07.220> I'd<00:00:08.220> say<00:00:08.460> better<00:00:08.730> built

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
be one of the more I'd say better built

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.270 
be one of the more I'd say better built

otherwise ww does their own ww thing

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.010 
otherwise ww does their own ww thing
where<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.330> know<00:00:21.600> back<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.960> forth

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
where it's like you know back and forth

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.390 
where it's like you know back and forth
back<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.380> forth<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:22.830> we'd<00:00:22.949> win<00:00:23.160> Brock's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
back and forth but we'd win Brock's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400 
back and forth but we'd win Brock's
there<00:00:23.670> there's<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> special<00:00:24.720> field<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> all<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
there there's a special field to all the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.960 
there there's a special field to all the
matches<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.070> don't<00:00:26.279> see<00:00:26.580> him<00:00:26.820> all

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
matches because you don't see him all

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.130 
matches because you don't see him all
that<00:00:27.119> much<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
that much and I think that's one of the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.769 
that much and I think that's one of the
charms<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.650> having<00:00:29.310> him<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:29.609> champion<00:00:30.090> you

know it's a big deal when he's on the
card<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> big<00:00:32.790> deal<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:32.969> he

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210

obvious<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.360> Brock's<00:00:55.260> winning<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.800> they're

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
obvious that Brock's winning and they're

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.170 
obvious that Brock's winning and they're
gonna<00:00:55.949> go<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.399> their<00:00:56.550> original<00:00:56.640> plans

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
having brought vs roman reigns doesn't

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
having brought vs roman reigns doesn't
mean<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.550> something<00:01:03.030> could

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.800 
Cena's just the oddball out this is
really<00:01:44.159> between<00:01:44.430> Seth<00:01:45.030> Rollins<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.630> Brock

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
really between Seth Rollins and Brock

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.330 
really between Seth Rollins and Brock
Lesnar<00:01:46.020> scene<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.530> really<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> third<00:01:47.130> guy

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
Lesnar scene is really that third guy

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.880 
Lesnar scene is really that third guy
he's<00:01:47.579> already<00:01:47.759> lost<00:01:48.000> twice<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> Lesnar<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
he's already lost twice to Lesnar and I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.319 
he's already lost twice to Lesnar and I
think<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.399> Seth<00:01:50.579> Rollins<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> misc

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
think now with Seth Rollins in the misc

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.319 
think now with Seth Rollins in the misc
and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> mix<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.430> opens<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.149> lot

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and then the mix it really opens a lot

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.600 
and then the mix it really opens a lot
of<00:01:54.360> doors<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> other<00:01:54.960> things<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of doors to other things you can do and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.660 
of doors to other things you can do and
I'm<00:01:57.329> looking<00:01:57.600> forward<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.380> uh<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.520> me

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
I'm looking forward to it it's uh to me

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
I'm looking forward to it it's uh to me
I<00:01:59.700> although<00:02:00.270> though<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I although though that's a that's a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.219 
I although though that's a that's a
scenario<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.460> very<00:02:02.729> good<00:02:02.909> one<00:02:02.969> actually<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
scenario a very good one actually at the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.420 
scenario a very good one actually at the
end<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.500> day<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> still<00:02:04.740> think<00:02:05.250> they're

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
could possibly

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.369 
could possibly
the<00:02:13.909> brock<00:02:14.450> lesnar's<00:02:14.900> last<00:02:15.170> match

Rollins curb stomp one two three you

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.369 
Rollins curb stomp one two three you
know<00:02:34.670> technically<00:02:35.150> Brock<00:02:35.480> won<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.720> match<00:02:35.959> but

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
know technically Brock won the match but

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.500 
know technically Brock won the match but
kind<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.340> loses<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> belt<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.120> then<00:02:38.329> you<00:02:38.420> know

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
kind of loses the belt and then you know

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.910 
kind of loses the belt and then you know
put<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:38.870> Roman<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.409> obviously<00:02:39.560> he's

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
put it on Roman because obviously he's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.910 
put it on Roman because obviously he's
not<00:02:39.950> ready<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:41.450> guess<00:02:41.780> but<00:02:42.620> when<00:02:42.799> that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
not ready and I guess but when that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.589 
not ready and I guess but when that
that's<00:02:43.250> being<00:02:43.489> said<00:02:43.730> Brock<00:02:44.030> will<00:02:44.239> never<00:02:44.390> get

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
that's being said Brock will never get

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.569 
that's being said Brock will never get
his<00:02:44.750> revenge<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:45.200> Paul<00:02:45.409> Heyman<00:02:45.739> because<00:02:45.950> if<00:02:46.459> he

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
his revenge on Paul Heyman because if he

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.280 
his revenge on Paul Heyman because if he
didn't<00:02:46.819> sign<00:02:46.879> a<00:02:46.940> contract<00:02:47.180> he's<00:02:47.690> not<00:02:48.019> going<00:02:48.230> to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
didn't sign a contract he's not going to
