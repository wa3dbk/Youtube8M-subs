00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 now I am temperatures at fashion level 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.299
 the intermediates or of soul and we are in 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.160
 the beach grand touring bento del h 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.750
 volcano sheet already in the minus position 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 50 45 to speak with stock and give us 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.220
 an emission 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 welcome elegant volcano to your 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.400
 responsible for the supply if 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.900
 you want to try the different menus that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.730
 we have prepared in your honor of alvarado 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.930
 Long life and prosperity talk to you without 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.670
 wheels and ask me shows for the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 investigation your request has been 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.040
 denied I do not have any 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.330
 responsibility of the last 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.250
 events that affect the good 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 operation of the park and myself 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.540
 I'm in a muddy after the theft of the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.070
 reservation of plans relying on a sample 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.870
 intended for pretty analysis 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.910
 debatable would be entirely inappropriate 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.610
 for putting him to find controversy to change 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.010
 of the coloration of stock your proposition 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.510
 it is illogical we do not find full to yes 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.979
 as we manufacture it by mixing 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 numerous ingredients I doubt very much that 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.790
 're qualified for operation 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.750
 such a spread control the irritation 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.540
 and go 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.030
 his obstinacy is fascinating very well 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.470
 an unexpected proposition in the absence of 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.850
 relevant will have the merit of making me 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.199
 gain time first of all 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.660
 try three kinds of salts 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.190
 different the crystals of the different 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.470
 minerals you can get us in the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.090
 Islet with no name gets the amount 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.310
 necessary and then graduates according to 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.270
 standards to get the powder then bring 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.429
 veil go get salt crystals 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.539
 we see that it gives us a new vision 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.539
 lack of salt 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.020
 this is a catastrophe in the reserve of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.640
 lead almost we have left you have to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.289
 find three different types of salts 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.750
 and mixed to get the preparation 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.520
 of this special local can even that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.500
 this that shows you the sample you need 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.810
 for your research find 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.659
 crystals of salt crystals of 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.250
 salt or funk and salt crystals culitis la 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.590
 reward three million two hundred 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.450
 fifty thousand experience points for 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.509
 start we come to the forest for the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.580
 position minus 49 36 to talk to 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.740
 ander peter a range 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.180
 what it tells us to disembark towards the islet 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.760
 without a name, then we sneak in 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.590
 and we appear in the position minus 47 33 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.590
 we go down towards the little beach 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.470
 and there is something here to click 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.470
 we have got salt crystals 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.800
 let's also click on that we have two 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.930
 followed crystals of salt or funk and there to 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.670
 the right there is also another piece and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.770
 we have got health crystals 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.440
 publicis well good vision updated 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.160
 it needs salt now we have to do 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.250
 use the salt crusher that is 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.310
 in the position minus 44 44 we go for 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.310
 there 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.689
 to get out of the islet we climb towards 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.170
 up and we talk again with 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.239
 the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.239
 raÃºl mobs and we snuck 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.819
 we are already in the position of about 46 44 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.500
 you have to talk to the other round box 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.500
 to go to the sharp bar 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.820
 and we see that here 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.620
 is where the salt crusher is 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.120
 says the crusher is blocked 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.120
 but the mission has been updated 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:25.840
 and asks us to go back to see stock at 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.790
 the position minus 50 minus 45 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.790
 we left the bar I went 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.610
 in the position minus 50 to 45 we see 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.690
 stock 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.010
 and explain that the shredder stops 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.840
 be broken I'm not an engineer 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.970
 crushers and I can not help you 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.190
 but surely you can ask for advice 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.930
 of the first stack he has knowledge 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.470
 in the matter you can find the beach 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.410
 of the table because we see that the mission is 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.140
 has updated and you will see stack that 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.360
 located at -55 43 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.730
 come, let's get closer 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.660
 we are on the beach the table we speak 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.820
 with stack 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.130
 inform you that crushed let 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.380
 Really broke yesterday to repair it 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.299
 one of the teeth was broken stopped 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.190
 use more mathematician in which he should 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.750
 good even if there's no panic 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.150
 unblock the jaw of the disposer 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.250
 it is enough with a tipping of the stripper sees the 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.300
 bar and ask marbella to prepare you 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.860
 one, saying that going on my part 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.930
 So now he says to ask 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.160
 marbella a castell decapante this is 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.700
 found in the position minus 44 40 44 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.190
 inside the sea 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.330
 I come back to speak again for the role move 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.300
 to go to the bar 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.300
 I go inside the bar 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.270
 to see if it 's marbella 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:56.169
 there is talk to her and says hello 

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:57.729
 I serve you something a cool castell 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.799
 here we prepare the drink with cruise 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.449
 fresh taricos of the day I will ask a castell 

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.300
 stripper saying you're coming from 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.949
 of stack 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.020
 agree right now of the prepared 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.729
 giving a few seconds and ready use it 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.949
 sparingly in a ventilated place and 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.919
 especially you do not see it anymore unless 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.680
 you want to make a burial visit 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:20.630
 go we achieved a castell 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:25.080
 stripping the mission is updated 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.320
 and repair the salt crusher is worth 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:33.530
 let's leave the bar I go 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.300
 We click on the shredder and you say see 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.210
 pour the castell into the mouthpiece of the 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.010
 device a sour smoke comes out and will dissipate 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.420
 the air the jaws inside the 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.000
 shredder seems to have 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.820
 unlocked we have lost the castell 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.450
 stripping the mission is updated 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.370
 crush the salt crystals click 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.650
 over the shredder we have lost the 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.440
 salt crystals we have achieved a 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.630
 crushed salt crystal we see that it 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.110
 updates the mission and will see touch 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:07.140
 the position minus 50 45 we're running 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.830
 to give him the crushed crystals we left 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.300
 from the bar 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.180
 I go 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:17.539
 and we come to the stock position in the 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.539
 great tourism beach we talk to him 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.280
 I will show the crystals let's see the size 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.960
 of the fragments is homogeneous and the 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.969
 three saline varieties are present 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.129
 against everything expected it seems that 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.779
 a chance chance has acted 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.699
 in your favor the peoples seem in good 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.889
 been to cause the crystals 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.659
 crushed and the empty jar really 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.129
 you want the sample is very good look 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.069
 for another part I do not have the habit 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:43.270
 Friday in front of tourists 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.270
 admire the Vulcan landscape 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.800
 we have lost the salt crystals 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.800
 crushed 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:07:00.029
 and we see that we fulfill the mission is missing 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:03.789
 come out and we receive the reward 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:06.219
 promised in experience points 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.689
 we continue by volcano and we continue 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:11.219
 exploring the investigating 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:11.219
 having fun until then
