00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Well, today in 2 test transmission 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.370
 us for you next mercedes-benz 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.190
 yes one of the biggest mercedes-benz 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.309
 iv but at the same time one of the most 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.820
 unusual configuration 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.070
 less common 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.130
 representation alas well r350 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.140
 for 6 years now he stands now at about 750 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.029
 thousand rubles and this is one of the most 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.250
 interesting offers on the secondary 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.439
 Krasnoyarsk car market is understandable 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.130
 that the car was in use and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.559
 here on the hood some pieces but 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.020
 the main and conservative design remained 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.000
 plant seems to me not to design rather 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.670
 reminds crossovers and SUVs on 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 advice than any sedans before us 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.930
 variation on the theme of German classics 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 nobly powerfully recognizable but part 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 arrangements this time the creators 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.840
 entrusted us food Mississippi 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.489
 yes yes I will remind you of a brand new one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.710
 something even experimental for 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 mercedes r-class was created in the first 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.739
 turn with a view to the American market 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.570
 It has been produced in America since 2006 in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.869
 a whole reading of old topics turned out 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.600
 successful seems to me the basic concept 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.369
 this car just has to be in 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.799
 excess principle even with two hundred 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.890
 forces he would drive well but not the most 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.280
 weak turbo diesel engine produces 265 liters 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.229
 the most powerful 388 we have under the hood 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.710
 the middle option is you shaped gasoline 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.689
 the six 35th century 270 was and accelerates 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.040
 very energetic hundred with ease 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.170
 chooses for 8 per half second 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.500
 appetite appropriately declared expense in 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.110
 the city 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 16 liters on highway 9 half 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.370
 one feels very much about him 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.360
 extremely smooth ride 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.100
 sure that in general the colossus but he is big 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.540
 on the biggest rushed on which 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.460
 Generally it is serial 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.320
 its wheelbase is somewhat 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.430
 centimeters longer than the wheelbase 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.800
 s-class is very long base therefore 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.090
 seven-speed very smooth box 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.030
 Machine with the design is here it is mercedes 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.729
 the beginning of the 21st century, everything is recognized all the family 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.250
 everything read hand there moved here 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.960
 box on the steering wheel is certainly unusual 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.510
 story several times once i even 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.840
 accidentally for some reason instead of a turn signal on 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.360
 neutral switch on everything and the janitor and the light 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.980
 brought here by management to this 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.680
 have some time getting used to 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.440
 the amount of adjustment is incredible what 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.440
 in depth that down is the seat that steering 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.240
 so what's the place you can find 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.730
 convenient and r-class created on the platform 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.570
 crossover m. it is equipped with the same 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.700
 four wheel drive 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.290
 a credit of 20 centimeters allows 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.920
 perks easy to ride cross 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.020
 terrain 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.610
 despite the size and weight of mine 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.739
 sensations is the most that neither is 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.320
 passenger car on the steering wheel he reacts 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.570
 Faster clearer with platform 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.430
 it seems to me that even the dynamics 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.650
 in general, how are they dynamic and cool 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.630
 smooth ride it too, this is not 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.790
 refuses that even m-elle is not very sony 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.620
 cmu sense that's even a jeep kai big they 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.800
 go less smoothly because long 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.610
 the base is even lower we sit independent suspension 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.640
 spring 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.560
 2 levers in front, multi-link 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.510
 I will decide two target groups for this car 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.180
 big wealthy 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.950
 in the family and also r-class will successfully cope with 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.079
 role of corporate representation 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.450
 meeting and transfer cars 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:26.610
 guests and business partners on the ball class 6 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.120
 the local will appreciate the convenience of the third row 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.989
 the seats 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.090
 and how long was the unusual proportion 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.459
 salon tunnel is such a natural yacht 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.390
 some kind of long and you are at the top 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.060
 look at the vastness of the 2 largest 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.609
 panoramic glass almost the entire roof 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.549
 well guys here all the same place here 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:50.250
 look i'm standing i'm not just there somehow 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.010
 I crouch and stand, of course, bending over 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.010
 all the same not and the bus is quiet 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.700
 actually go out 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.340
 they are you somehow get out a certain patina 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.440
 americans bones in the back especially in 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.159
 the back of the inside is felt here and there 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.549
 plasma plastic whom you some details 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.290
 such rude and some of them from 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.900
 heavy use even already 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.280
 slightly crack go to resume and 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.650
 so the pros are big powerful all-wheel drive 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.169
 and merciless with great 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.090
 cargo and capacity it is still 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.360
 from the role of a SUV easy to handle and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.949
 the price is only 750 thousand rubles a minus 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.449
 high fuel consumption 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.760
 machine operation will be by 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.800
 mersedesovsky expensive I added among 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.539
 cons still some yet 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.820
 the value of some plastic parts 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.530
 for providing r-class to the test 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.530
 we thank Victor Korotkov
