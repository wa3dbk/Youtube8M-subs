 Caribbean 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.590
 hi how about my name is javier and he is 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.360
 Edgar and we are part of the team 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.980
 caib engineering in this video 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.420
 We will show the proper procedure of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.309
 install the shock absorbers and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.390
 we will point out some important points to 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.520
 take into consideration 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.750
 one of the most common procedures 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.760
 to check the status of the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.290
 shock absorbers is to check if it continues 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.649
 the movement after compressing with 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.649
 hands 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.910
 we should also check the height of the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.039
 vehicle for this the best way to 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.930
 doing it is from the bottom of the ring 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.420
 going through the center to the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.820
 fender it is important to check the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.739
 shock absorber and spring looking for damage 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.739
 symptoms of deterioration or leakage 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.360
 we recommend a visual inspection 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.100
 preventive in all elements of the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.020
 suspension for the purpose of 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.320
 ensure the proper functioning of the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.320
 shock absorbers 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.920
 the most important are springs 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.540
 the stabilizer screw together 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.310
 homocinetics verifying that no 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.780
 present leaks ball joints bushing 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.780
 motor supports and here 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.060
 check the mileage this helps 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.110
 understand the level of wear that 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.030
 they have the pieces 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.770
 a clear symptom of shock absorbers 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.780
 worn can be observed in the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 tires if wear occurs 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.240
 irregular is likely to be due 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.240
 change the shock absorbers 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.120
 the first step to uninstall is the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.070
 disconnect the sensor to bs and the hose 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.870
 of brakes disconnect this hose is 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.180
 important to avoid the risk that 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.070
 Damage or break the screw 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.930
 stabilizer must be disconnected to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.910
 check your status if it is damaged 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.229
 it usually generates a pounding that usually 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.770
 confused with problem of 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.770
 shock absorber 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.980
 Remove the screws and nuts from the 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.230
 Lower clamping should be done with 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.969
 Be careful not to damage the thread if 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.299
 show signs of rust or dirt 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.950
 We recommend lubricating the previously 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.870
 next step is to loosen the screws 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.180
 of the base releasing the set 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.430
 shock absorber and spring 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.040
 Be sure to compress the spring with 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.319
 the right tools remove the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.909
 hired nearby and discard is allowed 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.879
 use the pneumatic gun to 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.590
 loosen the since it will not be reused 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.810
 carefully remove all the pieces of 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.620
 this set 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.620

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.120
 lower spring guide and screw 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.190
 stabilizer remember the order for the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.900
 assembly time follow this 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.760
 procedure allows to review the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.590
 physical state of each element and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.240
 replace it if necessary 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.700
 whenever you buy a shock absorber 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.530
 new caribe the box includes a manual 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.060
 with installation recommendations and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.010
 It can work as a contract 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.050
 guarantee verify the physical state of the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.630
 new shock absorber and purge it for 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.430
 corroborate its proper functioning 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.350
 always use the new counter torque and 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.150
 other elements that are included in the 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.610
 box since these can vary in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.680
 dimensions with the originals go back to 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.420
 place all the elements in the new 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.970
 shock absorber being careful to follow 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.670
 the order of unarmed the inverse guide 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.670
 spring low spring 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.170
 bounce shot 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.750
 dust cover and upper spring guide 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.600
 based on shock absorber 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.240
 and spacer 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.390
 to place it against nut is 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.609
 necessary to recompress the 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.019
 spring check that it is set 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.019
 correctly in your position 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.639
 place the counter nut on the 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.539
 shock absorber can be tightened with 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.539
 hand tool 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.620
 When mounting on the vehicle, tighten the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.510
 nuts from the base with your hand what you 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.750
 will allow greater mobility in the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.700
 bottom to position and tighten 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.980
 place the lower bracket on your 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.840
 position and then place the 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.020
 fixing screws with care of no 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.120
 damage these must enter freely 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.310
 Reattach the stabilizer screw 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.490
 to the shock absorber and the bar 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.490
 stabilizer 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.810
 connect the brake hose again 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.880
 and abs sensor to the shock absorber 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.160
 reconnect the brake line 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.690
 do not forget to purge the to eliminate 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.690
 air bubbles in the system 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.400
 and replace the missing brake fluid 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.510
 place the tires 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.980
 and lower the car the screws 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.800
 of the base and the stem of the shock absorber 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.840
 about they will come out on their own this we 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.830
 will help to tighten correctly avoiding 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.020
 that are loose and generate noise 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.330
 Tighten the nuts on the base and for 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.220
 last the counter nut use a 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.400
 torque meter and tighten according to 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.120
 Original equipment specifications 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.150
 check the height of the vehicle 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.310
 again if this changes revises the 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.220
 order of assembly of the pieces 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.780
 perform the alignment of the tires 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.300
 this must be done whenever 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.650
 change the bases or the shock absorbers and 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.650
 posts or structures 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.960
 recommendations do not use the contra 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.020
 old nut do not use the gun 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.020
 pneumatic to tighten the nut against 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.529
 Do not hold the stem with tweezers use 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.439
 always the right tools 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:32.959
 for safety and comfort 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:35.679
 performance we recommend changing 

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.679
 the four shock absorbers
