this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.280> my<00:00:02.760> second<00:00:03.330> lego<00:00:04.290> automatic

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
this is my second lego automatic

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.970 
this is my second lego automatic
compactor<00:00:05.640> this<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.960> much<00:00:07.200> larger<00:00:07.740> and

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
compactor this one is much larger and

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.690 
compactor this one is much larger and
much<00:00:08.189> more<00:00:08.460> complicated<00:00:09.200> and<00:00:10.340> barely<00:00:11.340> fits<00:00:11.580> on

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
much more complicated and barely fits on

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.490 
much more complicated and barely fits on
my<00:00:11.849> desk<00:00:13.670> and<00:00:14.670> say<00:00:15.030> I'll<00:00:15.360> give<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> 360<00:00:16.020> view

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
my desk and say I'll give you a 360 view

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:31.310 
my desk and say I'll give you a 360 view
a<00:00:21.439> lot<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.650> tubing<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.310> wires<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:29.990> inside

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
a lot of tubing and wires and inside

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.060 
a lot of tubing and wires and inside
that's<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.340> compaction<00:00:32.820> chamber<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:34.530> this

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that's the compaction chamber and this

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.540 
that's the compaction chamber and this
is<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.850> top<00:00:36.120> door<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:37.340> smash<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
is the top door that will smash the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
is the top door that will smash the
material<00:00:39.030> down<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.690> it'll<00:00:39.930> stay<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
material down so it'll stay in the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.090 
material down so it'll stay in the
chamber<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.600> that<00:00:42.600> door<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.260> powered<00:00:43.920> by<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
chamber and that door is powered by a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.569 
chamber and that door is powered by a
pneumatic<00:00:44.610> cylinder<00:00:45.050> which<00:00:46.219> that<00:00:47.219> cylinder

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
pneumatic cylinder which that cylinder

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.889 
pneumatic cylinder which that cylinder
is<00:00:47.760> powered<00:00:48.090> by<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.450> pump<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.079> an<00:00:49.980> air<00:00:50.160> tank

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
is powered by this pump and an air tank

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
is powered by this pump and an air tank
so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.140> pump<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.600> there's<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
so I just pump this up and there's a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.020 
so I just pump this up and there's a
switch<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:56.059> here<00:00:57.800> say<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> when<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.760> down

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
switch right here say so when it's down

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.490 
switch right here say so when it's down
like<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.589> see<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.250> doors<00:01:05.489> down<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.539 

when<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:12.390> lifts<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> I'll<00:01:14.310> show

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
when it's up the lifts up so I'll show

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.530 
when it's up the lifts up so I'll show
you<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.060> door<00:01:16.009> closing<00:01:17.009> action<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.939> down

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.010 

up<00:01:21.540> down

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.010 

now<00:01:25.650> I'll<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.820> slower<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.420> case<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> camera

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
now I'll do it slower in case the camera

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:38.490 
now I'll do it slower in case the camera
to<00:01:28.259> pick<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.220> because<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.670> kind<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.000> fast

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.030 

yeah<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:40.330> first<00:01:40.750> store<00:01:41.110> is<00:01:41.440> powered<00:01:41.860> by<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
yeah the first store is powered by the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.670 
yeah the first store is powered by the
pneumatic<00:01:42.610> cylinder<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.630> two<00:01:46.900> other<00:01:47.230> I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
pneumatic cylinder and the two other I

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.490 
pneumatic cylinder and the two other I
should<00:01:48.130> consider<00:01:48.490> two<00:01:48.640> rams<00:01:48.940> there's<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:50.230> in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
should consider two rams there's one in

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.930 
should consider two rams there's one in
the<00:01:50.770> back<00:01:50.950> there<00:01:50.980> you<00:01:51.250> can<00:01:51.610> say<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.150> there's<00:01:52.960> a

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
the back there you can say and there's a

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.360 
the back there you can say and there's a
second<00:01:54.940> one<00:01:55.060> right<00:01:55.510> there<00:01:55.830> which<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:57.010> one<00:01:57.220> more

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
second one right there which is one more

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.760 
second one right there which is one more
than<00:01:57.430> my<00:01:57.670> previous<00:01:57.940> son<00:01:58.450> automatic<00:01:59.170> compactor

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
than my previous son automatic compactor

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.680 
than my previous son automatic compactor
so<00:02:01.830> both<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.910> rams<00:02:04.150> are<00:02:04.330> powered<00:02:04.660> by

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
so both of the rams are powered by

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.470 
so both of the rams are powered by
linear<00:02:05.110> actuators<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.010> each<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.880> them<00:02:07.090> is

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
linear actuators and each of them is

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.590 
linear actuators and each of them is
powered<00:02:07.990> by<00:02:08.020> an<00:02:08.260> extra<00:02:08.619> large<00:02:08.770> boulder<00:02:10.170> say

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
powered by an extra large boulder say

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.490 
powered by an extra large boulder say
and<00:02:13.600> their<00:02:14.290> toe<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:19.240> I'll<00:02:19.780> give<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.260> view

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
and their toe so I'll give you a view

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.750 
and their toe so I'll give you a view
inside<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.790> first<00:02:22.060> Ram<00:02:22.420> how<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.900> moves

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.160 

it<00:02:30.760> goes<00:02:30.940> further<00:02:31.180> than<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.959> goes

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
it goes further than that it goes

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.860 
it goes further than that it goes
further<00:02:32.440> than<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.860> but<00:02:33.190> all<00:02:33.310> that's<00:02:33.550> all

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
further than that but all that's all

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:44.510 
further than that but all that's all
have<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.050> go<00:02:35.440> out<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.800> now<00:02:36.599> goes<00:02:37.599> back

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:55.710 

I'm<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.670> second<00:02:46.030> RAM<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:49.570> in<00:02:49.870> there

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:05.380 

listen<00:02:56.720> doesn't<00:02:57.050> need<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.290> go<00:02:57.410> out<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:57.740> far<00:02:57.970> so

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.740 

so<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.720> will<00:03:07.170> demonstrate<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.980> now<00:03:08.750> compacting

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
so I will demonstrate it now compacting

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.530 
so I will demonstrate it now compacting
this<00:03:09.960> little<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:11.340> krump<00:03:11.700> both<00:03:11.940> not<00:03:12.180> little

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
this little this krump both not little

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.020 
this little this krump both not little
but<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.930> crumpled<00:03:13.440> up<00:03:13.560> ball<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:14.190> aluminum

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
but this crumpled up ball of aluminum

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:24.370 
but this crumpled up ball of aluminum
foil<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:20.510> pop<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.750> into<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.200> compactor

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
foil so pop it into the compactor

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:37.000 
foil so pop it into the compactor
pressurize<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.790> door

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.300 

yeah

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
won't be able to see the inside because

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.220 
won't be able to see the inside because
others<00:03:48.850> whose<00:03:49.030> door<00:03:49.420> covenant<00:03:49.930> but<00:03:50.020> you'll<00:03:50.200> be

others whose door covenant but you'll be
able<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.560> hear<00:03:50.800> it<00:03:50.890> of<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.670> different<00:03:52.090> motors

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
able to hear it of the different motors

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:03.410 
able to hear it of the different motors
come<00:03:52.690> on<00:04:00.600> alright<00:04:01.600> that's<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.989> first<00:04:02.319> ram<00:04:02.620> now

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
come on alright that's the first ram now

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.590 
come on alright that's the first ram now
the<00:04:04.420> second<00:04:04.870> rap<00:04:05.050> I<00:04:08.880> have<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.030> back<00:04:10.239> up<00:04:10.270> the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
the second rap I have to back up the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.240 
the second rap I have to back up the
first<00:04:10.870> round<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:11.230> little<00:04:11.470> bit<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.890> second

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
first round a little bit so the second

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:27.870 
first round a little bit so the second
one<00:04:12.340> fit

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.640 

just<00:04:28.540> about<00:04:28.810> done

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.800 

all<00:04:34.650> right<00:04:34.830> let's<00:04:35.190> see<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:36.000> finished<00:04:36.210> product

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
all right let's see the finished product

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.770 
all right let's see the finished product
of<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:39.360> big<00:04:39.600> ball<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.620> was<00:04:41.130> in<00:04:41.310> there<00:04:41.780> this

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
of that big ball that was in there this

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.280 
of that big ball that was in there this
is<00:04:43.170> what<00:04:43.380> came<00:04:43.560> out<00:04:44.600> nice<00:04:47.420> compact<00:04:48.420> cube<00:04:49.020> of

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
is what came out nice compact cube of

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:58.070 
is what came out nice compact cube of
foil<00:04:54.080> say<00:04:55.490> lot<00:04:56.490> smaller<00:04:57.000> than<00:04:57.480> its<00:04:57.630> original

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
foil say lot smaller than its original

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.450 
foil say lot smaller than its original
size<00:05:00.320> all<00:05:01.320> right<00:05:01.470> now<00:05:01.650> I'll<00:05:01.980> show<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.280> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
size all right now I'll show you the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.170 
size all right now I'll show you the
compacting<00:05:03.270> process<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:04.920> I'm<00:05:05.520> gonna<00:05:05.730> be<00:05:05.940> using

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
compacting process so I'm gonna be using

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.630 
compacting process so I'm gonna be using
the<00:05:06.480> Bale<00:05:06.690> for<00:05:07.020> demonstration<00:05:07.740> because<00:05:08.160> it

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
the Bale for demonstration because it

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.630 
the Bale for demonstration because it
fits<00:05:08.940> in<00:05:09.120> there<00:05:09.300> nicely<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:10.560> I'll<00:05:11.220> show<00:05:11.610> you

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
fits in there nicely so I'll show you

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.870 
fits in there nicely so I'll show you
this<00:05:12.060> without<00:05:12.480> closing<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:13.080> top<00:05:13.290> door<00:05:13.760> so<00:05:14.760> the

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
this without closing the top door so the

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.800 
this without closing the top door so the
first<00:05:15.150> Ram<00:05:15.510> say<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.560> saying<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:17.670> this<00:05:18.210> cube

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
first Ram say that saying that this cube

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.950 
first Ram say that saying that this cube
was<00:05:19.170> a<00:05:19.200> regular<00:05:20.100> crumbled<00:05:20.550> up<00:05:20.640> ball<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.750> I'm

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
was a regular crumbled up ball so I'm

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.830 
was a regular crumbled up ball so I'm
not<00:05:22.140> gonna<00:05:22.350> do<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:22.590> because<00:05:22.980> if<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:24.390> wouldn't

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
not gonna do that because if it wouldn't

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.230 
not gonna do that because if it wouldn't
like<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.980> all<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.430> flow<00:05:26.640> would<00:05:26.820> pop<00:05:27.030> out

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
like the all the flow would pop out

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.360 
like the all the flow would pop out
because<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.750> doors<00:05:27.930> not<00:05:28.170> covering<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.680> so

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
because the doors not covering it so

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.820 
because the doors not covering it so
I'll<00:05:29.700> demonstrate<00:05:29.970> it<00:05:30.510> using<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.900> cube<00:05:31.140> so

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
I'll demonstrate it using the cube so

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.220 
I'll demonstrate it using the cube so
the<00:05:31.950> first<00:05:32.220> Ram<00:05:32.580> will<00:05:33.060> push<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.450> forward<00:05:33.840> like

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
the first Ram will push it forward like

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:42.410 
the first Ram will push it forward like
so

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.890 

until<00:05:43.420> it's<00:05:43.570> pretty<00:05:43.810> compact<00:05:44.260> and<00:05:44.770> then<00:05:45.490> I

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
until it's pretty compact and then I

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.260 
until it's pretty compact and then I
might<00:05:46.900> have<00:05:47.020> to<00:05:47.260> move<00:05:48.100> back<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.760> rent<00:05:49.030> this

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
might have to move back the rent this

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.590 
might have to move back the rent this
first<00:05:49.750> Ram<00:05:50.080> a<00:05:50.350> little<00:05:50.860> bit<00:05:51.010> so<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.520> second<00:05:52.390> Ram

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
first Ram a little bit so the second Ram

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.970 
first Ram a little bit so the second Ram
here<00:05:52.870> can<00:05:53.320> fit<00:05:54.150> so<00:05:55.380> I'll<00:05:56.380> move<00:05:56.560> that<00:05:56.620> back<00:05:56.920> a

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
here can fit so I'll move that back a

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.700 
here can fit so I'll move that back a
little<00:05:57.070> bit<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:57.610> then<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:59.110> second<00:05:59.500> ramp

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
little bit and then the second ramp

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.520 
little bit and then the second ramp
comes<00:06:00.040> in<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.940> make<00:06:01.120> it<00:06:01.150> into<00:06:01.510> a<00:06:01.540> make<00:06:02.200> it<00:06:02.320> into

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
comes in to make it into a make it into

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:12.360 
comes in to make it into a make it into
a<00:06:02.560> cube<00:06:07.740> so<00:06:09.060> you<00:06:10.060> can<00:06:10.270> say<00:06:10.540> it<00:06:11.380> makes<00:06:11.680> a<00:06:11.890> shapes

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
a cube so you can say it makes a shapes

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:20.300 
a cube so you can say it makes a shapes
and<00:06:12.610> Ice<00:06:12.730> Cube<00:06:13.030> and<00:06:14.730> why<00:06:15.730> if<00:06:15.880> the<00:06:16.060> dough<00:06:16.240> is

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:29.590 

rewind<00:06:21.310> it

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.800 

and<00:06:30.600> out<00:06:31.380> with<00:06:31.770> hum<00:06:32.100> a<00:06:32.960> nice<00:06:33.960> compacted<00:06:34.770> cube

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
and out with hum a nice compacted cube

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.560 
and out with hum a nice compacted cube
so<00:06:36.810> I'll<00:06:37.020> show<00:06:37.260> you<00:06:37.320> once<00:06:37.770> more<00:06:37.920> of<00:06:38.370> the<00:06:39.090> actual

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
so I'll show you once more of the actual

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:49.920 
so I'll show you once more of the actual
space<00:06:39.990> of<00:06:40.370> how<00:06:41.370> it<00:06:41.790> gets<00:06:42.060> turned<00:06:42.720> into<00:06:42.930> a<00:06:43.050> queue

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.710 

so<00:06:50.800> my<00:06:51.009> first<00:06:51.280> automatic<00:06:51.790> compact<00:06:52.360> I<00:06:52.540> made

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
so my first automatic compact I made

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.530 
so my first automatic compact I made
only<00:06:53.050> had<00:06:53.290> one<00:06:53.620> RAM<00:06:53.919> which<00:06:54.160> was<00:06:54.340> this<00:06:54.580> and<00:06:54.940> the

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
only had one RAM which was this and the

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.460 
only had one RAM which was this and the
top<00:06:55.780> door<00:06:56.190> now<00:06:57.190> it<00:06:57.759> would<00:06:58.060> only<00:06:58.180> compact<00:06:59.050> oil

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
top door now it would only compact oil

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.620 
top door now it would only compact oil
until<00:06:59.800> like<00:06:59.979> a<00:07:00.009> rectangle<00:07:00.759> and<00:07:01.090> I<00:07:01.300> wanted<00:07:01.539> to

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
until like a rectangle and I wanted to

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.100 
until like a rectangle and I wanted to
make<00:07:01.919> oil<00:07:02.919> into<00:07:03.310> a<00:07:03.340> cube<00:07:03.699> so<00:07:04.300> I<00:07:04.630> added<00:07:04.930> the

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
make oil into a cube so I added the

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.240 
make oil into a cube so I added the
second<00:07:05.500> round

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.129 

so<00:07:11.759> and<00:07:12.759> you<00:07:12.880> can<00:07:12.910> see<00:07:13.240> if<00:07:13.360> there<00:07:13.539> is<00:07:13.570> foil<00:07:13.990> in

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
so and you can see if there is foil in

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.350 
so and you can see if there is foil in
there<00:07:14.320> it<00:07:14.919> would<00:07:15.039> shape<00:07:15.340> it<00:07:15.550> into<00:07:15.759> an<00:07:15.940> ice<00:07:16.120> cube

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
there it would shape it into an ice cube

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.920 
there it would shape it into an ice cube
and<00:07:19.860> of<00:07:20.860> course<00:07:21.460> again<00:07:24.180> nor<00:07:25.180> will<00:07:25.360> be<00:07:25.479> down<00:07:25.690> the

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
and of course again nor will be down the

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.950 
and of course again nor will be down the
cover<00:07:26.169> it<00:07:26.350> but<00:07:27.070> showing<00:07:28.060> you<00:07:28.180> how<00:07:28.330> it<00:07:28.479> works

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
cover it but showing you how it works

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.350 
cover it but showing you how it works
keep<00:07:29.380> it<00:07:29.530> up<00:07:30.600> so<00:07:32.639> yeah<00:07:33.639> I<00:07:33.729> think<00:07:34.000> I've<00:07:34.210> pretty

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 
keep it up so yeah I think I've pretty

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.270 
keep it up so yeah I think I've pretty
much<00:07:34.510> covered<00:07:35.020> it<00:07:35.729> that's<00:07:38.010> gonna<00:07:39.010> fit<00:07:39.160> in

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 
much covered it that's gonna fit in
