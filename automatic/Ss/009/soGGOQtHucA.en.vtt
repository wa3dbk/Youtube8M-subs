00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
the quickest and that's where we're

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.830 
the quickest and that's where we're
going<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:52.930> do<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:54.100> Advanced<00:01:54.579> tab<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.090> that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
going to do the Advanced tab and that

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.480 
going to do the Advanced tab and that
way<00:01:55.960> we<00:01:56.110> can<00:01:56.229> also<00:01:56.380> target<00:01:56.799> whichever<00:01:57.280> device

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
way we can also target whichever device

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.450 
way we can also target whichever device
we're<00:01:57.850> trying<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.270> recover<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.020> file<00:01:59.200> from<00:01:59.560> so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
we're trying to recover the file from so

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.370 
we're trying to recover the file from so
in<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.000> case<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.600> can<00:02:01.719> see<00:02:01.899> what<00:02:02.049> we<00:02:02.229> have

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
in this case you can see what we have

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.959 
in this case you can see what we have
all<00:02:02.590> all<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.100> different<00:02:03.430> drives<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:03.909> are

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
all all the different drives that are

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.109 
all all the different drives that are
hooked<00:02:04.180> up<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:05.590> computer<00:02:06.039> are<00:02:06.189> attached

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
hooked up to this computer are attached

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.719 
hooked up to this computer are attached
right<00:02:07.299> here<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:08.320> you<00:02:09.100> know<00:02:09.190> what<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.340> would<00:02:09.550> do

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
okay and just make sure that we get the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.280 
okay and just make sure that we get the
drive<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:19.370> want<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:19.820> in<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.030> case<00:02:20.300> I'm

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
the scan process and you it will tell

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.970 
the scan process and you it will tell
you<00:02:46.459> which<00:02:46.780> down<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.050> is<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.260> finds<00:02:48.440> items<00:02:48.860> it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
you which down here is it finds items it

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.270 
you which down here is it finds items it
will<00:02:49.010> actually<00:02:49.190> list<00:02:49.610> them<00:02:50.230> together<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:52.130> go

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
will actually list them together so go

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.890 
will actually list them together so go
ahead<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.550> we'll<00:02:52.670> let<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:52.970> scan<00:02:53.450> run<00:02:53.690> and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
ahead and we'll let this scan run and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.010 
ahead and we'll let this scan run and
then<00:02:53.989> I'll<00:02:54.140> show<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.500> what<00:02:54.620> we<00:02:55.070> got

then I'll show you what we got
okay<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.200> scan<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.500> complete<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:59.120> can

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
okay the scan is complete and you can

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.020 
okay the scan is complete and you can
see<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.780> software<00:03:00.770> was<00:03:01.130> able<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.430> find<00:03:01.730> some

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
see that software was able to find some

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.720 
see that software was able to find some
different<00:03:02.510> types<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.840> files<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:04.430> way<00:03:04.580> it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
different types of files and the way it

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.850 
different types of files and the way it
sits<00:03:05.030> organizing<00:03:05.660> them<00:03:05.750> here<00:03:05.959> again<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.350> is<00:03:06.620> it

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
sits organizing them here again is is it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.620 
sits organizing them here again is is it
does<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.190> by<00:03:07.370> whatever<00:03:07.670> type<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.120> file<00:03:08.330> it<00:03:08.360> is

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
does it by whatever type of file it is

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.630 
does it by whatever type of file it is
so<00:03:09.380> we've<00:03:09.560> got<00:03:09.739> all<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.040> images<00:03:10.400> grouped

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
so we've got all the images grouped

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.430 
so we've got all the images grouped
together<00:03:10.760> documents<00:03:11.750> which<00:03:11.930> would<00:03:12.080> be<00:03:12.200> like

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
together documents which would be like

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.979 
together documents which would be like
Excel<00:03:13.130> files<00:03:13.430> or<00:03:13.850> Word<00:03:14.150> documents<00:03:14.690> those<00:03:14.810> type

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
Excel files or Word documents those type

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.420 
Excel files or Word documents those type
of<00:03:15.020> things

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430
