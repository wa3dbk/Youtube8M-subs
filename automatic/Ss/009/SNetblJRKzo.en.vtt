00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
something similar to this one here this

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.769 
something similar to this one here this
here<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.100> a<00:00:26.130> 12<00:00:26.490> inch<00:00:26.760> all-in-one<00:00:28.490> DVD<00:00:29.779> TV

here is a 12 inch all-in-one DVD TV

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.920 
here is a 12 inch all-in-one DVD TV
combo<00:00:31.940> problem<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.570> doesn't<00:00:33.690> have

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
combo problem is is that it doesn't have

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.389 
combo problem is is that it doesn't have
the<00:00:34.050> bracket<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.219> there's

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the bracket now you can see that there's

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.969 
the bracket now you can see that there's
four<00:00:35.640> holes<00:00:35.879> which<00:00:36.359> are<00:00:36.539> designed<00:00:37.409> to<00:00:37.589> be<00:00:37.710> used

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:37.979 
four holes which are designed to be used

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.040 
four holes which are designed to be used
with<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> corresponding<00:00:39.089> mounting<00:00:39.629> bracket

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
with the corresponding mounting bracket

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.040 
with the corresponding mounting bracket
which<00:00:40.499> would<00:00:40.679> come<00:00:40.859> with<00:00:40.979> this<00:00:41.069> unit<00:00:41.429> now<00:00:42.050> not

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
which would come with this unit now not

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
which would come with this unit now not
to<00:00:43.260> say<00:00:43.499> bad<00:00:43.949> things<00:00:44.249> about<00:00:44.339> the<00:00:44.639> mounting

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
to say bad things about the mounting

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.309 
to say bad things about the mounting
brackets<00:00:45.269> that<00:00:45.359> come<00:00:45.389> with<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:45.749> units<00:00:46.109> but

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:46.319 
brackets that come with these units but

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:48.319 
brackets that come with these units but
I<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.309> say<00:00:47.460> something<00:00:47.670> bad<00:00:47.940> about<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I have to say something bad about it and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.139 
I have to say something bad about it and
the<00:00:48.389> reason<00:00:48.719> why<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.229> because<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.909> here

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the reason why is because if this here

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.329 
the reason why is because if this here
is<00:00:51.269> say<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.690> 14<00:00:52.229> inches<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.649> width<00:00:52.889> the

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
is say about 14 inches in width the

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.889 
is say about 14 inches in width the
bracket<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.940> typically<00:00:54.359> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.690> around

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
bracket is typically going to be around

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.539 
bracket is typically going to be around
here<00:00:55.109> on<00:00:55.229> 13<00:00:55.589> inches<00:00:55.859> so<00:00:55.979> it's<00:00:56.159> putting<00:00:56.339> all

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:56.549 
here on 13 inches so it's putting all

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.849 
here on 13 inches so it's putting all
the<00:00:56.670> weight<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.089> pressure<00:00:57.739> exactly<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.799> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the weight in the pressure exactly in a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.680 
the weight in the pressure exactly in a
small<00:00:59.129> area<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.639> if<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.999> a<00:01:00.030> very<00:01:00.299> big

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
small area now if you have a very big

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.439 
small area now if you have a very big
van<00:01:01.019> or<00:01:01.229> an<00:01:01.319> SUV<00:01:01.409> those<00:01:02.399> things<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.119> 6

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
van or an SUV those things can be like 6

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.180 
van or an SUV those things can be like 6
feet<00:01:03.659> in<00:01:03.839> length<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
feet in length that's really that's a

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.830 
feet in length that's really that's a
long<00:01:05.430> stretch<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.450> what's<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.780> happen

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
long stretch so what's going to happen

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
long stretch so what's going to happen
is<00:01:07.200> eventually<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> sag<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
is eventually this is going to sag and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.720 
is eventually this is going to sag and
it's<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> very<00:01:11.040> good<00:01:11.370> clean

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
it's not going to be a very good clean

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.400 
it's not going to be a very good clean
tight<00:01:12.030> installation<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.230> give

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
tight installation it's going to give

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.870 
tight installation it's going to give
you<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> problem<00:01:13.890> sooner<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.370> later<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you a problem sooner or later down the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.080 
you a problem sooner or later down the
road<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.990> what<00:01:16.650> my<00:01:16.860> suggestion<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.580> him<00:01:17.910> or

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
road so what my suggestion is to him or

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.580 
road so what my suggestion is to him or
anybody<00:01:18.450> who's<00:01:18.660> putting<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.050> of<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.260> in<00:01:19.440> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
anybody who's putting one of these in is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.820 
anybody who's putting one of these in is
get<00:01:20.340> some<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.060> material<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
get some of this material this here is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
get some of this material this here is
called<00:01:23.040> luan<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:24.060> very<00:01:24.240> thin<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
called luan it's very thin what it is is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
called luan it's very thin what it is is
the<00:01:25.800> three<00:01:26.070> ply<00:01:26.310> piece<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.030> plywood<00:01:27.270> now

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the three ply piece of plywood now

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.130 
the three ply piece of plywood now
unlike<00:01:29.330> standard<00:01:30.330> plywood<00:01:30.720> which<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.990> can

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
unlike standard plywood which you can

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.290 
unlike standard plywood which you can
never<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.670> important<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
never do this now this is important that

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.780 
never do this now this is important that
it<00:01:33.450> does<00:01:33.630> bend<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.440> because<00:01:35.160> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
it does bend this way because the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.180 
it does bend this way because the
contours<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.540> most<00:01:37.260> vehicles<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
contours in most vehicles is going to

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.460 
contours in most vehicles is going to
have<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:39.420> level<00:01:39.690> of<00:01:39.750> degree<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> outer

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
have some level of degree on the outer

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.290 
have some level of degree on the outer
edges<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.980> it's<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> come<00:01:41.550> in<00:01:41.760> on<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
edges and it's going to come in on the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.840 
edges and it's going to come in on the
middle<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:44.130> good<00:01:44.340> thing<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.520> this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
middle now the good thing about this

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
middle now the good thing about this
little<00:01:45.150> one<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> grain

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
little one is that you have a grain

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.680 
little one is that you have a grain
which<00:01:46.920> goes<00:01:47.030> horizontally<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> middle

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
which goes horizontally in the middle

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.870 
which goes horizontally in the middle
there's<00:01:49.140> another<00:01:49.440> grain<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.580> goes

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
there's another grain which goes

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.320 
there's another grain which goes
vertically<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.520> back<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.030> going

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
vertically and on the back it's going

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.570 
vertically and on the back it's going
horizontally<00:01:55.020> again<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.100> unlike

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
horizontally again so this is unlike

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.420 
horizontally again so this is unlike
many<00:01:57.540> other<00:01:57.750> types<00:01:58.050> of<00:01:58.200> plywood<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:59.310> only

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
many other types of plywood and not only

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.510 
many other types of plywood and not only
that<00:01:59.550> not<00:02:00.300> this<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.870> per<00:02:01.080> se<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:02.070> most<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
that not this one per se but most of the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.180 
that not this one per se but most of the
luan<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.000> buy<00:02:03.409> has<00:02:04.409> almost<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.950> this

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
luan that I buy has almost like this

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.240 
luan that I buy has almost like this
string<00:02:05.790> kind<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.659> stuff<00:02:07.470> inside<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.129> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
string kind of stuff inside so it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.619 
string kind of stuff inside so it
actually<00:02:08.640> gives<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> almost<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
actually gives it almost like a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.839 
actually gives it almost like a
fiberglass<00:02:10.200> type<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.679> density<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.610> very

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
fiberglass type of density and a very

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.690 
fiberglass type of density and a very
mix<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.989> nice<00:02:13.170> rigid<00:02:13.469> insulation<00:02:13.920> not<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
mix it for a nice rigid insulation not a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.129 
mix it for a nice rigid insulation not a
good<00:02:14.909> thing<00:02:15.060> about<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.659> that<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.959> weighs

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:16.139 
good thing about this is that it weighs

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.300 
good thing about this is that it weighs
almost<00:02:16.349> next<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.859> nothing

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
almost next to nothing

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.630 
almost next to nothing
and<00:02:18.430> what<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:21.010> place<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.550> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
and what you do is just place it in the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.550 
and what you do is just place it in the
back<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:22.000> would<00:02:22.150> measure<00:02:22.330> your<00:02:22.750> roof<00:02:22.990> right

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
back I would measure your roof right

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.440 
back I would measure your roof right
before<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> starts<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> get<00:02:24.400> funky<00:02:24.820> with<00:02:25.330> how

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
before it starts to get funky with how

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 
before it starts to get funky with how
it<00:02:25.600> comes<00:02:25.810> down<00:02:26.050> make<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.800> as<00:02:26.920> wise<00:02:27.160> as<00:02:27.280> you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
it comes down make it as wise as you

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.360 
it comes down make it as wise as you
possibly<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:27.970> slide<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.110> up<00:02:29.410> over<00:02:30.250> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
possibly can slide this up over the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.730 
possibly can slide this up over the
headliner<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> buddy<00:02:32.170> hold<00:02:32.620> this

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
headliner have a buddy hold this

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.620 
headliner have a buddy hold this
underneath<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.670> placement<00:02:33.940> where<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.390> have

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
underneath in a placement where you have

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.870 
underneath in a placement where you have
should<00:02:35.470> have<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:36.070> know<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> marks<00:02:36.580> for<00:02:36.760> where

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
should have you know the marks for where

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.280 
should have you know the marks for where
your<00:02:37.000> holes<00:02:37.209> are<00:02:37.330> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.570> be<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.110> lined

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
your holes are going to be have it lined

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.980 
your holes are going to be have it lined
up<00:02:38.440> in<00:02:38.650> position<00:02:38.860> ready<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.459> go<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:40.720> just

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
up in position ready to go then just

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.860 
up in position ready to go then just
have<00:02:41.220> yourself<00:02:42.220> slide<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.090> up<00:02:43.300> in<00:02:43.450> there<00:02:43.690> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
have yourself slide this up in there and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.310 
have yourself slide this up in there and
then<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:44.530> join<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.070> two<00:02:45.100> together<00:02:46.320> of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
then just join the two together of

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.660 
then just join the two together of
course<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.709> very<00:02:47.770> dry<00:02:48.040> wall<00:02:48.220> screws<00:02:48.250> work

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
course the very dry wall screws work

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.910 
course the very dry wall screws work
fantastic<00:02:49.570> just<00:02:50.110> get<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.500> there<00:02:50.739> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
fantastic just get that in there and

fantastic just get that in there and
once<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.459> goes<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:52.150> going<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.390> suck

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
once this goes in it's going to suck

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.350 
once this goes in it's going to suck
that<00:02:52.959> luan<00:02:53.320> right<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.910> thing<00:02:54.970> I'm

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
that luan right to it and this thing I'm

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.940
