00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
really daunting piece it's a play that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.370 
really daunting piece it's a play that
demands<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:42.940> lot<00:00:43.090> of<00:00:43.450> comedy<00:00:43.870> there's<00:00:44.200> some

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
very serious dramatic scenes as well

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.510 
very serious dramatic scenes as well
more<00:00:47.320> than<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.470> naturalistic<00:00:47.890> side<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.400> things

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
more than a naturalistic side of things

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.150 
more than a naturalistic side of things
so<00:00:48.700> it's<00:00:48.879> basically<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.800> of<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:50.950> whole

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
so it's basically the kind of the whole

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.460 
so it's basically the kind of the whole
range<00:00:51.520> of<00:00:51.760> your<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.300> your<00:00:52.330> metal<00:00:52.690> is<00:00:52.810> tested<00:00:53.290> I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
range of your of your metal is tested I

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.900 
range of your of your metal is tested I
think<00:00:53.710> they<00:00:53.830> each<00:00:54.040> between<00:00:54.430> them<00:00:54.640> play<00:00:54.760> maybe

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
think they each between them play maybe

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.210 
think they each between them play maybe
