good question

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
good question
and<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> exactly<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> three<00:01:29.250> years

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and this is exactly what the three years

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
and this is exactly what the three years
of<00:01:29.670> research<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.329> trying<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.840> prove<00:01:31.140> we

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
of research was trying to prove we

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.219 
of research was trying to prove we
compared<00:01:32.189> an<00:01:32.460> initial<00:01:33.329> urine<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> feces

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
compared an initial urine and feces

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.440 
compared an initial urine and feces
sample<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> post<00:01:35.189> sample<00:01:35.670> taken<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.420> or

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
sample with a post sample taken one or

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.649 
sample with a post sample taken one or
two<00:01:36.750> days<00:01:36.960> after<00:01:37.500> taking<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.340> hey<00:01:38.460> Tandy<00:01:38.700> what

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
two days after taking the hey Tandy what

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.810 
two days after taking the hey Tandy what
we<00:01:39.810> found<00:01:40.049> was<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> percentage<00:01:41.070> increase<00:01:41.579> in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we found was a percentage increase in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.450 
we found was a percentage increase in
the<00:01:42.390> second<00:01:42.930> sample<00:01:43.170> compared<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> first

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the second sample compared to the first

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.420 
the second sample compared to the first
this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> proof<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.079> HMV<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.829> eliminating

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
this is proof that HMV was eliminating

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
this is proof that HMV was eliminating
many<00:01:47.640> metals<00:01:48.030> from<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> body<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:49.200> was

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
repeated on over 350 people and many

we<00:04:54.010> have<00:04:54.160> many<00:04:54.430> autistic<00:04:54.610> children<00:04:55.450> using<00:04:55.810> HMV

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
we have many autistic children using HMV

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.260 
we have many autistic children using HMV
around<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.830> world<00:04:57.070> because<00:04:57.790> of<00:04:58.000> this

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
around the world because of this

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.350 
around the world because of this
collating<00:04:58.840> potential<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.650> mercury<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:01.180> is

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
collating potential of mercury and it is

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.220 
collating potential of mercury and it is
also<00:05:01.750> about<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.410> gentle<00:05:03.190> collator<00:05:04.230> because

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
also about the gentle collator because

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.670 
also about the gentle collator because
it<00:05:05.560> rarely<00:05:06.010> causes<00:05:06.490> side-effects<00:05:07.410> are<00:05:08.410> there

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
it rarely causes side-effects are there

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.220 
it rarely causes side-effects are there
people<00:05:08.920> who<00:05:09.310> marry<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:09.910> adversely<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.540> H&amp;D

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
people who marry and adversely to H&amp;D

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.450 
people who marry and adversely to H&amp;D
yes<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:13.300> is<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.570> possibility<00:05:13.810> because<00:05:14.680> there

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
yes it is a possibility because there

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.150 
yes it is a possibility because there
are<00:05:15.640> some<00:05:16.150> individuals<00:05:17.020> that<00:05:17.350> have

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
are some individuals that have

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.910 
are some individuals that have
compromised<00:05:19.060> detoxification<00:05:19.900> organs

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
compromised detoxification organs

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.190 
compromised detoxification organs
i<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:22.150> kidney<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.590> liver<00:05:23.620> may<00:05:24.160> be<00:05:24.220> blocked

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
i the kidney the liver may be blocked

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.800 
i the kidney the liver may be blocked
and<00:05:26.200> so<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:27.370> lymphatic<00:05:28.090> system<00:05:28.120> may<00:05:28.750> be

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
and so the lymphatic system may be

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.580 
and so the lymphatic system may be
congested<00:05:29.260> and<00:05:29.760> these<00:05:30.760> individuals<00:05:31.590> could

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
congested and these individuals could

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.280 
congested and these individuals could
develop<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.430> detoxification<00:05:34.120> side<00:05:34.690> effects<00:05:35.020> as

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
develop a detoxification side effects as

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.490 
develop a detoxification side effects as
the<00:05:35.350> metals<00:05:36.010> are<00:05:36.310> actually<00:05:37.230> mobilized<00:05:38.230> from

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
the metals are actually mobilized from

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.810 
the metals are actually mobilized from
the<00:05:38.710> body<00:05:38.890> because<00:05:39.340> they're<00:05:39.490> not<00:05:39.610> being

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
the body because they're not being

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.630 
the body because they're not being
eliminated<00:05:40.090> they<00:05:41.050> end<00:05:41.380> up<00:05:41.530> congesting<00:05:42.340> even

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
eliminated they end up congesting even

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.580 
eliminated they end up congesting even
further<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.240> detoxification<00:05:43.780> organs<00:05:44.350> and

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
further the detoxification organs and

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.670 
further the detoxification organs and
that<00:05:45.040> could<00:05:45.280> lead<00:05:45.490> to<00:05:45.780> some<00:05:46.780> some<00:05:47.200> symptoms

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
that could lead to some some symptoms

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.900 
that could lead to some some symptoms
but<00:05:48.460> this<00:05:48.760> is<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.000> detox<00:05:49.480> crisis<00:05:50.230> and<00:05:50.670> this<00:05:51.670> can

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
but this is a detox crisis and this can

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.740 
but this is a detox crisis and this can
easily<00:05:52.030> be<00:05:52.330> handled<00:05:53.290> with<00:05:54.090> drainage<00:05:55.090> remedies

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
easily be handled with drainage remedies

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.290 
easily be handled with drainage remedies
which<00:05:56.110> we've<00:05:56.320> all<00:05:56.500> already<00:05:56.980> developed<00:05:57.550> one<00:05:58.180> of

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
which we've all already developed one of

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.540 
which we've all already developed one of
them<00:05:58.450> is<00:05:58.570> called<00:05:58.780> organic<00:05:59.110> lavage<00:05:59.620> and<00:06:00.040> the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
them is called organic lavage and the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.790 
them is called organic lavage and the
other<00:06:00.670> one<00:06:00.880> is<00:06:01.180> called<00:06:01.710> where<00:06:02.710> is<00:06:02.860> chlorella
