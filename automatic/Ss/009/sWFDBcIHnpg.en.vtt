00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.400

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.120
 dialogue company m 108 look it up 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.690

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.660
 stand and flexible base 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:30.439
 let's hold the microphone at our hide 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 show why it opens easily 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:39.860
 Of course Chinese-made and why 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:43.670
 didn't take everything got him now said 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:49.110
 a major novelty took it because of this 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:53.600
 see for yourself how to call him 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.640
 non flexible hose this stand is indicated 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.260
 flexibly stick let's say well let's see 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 Can anyone digging is called 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.490
 complete product flexible base at 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.070
 countries on the basis here well it doesn't matter 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.140
 indicated is in my case 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 preferred 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.759
 because I used to have another 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.810
 firms too podlovochka but let's say here 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.869
 not flexible 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.060
 Here is this thing let's say this way 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.799
 it is molded plastic and at the base 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.020
 secured by a certain 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.299
 round hinge which moves in 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.520
 this reason and this thing itself 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.159
 still seems firm Jenius 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.600
 I have and over time so 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.119
 broke broke off everything. rake was 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.290
 she is motionless and here is very flexible 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.240
 the base and it bends and does not fall then 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.960
 have you say bend it doesnâ€™t mean 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.899
 in a day, this cold will come down 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.680
 there will be no hold and this is a plus and 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.619
 inexpensive price price he has 210 rubles 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.630
 This is a question to the fact that someone suddenly 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.489
 need a microphone why can 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.610
 will be required because as my case 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.750
 on two computers for some reason stopped 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.330
 work the microphone and on the webcam 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.640
 stopped working and all that is just not 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.940
 tried to reinstall firewood 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.760
 tried to figure out something somewhere 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.489
 error to find that this is not like 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.170
 had to put 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.879
 I have another microphone now 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.370
 the microphone u is not very comfortable now I tell you 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.830
 show him here he is the main microphone mother 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.739
 and son is enough for me while you are comfortable 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.860
 attach it to double sided tape or 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.550
 on adhesive tape and to the base of the monitor in 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.620
 my case on him as they say 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.050
 slander everything that came into our heads 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.870
 but it turned out that there are certain 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.400
 flaws constantly he dangles like you 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.129
 I do n't know why he might be hurt 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.200
 cords are valid from the keyboard either 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.440
 when the mouse offer but somehow decided 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.250
 all the same put that one this microphone 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.000
 and I will remove 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.060
 and I will put this one to the base 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.830
 pokrasivshe it straightens but like too 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.830
