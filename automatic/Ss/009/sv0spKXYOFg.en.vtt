this year's theme is god mode we're all
working<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.260> projects<00:00:22.770> that<00:00:22.890> are<00:00:22.980> related<00:00:23.190> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
working on projects that are related to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.550 
working on projects that are related to
the<00:00:23.460> question<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.970> what<00:00:24.210> would<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.840> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the question of what would you do you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800 
the question of what would you do you
had<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> power<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.160> invincibility<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
had the power of invincibility so the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.050 

Oh

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.960 

this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.600> God<00:00:57.870> Jas<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.280> programming

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
this is God Jas it's a programming

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.270 
this is God Jas it's a programming
language<00:01:00.410> emulating<00:01:01.410> religious<00:01:01.800> scriptures

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
language emulating religious scriptures

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.330 
language emulating religious scriptures
it's<00:01:02.880> man<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.330> an<00:01:03.450> exploration<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.340> religious

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
it's man as an exploration on religious

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.000 
it's man as an exploration on religious
texts<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.910> instruction<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:07.320> those

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
texts as instruction and how those

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.320 
texts as instruction and how those
instructions<00:01:08.640> compared<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
instructions compared to the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.760 
instructions compared to the
instructions<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.930> make<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> programming

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
instructions that make up a programming

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.010 
instructions that make up a programming
language<00:01:10.800> so<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> system<00:01:12.000> where<00:01:12.180> anybody

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
language so it's a system where anybody

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.590 
language so it's a system where anybody
can<00:01:13.260> design<00:01:14.070> their<00:01:14.340> own<00:01:14.370> religion<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.420> can

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
can design their own religion that can

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.110 
can design their own religion that can
then<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.810> adhere<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:16.920> other<00:01:17.160> people<00:01:17.550> so<00:01:18.030> if

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
then be adhere to my other people so if

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.880 
then be adhere to my other people so if
the<00:01:18.210> religion<00:01:18.540> has<00:01:18.660> certain<00:01:18.990> rules<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.620> things

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the religion has certain rules or things

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
the religion has certain rules or things
that<00:01:19.980> aren't<00:01:20.220> allowed<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.090> browser<00:01:21.360> becomes

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that aren't allowed the browser becomes

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.300 
that aren't allowed the browser becomes
your<00:01:21.990> cleric<00:01:22.410> through<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.710> priest<00:01:23.010> or<00:01:23.190> your

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
your cleric through your priest or your

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
your cleric through your priest or your
Imam<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> takes<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> interpretation<00:01:25.290> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
Imam so it takes the interpretation of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.200 
Imam so it takes the interpretation of
religious<00:01:25.740> texts<00:01:26.070> away<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:26.610> human<00:01:26.910> beings

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
religious texts away from human beings

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.040 
religious texts away from human beings
and<00:01:27.360> puts<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.500> into<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.950> computers

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.500 

our<00:01:34.050> project<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.920> DNA<00:01:35.490> spoofing<00:01:36.090> we're

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
our project is about DNA spoofing we're

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.870 
our project is about DNA spoofing we're
addressing<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.260> time<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.340> genetic

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
addressing a time when genetic

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
addressing a time when genetic
surveillance<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.600> omnipresent<00:01:40.170> we're

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
surveillance is omnipresent we're

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.640 
surveillance is omnipresent we're
providing<00:01:41.400> DIY<00:01:42.000> techniques<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.900> evade<00:01:43.320> these

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
providing DIY techniques to evade these

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.100 
providing DIY techniques to evade these
kinds<00:01:44.010> of<00:01:44.130> genetic<00:01:44.640> surveillance<00:01:45.300> tactics<00:01:45.540> I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
kinds of genetic surveillance tactics I

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
kinds of genetic surveillance tactics I
think<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:46.680> three<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.950> ours<00:01:47.130> first<00:01:47.520> times

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
think it's all three of ours first times

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.290 
think it's all three of ours first times
right<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.450> vent<00:01:48.780> online<00:01:49.410> go<00:01:50.160> figure<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:51.150> met

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
right we vent online go figure we met

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.520 
right we vent online go figure we met
again<00:01:51.390> at<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> hackathon<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.290> through

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
again at the hackathon and then through

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.350 
again at the hackathon and then through
email<00:01:52.979> threads<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:54.330> of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
email threads so we kind of

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.050 
email threads so we kind of
correspondent<00:01:54.900> about<00:01:55.550> protein<00:01:56.550> chemistry

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
correspondent about protein chemistry

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.540 
correspondent about protein chemistry
and<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.050> bit<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.229> genetic<00:01:58.740> surveillance

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
and a little bit of genetic surveillance

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:11.570 
and a little bit of genetic surveillance
stuff<00:01:59.850> before<00:02:00.390> coming

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.730 

yes
