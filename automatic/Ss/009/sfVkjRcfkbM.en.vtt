instantly caught my eye this image on

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.780 
instantly caught my eye this image on
the<00:00:47.840> screen<00:00:47.960> now<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.560> not<00:00:49.280> one<00:00:49.430> of<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.610> images

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
the screen now is not one of the images

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.430 
the screen now is not one of the images
they<00:00:50.240> use<00:00:50.450> when<00:00:50.660> they're<00:00:50.780> promoting<00:00:51.320> the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
they use when they're promoting the

zombies<00:00:51.800> map<00:00:52.010> is<00:00:52.250> one<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.580> images<00:00:52.760> may<00:00:53.600> use

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
zombies map is one of the images may use

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.930

when they're promoting a multiplayer map
lettuce<00:00:56.480> instantly<00:00:56.930> caught<00:00:57.140> my<00:00:57.320> eye<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:57.680> it

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
lettuce instantly caught my eye so it

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.620 
lettuce instantly caught my eye so it
went<00:00:57.980> back<00:00:58.130> through<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.550> three<00:00:58.850> previous<00:00:59.120> map

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630

pack<00:00:59.840> trailers<00:01:00.170> we<00:01:00.290> had<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.710> I<00:01:01.070> can<00:01:01.370> pretty

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
pack trailers we had and I can pretty

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.850 
pack trailers we had and I can pretty
much<00:01:01.760> say<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.420> uprising<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:03.410> vengeance

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
much say that uprising and vengeance

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.800 
much say that uprising and vengeance
both<00:01:04.369> had<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.790> different<00:01:05.150> picture<00:01:05.330> I'll<00:01:05.570> show

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
both had a different picture I'll show

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.050 
both had a different picture I'll show
you<00:01:05.900> those<00:01:06.080> on<00:01:06.320> screen<00:01:06.710> right<00:01:06.740> now<00:01:07.010> as<00:01:07.550> you<00:01:07.940> can

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
you those on screen right now as you can

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.730 
you those on screen right now as you can
see<00:01:08.240> they<00:01:08.360> have<00:01:08.510> a<00:01:08.570> map<00:01:08.840> related<00:01:09.290> background

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
see they have a map related background

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.440 
see they have a map related background
and<00:01:09.980> not<00:01:10.250> one<00:01:10.400> of<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.580> boxes<00:01:11.000> around<00:01:11.240> them

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
and not one of the boxes around them

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.730 
and not one of the boxes around them
this<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:11.780> making<00:01:12.020> me<00:01:12.110> think<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:12.530> is<00:01:12.710> a

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
this is making me think this is a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.580 
this is making me think this is a
multiplayer<00:01:13.580> map<00:01:13.970> on<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.630> revolution<00:01:15.260> DLC

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
multiplayer map on the revolution DLC

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.440 
multiplayer map on the revolution DLC
however<00:01:15.980> they<00:01:16.160> did<00:01:16.220> actually<00:01:16.700> have<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.330> a

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
however they did actually have it in a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.540 
however they did actually have it in a
box<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:17.900> this<00:01:18.500> is<00:01:18.680> probably<00:01:18.950> because<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.520> was

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
box and this is probably because it was

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.460 
box and this is probably because it was
the<00:01:19.760> first<00:01:19.790> map<00:01:20.240> pack<00:01:20.510> and<00:01:20.750> obviously<00:01:21.320> they

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
the first map pack and obviously they

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.140 
the first map pack and obviously they
weren't<00:01:21.680> going<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.040> be<00:01:22.160> certain<00:01:22.520> on<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.790> exact

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
weren't going to be certain on the exact

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.340 
weren't going to be certain on the exact
way<00:01:23.330> they<00:01:23.480> were<00:01:23.540> going<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.810> promote<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.230> in

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
way they were going to promote it in

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.230 
way they were going to promote it in
their<00:01:24.530> trailers<00:01:24.980> so<00:01:25.550> I'm<00:01:25.670> pretty<00:01:25.970> certain

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
their trailers so I'm pretty certain

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.720 
their trailers so I'm pretty certain
this<00:01:26.510> is<00:01:26.690> not<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:27.080> zombie<00:01:27.560> only<00:01:28.040> map<00:01:28.250> pack<00:01:28.520> and

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
this is not a zombie only map pack and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.149 
this is not a zombie only map pack and
to<00:01:28.850> add<00:01:29.000> even<00:01:29.210> more<00:01:29.390> proof<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:30.290> is<00:01:30.470> if<00:01:31.040> you

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
to add even more proof to this is if you

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.950 
to add even more proof to this is if you
look<00:01:31.370> on<00:01:31.550> this<00:01:31.640> image<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.000> can<00:01:32.300> actually<00:01:32.600> see

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
look on this image you can actually see

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.040 
look on this image you can actually see
the<00:01:33.560> reflection<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.700> table<00:01:35.210> now<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:35.990> is

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
the reflection on the table now this is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.750 
the reflection on the table now this is
obviously<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.590> reflection<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.310> image<00:01:37.580> on

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
obviously a reflection of the image on

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.330 
obviously a reflection of the image on
screen<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.630> i<00:01:38.659> rotated<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.830> picture<00:01:40.159> on<00:01:40.310> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
screen so i rotated the picture on the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.610 
screen so i rotated the picture on the
table<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.330> correct<00:01:41.690> way<00:01:41.810> up<00:01:41.990> because<00:01:42.260> of<00:01:42.350> see

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
table the correct way up because of see

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.590 
table the correct way up because of see
it's<00:01:42.800> upside<00:01:43.159> down<00:01:43.340> right<00:01:43.370> now<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.420> can

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's upside down right now and you can

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.290 
it's upside down right now and you can
see<00:01:44.810> lettering<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:46.340> does<00:01:46.610> look<00:01:46.790> like<00:01:47.000> it's

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
see lettering and it does look like it's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.140 
see lettering and it does look like it's
ta<00:01:47.840> n<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.040> then<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.520> rest<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.790> it's<00:01:49.940> sort<00:01:50.030> of

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
ta n and then the rest of it's sort of

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.910 
ta n and then the rest of it's sort of
distorted<00:01:50.690> and<00:01:50.840> by<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.140> looks<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.590> it

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
distorted and by the looks of it it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.670 
distorted and by the looks of it it
looks<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.460> ta<00:01:52.760> n<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.540> there<00:01:53.930> isn't<00:01:54.260> any<00:01:54.440> of

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
looks like ta n and there isn't any of

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.920 
looks like ta n and there isn't any of
the<00:01:54.800> older<00:01:55.190> zombie<00:01:55.520> maps<00:01:55.760> which<00:01:56.360> begins<00:01:56.810> with

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
the older zombie maps which begins with

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.649 
the older zombie maps which begins with
ta<00:01:57.380> n<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.220> this<00:01:58.430> is<00:01:58.640> again<00:01:58.760> making<00:01:59.180> me<00:01:59.360> assume

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
ta n so this is again making me assume

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.870 
ta n so this is again making me assume
this<00:01:59.840> is<00:01:59.900> a<00:02:00.110> multiplayer<00:02:00.770> map<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.370> if<00:02:01.729> you

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
this is a multiplayer map and if you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.450 
this is a multiplayer map and if you
think<00:02:02.150> about<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.420> also<00:02:03.290> there<00:02:03.770> has<00:02:03.979> only<00:02:04.130> been

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
think about it also there has only been

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.430 
think about it also there has only been
these<00:02:05.090> zombies<00:02:05.600> on<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.020> pictures

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
these zombies on the pictures

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.649 
these zombies on the pictures
advertising<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.700> zombie<00:02:08.030> map<00:02:08.239> pack<00:02:08.479> they

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659 
advertising the zombie map pack they

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.410 
advertising the zombie map pack they
never<00:02:08.929> include<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.590> characters<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.369> if<00:02:11.209> you

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
never include the characters and if you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.970 
never include the characters and if you
see<00:02:11.600> on<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.750> image<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.290> does<00:02:12.590> look<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:12.830> a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
see on this image it does look like a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.010 
see on this image it does look like a
multiplayer<00:02:13.790> character<00:02:14.450> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
multiplayer character this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.750 
multiplayer character this
again<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.380> just<00:02:15.560> more<00:02:15.740> proof<00:02:15.950> adding<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.550> that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
again is just more proof adding up that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760 
again is just more proof adding up that
we're<00:02:16.910> not<00:02:17.180> getting<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.780> zombie<00:02:18.320> zoning<00:02:18.620> map
