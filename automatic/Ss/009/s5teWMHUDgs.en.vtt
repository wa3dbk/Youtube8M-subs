if<00:00:00.110> you're<00:00:01.110> somebody<00:00:01.439> that<00:00:01.500> works<00:00:01.770> with

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
if you're somebody that works with

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.800 
if you're somebody that works with
replicated<00:00:02.520> objects<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.000> lot<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.510> know<00:00:03.540> they

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
replicated objects a lot you know they

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.200 
replicated objects a lot you know they
can<00:00:03.990> be<00:00:04.110> very<00:00:04.319> cumbersome<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.339> use<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.819> spin

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
can be very cumbersome to use the spin

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.690 
can be very cumbersome to use the spin
duplicates<00:00:06.779> tool<00:00:07.020> or<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.740> spin<00:00:08.069> tool<00:00:08.309> with

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
duplicates tool or the spin tool with

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.970 
duplicates tool or the spin tool with
the<00:00:08.790> duplicates<00:00:09.179> option<00:00:09.660> because<00:00:10.559> any<00:00:10.740> time

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the duplicates option because any time

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.620 
the duplicates option because any time
that<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.370> modify<00:00:11.849> your<00:00:12.030> mesh<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.389> have<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.540> go

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
that you modify your mesh you have to go

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.259 
that you modify your mesh you have to go
back<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.230> re<00:00:13.559> spin<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.099> object<00:00:14.490> there's

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
back in and re spin the object there's

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.390 
back in and re spin the object there's
actually<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> pretty<00:00:15.719> simple<00:00:16.350> solution<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.770> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
actually a pretty simple solution to to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090 
actually a pretty simple solution to to
do<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.300> allows<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.080> keep<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.770> fully

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
do this that allows you to keep a fully

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.830 
do this that allows you to keep a fully
editable<00:00:20.520> object<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.359> will<00:00:21.539> then<00:00:21.660> be

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
editable object that will then be

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.990 
editable object that will then be
replicated<00:00:22.100> automatically<00:00:23.100> any<00:00:23.400> way<00:00:23.850> that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
replicated automatically any way that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.120 
replicated automatically any way that
you<00:00:24.090> need<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> by<00:00:25.350> using<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.859> array

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
you need and this is by using an array

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.429 
you need and this is by using an array
modifier<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.810> go<00:00:27.900> ahead<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.260> add

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
modifier so if we go ahead and just add

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.290 
modifier so if we go ahead and just add
an<00:00:28.710> array<00:00:28.800> modifier<00:00:29.130> from<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> modifiers

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
an array modifier from the modifiers

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.620 
an array modifier from the modifiers
panel<00:00:30.590> we<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.430> easily<00:00:32.759> by<00:00:33.600> using

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
panel we can do this easily by using

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.870 
panel we can do this easily by using
what's<00:00:34.230> called<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.559> object<00:00:34.770> offset<00:00:35.489> which<00:00:35.730> can

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
what's called an object offset which can

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.090 
what's called an object offset which can
be<00:00:36.000> checked<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.500> use<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.980> need

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
be checked here and to use this we need

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
be checked here and to use this we need
to<00:00:38.160> go<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> add<00:00:38.550> an<00:00:38.700> object<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.270> rotate<00:00:39.690> around

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to go and add an object to rotate around

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.560 
to go and add an object to rotate around
and<00:00:40.140> you'll<00:00:40.559> notice<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.760> case<00:00:41.820> with

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and you'll notice that in this case with

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.030 
and you'll notice that in this case with
this<00:00:42.690> scene<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> plan<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
this scene I have a plan for that a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.090 
this scene I have a plan for that a
plinth<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.100> duplicate

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
plinth that I then want to duplicate

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.430 
plinth that I then want to duplicate
this<00:00:47.280> simple<00:00:47.969> cylinder<00:00:48.270> around<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.200> circle

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
this simple cylinder around in a circle

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
this simple cylinder around in a circle
and<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> need<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> object<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and so I need a object for this to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.299 
and so I need a object for this to
rotate<00:00:52.379> around<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> hit<00:00:53.100> shift

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
rotate around so I'm going to hit shift

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.049 
rotate around so I'm going to hit shift
a<00:00:53.520> add<00:00:53.760> empty<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.250> then<00:00:56.250> I'll<00:00:56.370> reselect<00:00:56.850> my

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
a add empty and then I'll reselect my

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.630 
a add empty and then I'll reselect my
pillar<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.510> set<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.350> object<00:00:58.829> offset<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
pillar and set that object offset to the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.439 
pillar and set that object offset to the
empty<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.680> move<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.030> empty

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
empty so now if I move this this empty

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
empty so now if I move this this empty
you'll<00:01:03.989> notice<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> controls<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you'll notice that it controls the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.030 
you'll notice that it controls the
amount<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.790> offset<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.049> pillar<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.560> this

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
amount of offset for my pillar and this

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
amount of offset for my pillar and this
also<00:01:08.310> happens<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.299> rotate<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
also happens that if I rotate it it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.039 
also happens that if I rotate it it
rotates<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.430> circle<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.479> let's<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.810> ahead

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
rotates in a circle so let's go ahead

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.149 
rotates in a circle so let's go ahead
and<00:01:13.320> set<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.340> Tuesday<00:01:14.880> six<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.950> we'll

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and set this Tuesday six and then we'll

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.859 
and set this Tuesday six and then we'll
go<00:01:17.369> ahead<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.670> rotate<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.270> around<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
go ahead and rotate this around and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.929 
go ahead and rotate this around and
you'll<00:01:19.409> notice<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.920> were<00:01:20.189> rotates<00:01:20.520> right

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
you'll notice it were rotates right

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.570 
you'll notice it were rotates right
around<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.720> circle<00:01:22.140> now<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.430> this

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
around the circle now to get this

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
around the circle now to get this
precise<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.270> need<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> also<00:01:24.750> let's<00:01:25.439> turn<00:01:25.710> off

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
precise we need to also let's turn off

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.359 
precise we need to also let's turn off
the<00:01:26.040> relative<00:01:26.970> offset<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:29.040> way<00:01:29.189> it'll<00:01:29.310> be

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the relative offset that way it'll be

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.609 
the relative offset that way it'll be
controlled<00:01:29.790> strictly<00:01:30.390> by<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.540> empty<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.110> now

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
controlled strictly by the empty and now

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.080 
controlled strictly by the empty and now
it<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.770> goes<00:01:32.009> right<00:01:32.400> around<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> circle

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it just goes right around in a circle

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.749 
it just goes right around in a circle
and<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.869> rotate<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.619> 60<00:01:35.159> degrees<00:01:35.520> I've

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
and if I rotate it to 60 degrees I've

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.700 
and if I rotate it to 60 degrees I've
got<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> nice<00:01:36.119> even<00:01:36.390> offset<00:01:36.930> let's<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.619> ahead

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
got a nice even offset let's go ahead

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.230 
got a nice even offset let's go ahead
and<00:01:37.920> increase<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.579> perhaps<00:01:38.909> eight

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and increase this to perhaps eight

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.870 
and increase this to perhaps eight
pillars<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.280> we'll<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.430> rotate<00:01:41.759> this

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
pillars and we'll just rotate this

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.260 
pillars and we'll just rotate this
around<00:01:42.030> holding<00:01:42.689> down<00:01:42.780> control<00:01:43.259> -<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:44.700> snap<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
around holding down control - to snap it

replicated sill or pillar that is simply

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.560 
replicated sill or pillar that is simply
one<00:01:54.450> single<00:01:54.899> object<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.090> even<00:01:57.329> do

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
one single object and you can even do

one single object and you can even do
this<00:01:57.719> spiral<00:01:58.439> effect<00:01:58.560> some<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> have

this spiral effect some of you that have

this spiral effect some of you that have
seen<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.240> new<00:02:00.390> screw<00:02:00.899> modifier<00:02:01.549> may<00:02:02.549> be

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
seen the new screw modifier may be

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.429 
seen the new screw modifier may be
thinking<00:02:02.880> it'd<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.060> great<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.990> spin

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
