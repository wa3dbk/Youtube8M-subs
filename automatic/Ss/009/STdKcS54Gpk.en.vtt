00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:11.190
 when you have to brake hard on a straight line 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 do not be afraid you can tread on 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.110
 pedal that he can handle like this. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.209
 same 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 now if you have an obstacle and are 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:26.420
 rapid deviation is required. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:26.420
 attention to what I 'm going 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.920
 robert was not invented to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.040
 braking distance 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.040
 it was invented for you to be able 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.620
 divert while braking when talking 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 that the abs system gives more safety can 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.010
 believe when something comes up 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.199
 and you have to brake and divert 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.020
 see how it makes life easier for 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.360
 driver who is smart by the system 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.220
 Chatters the brake pedal and there is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.350
 another problem people buy a 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.150
 car with abs and can probably 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.250
 years without having to make a 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.440
 emergency braking and when it is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.690
 use the brake pedal the pedal wah 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.409
 to tremble and the person ends up 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.940
 brake 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 I think it 's good to see you think you 're 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.030
 with defect and in fact the messi system 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.030
 do it 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.940
 adriana has a car without abs and goes 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.190
 face an ability test 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.600
 the pilot tells what she should do is 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.420
 like a truck coming into your 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.330
 in front of an animal or something to us 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.760
 will brake and divert because we are 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.190
 with abs then connected with abs the people 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.440
 you can do this movement next to the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.440
 braking and detour without taking your foot 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.750
 adriana accelerates and brakes the first 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.210
 woman president 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.090
 It 's a long way off if it's not okay sometimes not 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.410
 it's reflection happens right? 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.410
 she's always on the track is you spending 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.620
 all the time you have to do the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.240
 evasive maneuvers and leprosy 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.530
 to see this side that is better than 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.630
 is always doing everything now 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.399
 program does not always understand this 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.760
 side would be the best option 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.030
 and already duct black 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.810
 and a little bit of strength is missing at the end 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.230
 the team and still want to make life difficult 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.269
 we will turn off the abs as dna comes 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.480
 standard with the system we were one 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.180
 special key for this will brake more 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.170
 I felt that the car will slide to there 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:49.769
 occurs that you felt slid off and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:53.629
 deviate and white 90 achieve this 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.629
 it's not new 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.980
 I can not get my foot off the brake is going 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.250
 against our instinct is to take a fright 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.609
 on the brake and had money to 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.099
 dumb to the horror realize that any 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:12.379
 distraction interferes in the reflex and looks 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.379
 that Adrian is fully concentrated 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.709
 I just did not get the foot off 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.510
 treatment 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.510
 then a new forward already said 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.970
 two hundred technical guards with cars is 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:43.180
 of s 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:45.670
 Frei takes his foot off and goes again with 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.240
 the psd the deviation can be done with the foot 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.230
 the brakes in both cases with a tip 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.240
 fundamental 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.230
 the driver has to look at where he 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.400
 wants to go right the eye of the obstacle is the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.400
 called escape route 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.550
 oo 1
