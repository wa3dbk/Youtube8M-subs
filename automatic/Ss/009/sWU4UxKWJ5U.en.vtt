00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.480 
different types of snag tools there's a
Snagit<00:00:19.540> there's<00:00:20.320> controllers<00:00:20.950> and<00:00:21.250> and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
Snagit there's controllers and and

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.710 
Snagit there's controllers and and
whatnot<00:00:21.790> so<00:00:21.820> today<00:00:22.180> I'm<00:00:22.270> going<00:00:22.360> to<00:00:22.420> be<00:00:22.540> showing

whatnot so today I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:22.869> some<00:00:22.900> applications<00:00:23.560> with<00:00:23.710> this<00:00:23.830> snag

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
you some applications with this snag

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.490 
you some applications with this snag
controller<00:00:25.270> this<00:00:25.450> polymer<00:00:25.869> controller<00:00:26.260> it<00:00:26.410> is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
controller this polymer controller it is

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.530 
controller this polymer controller it is
not<00:00:26.650> sharp<00:00:26.919> I<00:00:27.189> don't<00:00:27.910> know<00:00:28.000> if<00:00:28.060> you<00:00:28.119> can<00:00:28.270> see<00:00:28.450> it

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
not sharp I don't know if you can see it

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.450 
not sharp I don't know if you can see it
from<00:00:28.660> this<00:00:28.810> angle<00:00:28.869> but<00:00:29.200> it's<00:00:29.410> pretty<00:00:30.099> thick<00:00:30.340> on

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
from this angle but it's pretty thick on

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.050 
from this angle but it's pretty thick on
this<00:00:30.640> side<00:00:31.259> and<00:00:32.259> it's<00:00:33.040> very<00:00:33.430> well<00:00:33.640> made<00:00:33.670> it's

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
this side and it's very well made it's

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.170 
this side and it's very well made it's
almost<00:00:34.810> impossible<00:00:35.380> to<00:00:35.470> break<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:37.030> we're<00:00:37.149> just

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
almost impossible to break so we're just

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.430 
almost impossible to break so we're just
going<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.420> show<00:00:37.600> you<00:00:37.660> some<00:00:37.780> applications<00:00:38.320> with

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
going to show you some applications with

00:00:38.440 --> 00:04:11.790 
going to show you some applications with
this

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.860
