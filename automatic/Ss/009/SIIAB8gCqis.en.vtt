00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.410
 home free mob punish 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.410
 students can follow the link in the description 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello gangsters with you panda doom against 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 out of the Word overs let's see what of this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.820
 will come out and so the house is definitely excellent 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 forester cool hero with big 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 variability of abilities because 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.330
 but corny he can take such 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.849
 skills such skills such skill and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.100
 can the team play up to take yourself 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.410
 armor to check birdie and regin cheek satyr 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.680
 and general fun and live well and even 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.270
 to fatten more 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.760
 the second house is a good skill and at Yasha 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.730
 the third skill can somehow 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.539
 sometimes nice to help in a fight well and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.059
 of course 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.610
 his ulta brand is a great way 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.649
 anyone can just burn out the pentagram on 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.690
 the face therefore the house is certainly very 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.339
 strong hero ou e design and opportunity 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.880
 many nafarmit including the forest can be 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.680
 go to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170
 Is this format important in the method 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.520
 very important because 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.000
 peter on mid you know a lot of money 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.310
 you will not be 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 as for the flat that guy who 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 first of all enrages by the fact that he 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.920
 steals all the intelligence 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.720
 even one dilaver is insulting 5 dollars 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.369
 it's just a minus all intelligence if u 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.220
 they have such a desire they can just 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.229
 1 thought to humiliate completely there will not be 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.549
 Intelligence is very, very without brain can 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.930
 can do plus dior after all 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.240
 Further commit can stand several 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.100
 more confident than the neighbors I think that not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.619
 killed someone with this news though 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.899
 Of course there is a dependence on the hero plus 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.570
 his good faith by and large hook 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.759
 Dior is important in these rinks dominate 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.640
 the very beginning as you see in this game 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.250
 if matters of faith do not at first rest on 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.420
 pound thought under the taver and quickly pulls 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.000
 then she has a chance to win if not then 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.310
 in the level after 11 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.070
 doom usually already nafarmil but at least 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.600
 something about it is felt 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.340
 much more confident and wins the rink 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.430
 the only way to win behind 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.890
 overs it quickly win what are you 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.800
 actually see in this skating rinks 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.160
 less than 6 others k so won dumas 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.260
 because they are cool because they think 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.350
 oh there is, think great design 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.160
 if dilaver does not resolve the rink quickly 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.860
 the doom having a farm just breaks faces 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.730
 61 favor thought nonetheless on video 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.680
 great sure fast win 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.750
 dealers, which is also possible in principle 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.300
 if you have the appropriate skills 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.800
 you are not stupid and meanwhile six months thanks
