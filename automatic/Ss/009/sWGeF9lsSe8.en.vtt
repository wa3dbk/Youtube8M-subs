00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.839 
not that much and this paint is a shiny
gloss<00:02:00.899> finish<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.979> could<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.280> gotten<00:02:02.489> matte

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:02.849 
gloss finish I could have gotten matte

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.330 
gloss finish I could have gotten matte
but<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.229> want<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.770> look<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
but I kind of want it to look like it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.270 
but I kind of want it to look like it
was<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.489> different<00:02:05.939> material<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.950> you'll<00:02:07.950> see

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
was a different material so you'll see

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.740 
was a different material so you'll see
in<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> end<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> video<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.509> when<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
in the end of the video that when it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.980 
in the end of the video that when it
dries<00:02:10.019> it's<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.920> gonna<00:02:11.250> look<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:11.459> Gina

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.800

you see how shiny it looks like the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.390

light<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.310> reflecting<00:02:55.910> off<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:57.190> I'm<00:02:58.190> gonna

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
light is reflecting off of it I'm gonna

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.080 
light is reflecting off of it I'm gonna
do<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.700> other<00:02:58.730> leg

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
do the other leg

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.290 
do the other leg
the<00:03:00.050> same<00:03:00.290> process<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.730> don't<00:03:01.880> really<00:03:02.060> need

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
the same process you don't really need

the same process you don't really need
that<00:03:02.660> much<00:03:03.620> paint<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.280> mean<00:03:04.550> after<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.750> was<00:03:05.960> done

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
that much paint I mean after I was done

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.600 
that much paint I mean after I was done
I<00:03:06.530> think<00:03:06.650> there's<00:03:07.340> probably<00:03:07.460> like<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.980> 75%

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
I think there's probably like like 75%

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.760 
I think there's probably like like 75%
of<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.390> paint<00:03:11.630> left<00:03:11.900> that's<00:03:12.320> not<00:03:12.500> bad

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
of the paint left that's not bad

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.280 
of the paint left that's not bad
especially<00:03:13.460> for<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.670> bottle<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:14.810> only<00:03:14.930> cost

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
especially for a bottle but it only cost

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.309 
especially for a bottle but it only cost
the<00:03:15.470> buck

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
the buck

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:34.349 
the buck
