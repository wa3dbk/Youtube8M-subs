tablespoon<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.910> peanut<00:03:16.030> butter<00:03:16.300> okay<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.050> fine

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
tablespoon of peanut butter okay we fine

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.440 
tablespoon of peanut butter okay we fine
all<00:03:17.500> right<00:03:17.769> I'm<00:03:18.489> still<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.820> our<00:03:18.970> oatmeal<00:03:19.090> a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
all right I'm still have our oatmeal a

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.150 
all right I'm still have our oatmeal a
sweet<00:03:20.110> milk<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.620> something<00:03:21.010> really

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
sweet milk this is something really

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.350 
sweet milk this is something really
important<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.580> want<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.790> talk<00:03:21.970> about<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
important you want to talk about the

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.780 
important you want to talk about the
myth<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:23.019> better<00:03:23.700> alternative<00:03:24.700> to

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
myth is is it's better alternative to

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.300 
myth is is it's better alternative to
cow's<00:03:25.000> milk<00:03:25.440> that's<00:03:26.440> absolutely<00:03:26.980> not<00:03:27.250> true

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
cow's milk that's absolutely not true

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.490 
cow's milk that's absolutely not true
and<00:03:27.940> there's<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.209> lot<00:03:28.420> of<00:03:28.600> controversy<00:03:29.080> around

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
and there's a lot of controversy around

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.220 
and there's a lot of controversy around
soy<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.550> healthiest<00:03:31.209> forms<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.810> soy<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.140> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
soy the healthiest forms of soy and the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.100 
soy the healthiest forms of soy and the
only<00:03:32.410> forms<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.070> soy<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.370> are<00:03:33.489> healthy<00:03:33.790> are

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
only forms of soy that are healthy are

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.660 
only forms of soy that are healthy are
fermented<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.350> that's<00:03:35.530> tempeh<00:03:36.100> which<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.519> like

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
fermented so that's tempeh which is like

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.210 
fermented so that's tempeh which is like
a<00:03:36.700> veggie<00:03:36.970> burger<00:03:37.090> replacement<00:03:37.989> tamari<00:03:38.920> a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
a veggie burger replacement tamari a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.690 
a veggie burger replacement tamari a
gluten-free<00:03:39.640> soy<00:03:40.030> sauce<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.660> miso<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:42.040> soy

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
gluten-free soy sauce and miso so soy

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.470 
gluten-free soy sauce and miso so soy
milk<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.239> tofu<00:03:43.810> not<00:03:44.680> healthy<00:03:45.250> edamame<00:03:45.730> they

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
milk and tofu not healthy edamame they

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.479 
milk and tofu not healthy edamame they
block<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.050> uptake<00:03:47.080> of<00:03:47.440> iodine<00:03:47.800> which<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
block the uptake of iodine which the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.490 
block the uptake of iodine which the
thyroid<00:03:48.940> needs<00:03:49.180> there's<00:03:49.720> too<00:03:50.050> much<00:03:50.230> estrogen

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
thyroid needs there's too much estrogen

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.040 
thyroid needs there's too much estrogen
that<00:03:51.459> they<00:03:51.670> start<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.120> promote<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.780> they're

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
that they start to promote and they're

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.050 
that they start to promote and they're
genetically<00:03:53.650> modified<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.519> that's<00:03:54.640> probably

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
genetically modified and that's probably

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.630 
genetically modified and that's probably
the<00:03:55.720> biggest<00:03:55.930> thing<00:03:56.230> along<00:03:56.590> with<00:03:56.860> corn<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
the biggest thing along with corn and

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.910 
the biggest thing along with corn and
wheat<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.510> you're<00:03:58.959> saying<00:03:59.140> like<00:03:59.230> edamame<00:03:59.709> is

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
wheat so you're saying like edamame is

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.120 
wheat so you're saying like edamame is
not<00:04:00.250> healthy<00:04:01.050> really<00:04:02.050> sorry<00:04:02.410> get<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.769> miso

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
not healthy really sorry get the miso

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.890 
not healthy really sorry get the miso
soup<00:04:03.370> but<00:04:03.550> don't<00:04:03.760> get<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.030> edamame<00:04:04.450> actually

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
soup but don't get the edamame actually

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.810 
soup but don't get the edamame actually
I<00:04:04.930> had<00:04:05.019> no<00:04:05.170> idea<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.800> when<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:06.459> talk<00:04:06.670> about

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
I had no idea and when we talk about

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.820 
I had no idea and when we talk about
genetic<00:04:07.180> modified<00:04:07.989> foods<00:04:08.320> you<00:04:08.560> know<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
genetic modified foods you know the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.800 
genetic modified foods you know the
genome<00:04:09.310> playing<00:04:09.760> with<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.030> genome<00:04:10.450> as<00:04:10.660> it

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
genome playing with the genome as it

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.990 
genome playing with the genome as it
pertains<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.350> food<00:04:11.680> has<00:04:11.980> not<00:04:12.190> been<00:04:12.489> studied

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000

its<00:04:13.570> effects<00:04:13.930> on<00:04:14.110> human<00:04:14.500> health<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:15.100> it's

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
its effects on human health so it's

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.070 
its effects on human health so it's
another<00:04:15.880> reason<00:04:15.970> soy<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.540> one<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.870> three

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
another reason soy is one of the three

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.210 
another reason soy is one of the three
most<00:04:17.260> genetically

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
most genetically

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.880 
most genetically
like<00:04:18.310> crops<00:04:18.610> mistakes<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:19.900> just<00:04:20.380> those<00:04:20.530> three

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
like crops mistakes so just those three

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.340 
like crops mistakes so just those three
okay<00:04:21.310> for<00:04:21.880> sure<00:04:22.090> okay<00:04:22.450> well<00:04:22.660> we<00:04:22.780> gotta<00:04:22.960> go<00:04:23.140> but

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
okay for sure okay well we gotta go but

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.020 
okay for sure okay well we gotta go but
you<00:04:23.470> just<00:04:23.620> want<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.800> mention<00:04:23.950> avoiding<00:04:24.790> Groot

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
you just want to mention avoiding Groot

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.490 
you just want to mention avoiding Groot
vegetables<00:04:25.540> because<00:04:25.810> they're<00:04:25.960> too<00:04:26.140> high<00:04:26.320> in

sugar that's a myth
that's<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.270> myth<00:04:28.510> root<00:04:28.750> vegetables<00:04:28.780> are

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
that's a myth root vegetables are

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.750
