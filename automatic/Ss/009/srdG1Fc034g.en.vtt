I<00:00:38.579> really<00:00:38.909> like<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.269> time<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.539> just<00:00:39.839> randomly

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

turned on the camera and started
speaking<00:00:41.699> I<00:00:41.999> figured<00:00:42.359> I<00:00:42.449> would<00:00:42.569> do<00:00:42.659> that<00:00:42.780> again

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
speaking I figured I would do that again

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.110 
speaking I figured I would do that again
because<00:00:43.229> I<00:00:43.769> had<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> lot<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.609> fun<00:00:44.819> doing<00:00:44.999> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
