00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
what we're used to seeing from Apple

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.740 
what we're used to seeing from Apple
devices<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.790> two<00:00:36.000> little<00:00:36.030> pull<00:00:36.480> tabs

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
devices and we have two little pull tabs

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.139 
devices and we have two little pull tabs
here<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.700> this<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.300> Apple<00:00:39.660> watch<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> if

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.030 
here and this is the Apple watch so if
we<00:00:42.239> go<00:00:42.329> ahead<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.719> pull<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.620> here

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
we go ahead and pull this up right here

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
we go ahead and pull this up right here
and<00:00:44.480> slide<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.200> see<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.500> have

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and slide this out you can see we have

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.319 
and slide this out you can see we have
designed<00:00:46.950> by<00:00:47.129> Apple<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.550> California<00:00:47.579> right

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
designed by Apple in California right

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
designed by Apple in California right
here<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.320> looks<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.920> some

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
here and this looks like just some

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.110 
here and this looks like just some
documentation<00:00:51.199> some<00:00:52.199> tips<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.590> tricks<00:00:53.120> put

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
documentation some tips and tricks put

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
documentation some tips and tricks put
that<00:00:54.270> aside<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.070> some<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.190> information

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that aside and some more information

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.910 
that aside and some more information
right<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.170> actually<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.680> our

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
right here and then we actually have our

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
right here and then we actually have our
other<00:00:59.219> band<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.300> our<00:01:00.329> watch<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.260> course

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
other band for our watch so of course

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
other band for our watch so of course
this<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.280> comes<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> small<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
this actually comes with a small to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840 
this actually comes with a small to
medium<00:01:03.960> band<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.309> assume<00:01:05.460> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
medium band and then this I assume is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.280 
medium band and then this I assume is
the<00:01:06.060> large<00:01:06.540> band

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the large band

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.870 
the large band
yeah<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> medium<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> large<00:01:08.280> band<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
yeah the medium to large band as you can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.770 
yeah the medium to large band as you can
see<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.510> those<00:01:09.659> are

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
see right there so those are

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.330 
see right there so those are
interchangeable<00:01:10.320> we'll<00:01:10.920> put<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.189> aside

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
interchangeable we'll put that aside

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.210 
interchangeable we'll put that aside
right<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.510> we'll<00:01:12.630> also<00:01:12.750> check<00:01:13.080> out<00:01:13.290> our

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
right here and we'll also check out our

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760 
right here and we'll also check out our
power<00:01:14.970> adapter<00:01:15.509> which<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> very<00:01:16.350> similar<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
power adapter which is very similar to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
power adapter which is very similar to
just<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.759> normal<00:01:18.150> power<00:01:18.330> adapter<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.869> we

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
just the normal power adapter that we

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.370 
just the normal power adapter that we
would<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.439> an<00:01:19.590> iPhone<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.900> then<00:01:21.900> here

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
would get with an iPhone and then here

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.670 
would get with an iPhone and then here
we<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.619> our<00:01:23.159> pretty<00:01:23.729> long<00:01:24.259> cable<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.619> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
we have our pretty long cable this is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.289 
we have our pretty long cable this is
going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> magnetic<00:01:26.820> inductive

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
going to be a magnetic inductive

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.960 
going to be a magnetic inductive
charging<00:01:27.650> for<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> Apple<00:01:29.130> watch<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.820> let's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
charging for the Apple watch but let's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.640 
charging for the Apple watch but let's
go<00:01:30.060> ahead<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.259> want<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
see which is obviously the watch so we

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
see which is obviously the watch so we
have<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.280> pull<00:01:35.579> tab<00:01:35.820> which

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
have right here just a pull tab which

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.140 
have right here just a pull tab which
I'll<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.390> ahead<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.900> pull<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:41.150> and
