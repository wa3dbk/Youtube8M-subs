00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.270
 we are in the section creating the 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.160
 character of the new dragon age 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.480
 let's see the new options that we 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.019
 offer this time 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 we have a lot of new things for 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.930
 good example I 'm now for the part 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.230
 of the forehead is something that I do not usually 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.720
 fix the truth a lot 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.750
 there are things that it's better to touch the ones that 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.320
 you move them and at the end the exit this 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.320
 it is horrible 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:39.070
 and good to try to have the least 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.070
 bulged possible but not flat 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.340
 I think that's fine 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.750
 we passed to the eyes that is one of my 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.930
 favorite parts there are a lot of 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.739
 eye shapes alone there are very few 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.739
 make them pretty 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.760
 the ideal is to choose one that you like and 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.760
 good 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.670
 and discard the others that do not tell you 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 much 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.150
 I have always liked dolls 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.830
 a little or jonás then between what 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.360
 fits and I will try to put his eyes 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.370
 grandsons 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.320
 without it being very strange 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.300
 the position of the eyes is better if you 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.500
 like that I do not touch is a lot because then 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.990
 the lees 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.880
 rotations for action I think that 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.910
 It's fine as it is I'm not going to touch it 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.910
 much 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.049
 eyebrows is another part that I always 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.979
 It has attracted a lot of attention because 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.009
 there are never the eyebrows that I like 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:51.369
 they are all as well as disheveled valdés 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.369
 Today aligned huge rare 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.750
 well that's fine they 're like that 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.580
 female 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.940
 and the height of the eyebrows so that 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.540
 look very scared like now nor do I 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.540
 angry 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.110
 an average height 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.130
 the eyelashes I think is new this is 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.720
 again because it does not sound like I've seen it 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.620
 before equal it refers to the length 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.930
 has tabs 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.770
 and the truth is that if you do not notice much 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.620
 you do not notice hardly anything 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.220
 but keep moving from one place to another 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.220
 head 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.910
 to see the little changes 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.460
 nobody looks good in profile 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.490
 I'm staying with this one that has eyebrows 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.940
 tabs up and down and the 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.430
 color of those of the iris you can combine 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.650
 two colors for the internal area in the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.260
 external zone within all this broad 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.580
 range of colors 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.580
 I'm going to put a blue indigo 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.090
 and for the interior I'll see if he catches 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.749
 a color more clarito so that it makes 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.749
 contrast 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.200
 the truth is that I do not like it very much 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.989
 it seems more extraterrestrial 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.989
 I'm going to put it up and it 's 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.819
 well we went to the nose to choose a 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.340
 nose is better to put it in profile 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.430
 and vary the types of noses that 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.430
 there is 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.209
 until you find one that convinces you 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.420
 there is usually one or two that are 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.010
 finalists and good at is that looking at one 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.890
 or another 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.349
 until one seems better than another and 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.349
 finally he stays 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.500
 there are things that I am going to touch because 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.500
 I like how it is and for not messing 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.320
 I'm going to fine tune the graves 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.450
 nasal 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.190
 and well I think this definitely 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.780
 I do not expect that you liked the video and 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.080
 well there are many more options but 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.500
 you can see them when you have the game 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.500
 a greeting
