00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello as gatherers and we want 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.880
 show them in the best possible way what 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 what are electric scooters 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.469
 the format and size similar to 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.719
 scooters master or having brake to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.900
 larger disc or shoe we are more 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.660
 boys with storage or luggage rack with 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.820
 larger engines with greater or lesser 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.400
 autonomy 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.560
 to our understanding for use in city 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.980
 They are far superior to ordinary motorcycles 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.700
 except for two factors autonomy and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.770
 speed 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.350
 highlighting these two unique factors are 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.380
 superior in all do not use apt not 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.050
 use oil have carburetor 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.790
 They have an exhaust pipe they do not use chains or 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.670
 no type of transmission do not have 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.350
 spark plugs do not make noise to anything even 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.080
 one realizes if the motorcycle is 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.670
 switched on or off they do not have changes of 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.190
 clutch with which the handling is very 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.790
 simple even with the rear brake 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.500
 front at the tips is like walking on 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.210
 bicycle without you you know walk in 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.729
 bicycle you know how to ride a scooter 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.640
 electrical thing else they do not have is 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.440
 maintenance of any kind and most 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.110
 important they work with an engine 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.290
 electric that is the same rear wheel 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.210
 which has a 5 year written warranty with 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.430
 your engine number and on behalf of the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.350
 owner who bought it the other advantage 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.090
 they have is that they are not patented 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.829
 with the people 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.649
 you also take the monthly payment from the 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.270
 patent the reason for this extension is 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.280
 the law requires patenting 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.710
 vehicles that have more than 48 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.229
 cubic centimeters and in this case not 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.789
 they have not a single cubic centimeter to 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.219
 have an idea later we'll talk 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.560
 better this is the wheel or this is the 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.100
 engine there is no other thing there is no chain no 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.110
 there is transmission 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.600
 in view of the people when buying us a 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.340
 electric scooter tells us that they are going to 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.590
 look for the return and you will have to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.630
 we mean patenting them all 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.790
 that these scooters are selling in 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.520
 Argentina that is four years that is 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.310
 more than 32 thousand motorcycles sold and for 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.200
 the moment they are not patented the day they are 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.739
 do it, we will do it as the brand 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.410
 law and sanseacabó let's say yes but 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.640
 let's go back to the scooter he hit by not having 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.980
 nothing more than an electric motor 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.230
 inserted in the wheels and some batteries 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.150
 that feed it there's nothing that 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.890
 can break more than some cable or that 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.010
 the batteries have run out and you have to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.800
 recharge the peronas and with the theme of 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.750
 the autonomy that are the only two 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.450
 factors in which heras not 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.830
 overcome theories we want to tell you that 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.230
 it's something that anyway 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.180
 perfectly to walk in the city the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.310
 average autonomy these scooters is from 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.140
 around 40 kilometers between 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.810
 load and load us for example 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.760
 we are in the light station to have 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.640
 account for what are 40 kilometers them 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.799
 commented that from the station lanús 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.410
 up to the obelisk measured with gps and 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.390
 exactly 13 kilometers with which to 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.269
 a person could come and go from the light 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.549
 to the obelisk with 26 kilometers and stay 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.840
 still 14 more kilometers to give by 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.609
 the neighborhood 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.320
 another example autonomy is that the points 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.870
 more extremes that exist in the capital 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.940
 federal have a distance from each other of 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.850
 21 kilometers we are talking about the 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.579
 most extreme points that are between núñez 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.459
 and villa riachuelo that is pretty with 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.500
 lomas de zamora is to say that he could go and 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.570
 come back from the most extreme points with 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.040
 one load with most of the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.570
 electric motorcycles since as they 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.579
 we discussed earlier and with less 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.290
 autonomy as there are also those that 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.480
 they can do much more distance 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.540
 inside anyway we already sell 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.280
 models that exceed this speed by 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.900
 what do I say this with regard to the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.810
 speed the vast majority of around 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.579
 of 40 kilometers per hour which is 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.750
 an interesting speed to walk in 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.330
 the city 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.020
 even taking into account that in many 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.970
 cities as capital or several cities 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.070
 they fine you if you walk more than 40 in the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.870
 street but as I told you there are new 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.910
 for quite some models exceeding this 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.370
 speed in order as we told the 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.990
 principle and we are convinced of the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.520
 electric motorcycle is the best option for 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.350
 walk in the city ​​because of all the 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.350
 factors mentioned above as 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.020
 be zero maintenance five years of 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.850
 written guarantee the non-payment of patents 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.519
 I never have spark plug problems 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.910
 Filled filters that escaped with 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.510
 garbage and will fall to broken carburetors 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.700
 spending on naphtha in oil in repairs 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.800
 etcetera etcetera for those who never 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.450
 I saw an electric scooter tell them 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.850
 that have higher acceleration than a 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.980
 estero with which is a barbarian to walk 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.590
 in traffic but good to these 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.200
 explanations let's see it working 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.689
 from the driver and from a person 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.580
 who is in the skill join me 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:50.900
 there comes an electric scooter 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.900
 observe that it does not make noise 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.790
 and the speed it takes in how much time 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.639
 the other block arrived 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.689
 is already in the corner 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.629
 Now let's do the same 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.169
 show but working while being 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.169
 from above
