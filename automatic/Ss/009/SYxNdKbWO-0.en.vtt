00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.660
 102 as the total world cup 20 52 as i 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.309
 titles won from April have a 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.800
 last the constructors title of the 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.690
 last year, however, take back the table 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.670
 number one the house of noone relies on 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.470
 confirmed sylvain guintolÃ¬ and return 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.540
 by marco melandri that with 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.540
 aprilia wins the title in 250 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.450
 in command of the Venetian house he rose to 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.150
 new manager of the Albesian question 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.950
 sports technician and his own product 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.750
 April opened its doors 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.000
 racing department where we could 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.650
 attend the planning phase of the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.650
 evolutionary steps of the rsv4 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.670
 a more real than virtual tumor here 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.439
 then software development e 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.899
 hardware with citadel in and strategies 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.909
 developed for racing a deed work 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.560
 to soften the torque curve e 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.979
 best to download the horses of the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.979
 superbike 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.840
 in the area of engine designers 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.790
 transmission and four men work 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.510
 between drawings and computer simulations 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.510
 components 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.369
 the challenge with the new regulation is one 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.140
 and it's called reliability 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.820
 our engine is probably that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.070
 which runs at the highest regimes has us 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.140
 told mario responsible batons 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.640
 of the engines and we had to find a 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.920
 small compromise at the level of 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.259
 limiter but more effort also 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.270
 in economic terms it was carried out 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.040
 in the test room with cycles developed for 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.190
 replicate all the tracks discover the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.080
 limits of fatigue of the bike a job 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.780
 this passing through eight banks 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.340
 test of which one dynamic the parameters 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.980
 of are those of monza for dosing 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.940
 instead it is enough 25 minutes to 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.940
 variable regime 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.020
 April also develops new components 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.239
 like the swingarm that is designed 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.310
 and realized the same one every year 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.980
 applies to the vsv 4 tank 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.230
 superbike available in different forms a 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.970
 depending on the pilot's preferences o 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.010
 for the steering plates 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.690
 the suspensions despite being ohlins are 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.010
 even if developed internally in 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.010
 synergy with the Swedish house 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.530
 a department made by men and boys 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.299
 here therefore gianfranco castiglioni that 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.000
 deals with vehicle dynamics 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.400
 simulating mechanical and technical loads 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.120
 to which the motorcycle is subjected during 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.430
 a race 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.709
 elena de cia instead works on software 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.900
 able to simulate a lap and 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.030
 allow to program the ECU 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.450
 saving valuable time and technicians in 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.450
 track
