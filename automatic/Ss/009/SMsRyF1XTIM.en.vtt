today<00:00:46.710> we're<00:00:46.920> all<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.760> tourists<00:00:48.390> at

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
today we're all a little tourists at

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.880 
today we're all a little tourists at
least<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> earlier<00:00:49.260> part<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> day

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
least for the earlier part of the day

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.700 
least for the earlier part of the day
and<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.700> moon<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.149> Taurus<00:00:51.600> runs<00:00:51.930> into<00:00:52.350> heart

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and that moon in Taurus runs into heart

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
and that moon in Taurus runs into heart
aspects<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.520> Pluto<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.120> Venus<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> get

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
aspects with Pluto and Venus we can get

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.439 
aspects with Pluto and Venus we can get
picky<00:00:55.350> about<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.300> our

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
picky about what we like we can get our

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
picky about what we like we can get our
fish<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.199> lunch<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.710> wasn't<00:00:59.100> cooked<00:00:59.370> quite

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
fish for lunch that wasn't cooked quite

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.270 
fish for lunch that wasn't cooked quite
right<00:01:00.120> there's<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.840> little<00:01:01.079> sort<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> grumpy

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
right there's this little sort of grumpy

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
right there's this little sort of grumpy
attitude<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
attitude but I think that's going to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.810 
attitude but I think that's going to
change<00:01:04.080> where<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> moon<00:01:04.710> changes<00:01:05.040> sides<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
change where the moon changes sides and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.500 
change where the moon changes sides and
the<00:01:06.000> moon<00:01:06.150> changes<00:01:06.420> signs<00:01:06.900> into<00:01:07.820> Gemini<00:01:08.820> which

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the moon changes signs into Gemini which

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.920 
the moon changes signs into Gemini which
is<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:10.290> air<00:01:10.560> sign<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.369> Gemini<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.510> connect

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
is an air sign and Gemini can connect

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.350 
is an air sign and Gemini can connect
with<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.799> Taurus<00:01:14.580> doesn't<00:01:15.030> want<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
with anything as Taurus doesn't want to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.170 
with anything as Taurus doesn't want to
connect<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.689> anything<00:01:16.729> Gemini<00:01:17.729> will

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
connect with anything Gemini will

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.300 
connect with anything Gemini will
basically<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.960> connect<00:01:19.320> dots<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.830> day<00:01:20.040> long

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
basically just connect dots all day long

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
basically just connect dots all day long

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.589 
a look at the other signs later or equal
sign<00:02:14.450> bashes<00:02:14.989> yeah<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.220> basically<00:02:16.940> what<00:02:17.420> this

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
really means though is that we can use

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.430 
really means though is that we can use
that<00:02:21.379> evening<00:02:22.010> energy<00:02:22.580> as<00:02:23.480> Jeff<00:02:23.930> said<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.319> his

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
that evening energy as Jeff said in his

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.880 
that evening energy as Jeff said in his
opening<00:02:24.500> remarks<00:02:25.480> as<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.780> potential<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.470> escape

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
opening remarks as a potential to escape

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.979 
opening remarks as a potential to escape
to<00:02:28.159> avoid<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.849> issues<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.209> are<00:02:29.480> important

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
to avoid the issues that are important

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.440 
to avoid the issues that are important
because<00:02:30.470> we<00:02:30.829> can<00:02:31.129> talk<00:02:31.459> our<00:02:31.640> way<00:02:31.700> around<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
because we can talk our way around the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.350 
because we can talk our way around the
edges<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:33.140> reality<00:02:34.040> rather<00:02:34.489> than<00:02:34.670> confronting

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
edges of reality rather than confronting

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.569 
edges of reality rather than confronting
it<00:02:35.510> directly<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.650> think<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.099> just<00:02:37.129> being

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
it directly and I think that just being

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.460 
it directly and I think that just being
aware<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:38.299> that's<00:02:38.450> what's<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.200> can

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
aware that that's what's going on can

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.220 
aware that that's what's going on can
help<00:02:39.769> us<00:02:39.950> stay<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.640> honest<00:02:41.150> side<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.780> that

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
help us stay on the honest side of that

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.559 
help us stay on the honest side of that
