long could be made up of hairs that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.620 
long could be made up of hairs that
would<00:00:24.230> loose<00:00:24.890> be<00:00:25.520> nearly<00:00:25.880> twice<00:00:26.150> as<00:00:26.210> long

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630

I'm<00:00:33.410> not<00:00:33.710> sure<00:00:33.890> how<00:00:34.040> easy<00:00:34.430> it's<00:00:34.670> gonna<00:00:34.760> be<00:00:34.940> to

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
I'm not sure how easy it's gonna be to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.330 
I'm not sure how easy it's gonna be to
do<00:00:35.210> but<00:00:35.600> I'd<00:00:35.840> like<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.350> know<00:00:36.710> for<00:00:36.920> my<00:00:37.070> own

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
do but I'd like to know for my own

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.220 
do but I'd like to know for my own
knowledge<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.630> guys<00:00:38.900> can<00:00:39.079> see

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
knowledge and so you guys can see

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.229 
knowledge and so you guys can see
because<00:00:39.590> I<00:00:40.010> have<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.370> feeling<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:40.910> are<00:00:41.060> going

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
because I have a feeling that are going

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.350 
because I have a feeling that are going
to<00:00:41.360> waste<00:00:41.630> significantly<00:00:42.410> more<00:00:42.649> on<00:00:42.890> their<00:00:43.070> wet

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
to waste significantly more on their wet

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.550 
to waste significantly more on their wet
okay<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:44.420> it<00:00:44.600> turns<00:00:44.810> out<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.140> is<00:00:45.260> very

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
okay so it turns out it is very

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.650 
okay so it turns out it is very
difficult<00:00:46.130> to<00:00:46.550> weigh<00:00:46.700> dreadlocks<00:00:47.180> while<00:00:47.450> they

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
difficult to weigh dreadlocks while they

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.330 
difficult to weigh dreadlocks while they
are<00:00:47.809> still<00:00:48.050> attached<00:00:48.470> to<00:00:48.620> your<00:00:48.710> head<00:00:49.040> and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
although I'll do lots of things in the

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.110 
although I'll do lots of things in the
name<00:00:51.260> of<00:00:51.290> my<00:00:52.010> youtube<00:00:52.309> channel<00:00:52.340> I'm<00:00:52.760> not<00:00:52.969> going

sake of weighing it so this is as you
know<00:00:58.309> as<00:00:58.520> best<00:00:59.090> as<00:00:59.300> I<00:00:59.420> can<00:00:59.480> get<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.649> roughly

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
know as best as I can get to roughly

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.430

weighing my dreads while they're still

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.259 
weighing my dreads while they're still
attached<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.800> my<00:01:03.890> head<00:01:04.040> I'm<00:01:04.549> going<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:05.089> now

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
attached to my head I'm going to now

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.739 
attached to my head I'm going to now
weigh<00:01:05.569> one<00:01:06.259> individual<00:01:07.219> dreadlock<00:01:07.670> dry<00:01:08.389> and

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
weigh one individual dreadlock dry and

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:11.410 
weigh one individual dreadlock dry and
then<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.319> will<00:01:09.469> weigh<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.549> same<00:01:10.880> individual

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
then we will weigh that same individual

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.109 
then we will weigh that same individual
dreadlock<00:01:11.869> wet<00:01:12.200> because<00:01:13.159> it's<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:13.700> easier

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
dreadlock wet because it's it's easier

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.940 
dreadlock wet because it's it's easier
and<00:01:14.359> more<00:01:14.509> accurate<00:01:14.689> away<00:01:15.170> just<00:01:15.439> one<00:01:15.560> drill<00:01:15.829> at

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
and more accurate away just one drill at

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.419 
and more accurate away just one drill at
a<00:01:16.009> time

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
a time

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.940 
a time
okay<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:17.119> we've<00:01:17.299> picked<00:01:17.479> out<00:01:17.719> one<00:01:18.259> dreadlock

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
okay so we've picked out one dreadlock

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.789 
okay so we've picked out one dreadlock
that<00:01:19.279> I<00:01:19.490> will<00:01:19.939> be<00:01:20.149> able<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.450> find<00:01:21.049> again<00:01:21.409> once

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
that I will be able to find again once

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.309 
that I will be able to find again once
they're<00:01:22.069> wet<00:01:22.279> and<00:01:22.579> so<00:01:23.329> here<00:01:23.630> is<00:01:23.779> the<00:01:23.959> dry

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
they're wet and so here is the dry

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.649 
they're wet and so here is the dry
weight<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.889> this<00:01:25.219> one<00:01:25.490> dreadlock<00:01:25.969> and<00:01:26.179> we'll

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
weight of this one dreadlock and we'll

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.480 
weight of this one dreadlock and we'll
come<00:01:26.899> back<00:01:27.079> and<00:01:27.319> see<00:01:27.560> what<00:01:27.709> it<00:01:27.829> weighs<00:01:28.069> while

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
come back and see what it weighs while

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.480 
come back and see what it weighs while
they're<00:01:28.729> wet<00:01:28.999> ok<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:29.899> again<00:01:30.679> it's<00:01:31.189> really

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
they're wet ok so again it's really

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.269 
they're wet ok so again it's really
difficult<00:01:31.789> to<00:01:32.200> get<00:01:33.200> anything<00:01:33.560> like<00:01:34.009> an

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:34.279 
difficult to get anything like an

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:36.550 
difficult to get anything like an
accurate<00:01:34.700> weight<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.869> dreadlocks<00:01:36.139> while

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
accurate weight of dreadlocks while

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.599 
accurate weight of dreadlocks while
they're<00:01:36.740> still<00:01:36.950> attached<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.219> your<00:01:37.369> head<00:01:37.579> but

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
they're still attached to your head but

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.709 
they're still attached to your head but
these<00:01:38.179> are<00:01:39.079> now<00:01:39.380> wet<00:01:39.679> dreads<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.450> they<00:01:41.450> feel<00:01:41.689> a

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
these are now wet dreads and they feel a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.169 
these are now wet dreads and they feel a
lot<00:01:41.899> heavier<00:01:42.289> and<00:01:42.709> going<00:01:43.399> by<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.609> way<00:01:43.849> you

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
lot heavier and going by the way you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.230 
lot heavier and going by the way you
know<00:01:44.299> they<00:01:44.509> roughly<00:01:45.349> weigh<00:01:45.709> twice<00:01:46.069> as<00:01:46.310> much<00:01:46.520> so

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
know they roughly weigh twice as much so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.669 
know they roughly weigh twice as much so
you're<00:01:47.539> not<00:01:47.599> really<00:01:47.840> getting<00:01:48.049> an<00:01:48.319> accurate

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
you're not really getting an accurate

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.739 
you're not really getting an accurate
weight<00:01:49.159> of<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.429> dreads<00:01:49.700> but<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.299> kind<00:01:50.630> of

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
weight of the dreads but you can kind of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.779 
weight of the dreads but you can kind of
see<00:01:50.929> that<00:01:51.259> whatever<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.859> was<00:01:52.069> weighing<00:01:52.279> before

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
see that whatever I was weighing before

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.179 
see that whatever I was weighing before
I'm<00:01:53.149> weighing<00:01:53.539> it<00:01:53.779> again<00:01:54.020> now<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.709> it's<00:01:54.889> about

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
I'm weighing it again now and it's about

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.949 
I'm weighing it again now and it's about
twice<00:01:55.700> as<00:01:55.969> much<00:01:56.119> when<00:01:56.509> you're<00:01:56.630> actually<00:01:56.779> in

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
twice as much when you're actually in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.719 
twice as much when you're actually in
the<00:01:57.109> shower<00:01:57.349> they<00:01:57.709> weigh<00:01:57.979> even<00:01:58.189> more<00:01:58.549> than

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
the shower they weigh even more than

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.999 
the shower they weigh even more than
this<00:01:58.909> because<00:01:59.419> you<00:01:59.749> know<00:01:59.869> lots<00:02:00.469> of<00:02:00.619> water<00:02:00.829> has

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
this because you know lots of water has

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.679 
this because you know lots of water has
dripped<00:02:01.310> out<00:02:01.549> between<00:02:01.999> getting<00:02:02.329> out<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
dripped out between getting out of the

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.449 
dripped out between getting out of the
shower<00:02:02.719> and<00:02:03.079> coming<00:02:03.380> over<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.799> scale<00:02:04.039> this

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
shower and coming over to the scale this

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.609 
shower and coming over to the scale this
is<00:02:04.639> as<00:02:04.849> close<00:02:05.450> as<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.719> could<00:02:05.779> get<00:02:06.079> to<00:02:06.349> the<00:02:06.439> weight

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
is as close as I could get to the weight

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.820 
is as close as I could get to the weight
of<00:02:06.649> wet<00:02:07.009> dreads<00:02:07.279> will<00:02:07.579> weigh<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.479> one<00:02:09.319> dread

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
of wet dreads will weigh the one dread

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.260 
of wet dreads will weigh the one dread
that<00:02:10.040> we<00:02:10.130> weighed<00:02:10.310> before<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.970> hopefully

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
that we weighed before and hopefully

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.250 
that we weighed before and hopefully
that'd<00:02:11.570> be<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> little<00:02:11.930> bit<00:02:12.020> more<00:02:12.170> accurate

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
that'd be a little bit more accurate

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.440 
that'd be a little bit more accurate
again<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.070> can<00:02:13.250> see<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.790> weighs<00:02:13.970> pretty

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
again you can see that it weighs pretty

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.830 
again you can see that it weighs pretty
much

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
much

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.809 
much
twice<00:02:15.080> as<00:02:15.290> much<00:02:15.470> there<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.069> go<00:02:16.280> whatever<00:02:16.670> your

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
twice as much there you go whatever your

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.240 
twice as much there you go whatever your
dreads<00:02:17.060> way<00:02:17.300> dry<00:02:17.890> uh-huh

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
dreads way dry uh-huh

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.070 
dreads way dry uh-huh
if<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.879> think<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:20.180> heavy<00:02:20.360> then<00:02:20.599> they<00:02:20.840> can

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
if you think it's heavy then they can

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.199 
if you think it's heavy then they can
end<00:02:21.410> up<00:02:21.800> weighing<00:02:22.040> twice<00:02:22.519> as<00:02:22.760> much<00:02:22.970> when

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
end up weighing twice as much when

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.509 
end up weighing twice as much when
they're<00:02:23.420> wet<00:02:23.599> they<00:02:24.349> hold<00:02:24.620> up<00:02:24.800> water<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.340> a

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
they're wet they hold up water like a

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.059 
they're wet they hold up water like a
sponge<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.870> obviously<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.560> longer<00:02:27.920> your

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
sponge and obviously the longer your

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.309 
sponge and obviously the longer your
dreadlocks<00:02:28.519> grow<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.510> more<00:02:29.750> they're<00:02:30.019> going

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
dreadlocks grow the more they're going

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.530 
dreadlocks grow the more they're going
to<00:02:30.560> weigh<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.160> that's<00:02:31.640> gonna<00:02:31.879> be<00:02:32.060> pulling<00:02:32.420> on

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
to weigh and that's gonna be pulling on

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.740 
to weigh and that's gonna be pulling on
