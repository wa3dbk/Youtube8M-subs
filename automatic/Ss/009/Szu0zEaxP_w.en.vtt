00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.270 

it's<00:02:45.190> chocolate<00:02:45.400> mousse<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.150> solid

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
it's chocolate mousse on the in solid

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.520 
it's chocolate mousse on the in solid
and<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.549> got<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> kind<00:02:49.599> of<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.780> nutty<00:02:50.019> flavor<00:02:50.379> to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
and it's got a kind of a nutty flavor to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.610 
and it's got a kind of a nutty flavor to
it<00:02:50.709> as<00:02:50.920> well

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it as well

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.280 
it as well
I'm<00:02:53.620> not<00:02:53.799> quite<00:02:53.980> sure<00:02:54.010> it's<00:02:55.079> almost<00:02:56.079> got<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
I'm not quite sure it's almost got a

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.050 
I'm not quite sure it's almost got a
vaguely<00:02:56.530> peanut<00:02:57.040> flavor<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.549> it<00:02:57.579> I<00:02:57.730> don't<00:02:57.940> know

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
vaguely peanut flavor to it I don't know

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.800 
vaguely peanut flavor to it I don't know
there's<00:02:58.299> actually<00:02:58.450> peanuts<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.230> but<00:02:59.579> mmm

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
there's actually peanuts in it but mmm

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.470 
there's actually peanuts in it but mmm
it's<00:03:01.810> very<00:03:02.170> very<00:03:02.470> soft<00:03:02.799> though<00:03:03.129> so<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:04.359> be

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
it's very very soft though so to be

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.390 
it's very very soft though so to be
careful<00:03:04.870> with<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:04.989> one<00:03:05.159> and<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:07.269> next<00:03:07.450> one

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
careful with that one and the next one

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.640 
careful with that one and the next one
I'm<00:03:09.400> not<00:03:09.549> again<00:03:09.909> not<00:03:10.299> quite<00:03:10.510> sure<00:03:10.540> manager

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.759 

it's<00:03:14.650> another<00:03:14.859> chocolate<00:03:15.190> one<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:16.769> just

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
it's another chocolate one so just

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.879 
it's another chocolate one so just
trying<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.040> take<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.400> foil<00:03:18.609> off<00:03:18.819> this

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
trying to take the foil off this

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:36.270 
trying to take the foil off this
relatively<00:03:20.889> neatly<00:03:34.709> that's<00:03:35.709> another<00:03:36.010> soft

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
relatively neatly that's another soft

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.659 
relatively neatly that's another soft
one<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:38.590> one<00:03:38.769> tastes<00:03:39.129> virtually<00:03:39.519> the

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
one and that one tastes virtually the

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.490 
one and that one tastes virtually the
same<00:03:39.699> as<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.359> sweetie<00:03:40.660> except<00:03:41.169> it<00:03:41.260> doesn't

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
same as the sweetie except it doesn't

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.220 
same as the sweetie except it doesn't
have<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.709> nutty<00:03:41.919> flavor<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.579> so<00:03:43.230> maybe

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
have the nutty flavor to it so maybe

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.599 
have the nutty flavor to it so maybe
that's<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.590> nut<00:03:44.829> flavor<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.370> that's<00:03:45.489> the

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
that's the nut flavor and that's the

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.170 
that's the nut flavor and that's the
plain<00:03:45.819> flavor<00:03:46.349> I'm<00:03:47.349> not<00:03:47.470> really<00:03:47.620> sure<00:03:48.180> it's

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
plain flavor I'm not really sure it's

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.740 
plain flavor I'm not really sure it's
odd<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:51.310> our<00:03:52.239> last<00:03:52.569> one<00:03:53.879> is<00:03:54.879> a<00:03:55.299> mystery

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
odd that and our last one is a mystery

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.879 
odd that and our last one is a mystery
to<00:03:55.930> me<00:03:56.370> it's<00:03:57.599> these<00:03:58.599> it's<00:03:58.870> got<00:03:59.019> Mozart<00:03:59.590> on<00:03:59.799> the

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.960 
to me it's these it's got Mozart on the
front<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:01.889> I'm<00:04:02.889> not<00:04:03.040> sure<00:04:03.099> if<00:04:03.280> I'm<00:04:03.549> confident

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
front so I'm not sure if I'm confident

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.729 
front so I'm not sure if I'm confident
about<00:04:04.120> eating<00:04:04.480> Mozart<00:04:04.900> balls

it's<00:04:08.739> very<00:04:09.190> pretty<00:04:09.459> though<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.090> like<00:04:10.299> that

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
it's very pretty though I do like that

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.809 
it's very pretty though I do like that

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:40.719 
I'm not really sure what they are it's

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.360 
I'm not really sure what they are it's
sort<00:06:40.990> of<00:06:41.020> like<00:06:41.199> a<00:06:41.259> soft<00:06:41.710> chocolate<00:06:42.189> mousse

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
sort of like a soft chocolate mousse

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.059 
sort of like a soft chocolate mousse
with<00:06:42.610> a<00:06:43.080> coating<00:06:44.080> on<00:06:44.169> the<00:06:44.259> outside<00:06:44.289> I<00:06:44.830> don't

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.069 
with a coating on the outside I don't

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:46.439 
with a coating on the outside I don't
know<00:06:45.219> if<00:06:45.339> they<00:06:45.460> meant<00:06:45.639> to<00:06:45.699> be<00:06:45.909> that<00:06:46.089> soft<00:06:46.300> I

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
know if they meant to be that soft I

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.260 
know if they meant to be that soft I
think<00:06:46.629> maybe<00:06:46.779> air<00:06:47.050> travel<00:06:47.469> has<00:06:48.120> softened<00:06:49.120> them

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
think maybe air travel has softened them

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.600 
think maybe air travel has softened them
a<00:06:49.330> bit<00:06:49.479> more<00:06:49.689> than<00:06:49.839> they<00:06:49.930> probably<00:06:50.169> should<00:06:50.529> be

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
a bit more than they probably should be

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.209 
a bit more than they probably should be
but<00:06:51.719> they<00:06:52.719> taste<00:06:52.990> virtually<00:06:53.529> identical<00:06:54.069> to

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
but they taste virtually identical to

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.059 
but they taste virtually identical to
each<00:06:54.249> other<00:06:54.580> so<00:06:54.819> um<00:06:55.150> they're<00:06:56.139> not<00:06:56.169> bad<00:06:56.499> okay<00:06:57.039> I

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:57.069 
each other so um they're not bad okay I

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:58.920 
each other so um they're not bad okay I
would<00:06:57.339> give<00:06:57.460> him<00:06:57.550> a<00:06:57.669> 7<00:06:57.819> out<00:06:58.029> of<00:06:58.059> 10<00:06:58.240> H<00:06:58.509> on<00:06:58.749> those
