about faith and different academic areas
was<00:00:18.520> just<00:00:18.730> going<00:00:18.880> to<00:00:19.050> want<00:00:20.050> to<00:00:20.109> make<00:00:20.199> me<00:00:20.320> learn

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
was just going to want to make me learn

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.550 
was just going to want to make me learn
more<00:00:20.680> and<00:00:20.890> study<00:00:21.880> under<00:00:22.119> them<00:00:22.410> when<00:00:23.410> he<00:00:23.470> came

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
more and study under them when he came

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.109 
more and study under them when he came
down<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.890> it<00:00:23.949> me<00:00:24.130> my<00:00:24.250> parents<00:00:24.550> talked<00:00:24.760> and<00:00:25.000> then

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
down to it me my parents talked and then

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.630 
down to it me my parents talked and then
I<00:00:25.480> chose<00:00:25.779> that<00:00:25.869> in<00:00:26.019> you<00:00:26.109> and<00:00:26.260> came<00:00:26.410> here<00:00:26.619> and<00:00:26.890> it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
I chose that in you and came here and it

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.070 
I chose that in you and came here and it
was<00:00:27.760> it<00:00:28.090> was<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.269> struggle<00:00:28.449> to<00:00:28.689> get<00:00:28.779> here<00:00:28.960> than

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
was it was a struggle to get here than

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.390 
was it was a struggle to get here than
once<00:00:29.260> I<00:00:29.320> got<00:00:29.439> here<00:00:29.500> I<00:00:29.679> learned<00:00:29.859> I<00:00:29.980> realized<00:00:30.250> it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
once I got here I learned I realized it

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.869 
once I got here I learned I realized it
was<00:00:30.519> the<00:00:30.730> best<00:00:31.359> choice<00:00:31.449> I<00:00:31.720> ever<00:00:31.750> made<00:00:31.929> and<00:00:32.879> no

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
was the best choice I ever made and no

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.910 
was the best choice I ever made and no
other<00:00:34.090> college<00:00:35.019> or<00:00:35.170> university<00:00:35.320> would<00:00:35.710> suit

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
other college or university would suit

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.140 
other college or university would suit
me<00:00:36.070> better<00:00:37.620> neuroscience<00:00:38.620> or

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
me better neuroscience or

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.670 
me better neuroscience or
neuropsychology<00:00:40.150> kind<00:00:40.420> of<00:00:40.510> study<00:00:40.690> of<00:00:40.750> the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
neuropsychology kind of study of the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
neuropsychology kind of study of the
brain<00:00:41.860> and<00:00:42.250> how<00:00:42.519> it<00:00:42.549> how<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.059> functions<00:00:43.479> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
brain and how it how it functions and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.180 
brain and how it how it functions and
what<00:00:46.239> happens<00:00:46.570> when<00:00:46.659> it's<00:00:47.199> not<00:00:47.500> working

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
what happens when it's not working

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.420 
what happens when it's not working
correctly<00:00:49.409> when<00:00:50.409> there's<00:00:50.619> brain<00:00:51.010> disorders

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
correctly when there's brain disorders

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.810 
correctly when there's brain disorders
or<00:00:51.839> dysfunction<00:00:53.100> there's<00:00:54.100> different<00:00:54.460> tests

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
or dysfunction there's different tests

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.649 
or dysfunction there's different tests
in<00:00:54.970> different<00:00:56.519> imaging<00:00:57.519> techniques<00:00:57.970> that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
in different imaging techniques that

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.679 
in different imaging techniques that
people<00:00:59.080> use<00:00:59.379> to<00:00:59.409> kind<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.369> discover<00:01:01.180> these<00:01:01.360> and

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:01.689 
people use to kind of discover these and

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:05.640 
people use to kind of discover these and
so<00:01:02.080> what<00:01:02.589> I'm<00:01:02.830> essentially<00:01:03.220> doing<00:01:03.400> is<00:01:04.650> medical

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
so what I'm essentially doing is medical

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.460 
so what I'm essentially doing is medical
schools<00:01:05.890> have<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.430> pretty<00:01:07.300> similar<00:01:07.750> set<00:01:08.440> of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
schools have a pretty similar set of

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.470 
schools have a pretty similar set of
requirements<00:01:08.650> for<00:01:09.370> entrance<00:01:09.760> it<00:01:09.970> includes

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
requirements for entrance it includes

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.180 
requirements for entrance it includes
usually<00:01:11.320> a<00:01:11.380> year<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.800> general<00:01:12.040> biology

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
usually a year of general biology

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
usually a year of general biology

what<00:01:20.650> I<00:01:20.710> did<00:01:20.770> was<00:01:20.890> research<00:01:21.340> schools<00:01:21.760> I'm<00:01:22.000> most

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
what I did was research schools I'm most

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.750 
what I did was research schools I'm most
interested<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.980> with<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.070> programs<00:01:24.430> i<00:01:24.550> like

that they have alongside my my

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.840 
that they have alongside my my

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
neuroscience requirements with my

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.000 
neuroscience requirements with my
classes<00:01:34.240> I<00:01:34.510> mean<00:01:34.990> they're<00:01:35.230> they're<00:01:35.530> all

time studying in a long time with my
professors<00:01:44.530> talking<00:01:45.130> with<00:01:45.370> them<00:01:45.460> about

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
professors talking with them about

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.100 
professors talking with them about
classes<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.540> I<00:01:46.600> know<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:47.020> with<00:01:47.860> my<00:01:47.979> classes

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
classes and I know that with my classes

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.540 
classes and I know that with my classes
my<00:01:50.110> teachers<00:01:50.409> go<00:01:50.620> above<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:50.890> beyond<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.310> teach

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
my teachers go above and beyond to teach

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.760 
my teachers go above and beyond to teach
me<00:01:51.760> and<00:01:52.060> make<00:01:52.479> sure<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.690> know<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:53.050> concepts

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
me and make sure I know the concepts

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.469 
me and make sure I know the concepts
that<00:01:53.830> we're<00:01:54.010> learning<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:55.090> concepts

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
that we're learning and the concepts

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.060 
that we're learning and the concepts
that<00:01:55.570> build<00:01:55.810> on<00:01:55.900> one<00:01:56.050> another<00:01:56.080> people<00:01:56.920> say

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
that build on one another people say

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.530 
that build on one another people say
that<00:01:57.100> biology<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.909> lot<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.150> memorization

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
that biology is a lot of memorization

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.289 
that biology is a lot of memorization
which<00:01:58.870> it<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.140> but<00:01:59.890> our<00:02:00.460> professors<00:02:00.970> take<00:02:01.150> that

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
which it is but our professors take that

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.030 
which it is but our professors take that
one<00:02:01.450> step<00:02:01.479> further<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.200> turn<00:02:02.890> into

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
one step further and turn into

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.039 
one step further and turn into
application<00:02:03.670> especially<00:02:04.479> with<00:02:04.930> the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
application especially with the

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.950 
application especially with the
psychology<00:02:05.530> department<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:06.130> mean

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
psychology department I mean
