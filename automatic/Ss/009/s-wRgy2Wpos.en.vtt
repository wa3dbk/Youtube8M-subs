00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello, my name is Olya 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.660
 today I will tell you a very interesting 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.480
 watercolor effect that achieves 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.370
 using plain paper today we will 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.740
 draw poppies 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.109
 so we take a squirrel tassel I took 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.369
 four 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:22.340
 at night we take a bright red color 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:27.230
 water 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.230
 We start to notice our magicians 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.630
 choose outlined a sand flower with 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.660
 instructions have been set aside for now 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.710
 the flower hasn't dried up we take our crumpled disc 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:55.230
 and attach to the very cent 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:58.280
 see that paper collects water here 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.280
 such an interesting effect 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.909
 while we have 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.290
 the core is not fully up yet we 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:19.549
 take pure black in this crumpled 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.549
 the core we make daughters such here 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.390
 precisely due to the fact due to our 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.220
 We have a little effect at this point too. 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.220
 There is such an interesting effect 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.460
 to put any dots turned out 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.760
 core until our flower dries up we 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:50.100
 take pure green and abstract 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:53.520
 draw stalk tassels are small there is no image 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.450
 already as it were, the schmo becomes like 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:03.350
 little flower though my brush come back 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:09.720
 to our bright red color we begin 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:11.869
 push our petals out like that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.869
 way 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.190
 you can add a little bright yellow 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:37.810
 dots skin by color do not be clean just 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:37.810
 on the bi because we take the black 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.120
 drawings drawings 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:57.360
 here you can add another 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:58.470
 unopened unrevealed until we take 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.870
 thinking of me 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.440
 and right there at our pick brackets 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.170
 to the sound 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:16.230
 they took the image of our paint 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:18.860
 here we have changed the black color 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.120
 Bud after all, take the green color 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.360
 abstract its 200 black 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.900
 here you can draw an abstract 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.900
 spilling it with water 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.240
 here it is the color back to our 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.510
 revealed 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.940
 the kim is drowned by the pulp of attention and 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.290
 soar in the paints we drew 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.610
 interesting abstract paintings with poppies 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.610
 draw with us
