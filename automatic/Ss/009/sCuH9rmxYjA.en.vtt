00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.579 

I<00:00:01.700> guess<00:00:02.700> we're<00:00:02.850> gonna<00:00:02.939> take<00:00:03.240> test<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.929> vertex

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
I guess we're gonna take test the vertex

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.600 
I guess we're gonna take test the vertex
our<00:00:05.190> di<00:00:05.700> system<00:00:06.740> here's<00:00:07.740> two<00:00:08.010> identical

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
our di system here's two identical

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.919 
our di system here's two identical
pictures<00:00:08.990> both<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.230> them<00:00:10.349> hold<00:00:10.620> 64<00:00:11.400> ounces<00:00:11.929> as

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
pictures both of them hold 64 ounces as

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.919 
pictures both of them hold 64 ounces as
you<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.139> see<00:00:13.320> right<00:00:13.469> there<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.580> right<00:00:15.509> there

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
you can see right there and right there

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.109 
you can see right there and right there
the<00:00:16.590> blue<00:00:16.859> line<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.340> waistline<00:00:17.910> that

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the blue line is the waistline that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.170 
the blue line is the waistline that
comes<00:00:18.300> off<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> back<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.250> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.850> back<00:00:21.000> of

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
comes off the back of the of the back of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.450 
comes off the back of the of the back of
the<00:00:21.240> system<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.230> way<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.529> there<00:00:22.740> goes<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the system all the way up there goes to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.029 
the system all the way up there goes to
the<00:00:23.580> wall<00:00:23.760> back<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:24.170> comes<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the wall back there comes out here and

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
the wall back there comes out here and
goes<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.550> usually<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.029> picked<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
goes in here usually it's picked up to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.460 
goes in here usually it's picked up to
the<00:00:28.070> waste<00:00:29.070> Inlet<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.179> claim<00:00:30.470> comes

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
the waste Inlet and the claim comes

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.490 
the waste Inlet and the claim comes
right<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:32.510> it<00:00:33.510> comes<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> white<00:00:34.320> line

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
right here it comes like the white line

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.240 
right here it comes like the white line
comes<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> DI<00:00:35.850> chamber<00:00:36.450> there<00:00:36.600> so

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
comes out of the DI chamber there so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.720 
comes out of the DI chamber there so
both<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.489> both<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.450> containers<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.020> empty

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:01:03.780 

we're<00:00:44.730> gonna<00:00:44.850> go<00:00:45.059> ahead<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.539> turn<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.750> on

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.180 

one<00:01:04.420> minute<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.809> five<00:01:05.080> into<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.740> video<00:01:06.010> is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
one minute of five into the video is

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:18.300 
one minute of five into the video is
when<00:01:06.280> we<00:01:06.400> start<00:01:06.640> producing<00:01:06.850> water

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.370 

we'll<00:01:18.850> stop<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.210> video<00:01:19.480> and<00:01:19.660> we<00:01:19.780> have<00:01:19.930> 64

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
we'll stop the video and we have 64

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:45.240 
we'll stop the video and we have 64
ounces<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:20.980> either<00:01:21.340> one<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.990> two<00:01:22.990> pictures

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.330 

we<00:01:46.060> are<00:01:46.150> making<00:01:46.420> zero<00:01:47.040> parts<00:01:48.040> per<00:01:48.190> million

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
we are making zero parts per million

00:01:48.340 --> 00:02:02.880 
we are making zero parts per million
water

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:16.160 

okay

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.460 

usually<00:02:16.860> goes<00:02:17.010> off<00:02:17.160> briefly<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:19.050> then<00:02:19.140> drops

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
usually goes off briefly and then drops

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.370 
usually goes off briefly and then drops
back<00:02:19.560> down<00:02:19.740> as<00:02:20.280> we're<00:02:20.520> making<00:02:20.700> water<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:22.320> you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
back down as we're making water so you

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.360 
back down as we're making water so you
because<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:22.740> been<00:02:22.890> sitting<00:02:23.040> for<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.310> little

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
because it's been sitting for a little

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.760 
because it's been sitting for a little
bit<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:25.250> got<00:02:26.250> went<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.520> 2.9<00:02:27.290> ppm<00:02:28.290> that's<00:02:28.560> going

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
bit I got went to 2.9 ppm that's going

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:49.890 
bit I got went to 2.9 ppm that's going
back

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.690 

you<00:02:50.439> can<00:02:50.560> see<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.890> color<00:02:51.129> of<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.400> water<00:02:51.579> is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
you can see the color of the water is

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.640 
you can see the color of the water is
different<00:02:51.939> the<00:02:52.840> blue<00:02:53.049> line<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.439> definitely

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
different the blue line is definitely

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.330 
different the blue line is definitely
the<00:02:53.890> wastewater<00:02:58.409> sorrow<00:02:59.409> system<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.010> down<00:03:00.129> to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
the wastewater sorrow system is down to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:44.160 
the wastewater sorrow system is down to
two

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.390 

made<00:03:44.740> about<00:03:44.860> 64<00:03:45.370> ounces<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:47.070> three<00:03:48.070> minutes

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
made about 64 ounces and three minutes

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.440 
made about 64 ounces and three minutes
and<00:03:48.550> 50<00:03:48.820> seconds<00:03:49.210> and<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:51.100> time<00:03:51.280> before<00:03:51.460> this

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.450 

where<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.540> wastewater<00:03:55.870> was<00:03:56.290> 60<00:03:56.740> ounces<00:03:56.890> and

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
where the wastewater was 60 ounces and

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.760 
where the wastewater was 60 ounces and
their<00:03:57.550> clean<00:03:57.820> water<00:03:58.090> product<00:03:58.810> where<00:03:58.960> was<00:03:59.140> 64

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
their clean water product where was 64

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.990 
their clean water product where was 64
ounces<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.130> system<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.520> back<00:04:03.700> down<00:04:03.850> to

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
ounces and the system is back down to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:22.710 
ounces and the system is back down to
zero<00:04:04.210> ppm

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.330 

probably<00:04:23.380> it's<00:04:23.500> time<00:04:23.680> for<00:04:23.860> me<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.040> change<00:04:24.220> my

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
probably it's time for me to change my

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.820 
probably it's time for me to change my
di<00:04:24.580> arisen<00:04:24.960> stole<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.080> original<00:04:26.410> one<00:04:26.530> up<00:04:26.680> and

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
di arisen stole the original one up and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:38.480 
di arisen stole the original one up and
running<00:04:27.070> for<00:04:27.220> six<00:04:27.700> to<00:04:27.820> eight<00:04:27.880> months<00:04:28.060> now

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.250 

what's<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.240> we're<00:04:39.390> making<00:04:39.510> product<00:04:39.990> water<00:04:40.140> a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
what's that we're making product water a

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.360 
what's that we're making product water a
little<00:04:40.500> quicker<00:04:40.740> at<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.100> wastewater<00:04:43.340> yeah

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
little quicker at that wastewater yeah

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.000 
little quicker at that wastewater yeah
we're<00:04:44.850> approaching<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.630> 56<00:04:46.440> ounce<00:04:46.650> Mart

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
we're approaching the 56 ounce Mart

00:04:47.010 --> 00:05:01.459 
we're approaching the 56 ounce Mart
there<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.730> we<00:04:48.570> haven't<00:04:49.110> reached<00:04:49.710> there<00:04:50.130> yet

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.459 

when<00:05:02.009> reached<00:05:02.249> 64<00:05:02.759> I'm<00:05:02.849> gonna<00:05:02.999> pull<00:05:03.179> the<00:05:03.300> power

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
when reached 64 I'm gonna pull the power

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.079 
when reached 64 I'm gonna pull the power
which<00:05:04.469> shuts<00:05:04.769> off<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.189> booster<00:05:05.519> pump<00:05:05.849> in<00:05:06.029> the

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:06.089 
which shuts off the booster pump in the

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:12.949 
which shuts off the booster pump in the
cell<00:05:06.300> night<00:05:10.189> looks<00:05:11.189> like<00:05:11.459> we're<00:05:11.699> there<00:05:11.969> just<00:05:12.869> a

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:12.959 
cell night looks like we're there just a

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:21.879 
cell night looks like we're there just a
couple<00:05:13.139> seconds<00:05:19.189> can<00:05:20.189> see<00:05:20.429> it's<00:05:21.179> right<00:05:21.389> there

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
couple seconds can see it's right there

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.239 
couple seconds can see it's right there
and<00:05:22.889> with<00:05:23.249> a<00:05:23.279> little<00:05:23.489> bit<00:05:23.580> low<00:05:23.789> there<00:05:25.159> all<00:05:26.159> you

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:26.249 
and with a little bit low there all you
