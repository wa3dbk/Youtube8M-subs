00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.020 
here to these zero or the open fret but
it's<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:58.170> E<00:00:58.350> minor<00:00:58.469> shape<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.520> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it's really just an E minor shape so the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.020 
it's really just an E minor shape so the
intro<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.590> gonna<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.030> actually

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
intro there is gonna be actually

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
intro there is gonna be actually
starting<00:01:03.300> from<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.570> solo<00:01:03.870> idea<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
starting from this solo idea on the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:15.070 
starting from this solo idea on the
twelfth<00:01:04.739> fret<00:01:04.860> D<00:01:05.369> string

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.070 

and<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.290> ring<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> 12th<00:01:17.130> fret<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.430> D

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.110 

I<00:01:22.160> thought<00:01:23.160> that<00:01:23.250> two<00:01:23.370> times<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:23.910> goes

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
I thought that two times and then goes

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.940 
I thought that two times and then goes
into<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.480> so<00:01:24.660> you've<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.410> solo<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
into it so you've got your solo at the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:43.120 
into it so you've got your solo at the
beginning<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.940> this<00:01:27.420> power<00:01:27.780> chord

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.370 

leading<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> into<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.670> first<00:01:45.150> with<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> same

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
leading you into the first with the same

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.650 
leading you into the first with the same
pushes<00:01:46.800> then<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.000> comes<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.300> of<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
pushes then as it comes out of that it

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:59.940 
pushes then as it comes out of that it
just<00:01:48.810> goes<00:01:48.960> right<00:01:49.140> into<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.350> straight

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.910 

with<00:02:00.950> these<00:02:01.700> kind<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.000> harmonic<00:02:02.960> scrapes<00:02:03.380> let

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
with these kind of harmonic scrapes let

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.370 
with these kind of harmonic scrapes let
me<00:02:04.010> get<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.310> sound<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:05.180> just<00:02:05.540> me<00:02:06.140> five

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
me get that sound it's just me five

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.090 
me get that sound it's just me five
again<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:07.310> relax<00:02:07.970> that'd<00:02:08.600> be<00:02:08.899> five<00:02:09.259> I<00:02:09.649> have

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
again then relax that'd be five I have

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.170 
again then relax that'd be five I have
my<00:02:10.250> middle<00:02:10.670> finger<00:02:11.000> reach<00:02:11.300> over<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.020> touch<00:02:12.590> a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
my middle finger reach over and touch a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:27.310 
my middle finger reach over and touch a
string<00:02:23.860> while<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.100> your<00:02:25.130> scrapes<00:02:26.320> that

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
string while you do your scrapes that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:37.229 
string while you do your scrapes that
works<00:02:27.500> perfect<00:02:31.060> I'll<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.270> again

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.970 

two<00:02:38.239> times<00:02:38.480> through<00:02:38.750> back<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.800> first

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
two times through back to the first

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.949 
two times through back to the first
three<00:02:40.250> which<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.670> same<00:02:40.820> as<00:02:41.000> verse<00:02:41.150> two<00:02:41.420> um

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
the only other different part in this

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.000 
the only other different part in this
song<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.450> basically<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.320> bridge<00:02:45.620> when<00:02:45.980> it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
song is basically the bridge when it
