00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.660
 hello today i will tell you about the imperator this is the last born 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.940
 from Lagarde, which was presented at the 2007 Frankfurt Salon, it exists 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.280
 in two versions over the country 2009 that on the knees 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.210
 the hyper 3000 that stands up 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.720
 the wrong pair adopts the classic form of a single that clouet 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.679
 with 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:25.580
 a body 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.880
 a little bit more 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.739
 a cut here for the stomach 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.210
 we note the work that has been done to make access to acute e e enough 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.940
 easy 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.780
 so then we granted what day a table was covered in maple 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.130
 stroll 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.550
 a penguin everything has been solved also with him an ebony fingerboard 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.190
 the casting was signed boto 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.250
 and the pickups are 0 Dinar a bit of a high-pitched area and a virtual replace 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.780
 obstacle 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.910
 each microphone has its own volume 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.030
 here the volume of the microphone acute 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.980
 here microgram volume 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.970
 and the tone is shared 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.030
 because very interesting in terms of sounds 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.470
 what we have 2 push push on the volumes 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.730
 and so 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.860
 kante the potentiometer is raised 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.350
 the microphone explain so we have 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.600
 only one of the two windings that works 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.830
 and we have a simple sound 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.939
 and 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.389
 and then it's very interesting about the intermediate repetition of the 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.439
 selector what we had two microphones at once 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.550
 so we can have 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.190
 either the two doubles 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.500
 either the two split in singles 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.780
 is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.090
 one of the two doubles and the other 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.580
 spica in simple 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.580
 to show us what it's like at summer level 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.360
 so here we start with the two doubles 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.040
 millions 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.200
 not 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.180
 the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.080
 mu 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.870
 youth and then both 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.140
 a mini 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
 d 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.519
 the alsace clicks only the microphone so he wants 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.590
 and the serious microphone is duplicate a mine 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.029
 he had made the difference 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.069
 acute microphone 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.429
 double bass micro piter 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.429
 thousands 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.650
 a rise of yesterday on this 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.359
 the opposition gives us 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.869
 four different sounds 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.979
 then on each microphone of course we can also 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.469
 to have both 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.080
 sounds so here 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.080
 the treble in double this 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:48.839
 the idea itself 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.839
 mm mm 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:55.719
 the engraving double 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.719
 m a 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:01.770
 the drama this summer 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.770
 she is an employee 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.620
 let's now see some 107 parish priest of this size 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.620
 imperador 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.159
 m 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.000
 so all this gives this lagoon a rather impressive sound palette 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.399
 in conclusion the imperator with a guitar 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.150
 comfortable with a handle really nice to play 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.690
 and with a very large sound palette 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.690
 thanks to these two microphones and its electronics 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.189
 Goodbye and see you soon
