projections accordingly with this the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.710 
projections accordingly with this the
projector<00:01:11.939> could<00:01:12.060> actually<00:01:12.180> cut<00:01:12.540> out

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
projector could actually cut out

furniture<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.740> project<00:01:14.189> onto<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.640> just

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
furniture and not project onto that just

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.270 
furniture and not project onto that just
project<00:01:15.360> onto<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> wall<00:01:16.020> behind<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.650> also

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
project onto the wall behind it also

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.130 
project onto the wall behind it also
using<00:01:17.580> some<00:01:17.729> very<00:01:17.909> interesting<00:01:18.240> filters<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
using some very interesting filters it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.210 
thing continuing to talk about movies
here<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.720> next<00:03:16.019> story<00:03:16.200> isn't<00:03:16.440> about<00:03:16.560> how<00:03:16.829> big

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
here this next story isn't about how big

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.699 
here this next story isn't about how big
the<00:03:17.430> film<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.879> it's<00:03:18.450> about<00:03:18.569> how<00:03:18.810> small<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.560> is

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
the film is it's about how small it is

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.650 
the film is it's about how small it is
the<00:03:20.010> awesome<00:03:20.280> people<00:03:20.519> over<00:03:20.730> at<00:03:20.819> IBM<00:03:21.359> have

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
the awesome people over at IBM have

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.330 
the awesome people over at IBM have
pulled<00:03:21.930> off<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.109> rather<00:03:22.380> interesting<00:03:22.829> feet

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
pulled off a rather interesting feet

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.400 
pulled off a rather interesting feet
today<00:03:23.549> they've<00:03:23.970> created<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.540> smallest<00:03:25.170> ever

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
today they've created the smallest ever

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.920 
today they've created the smallest ever
stop<00:03:25.859> motion<00:03:26.370> film<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.209> smallest<00:03:27.690> like

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
stop motion film and not smallest like

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.229 
stop motion film and not smallest like
it's<00:03:28.109> like<00:03:28.200> one-second<00:03:28.920> long<00:03:29.160> smallest<00:03:29.970> like

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
it's like one-second long smallest like

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.849 
it's like one-second long smallest like
the<00:03:30.450> film<00:03:30.690> was<00:03:30.870> created<00:03:31.260> by<00:03:31.380> moving<00:03:31.620> atoms

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
the film was created by moving atoms

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.610 
the film was created by moving atoms
around<00:03:32.700> on<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> very<00:03:33.299> flat<00:03:33.660> surface<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:34.500> you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
around on a very flat surface here you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.289 
around on a very flat surface here you
can<00:03:34.709> see<00:03:34.889> a<00:03:34.920> series<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.280> dots<00:03:35.579> each<00:03:35.910> one<00:03:36.269> of

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
can see a series of dots each one of

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.089 
can see a series of dots each one of
those<00:03:36.480> dots<00:03:36.780> are<00:03:36.959> actually<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> single<00:03:37.950> atom

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
those dots are actually a single atom

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.220 
those dots are actually a single atom
now<00:03:38.790> by<00:03:39.000> changing<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.420> place<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.780> those<00:03:39.870> atoms

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
now by changing the place of those atoms

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.289 
now by changing the place of those atoms
over<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.799> over<00:03:40.950> again<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.790> people<00:03:42.060> over<00:03:42.180> at

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
over and over again the people over at

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.479 
over and over again the people over at
IBM<00:03:42.840> we're<00:03:43.049> not<00:03:43.200> only<00:03:43.560> able<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.859> draw<00:03:44.250> out<00:03:44.280> a

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
IBM we're not only able to draw out a

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.490 
IBM we're not only able to draw out a
boy<00:03:44.790> playing<00:03:45.090> with<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.419> ball<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:46.260> also

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
boy playing with a ball but also

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.830 
boy playing with a ball but also
animated<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.519> movie<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.849> fairly<00:03:48.090> simple<00:03:48.389> but

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
animated the movie is fairly simple but

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.479 
animated the movie is fairly simple but
just<00:03:49.109> looking<00:03:49.470> at<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.889> don't<00:03:50.130> even<00:03:50.220> think<00:03:50.340> I

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
just looking at it I don't even think I

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.099 
just looking at it I don't even think I
could<00:03:50.549> draw<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.120> type<00:03:51.359> of<00:03:51.389> movie<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.079> a

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
could draw that type of movie like on a

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.050 
could draw that type of movie like on a
piece<00:03:52.349> of<00:03:52.380> paper<00:03:52.530> let<00:03:53.310> alone<00:03:53.459> move<00:03:53.790> around

way to share the atomic scale world the
reason<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:07.650> made<00:04:07.859> this<00:04:08.040> was<00:04:08.280> not<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.819> convey<00:04:09.090> a

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
reason we made this was not to convey a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.270 
reason we made this was not to convey a
scientific<00:04:09.780> message<00:04:10.139> directly<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:11.130> to

scientific message directly but to

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.039 
scientific message directly but to
engage<00:04:11.609> with<00:04:11.639> students<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.419> prompt<00:04:12.810> them<00:04:12.989> to

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
engage with students to prompt them to

engage with students to prompt them to
ask<00:04:13.290> questions<00:04:13.530> well<00:04:14.459> props<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.030> Andre

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
ask questions well props to you Andre

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.870 
ask questions well props to you Andre
because<00:04:15.930> well<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.169> think<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.799> succeeded<00:04:17.280> IBM

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
because well I think it succeeded IBM

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.759 
because well I think it succeeded IBM

high level that I think even for a
person<00:04:57.840> like<00:04:57.870> myself<00:04:58.110> who<00:04:58.590> stores<00:04:58.889> tons<00:04:59.370> of
