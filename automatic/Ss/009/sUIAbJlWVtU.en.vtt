00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629 

the<00:00:00.210> next<00:00:00.599> opening<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.230> an<00:00:01.860> opening<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.370> used

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
the next opening is an opening that used

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.999 
the next opening is an opening that used
to<00:00:02.760> be<00:00:02.879> played<00:00:03.120> quite<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.510> lot<00:00:03.780> at<00:00:03.899> one<00:00:04.170> time<00:00:04.440> but

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
to be played quite a lot at one time but

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.120 
to be played quite a lot at one time but
is<00:00:05.250> much<00:00:05.790> more<00:00:06.089> rarely<00:00:06.480> played<00:00:06.899> now<00:00:07.290> but<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:08.010> is

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
is much more rarely played now but it is

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.980 
is much more rarely played now but it is
significant<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.420> probably<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
significant in that is probably the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.490 
significant in that is probably the
oldest<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:10.980> so-called<00:00:11.340> gambits<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.630> when

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
oldest of the so-called gambits and when

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
oldest of the so-called gambits and when
you<00:00:13.620> come<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.099> look<00:00:14.309> more<00:00:14.549> deeply<00:00:14.820> into<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
you come to look more deeply into the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.050 
you come to look more deeply into the
openings<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.289> chess<00:00:16.619> you'll<00:00:17.310> find<00:00:17.670> that

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
openings in chess you'll find that

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.859 
openings in chess you'll find that
gambits<00:00:18.660> form<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.260> very<00:00:19.470> big<00:00:19.770> part<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
gambits form a very big part of it a

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.920 
gambits form a very big part of it a
gambit<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.050> basically<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.789> sacrifice<00:00:24.570> of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
gambit is basically just a sacrifice of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.070 
gambit is basically just a sacrifice of
usually<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.529> pawn<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.269> hope<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.750> getting

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
usually of a pawn in the hope of getting

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.600 
usually of a pawn in the hope of getting
a<00:00:28.609> stronger<00:00:29.609> position<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.390> return<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
a stronger position in return and

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.060 
a stronger position in return and
usually<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.300> porn<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.079> lost<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.800> very

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
usually the porn that is lost is very

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.270 
usually the porn that is lost is very
quickly<00:00:35.399> recovered<00:00:36.120> anyway<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:38.040> this

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
quickly recovered anyway now in this

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.139 
quickly recovered anyway now in this
King's<00:00:38.670> gambit<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.690> again<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.800> center<00:00:41.790> King

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
King's gambit the again the center King

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.760 
King's gambit the again the center King
porns<00:00:42.600> were<00:00:42.750> moved<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.559> fourth<00:00:43.890> row<00:00:44.570> and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
porns were moved to the fourth row and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.510 
porns were moved to the fourth row and
then<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.660> distinguishing<00:00:48.660> feature<00:00:49.010> was<00:00:50.010> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
then the distinguishing feature was that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.990 
then the distinguishing feature was that
white<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.420> play<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.110> move<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:53.520> one

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
white would then play this move now one

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.660 
white would then play this move now one
I<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.629> very<00:00:54.780> undesirable<00:00:55.469> aspects<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.489> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
I think very undesirable aspects of this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.819 
I think very undesirable aspects of this
and<00:00:56.910> probably<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.539> reason<00:00:57.750> why<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.199> opening

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and probably the reason why this opening

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.310 
and probably the reason why this opening
is<00:00:58.920> no<00:00:59.129> longer<00:00:59.340> very<00:00:59.609> popular<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
is no longer very popular is that it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
is no longer very popular is that it
immediately<00:01:01.800> takes<00:01:02.309> away<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> key

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
immediately takes away one of the key

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.100 
immediately takes away one of the key
defending<00:01:04.409> pawns<00:01:04.880> from<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.180> king<00:01:06.420> especially

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
defending pawns from the king especially

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.450 
defending pawns from the king especially
when<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.470> remember<00:01:07.950> when<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> King

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
when if you remember when the King

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.289 
when if you remember when the King
castles<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.299> hear<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.530> nevertheless<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:12.240> was

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
castles to hear but nevertheless it was

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.700 
castles to hear but nevertheless it was
played<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.500> worth<00:01:13.740> looking<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
played and it's worth looking at and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.249 
played and it's worth looking at and
typically<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.040> situation<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> gambit

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
typically in this situation the gambit

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.570 
typically in this situation the gambit
can<00:01:19.470> either<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:20.189> declined<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:21.439> accepted

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
can either be declined or accepted

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.100 
can either be declined or accepted
declining<00:01:23.580> would<00:01:23.970> mean<00:01:24.180> playing<00:01:24.570> something

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
declining would mean playing something

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.490 
declining would mean playing something
like<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.590> simply<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:26.970> or

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
like this simply not going for it or

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.350 
like this simply not going for it or
accepting<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.680> would<00:01:28.950> indeed<00:01:29.579> mean<00:01:29.970> taking

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
accepting it would indeed mean taking

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.719 
accepting it would indeed mean taking
the<00:01:30.750> pawn<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.439> gambit<00:01:31.799> adore<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.340> it's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the pawn the gambit adore as it's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.050 
the pawn the gambit adore as it's
sometimes<00:01:32.909> called<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.600> poisoned<00:01:34.259> pawn<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> we

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
sometimes called the poisoned pawn so we

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.679 
sometimes called the poisoned pawn so we
come<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> probably<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.329> next

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
come to here and then probably the next

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.069 
come to here and then probably the next
move<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.290> white<00:01:40.439> would<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.810> possibly<00:01:42.810> this

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
move for white would be possibly this

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.429 
move for white would be possibly this
move<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.939> thereafter<00:01:44.939> very<00:01:45.540> shortly<00:01:46.049> this

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
move and thereafter very shortly this

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.280 
move and thereafter very shortly this
porn<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.549> developed<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.750> he<00:01:49.110> now

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
porn would be developed so that he now

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.850 
porn would be developed so that he now
has<00:01:49.590> an<00:01:49.740> attack<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.490> has<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.570> of

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
has an attack and has a way of

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.749 
has an attack and has a way of
recovering<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.430> porn<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.460> as<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.610> say

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
recovering this porn here and as I say

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.539 
recovering this porn here and as I say
the<00:01:56.909> underlying<00:01:57.390> idea<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.979> does<00:01:59.189> get

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the underlying idea is that it does get

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.810 
the underlying idea is that it does get
the<00:01:59.610> pieces<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.360> quickly
