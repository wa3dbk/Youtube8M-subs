00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.500 
hi this is John on behalf of expert

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.499 
hi this is John on behalf of expert
village<00:00:04.500> in<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.220> video<00:00:05.670> clip<00:00:05.879> we'll<00:00:06.480> be

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
village in this video clip we'll be

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.610 
village in this video clip we'll be
calculating<00:00:07.309> siding<00:00:08.630> here<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> basic

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
calculating siding here we have a basic

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.299 
calculating siding here we have a basic
garage<00:00:11.400> with<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> hip<00:00:12.450> roof<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.889> need<00:00:14.099> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
garage with a hip roof and we need to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.820 
garage with a hip roof and we need to
calculate<00:00:14.700> how<00:00:15.000> much<00:00:15.420> siding<00:00:16.109> we're<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.770> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
calculate how much siding we're going to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.120 
calculate how much siding we're going to
need<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.100> buy<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> cover<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:18.090> four<00:00:18.570> sides<00:00:19.130> so

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
need to buy to cover all four sides so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.019 
need to buy to cover all four sides so
first<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:20.730> our<00:00:21.119> measurements<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:23.029> 20

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
first of all our measurements we have 20

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.349 
first of all our measurements we have 20
by<00:00:24.930> 20<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.730> it's<00:00:26.730> 8<00:00:27.480> feet<00:00:27.539> high<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.939> we<00:00:29.939> need<00:00:30.119> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
by 20 and it's 8 feet high so we need to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.350 
by 20 and it's 8 feet high so we need to
draw<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:31.080> each<00:00:31.769> side<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.850> we're<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
draw out each side that we're going to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.740 
draw out each side that we're going to
be<00:00:33.690> siding<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:35.250> need<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.670> calculate<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
be siding and we need to calculate the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.920 
be siding and we need to calculate the
square<00:00:37.140> footage<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:38.100> each<00:00:38.340> side<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.780> know

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
square footage for each side so we know

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.290 
square footage for each side so we know
that<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.410> sides<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.460> 8<00:00:41.820> feet<00:00:42.120> high

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.350 

by<00:00:45.980> 20<00:00:46.980> feet<00:00:47.160> long<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.059> we're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.300> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
by 20 feet long so we're going to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.630 
by 20 feet long so we're going to
calculate<00:00:48.600> those<00:00:49.079> together<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:50.719> 160

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
calculate those together and get 160

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.279 
calculate those together and get 160
square<00:00:53.640> footage<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.329> each<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.809> those<00:00:54.960> sides

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
square footage for each of those sides

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
square footage for each of those sides
now<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.610> our<00:00:56.640> side<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.629> garage<00:00:58.140> door<00:00:58.649> we

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
now for our side with the garage door we

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.360 
now for our side with the garage door we
know<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> entire<00:00:59.940> side<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.160> 160<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
know that the entire side is 160 and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.759 
know that the entire side is 160 and
we're<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> calculate<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.530> size

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
we're just going to calculate the size

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.670 
we're just going to calculate the size
of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> garage<00:01:05.580> door<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.210> subtract<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.290> from

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of the garage door and subtract it from

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.210 
of the garage door and subtract it from
our<00:01:08.330> side<00:01:10.010> now<00:01:11.010> our<00:01:11.369> garage<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.299> 16<00:01:13.229> by<00:01:13.500> 7<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
our side now our garage is 16 by 7 and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.410 
our side now our garage is 16 by 7 and
that<00:01:15.150> gives<00:01:15.360> me<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> total<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:16.020> 112<00:01:17.119> square<00:01:18.119> feet

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that gives me a total of 112 square feet

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
that gives me a total of 112 square feet
so<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> take<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.650> 112<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.640> take

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
so I'm going to take that 112 and take

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.980 
so I'm going to take that 112 and take
that<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.570> our<00:01:22.159> entire<00:01:23.159> side<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> 160<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that out of our entire side of 160 that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.649 
that out of our entire side of 160 that
leaves<00:01:25.259> me<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.500> 48<00:01:26.189> square<00:01:26.700> feet<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.540> I'm

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
leaves me with 48 square feet that I'm

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.800 
leaves me with 48 square feet that I'm
going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> side<00:01:28.409> now<00:01:29.180> if<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.299> add<00:01:30.479> up

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
going to need to side now if I add up

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.410 
going to need to side now if I add up
all<00:01:31.079> four<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> my<00:01:31.890> sides<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> three

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
all four of my sides I have the three

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.350 
all four of my sides I have the three
sides<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.170> are<00:01:34.320> 160<00:01:35.130> square<00:01:35.369> feet<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
sides that are 160 square feet and the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
sides that are 160 square feet and the
one<00:01:36.540> side<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> garage<00:01:37.439> door<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:38.040> 48

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
one side with the garage door that's 48

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.770 
one side with the garage door that's 48
that<00:01:39.210> gives<00:01:39.509> me<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> total<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.820> 528<00:01:41.820> square<00:01:42.360> feet

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that gives me a total of 528 square feet

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.160 
that gives me a total of 528 square feet
of<00:01:43.159> side<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> need<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.659> put<00:01:46.049> my

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of side that I'm going to need to put my

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.999 
of side that I'm going to need to put my
siding<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:47.600> however<00:01:48.600> when<00:01:48.990> ordering<00:01:49.409> siding
