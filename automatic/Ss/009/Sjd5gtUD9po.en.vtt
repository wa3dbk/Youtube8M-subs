of characters called guess in this case

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.040 
of characters called guess in this case
which<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.820> guess<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> user<00:00:27.720> makes

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
which is the guess that the user makes

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.330 
which is the guess that the user makes
because<00:00:28.470> we're<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.859> need<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.130> take<00:00:29.279> some

because we're going to need to take some
input<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.060> I've<00:00:30.630> also<00:00:30.779> added<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.410> printf

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
input and I've also added a printf

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.490 
input and I've also added a printf
statement<00:00:32.520> which<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:33.690> which

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
statement which you can see here which

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.889 
statement which you can see here which
simply<00:00:35.040> prints<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> screen<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.329> start

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
simply prints to the screen at the start

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.080 
simply prints to the screen at the start
what<00:00:37.770> word<00:00:37.980> has<00:00:38.219> been<00:00:38.430> selected<00:00:38.940> randomly

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
what word has been selected randomly

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.650 
what word has been selected randomly
from<00:00:39.540> our<00:00:39.989> array<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.469> words<00:00:40.910> what<00:00:41.910> index<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
from our array of words what index it

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.830 
from our array of words what index it
has<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.320> random<00:00:43.680> index<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> length<00:00:45.660> of

has so random index and the length of
that<00:00:45.899> word<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.440> well<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> we've<00:00:47.370> got

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that word as well just so that we've got

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.950 
that word as well just so that we've got
something<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> reference

something as a little bit of reference
for<00:00:49.140> later<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.190> compile<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
for later on if I go and compile the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.240 
for later on if I go and compile the
program<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.360> run<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.800> selected

program and run it here it's selected
windows<00:00:53.699> said<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.840> added<00:00:55.110> index<00:00:55.440> 3<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
windows said it's added index 3 in the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
windows said it's added index 3 in the
length<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.399> 7<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.090> go<00:00:57.210> back<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.870> array

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
length is 7 if I go back up to the array

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
length is 7 if I go back up to the array
you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.420> two<00:01:01.160> indeed

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
you can see that not one two indeed

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.700 
you can see that not one two indeed
Windows<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.820> index<00:01:03.210> three<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> has<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> length

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
Windows is index three and has a length

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.880 
Windows is index three and has a length
of<00:01:04.830> 7<00:01:05.400> characters<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> program<00:01:07.590> again

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
of 7 characters for in the program again

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.660 
of 7 characters for in the program again
this<00:01:09.110> time<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> was<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> purple<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.100> index<00:01:11.400> two

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
this time it was a purple at index two

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.499 
this time it was a purple at index two
and<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.479> length<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.900> 6<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.310> two<00:01:14.610> so

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and the length is 6 not one and two so

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.789 
and the length is 6 not one and two so
that's<00:01:15.630> simply<00:01:15.930> there<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> give<00:01:16.619> us<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that's simply there just to give us a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.109 
that's simply there just to give us a
bit<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> assistance<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.640> we're<00:01:17.729> running<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
bit of assistance when we're running the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.660 
bit of assistance when we're running the
program<00:01:18.950> what's<00:01:19.950> called<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> bugging

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
program what's called the bugging

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
program what's called the bugging
assistance<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> check<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:21.930> variables

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
assistance just to check what variables

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
assistance just to check what variables
are<00:01:22.799> being<00:01:22.860> stored<00:01:23.220> where<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.790> what<00:01:23.939> values

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
are being stored where and what values

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.719 
are being stored where and what values
they<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.680> ok<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.009> let's<00:01:26.189> look<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
they have ok so let's look at have a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.969 
they have ok so let's look at have a
look<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> user<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.840> game<00:01:28.229> loop<00:01:28.500> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
look at the user or the game loop in

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.020 
look at the user or the game loop in
this<00:01:30.049> video<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> games<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
this video so the way the games going to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.890 
this video so the way the games going to
run<00:01:33.210> we're<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> use<00:01:33.659> something<00:01:33.810> called

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
run we're going to use something called

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
run we're going to use something called
a<00:01:34.049> while<00:01:34.290> loop<00:01:34.619> which<00:01:35.369> you're<00:01:35.549> already

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
a while loop which you're already

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.480 
a while loop which you're already
familiar<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> say<00:01:37.590> but

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
familiar with and we're going to say but

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.210 
familiar with and we're going to say but
whilst<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.420> number<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.990> correct<00:01:40.320> letters

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
whilst the number of correct letters

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.420 
whilst the number of correct letters
guessed<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:42.150> less<00:01:42.570> than<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.890> length<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
guessed is less than the length of the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.750 
guessed is less than the length of the
word<00:01:45.140> keep<00:01:46.140> looping

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
word keep looping

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.640 
word keep looping
so<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.480> game<00:01:48.630> will<00:01:48.810> keep<00:01:49.050> running<00:01:49.440> whilst<00:01:51.650> the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
so the game will keep running whilst the

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.070 
so the game will keep running whilst the
number<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.040> letters<00:01:53.220> we've<00:01:53.580> guessed

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
number of letters we've guessed

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.360 
number of letters we've guessed
correctly<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.380> less<00:01:55.680> than<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.920> length<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
correctly is less than the length of the

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.010 
correctly is less than the length of the
word<00:01:56.550> which<00:01:57.210> should<00:01:57.660> be<00:01:57.780> fairly

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
word which should be fairly

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.380 
word which should be fairly
self-explanatory<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.730> word<00:01:59.910> is<00:02:00.090> seven

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
self-explanatory if a word is seven

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.320 
self-explanatory if a word is seven
letters<00:02:00.750> long<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:02.460> we've<00:02:02.580> only<00:02:02.700> guessed<00:02:03.030> six

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
letters long and we've only guessed six

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.120 
letters long and we've only guessed six
then<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:03.960> haven't<00:02:04.230> guessed<00:02:04.440> all<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.830> letters

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
then we haven't guessed all the letters

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.000 
then we haven't guessed all the letters
in<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.310> word<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.930> next<00:02:07.080> thing<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.470> need<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.740> do

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
in the word the next thing we need to do

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.460 
in the word the next thing we need to do
is<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.430> need<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:08.790> answer<00:02:09.330> ask<00:02:09.690> sorry<00:02:10.260> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
is we need to then answer ask sorry the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:20.180 
is we need to then answer ask sorry the
user<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:12.330> enter<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:14.000> guess<00:02:15.590> letter

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.230 

and<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.760> use<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> familiar<00:02:21.540> old<00:02:21.690> F<00:02:21.960> gets<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
and then we use a familiar old F gets to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.360 
and then we use a familiar old F gets to
store<00:02:24.240> whoops<00:02:24.690> wrong<00:02:25.080> bracket<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:26.100> store

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
store whoops wrong bracket to store

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.440 
store whoops wrong bracket to store
inside<00:02:26.910> our<00:02:27.240> guest<00:02:27.690> array<00:02:28.700> 16<00:02:29.700> characters<00:02:30.300> at

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
inside our guest array 16 characters at

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620 
inside our guest array 16 characters at
the<00:02:30.540> most<00:02:30.750> from<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.350> standard<00:02:31.860> input

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.990 

and<00:02:34.720> now<00:02:35.230> all<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.410> want<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:35.830> do<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.760> first

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
and now all I want to do is the first

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.130 
and now all I want to do is the first
thing<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.390> want<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.660> check<00:02:37.870> whether<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.110> user

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
thing is want to check whether the user

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.840 
thing is want to check whether the user
just<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.680> cover<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:38.950> bothered<00:02:39.250> anymore<00:02:39.490> on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
just to cover it bothered anymore on

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.680 
just to cover it bothered anymore on
wants<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.270> quit

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
wants to quit

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
wants to quit
so<00:02:40.990> we'll<00:02:41.170> say<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:42.220> this<00:02:42.340> should<00:02:42.490> all<00:02:42.610> be

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
so we'll say and this should all be

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.460 
so we'll say and this should all be
familiar<00:02:42.760> from<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.480> previous<00:02:43.900> videos<00:02:44.880> if

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
familiar from the previous videos if

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.050 
familiar from the previous videos if
guess

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
guess

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.350 
guess
starts<00:02:49.960> with<00:02:50.170> quit<00:02:51.010> for<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.550> first<00:02:51.760> for<00:02:52.000> first

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
starts with quit for the first for first

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.440 
starts with quit for the first for first
of<00:02:52.480> all<00:02:52.570> characters<00:02:53.170> ie<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:55.000> function

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
of all characters ie this function

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.060 
of all characters ie this function
equals<00:02:55.780> zero<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:57.870> we'll<00:02:58.870> set<00:02:59.110> our<00:02:59.530> variable

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
equals zero then we'll set our variable

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.340 
equals zero then we'll set our variable
quits<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.550> one<00:03:00.810> because<00:03:01.810> remember<00:03:01.840> at<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
quits to one because remember at the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.090 
quits to one because remember at the
start<00:03:02.380> here<00:03:02.830> it's<00:03:02.920> been<00:03:03.100> set<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.850> zero<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
start here it's been set to zero and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.190 
start here it's been set to zero and
we'll<00:03:06.100> break<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.510> while<00:03:07.690> loop

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
we'll break out of the while loop

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.020 
we'll break out of the while loop
he<00:03:08.650> may<00:03:08.830> be<00:03:08.890> wondering<00:03:09.280> why<00:03:09.430> we're<00:03:09.610> setting<00:03:09.940> a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
he may be wondering why we're setting a

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.780 
he may be wondering why we're setting a
variable<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.570> say<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.900> we've<00:03:10.990> quit<00:03:11.790> well

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
variable to say that we've quit well

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.730 
variable to say that we've quit well
there<00:03:13.510> won't<00:03:13.630> be<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.930> only<00:03:13.959> reason<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.560> we

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
there won't be the only reason that we

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.440 
there won't be the only reason that we
leave<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.130> while<00:03:15.310> loop<00:03:15.640> one<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.150> them<00:03:16.270> could

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
leave the while loop one of them could

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.810 
leave the while loop one of them could
be<00:03:16.660> because<00:03:17.170> num<00:03:17.500> correct<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.100> now<00:03:18.310> equal<00:03:18.700> to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
be because num correct is now equal to

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.120 
be because num correct is now equal to
the<00:03:18.910> length<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.420> word<00:03:19.600> which<00:03:19.900> means<00:03:20.130> the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
the length of the word which means the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.680 
the length of the word which means the
users<00:03:21.459> actually<00:03:21.790> won<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.150> correctly<00:03:22.510> guess

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
users actually won and correctly guess

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.540 
users actually won and correctly guess
the<00:03:22.720> word<00:03:23.050> or<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.620> could<00:03:23.800> be<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.070> users<00:03:24.400> run

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
the word or it could be that users run

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.000 
the word or it could be that users run
out<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.700> lives<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.270> has<00:03:25.390> died<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.989> down<00:03:26.890> the

out of lives and has died so down the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.640 
out of lives and has died so down the
bottom<00:03:27.280> here<00:03:27.459> we<00:03:27.640> can<00:03:27.820> say<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.300> if<00:03:28.450> quit<00:03:28.780> is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
bottom here we can say that if quit is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.920 
bottom here we can say that if quit is
equal<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.160> one<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.610> we<00:03:31.150> know<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.690> user

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
equal to one and we know that the user

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.550 
equal to one and we know that the user
typed<00:03:32.230> quit<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.800> we<00:03:33.610> can<00:03:33.790> then<00:03:34.470> very<00:03:35.470> easily

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
typed quit and we can then very easily

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.320 
typed quit and we can then very easily
