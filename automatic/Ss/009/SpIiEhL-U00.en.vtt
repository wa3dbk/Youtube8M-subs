00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:02.104
 You should be weird 

00:00:03.021 --> 00:00:03.937
 Siv 

00:00:04.896 --> 00:00:07.271
 What are you doing? 

00:00:07.687 --> 00:00:09.021
 Make a new rune page 

00:00:09.437 --> 00:00:10.229
 Aich 

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:13.479
 Bruise Only Assistance 

00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:18.187
 Because Aich will increase her crit rate 

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:19.104
 You know 

00:00:20.146 --> 00:00:23.687
 But you are usually in the peasant army so this does not work 

00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:24.979
 But if it is auxiliary 

00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:27.854
 I will let the crit rate go high 

00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:30.229
 Then give the opposite arrow 

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:33.021
 With a full-blown rune 

00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:39.104
 (Equipped with a full-blown rune...) 

00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:46.479
 Ai Xi: One arrow dominates 

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:49.896
 They will try to taste what it feels like later. 

00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:51.771
 Let us blow them up 

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:01.896
 I rely on... 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.896
 This is the nuclear bomb flow assist 

00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:11.890
 Ok, good. 

00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:17.396
 Like it 

00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:19.396
 I guess this Ize is thinking 

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:24.771
 Let's go to the middle of the road to play. 

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:41.021
 Victor, I am sincerely sorry. 

00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:43.562
 I am waiting for your general attack and then you can take your head off. 

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.729
 I want to kill this Udir. 

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:53.854
 Shameful Aishe Arrow 

00:01:54.812 --> 00:01:57.729
 (Tabzz: Western European elite players are good friends with Siv.) When Tabzz came to my house, I told him this idea. 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.062
 I told Tabzz 

00:01:59.062 --> 00:02:01.060
 I want to play assisted Aich. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.271
 Only insert a violent rune 

00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:04.270
 At the first level (one arrow) 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.312
 With a red refining 

00:02:05.812 --> 00:02:06.479
 This crit is very good. 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.229
 Then he will 

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:09.146
 This is not a good idea. 

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:10.187
 (look!) 

00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:14.979
