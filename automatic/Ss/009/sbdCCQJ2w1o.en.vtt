locomotive<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:16.410> gonna<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> hardwire<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
locomotive I'm gonna have to hardwire it

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.980 
locomotive I'm gonna have to hardwire it
which<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.970> why<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> got<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.690> MC<00:00:19.050> 2<00:00:19.260> decoder<00:00:19.650> and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
which is why I got the MC 2 decoder and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.330 
which is why I got the MC 2 decoder and
to<00:00:21.990> take<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> shell<00:00:22.500> off<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> locomotive

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
to take the shell off the locomotive

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.160 
to take the shell off the locomotive
first<00:00:24.240> you're<00:00:24.359> gonna<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.720> unscrew<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
first you're gonna have to unscrew the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.790 
first you're gonna have to unscrew the
couplers<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.830> each<00:00:26.039> end<00:00:26.310> then<00:00:27.470> right<00:00:28.470> behind

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
couplers on each end then right behind

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.580 
couplers on each end then right behind
that<00:00:29.010> there<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.660> two<00:00:30.660> other<00:00:30.869> screws<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.439> each

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that there are two other screws on each

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
that there are two other screws on each
end<00:00:31.890> right<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.230> right<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.710> when

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
end right here and right here so when

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.580 
end right here and right here so when
you<00:00:35.640> take<00:00:35.880> them<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.750> shell<00:00:37.020> should<00:00:37.350> just

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you take them out the shell should just

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:48.229 
you take them out the shell should just
slide<00:00:38.040> right<00:00:38.100> off<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.860> shell<00:00:47.100> will<00:00:47.940> slide

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
slide right off and the shell will slide

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:57.110 
slide right off and the shell will slide
off<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.370 

now<00:00:57.720> what<00:00:57.960> you're<00:00:58.110> gonna<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.440> next<00:00:58.590> is<00:01:00.170> we<00:01:01.170> need

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
now what you're gonna do next is we need

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.690 
now what you're gonna do next is we need
to<00:01:01.790> sever<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:03.060> electrical<00:01:03.660> current<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
to sever the electrical current for the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.750 
to sever the electrical current for the
DC<00:01:06.090> power<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:09.020> on<00:01:10.020> your<00:01:10.560> board<00:01:10.800> here<00:01:11.160> you're

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
DC power so on your board here you're

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030 
DC power so on your board here you're
gonna<00:01:11.940> see<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.890> see

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
gonna see I don't know if you can see

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640 
gonna see I don't know if you can see
that<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.600> there's<00:01:15.600> gonna<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.930> three<00:01:16.140> X's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that there there's gonna be three X's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.900 
that there there's gonna be three X's
one<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.600> one<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.800> here<00:01:19.910> now

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
one here one here and one here now

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.820 
one here one here and one here now
you're<00:01:21.030> gonna<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.660> drill<00:01:22.350> through<00:01:22.619> them

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you're gonna have to drill through them

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.560 
you're gonna have to drill through them
what<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> use<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> pin<00:01:27.510> vise<00:01:27.860> so

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
what I use to do that it's a pin vise so

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.240 
what I use to do that it's a pin vise so
when<00:01:30.570> you're<00:01:30.720> doing<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.380> very<00:01:31.680> very

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
when you're doing this be very very

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.960 
when you're doing this be very very
careful

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
careful

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.760 
careful
because<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> apply<00:01:33.960> too<00:01:34.200> much<00:01:34.410> pressure

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
because if you apply too much pressure

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:47.690 
because if you apply too much pressure
it<00:01:35.729> could<00:01:37.670> snap<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.940> board<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.540> half

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.719 

okay<00:01:48.530> now<00:01:49.530> after<00:01:49.799> drilling<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.310> three<00:01:50.520> holes

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
okay now after drilling the three holes

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.719 
okay now after drilling the three holes
through<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> white<00:01:51.990> X's<00:01:52.439> you're<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.580> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
through the white X's you're going to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.969 
through the white X's you're going to
connect<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> wires<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.869> where<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.680> on

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
connect the wires to where they go on

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.200 
connect the wires to where they go on
the<00:01:56.759> board<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.270> P<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.200> two<00:01:58.860> four<00:01:59.460> five<00:01:59.490> six

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the board at P one two four five six

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.020 
the board at P one two four five six
seven<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.930> eight<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.310> you'll<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.549> how<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.729> do

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
seven and eight and you'll see how to do

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.039 
seven and eight and you'll see how to do
that<00:02:03.210> by<00:02:04.789> matching<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:06.330> color<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.840> wires

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
that by matching the color of the wires

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.169 
that by matching the color of the wires
to<00:02:07.560> where<00:02:07.710> they<00:02:07.830> go<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> diagram<00:02:08.880> right

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to where they go in the diagram right

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:18.240 
to where they go in the diagram right
here

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.880 

you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.910 

okay<00:02:24.890> now<00:02:25.549> I<00:02:26.030> just<00:02:26.540> soldered<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.409> it<00:02:27.769> took

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
okay now I just soldered it and it took

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.330 
okay now I just soldered it and it took
about<00:02:28.099> 15<00:02:28.909> minutes<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.069> what<00:02:31.219> it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
about 15 minutes but this is what it

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.149 
about 15 minutes but this is what it
should<00:02:31.370> look<00:02:31.519> like<00:02:32.650> p1<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.359> orange<00:02:35.659> wire

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
should look like p1 as you orange wire

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.630 
should look like p1 as you orange wire
p2<00:02:37.159> has<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.760> yellow<00:02:37.939> wire<00:02:39.040> p4<00:02:40.040> has<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.280> black

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
p2 has the yellow wire p4 has a black

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.640 
p2 has the yellow wire p4 has a black
wire<00:02:40.989> 5<00:02:41.989> has<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.260> gray<00:02:43.060> 6<00:02:44.060> has<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.359> white<00:02:44.650> 7

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
wire 5 has the gray 6 has the white 7

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.830 
wire 5 has the gray 6 has the white 7
has<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.799> blue<00:02:46.069> 8<00:02:46.790> has<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> red<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.659> I<00:02:48.609> taped

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
has the blue 8 has the red and I taped

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.500 
has the blue 8 has the red and I taped
the<00:02:50.840> decoder<00:02:51.530> down<00:02:51.769> here<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.099> wires<00:02:52.359> so<00:02:53.359> it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
the decoder down here the wires so it

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.319 
the decoder down here the wires so it
doesn't<00:02:53.780> go<00:02:54.739> all<00:02:54.769> over<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.189> place<00:02:55.370> can<00:02:56.180> make

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
doesn't go all over the place can make

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.710 
doesn't go all over the place can make
it<00:02:56.480> nice<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.659> neat<00:02:56.840> however<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.319> want<00:02:57.530> but

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
it nice and neat however you want but
