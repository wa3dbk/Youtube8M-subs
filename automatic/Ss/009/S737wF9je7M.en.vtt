00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello to all guys from 10 years entry 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.960
 here we are again with the pokémon game 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.530
 tower defense 2 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.670
 as you see as a starter I removed from 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.210
 you'll decide why since we had 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 mayor and now I'll tell you a little how 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.050
 see we have two taken away from the winners 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.880
 that the usual tracking shiny but we have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.970
 also many shadow pokémon we have a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.949
 food art center at 3 pg now thai 1 pip 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.390
 then the pokémon will start there or 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:39.680
 because I got exchanges 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.680
 as often a little bit fake exchanges 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.260
 and shawls because there are things 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.899
 what time I will show you is indeed a real monster 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 I'll make them individual videos for those 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.329
 since it's easier to understand now 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.070
 we will do the route number 29 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.579
 as you see in this game the pokémon 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.350
 on the grass you meet in will appear in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.049
 this way when a moment ahead to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210
 let you see here you will only be 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.580
 obviously the usual places to put the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.900
 pokémon nothing is worth skipping 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.490
 much historical bullshit west with guest 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.600
 you guys can talk to where you have to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.150
 help save his berries 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.509
 cow rancia is very important now 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.700
 also on this we will make videos for 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.950
 things especially about pokémon 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.710
 shadow now let's move on here 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 we meet this guy here says that the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.430
 route 46 closed because it was 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.079
 investigation for work for the part 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.220
 of the pokémon jean we enter the others 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.229
