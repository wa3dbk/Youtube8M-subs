Bob's<00:00:22.140> Red<00:00:22.470> Mill<00:00:23.300> whole<00:00:24.300> ground<00:00:24.630> flaxseed

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
Bob's Red Mill whole ground flaxseed

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.060 
Bob's Red Mill whole ground flaxseed
meal<00:00:26.820> okay<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.349> people<00:00:28.500> grind<00:00:28.920> their

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
meal okay now some people grind their

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.740 
meal okay now some people grind their
own<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.730> they<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> makes<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
own and they think that it makes a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.410 
own and they think that it makes a
better<00:00:30.960> egg<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:32.279> always<00:00:32.669> used<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
better egg I have always used this and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.990 
better egg I have always used this and
it's<00:00:33.510> worked<00:00:33.719> well<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:33.960> me<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it's worked well for me and what the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.520 
it's worked well for me and what the
ratio<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:37.670> one<00:00:38.670> tablespoon<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:40.020> flaxseed

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
ratio is is one tablespoon of flaxseed

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.970 
ratio is is one tablespoon of flaxseed
meal<00:00:41.030> two<00:00:42.030> three<00:00:42.390> tablespoons<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.200> water<00:00:43.260> for

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
meal two three tablespoons of water for

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.029 
meal two three tablespoons of water for
one<00:00:44.160> egg<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.360> egg<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> need<00:00:46.860> two

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
one egg for one egg so if you need two

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
one egg for one egg so if you need two
eggs<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.460> double<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.510> that's<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
eggs you just double that so that's the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.600 
eggs you just double that so that's the
way<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.260> works<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> does<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
way that works and what it does is you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.860 
way that works and what it does is you
you<00:00:51.059> put<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.539> together<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.680> actually

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
you put this together it will actually

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.389 
you put this together it will actually
sit<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.230> while<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.219> build

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
sit for a little while and it will build

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
sit for a little while and it will build
up<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.789> gel<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.539> will<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.870> gel<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.500> almost

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
up a gel like will get gel like almost

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.540 
up a gel like will get gel like almost
like<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.160> egg<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:00.449> what<00:01:00.899> binds<00:01:01.550> your

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
like an egg so that's what binds your

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.990 
like an egg so that's what binds your
ingredients<00:01:03.390> together<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.750> baking<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> we're

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
ingredients together in baking so we're

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.990 
ingredients together in baking so we're
making<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.590> two<00:01:07.590> eggs<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:08.100> yep<00:01:08.490> we're<00:01:08.729> making

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
making a two eggs right yep we're making

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.920 
making a two eggs right yep we're making
two<00:01:09.180> eggs<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:11.000> two<00:01:12.000> tablespoons<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
two eggs so it's a two tablespoons and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
two eggs so it's a two tablespoons and
six<00:01:13.200> tablespoons<00:01:13.650> instead<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> maxillary

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
six tablespoons instead of maxillary

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
six tablespoons instead of maxillary
exactly<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.650> combine

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
exactly so what you do is just combine

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
exactly so what you do is just combine
them<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.939> then<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> whisk<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:21.259> you<00:01:22.259> let

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
them and then you whisk it and you let

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.160 
them and then you whisk it and you let
it<00:01:22.530> stand<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:24.000> let<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> sit<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:24.750> ten

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it stand you let it sit for about ten

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
it stand you let it sit for about ten
minutes<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> will<00:01:26.130> thicken<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.330> if<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
minutes and it will thicken but if you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.030 
minutes and it will thicken but if you
want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> speed<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> process<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
want to speed up the process what you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.149 
want to speed up the process what you
can<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.729> warm<00:01:30.090> water<00:01:30.439> or<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> put

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
can do is use warm water or you can put

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.560 
can do is use warm water or you can put
this<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> microwave<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.970> about<00:01:33.240> 10

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
this in the microwave for about 10

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
this in the microwave for about 10
seconds<00:01:34.079> which<00:01:34.920> we're<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.400> right

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
seconds which we're going to do right

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:54.370 
seconds which we're going to do right
now

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.890 

so<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.980> can<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.160> it's<00:01:56.940> thickened<00:01:57.480> up<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
so as you can see it's thickened up and

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.500 
so as you can see it's thickened up and
I'm<00:01:58.830> just<00:01:59.010> doing<00:01:59.190> this<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.060> it

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
I'm just doing this so you can see it

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.270 
I'm just doing this so you can see it
but<00:02:01.080> if<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.560> put<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.010> in<00:02:02.160> between

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
but if you actually put it in between

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.200 
but if you actually put it in between
your<00:02:02.580> fingers<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.330> can<00:02:03.450> actually<00:02:03.660> feel<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:05.210> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
your fingers you can actually feel it it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.990 
your fingers you can actually feel it it
turned<00:02:06.540> into<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.840> little<00:02:07.140> gel-like<00:02:07.650> substance

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
turned into a little gel-like substance

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.750 
turned into a little gel-like substance
and<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.869> don't<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.619> flaxseed<00:02:11.400> mixture

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and you don't want the flaxseed mixture

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.230 
and you don't want the flaxseed mixture
to<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.210> hot<00:02:13.280> okay<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.550> you're<00:02:14.700> putting<00:02:15.030> it

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
to be hot okay when you're putting it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.030 
to be hot okay when you're putting it
into<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.930> other<00:02:16.080> ingredients<00:02:16.350> because

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
into the other ingredients because

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.030 
into the other ingredients because
that's<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> work<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.290> anyway<00:02:19.290> that
