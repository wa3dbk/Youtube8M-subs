00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.069
 Hi, how are youtube friends? 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.579
 well this is going to be my first video of 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.810
 this channel this channel is going to be after 

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:11.000
 rainy and well I wanted them 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.670
 teach them with the first unique video 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.920
 lesson I just came back a year ago to 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.750
 collect weeds and then this what I've 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.350
 coupled until now 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.860
 and well I hope you like it and then 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.080
 good let's start here are my ghosts are 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:32.489
 two blue eyes and a natural park and 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.600
 then the three Egyptian gods the three 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:41.640
 gods so to speak gx again 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.879
 obelisk my last 100 with ultimate 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.830
 here the two melting begin 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.830
 with pure secret letters 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.560
 here the ultras begin 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.360
 with a back and supers 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.520
 new we started with the successes 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.859
 with you with the five pardons 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.940
 these letters the truth are very very very 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.340
 parents 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.350
 here we have the nordic gods 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.350
 be 2 black crowes 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.340
 they are essential letters 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.960
 here are the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.960
 exit 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.940
 and well , the monsters start 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.260
 this is like my page plus the one that most 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.700
 like 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.700
 all these are secret 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.420
 I have an arm 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.790
 I do not know if anyone wants to send a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.560
 message 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.560
 to see if what to buy when changing 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.590
 in general, because this 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.479
 almost all these letters are collectible 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.599
 nothing else 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.489
 this usually I do not sell them, I do not 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.790
 change unless it's a good 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.550
 offer or 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.820
 okay 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.510
 good or something that has enough 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.590
 repeated like these torrent since I have 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.510
 five secrets 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.870
 let's say I need three for the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.870
 collection 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.730
 and someone who can change letters you can 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.550
 let's say an offer send me a message or 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.710
 leave a comment in the video 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.350
 usually he just looked for letters that 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.840
 do not have 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.840
 and at the moment I do not have any deck 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.120
 with which bellows are all my 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.670
 letters to be hero 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.069
 but good usually not right now 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.130
 I have this no c's here they start 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.710
 the ultras 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.840
 I was playing for a while with the Nordics 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.310
 I really like very much they are very 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.160
 parents 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.220
 and then I think that I have many 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.580
 eager to use a dragon deck 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.580
 chaos 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.140
 and for really never this has never gone 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.600
 to some tournament or something like that 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.630
 I'm from the df if someone has information 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.770
 about where I could compete regional 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.750
 or 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.670
 or something that would be very good the truth 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.870
 that I'm a bit out of practice but 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.870
 I feel a lot 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.349
 and so good soon the former dragons of 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.349
 chaos 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.290
 sex and wine 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.780
 tokens 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.170
 how good with him judis blogs hillary 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.430
 collection 3 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.430
 It is not a trade 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.659
 trap 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.060
 I have these letters in very good 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.230
 been the truth almost all have been of 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.090
 recent takeover that the attack of some 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.090
 over and then I save them 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.020
 all these are still bulky 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.720
 sorry because it moves a lot in the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.529
 camera but then all that not my 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.899
 mobile 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:44.299
 I tried to use another bed but the truth is 

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:44.299
 that was not very here they start super 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.479
 I tried to use another camera but it was 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.179
 moved a little bit he said rather he was not 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.369
 working very well and it is in 

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:57.720
 solar I hope the quality of this well 

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:59.980
 can see it well 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.740
 this 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.020
 and well consular good I do not have very 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.800
 good pulse and then 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.870
 we have a little 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.360
 already for when it starts to open this 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.389
 about me I think in this week or the 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.070
 next they will come from a few 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:21.010
 envelopes to open 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.990
 that is already going to be with another with another camera 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.240
 and with a tripod 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.000
 but since this is how I'm moving 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.120
 much 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.200
 the pages because I have to move the 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.110
 cameras and sides 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.370
 and for that reason I decided to use the site 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.370
 that the other camera 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.770
 these are still the supers 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.660
 in all the collection that I am 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.080
 teaching the lowest I have are 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.080
 super 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.060
 and obviously I still have many many 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.330
 more letters 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.700
 but almost all are common rather or 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.180
 rare with those who have the letrita 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.560
 how 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.560
 as silver color 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.490
 and well, if someone is interested 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.860
 in exchange 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.849
 buy or sell me letters also we 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.179
 can buy letters 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.860
 as long as they are in good a good 

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:29.250
 state 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.250
 and also letters that I do not have 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.670
 we have to give an agreement because you are 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:42.560
 letters are not very cheap to say and 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.560
 Well yes I have been spending a little 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.230
 but it's something that I like 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:55.189
 once the magic super begin 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.810
 seriously for the momentum but you can 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.420
 the truth is that I do not have very good 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.960
 you well then this was the collection here 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.760
 I have more protection letters like dex 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.540
 structure or 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.480
 or from this start that I bought for 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.900
 because they bring good letters, well, good 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.210
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.949
 in this my collection like it 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:37.560
 subscribe and soon be going up more
