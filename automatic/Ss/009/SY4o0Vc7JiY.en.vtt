and we'll see if they're true now the
first<00:00:39.530> thing<00:00:39.650> I<00:00:39.770> notice<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.760> little

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
first thing I notice is it's a little

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.580 
first thing I notice is it's a little
bit<00:00:41.090> different<00:00:41.440> unboxing<00:00:42.440> experience

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
bit different unboxing experience

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.290 
bit different unboxing experience
because<00:00:43.340> there's<00:00:43.490> a<00:00:43.550> couple<00:00:43.760> of<00:00:43.910> extras<00:00:44.180> in

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
because there's a couple of extras in

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.180 
because there's a couple of extras in
here<00:00:44.420> not<00:00:44.570> just<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.960> strap<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.920> reason

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
here not just the strap and the reason

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.140 
here not just the strap and the reason
for<00:00:46.220> that<00:00:46.370> is<00:00:46.550> because<00:00:46.580> you've<00:00:46.820> got<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.030> do<00:00:47.090> a

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
for that is because you've got to do a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.030 
for that is because you've got to do a
little<00:00:47.300> work<00:00:47.510> that's<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:48.350> trade-off<00:00:48.620> you

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
little work that's the trade-off you

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.940 
little work that's the trade-off you
want<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.520> high<00:00:50.060> end<00:00:50.300> secure<00:00:51.290> strap<00:00:51.650> where<00:00:51.860> the

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
want a high end secure strap where the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.830 
want a high end secure strap where the

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
first impression this looks beautiful I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.870 
first impression this looks beautiful I
mean<00:01:12.859> this<00:01:12.950> is<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.249> only<00:01:13.429> one<00:01:13.700> I've<00:01:13.850> ever

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
mean this is the only one I've ever

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.660 
mean this is the only one I've ever
pulled<00:01:14.299> out<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:15.200> looks<00:01:15.499> like<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.679> watch<00:01:16.009> from

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
pulled out that looks like a watch from

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.550 
pulled out that looks like a watch from
the<00:01:16.789> get-go<00:01:17.030> without<00:01:17.479> even<00:01:17.780> having<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.079> nano<00:01:18.289> in

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
the get-go without even having a nano in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.160 
the get-go without even having a nano in
there<00:01:18.909> it<00:01:19.909> just<00:01:19.969> feels<00:01:20.450> right<00:01:20.719> you<00:01:20.780> know<00:01:20.960> what

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
there it just feels right you know what

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.719 
there it just feels right you know what
I'm<00:01:21.259> saying<00:01:21.469> it's<00:01:21.649> got<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.799> slightly<00:01:22.369> wider

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
I'm saying it's got a slightly wider

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.179 
I'm saying it's got a slightly wider
band<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.329> more<00:01:23.630> athletic<00:01:23.840> style<00:01:24.619> I<00:01:24.799> would<00:01:24.859> say

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
band a more athletic style I would say

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.669 
band a more athletic style I would say
compared<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.880> last<00:01:26.030> one<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.359> unboxed<00:01:27.020> and

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
compared to the last one I unboxed and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.139 
compared to the last one I unboxed and
that's<00:01:28.159> really<00:01:28.399> what<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:28.549> was<00:01:28.670> looking<00:01:28.909> for<00:01:28.969> is

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
that's really what I was looking for is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.539 
that's really what I was looking for is

the only one out there that does that

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.739

because I'm going to use this as a watch
exclusively<00:01:45.499> and<00:01:45.709> you<00:01:46.189> know<00:01:46.310> this<00:01:46.549> is<00:01:46.700> kind<00:01:46.909> of

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
exclusively and you know this is kind of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.639 
exclusively and you know this is kind of
the<00:01:47.060> misconception<00:01:47.840> is<00:01:47.959> is<00:01:48.139> it<00:01:48.350> really<00:01:48.619> a

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
the misconception is is it really a

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.190 
the misconception is is it really a
watch<00:01:48.950> or<00:01:49.249> is<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:49.520> just<00:01:49.549> an<00:01:49.789> iPod<00:01:50.179> Nano<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:50.749> a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
watch or is it just an iPod Nano in a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.109 
watch or is it just an iPod Nano in a
convenient<00:01:51.740> location<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:52.429> mean<00:01:52.490> that's<00:01:52.819> that's

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
convenient location I mean that's that's

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.550 
convenient location I mean that's that's
really<00:01:53.420> what<00:01:53.509> needs<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.899> be<00:01:54.020> considered<00:01:54.439> here

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
really what needs to be considered here

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.779 
really what needs to be considered here
because<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.799> lot<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:54.979> people<00:01:55.219> get<00:01:55.340> angry<00:01:55.520> saying

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
because a lot of people get angry saying

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.039 
because a lot of people get angry saying
why<00:01:55.909> don't<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.119> just<00:01:56.270> get<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.479> regular<00:01:56.659> watch

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
why don't you just get a regular watch

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.230 
why don't you just get a regular watch
you<00:01:57.319> know<00:01:57.439> but<00:01:58.069> that's<00:01:58.579> not<00:01:58.819> I<00:01:58.969> don't<00:01:59.179> know

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
you know but that's not I don't know

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.519 
you know but that's not I don't know
that<00:01:59.420> that's<00:01:59.569> really<00:01:59.779> the<00:01:59.869> argument<00:02:00.409> I<00:02:00.499> think

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
that that's really the argument I think

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:01.899 
that that's really the argument I think
that<00:02:00.920> there<00:02:01.100> are<00:02:01.159> enough<00:02:01.340> people<00:02:01.369> don't<00:02:01.759> even

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
that there are enough people don't even

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.419 
that there are enough people don't even
wear<00:02:02.119> watches<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.229> maybe<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.889> is<00:02:04.159> just<00:02:04.189> a

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
maybe that's what we should start saying

real estate for something a little bit

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.259 
real estate for something a little bit
more<00:04:02.480> interesting<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:03.319> as<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.489> said<00:04:04.549> before<00:04:04.760> my

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
more interesting and as I said before my

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.270 
more interesting and as I said before my
previous<00:04:05.690> videos<00:04:06.019> I<00:04:06.230> am<00:04:06.680> going<00:04:06.889> to<00:04:06.949> do<00:04:07.069> a<00:04:07.099> video

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.099 
previous videos I am going to do a video
after<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.150> one<00:04:08.389> to<00:04:08.540> talk<00:04:08.720> about<00:04:09.019> the

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
after this one to talk about the

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.839 
after this one to talk about the

wrist and and as I mentioned earlier in
this<00:04:13.760> video<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.060> don't<00:04:14.090> think<00:04:14.419> it's<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:14.750> much

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
this video I don't think it's so much

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.020 
this video I don't think it's so much
competing<00:04:15.379> with<00:04:15.650> watches<00:04:16.099> as<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:16.669> just<00:04:16.789> a
