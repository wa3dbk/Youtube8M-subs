okay you can see that there is still

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.180 
okay you can see that there is still
some<00:03:10.640> lag<00:03:10.879> but<00:03:11.720> no<00:03:12.230> different<00:03:12.650> than<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.950> wired

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
some lag but no different than the wired

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.039 
some lag but no different than the wired
connection<00:03:13.310> before<00:03:13.879> and<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:15.140> audio

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:28.990 

experience<00:03:24.879> all<00:03:25.879> right<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:28.190> seamless<00:03:28.519> I

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
experience all right so it's seamless I
