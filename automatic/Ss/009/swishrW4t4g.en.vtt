built with a hyper-cardioid pattern to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.210 
built with a hyper-cardioid pattern to
reduce<00:00:21.300> feedback<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.230> comes<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> VOB

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
reduce feedback but comes with a VOB

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.310 
reduce feedback but comes with a VOB
technology<00:00:23.880> which<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.480> control<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
technology which is to control the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.730 
technology which is to control the
proximity<00:00:25.859> effect<00:00:26.099> which<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.580> movement

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
proximity effect which is movement

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.140 
proximity effect which is movement
obviously<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.490> HUD<00:00:29.699> cardioid

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
obviously you have the HUD cardioid

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.690 
obviously you have the HUD cardioid
pattern<00:00:30.330> which<00:00:30.779> controls<00:00:31.260> feedback<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> they

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
pattern which controls feedback and they

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.600 
pattern which controls feedback and they
claim<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.170> indestructible<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:35.340> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
claim that it is indestructible right so

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.650 
claim that it is indestructible right so
we're<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> test<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.270> through<00:00:36.450> slowly

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
we're going to test this through slowly

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.910 
we're going to test this through slowly
on<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.870> road<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.140> cubish<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.590> show<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.800> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
on the road and cubish to show you that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
on the road and cubish to show you that
it<00:00:38.010> works<00:00:38.040> test<00:00:38.579> s<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.000> two<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.390> two<00:00:39.420> very

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it works test s one two one two very

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.569 
it works test s one two one two very
clearly<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.500> hear<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.520> to

clearly you can hear that I'm going to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.850 
clearly you can hear that I'm going to
put<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.790> through<00:00:41.879> its<00:00:41.940> paces<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.500> usual

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
put it through its paces and the usual

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.180 
put it through its paces and the usual
singer<00:00:44.489> situation<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:49.170> still<00:00:49.469> works<00:00:49.739> there

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
singer situation this still works there

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:14.280 
singer situation this still works there
we<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:50.430> perfect<00:00:50.670> testing

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.960 

test<00:01:15.290> this<00:01:15.470> one<00:01:15.710> too<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.130> it's<00:01:16.370> still<00:01:16.580> alive

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
test this one too and it's still alive

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.570 
test this one too and it's still alive
great<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.440> after<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.860> drop<00:01:19.340> kick

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
great but this is after the drop kick

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.050 
great but this is after the drop kick
and<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.000> dropping<00:01:20.210> near<00:01:21.050> enough<00:01:21.260> pretty

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
and the dropping near enough pretty

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.150 
and the dropping near enough pretty
pretty<00:01:23.060> good<00:01:23.270> I'd<00:01:23.390> say<00:01:23.660> you<00:01:23.930> know<00:01:24.160> survived

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
pretty good I'd say you know survived

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.969 
pretty good I'd say you know survived
quite<00:01:25.369> a<00:01:25.460> bit<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.420> now<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.690> important<00:01:27.410> Fatman

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
quite a bit and now the important Fatman

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:47.120 
quite a bit and now the important Fatman
roadies

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

testing testing that's their testing one
two<00:01:51.700> three<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.439> working<00:01:53.709> microphone

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
two three we have a working microphone

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:08.400 
two three we have a working microphone
and<00:01:55.840> now<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.219> all-important<00:01:57.219> test<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.850> throw
