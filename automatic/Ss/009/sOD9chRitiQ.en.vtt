00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 edward gal and hans peter inferior 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.680
 today third and eighth in the will 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.839
 cup final 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.250
 edward i think you see or had more 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.500
 certainly hoped in terms of points 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.030
 well not so much in points I had 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.440
 hoped it was just a little nicer 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.759
 I have respects gone 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.160
 had those good things but also that many 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.359
 things that simply could be better and me 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.920
 just didn't feel so good i came 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.359
 not quite in my 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.340
 in make hour and then I had too much 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.320
 things and then came through a bit of the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 tension and then it's hard to be real 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.750
 turning a beautiful flowing pm 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.580
 while I know it can be much better 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.019
 then it appears in the coffee anyway 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 still quite difficult in by 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.410
 are you glad you are no longer in it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 kiss kissing can 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890
 yes then at least you hope so 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.940
 I then yes just that he is more relaxed 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.770
 is because then of course you have more 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
 space and it also comes mainly 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.489
 because loosening was best tomorrow and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 then people stand to take photos with 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.280
 flash light and then there were nine 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.530
 a flash and then he becomes one 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 bit back and then nervous 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.620
 it's hard to get rid of that tension 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.910
 touch while turning 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.410
 re life briefly the hearty moment 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.670
 from this you quite against that we see anyway 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.989
 I'll see you soon 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 yeah i think i'll give it a try 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.550
 nice and loose no yes i wish i give my 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.180
 do not transition well from mine 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.010
 penis 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.860
 and then i had to start a henk music 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.600
 of the passage and I become the transition 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.560
 and then it didn't quite work out 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 then I left it a bit to one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.030
 curse my rein away I think and now yes 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.979
 I picked it up again but it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.210
 your body stays white so I was 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.180
 not quite ready 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.380
 any other in the windfall 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.979
 cooperation with block a few whole 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 great moment for the sport 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.030
 have managed to retain London and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.590
 johnson because back with you 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 what can you say about that there is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.740
 Naturally fantastic that where you get the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.939
 have a family clock and also the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.680
 show jumping and now of course 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.700
 fantastic things for the sport 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.290
 and we can only be happy about that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 they are such people and they are 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.250
 fantastic lovely people and they do one 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.750
 hope for us and yes as you see them 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.220
 its just that she thought okay such 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.869
 combination already sharp in London that is allowed 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.280
 just not apart and there they have 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.320
 made himself very strong for it and it is 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.600
 luckily you prefer small ones 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.549
 I think party four is better 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.710
 well it was we were naturally 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.680
 aware of it so it was one 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.659
 it was an exciting day so yes that 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.979
 it was hard that luck like actor and 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.570
 I every few days later news 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.429
 stations and for you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.280
 yes then it is the icing on the cake 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.900
 the cake yes yes look I already knew something 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.090
 but rather for that to 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.250
 came out and of course I was super 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.050
 happy because 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.910
 sewing or animals that had that at all 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.390
 not really intense 300 to sell but 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.530
 good yes if we are successful or 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.810
 then the course is still 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.520
 asked a lot about it and now we are used to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.420
 no longer everywhere from an aussie 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.040
 buy well you stay with me and yes so me 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.570
 can just continue with him 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.670
 it already rewarded today again 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.080
 middle with a fantastic result 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.160
 I already surprised you too 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.540
 has this season and mean who you are 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.250
 one of the revelations was that 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.890
 call this world better kiss yes me 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.709
 I've had it of course for a long time and he 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.770
 walked in October she first cramped 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.330
 3 and for my feeling that I put it in 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.530
 neumÃ¼nster in the world cup anyway 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.150
 little deeper ever and then he had 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.040
 done and even worse 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.690
 national campri and yes he is the last 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.459
 months he is just getting 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.150
 better and better and he takes it as me 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.650
 well on and he is super with you and 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.250
 what i say he now runs for six months 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.940
 at that level 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.470
 and yesterday turns 6 here and then today 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.810
 Styling is really at the top 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.790
 mean what we think might be a whole 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.290
 nice car season you can go 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.980
 say briefly about your schedule 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.980
 the upcoming months 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.739
 I don't know exactly yet 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.690
 as the looks closely won't 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.260
 cases and 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.750
 johnson and glock's romanov 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.490
 the competition at the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.040
 family clock 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.390
 and today we are going to work that you 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.580
 to the observations but then I have to 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.260
 let's see if they are still 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.850
 yes how many matches they need 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.430
 for my feeling the order so optimal 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.990
 possibly those observations 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.270
 Finally, for you were what have you any 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.680
 view of your place of course I also check 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.480
 the game in taking the family 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.430
 clock and then ok the observation 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.380
 competitions and which exactly 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.870
 that's what we have to wait for because we 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.360
 are the 3s and must be the two rows and 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.680
 otherwise we planned only one 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.600
 little but good it is a bit now 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.160
 We start with outdoor season we know 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.540
 at least not completely over yet 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.410
 three weeks is the competition and 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.310
 Austria 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.230
 and for the rest they need a little bit 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.780
 look wish you were very much 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.940
 success and a good return trip from leon 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.940
