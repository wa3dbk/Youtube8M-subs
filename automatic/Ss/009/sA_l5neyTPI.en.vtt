we're<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.470> give<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.800> test<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.720> see

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
we're going to give that a test and see

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.400 
we're going to give that a test and see
how<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.730> reacts<00:00:29.730> with<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:31.619> load<00:00:33.200> we<00:00:34.200> already

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
how it reacts with a load we already

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:47.350 
how it reacts with a load we already
have<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.680> pre-mixed<00:00:36.230> in<00:00:37.430> our<00:00:38.430> oil

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.630 

we're<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> add<00:00:49.730> one<00:00:50.730> pound<00:00:50.970> weights<00:00:52.640> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
we're going to add one pound weights to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.490 
we're going to add one pound weights to
this

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.010 

who

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:23.080 

breathe

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.020 

for<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:25.260> helped<00:01:25.530> four<00:01:25.770> pounds<00:01:26.190> away<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.670> ratio

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
for it helped four pounds away the ratio

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.800 
for it helped four pounds away the ratio
on<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.450> arm<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.440> fifty<00:01:28.830> four<00:01:29.010> point<00:01:29.310> three

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
on this arm is fifty four point three

on this arm is fifty four point three
two<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:31.730> so<00:01:32.730> if<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> take<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> four<00:01:33.390> pounds

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
two one so if you take the four pounds

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.400 
two one so if you take the four pounds
times<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:37.760> four<00:01:38.760> pounds<00:01:39.210> times<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.720> fifty

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410

four point three three it's on there
it's<00:01:42.960> around<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.890> hundred<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.600> believe<00:01:45.600> it's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
it's around two hundred I believe it's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.620 
it's around two hundred I believe it's
around<00:01:45.780> two<00:01:46.020> hundred<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.320> five<00:01:46.530> pounds<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
around two hundred and five pounds of

this with some other videos with other

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.670 
this with some other videos with other
products<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.970> show<00:01:54.120> comparisons<00:01:54.900> on<00:01:55.200> how<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
products to show comparisons on how the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
products work one thing to note this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.950 
products work one thing to note this
product<00:01:59.070> smells<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.820> though<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.270> has<00:02:00.800> its

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
product smells as though it has its

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.410 
product smells as though it has its
acidic<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:05.190> can<00:02:05.369> smell<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.820> when<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:06.060> gets<00:02:06.210> hot

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
acidic you can smell it when it gets hot

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.820 
acidic you can smell it when it gets hot
it<00:02:07.410> begins<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.160> emit<00:02:08.760> a<00:02:09.770> foul<00:02:12.320> acid<00:02:13.320> odor<00:02:13.530> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it begins to emit a foul acid odor so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.100 
it begins to emit a foul acid odor so
it's<00:02:13.980> probably<00:02:14.340> using<00:02:14.760> chlorinated<00:02:15.510> paraffin

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's probably using chlorinated paraffin

small mark is proximately I would say

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.910 
small mark is proximately I would say
about<00:03:39.670> 60<00:03:40.060> thousandths<00:03:40.750> by<00:03:40.989> 90<00:03:41.409> thousandths
