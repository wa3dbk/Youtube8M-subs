good a restaurant is with their seafood
when<00:03:49.470> they're<00:03:49.560> especially<00:03:49.799> when<00:03:50.040> they're

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
when they're especially when they're

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.470 
when they're especially when they're
doing<00:03:50.220> their<00:03:50.340> beer<00:03:50.549> batter<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.329> was<00:03:51.450> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
doing their beer batter and that was a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.180 
doing their beer batter and that was a
very<00:03:51.570> well<00:03:51.989> done<00:03:52.140> beer<00:03:52.320> batter<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:53.040> just

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
very well done beer batter it's I just

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.289 
very well done beer batter it's I just
think<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.430> could<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.790> used<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.030> little<00:03:54.060> more

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
think it could have used a little more

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.940 
think it could have used a little more
flavor<00:03:54.690> like<00:03:55.049> when<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> bit<00:03:55.470> into<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.739> taco

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
flavor like when I bit into that taco

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.740 
flavor like when I bit into that taco

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
which I have the same thing is that that

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.720 
which I have the same thing is that that
all<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.530> things<00:03:58.769> were<00:03:58.950> well<00:03:59.100> executed<00:03:59.610> but

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.130 
all of the things were well executed but
it<00:03:59.820> was<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.030> missing<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.600> little<00:04:00.750> bit<00:04:00.959> of
