00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.930
 Hi, I'm Alejandra, hang up and you're in my 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.049
 house that is your house 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.090
 let's make a delicious jam of 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.519
 mandarin we are going to work it with 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.309
 tangerine queen is a tangerine that 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.919
 has more the shell is even more 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.649
 big then better is first the 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.689
 we're going to cut and we're going to squeeze 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:28.550
 juice I already have here squeezed the 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.250
 juice but I want to show you these 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.179
 juicers are of 9 rhythms or as 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.269
 after I love them I want to teach you 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:40.730
 how to work the house that the most 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.610
 important of one of the jams of 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.210
 citrus fruit is how to work the husks 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.040
 first we are going to remove the glass 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.190
 I recommend you keep the bones 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.510
 because with the bones they are going to help you 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.270
 that the jam is thickened 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.320
 we already bid everything and then with this 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.800
 middle instrument on this side we're going 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.510
 to remove everything white with the pickets 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.050
 of red the turns 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.930
 if you do not have this pinitos 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.720
 you can do it with even one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.780
 spoon because the tangerine is very easy 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.490
 to work is very smooth and you already leave your 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.220
 waterfalls the pages then we're going to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:41.940
 you can cut them to cook 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.080
 Acosta covers and then those are 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.830
 the strips 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.130
 here we have the strips so that the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.500
 You see this, we're going to fix it myself 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.520
 I have my tangerine strips 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.740
 in this recipe we are going to do 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.399
 a tangerine book that pretty much 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.250
 they were 5 kilos and those five kilos 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.890
 we only made 10 tangerines the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.709
 husk because if not good we drown 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.049
 you will have many more left over that is very 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.080
 little the amount of juice against 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:19.200
 number of zeros so you can 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.959
 put accept the moles consummated and 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.129
 good thing is that we have a wonderful Roman 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.130
 ok and tecate very well this is a balance 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.880
 are the most important for any 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:38.670
 site shell management you're going to 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:42.480
 boil three times with different the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.610
 grass first five minutes after 10 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.849
 minutes later and on each occasion 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.500
 you change the water the whites to fix 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.500
 this water has already served 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.569
 the whites perfectly and then you put 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.849
 the tangerines on ice because in full 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.810
 so that bars completely cooking 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.299
 and you comment again to start this 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.950
 what is important with this is enough 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.620
 avoid the beloved ones on the one hand their 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.799
 free shells 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.659
 this skin is white very uncomfortable and for 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:31.280
 another side the option and the cooking of the 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:35.030
 cooking and ice three times me to me like 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.579
 it works for me are the first five 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.480
 minutes the second time ten minutes and 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.799
 the people 15 minutes but always 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.040
 interrupting very slowly in the 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.409
 cooking with iron and it may seem like a 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.310
 little bit so strong but you're really going to 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:55.459
 say wow the the jam you were not in 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:59.989
 our perfect brand then already 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:02.720
 you have here Hindus and cooked shells and 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.590
 analysts are soft and on the other 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.590
 side we have the juice 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.090
 perfectly and rich that beautiful color 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.550
 of tone 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.830
 this is the liter of tangerine and here already 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.350
 we have the liter of boiled tangerine 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.350
 what are you going to do basically look 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.000
 you're basically going to put the liter of 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.000
 mandarin in the pot 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.030
 three quarters 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.420
 that I recommend you to rectify is 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.570
 that you put half the house the grass is a 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.180
 little and you try it very much that 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.870
 do with your lifestyle with your way 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.750
 to eat sugar with your weight goals 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.630
 about sugar you can even make them 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.020
 with dietary sugar with this action is 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.390
 complete garment can be cooked and that 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.710
 Well, it's your decision, not this, you're going 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.700
 to boil about 50 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.639
 minutes to make honey jam 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.460
 exquisite you are going to put 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.639
 you remember that I told you to keep 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.639
 there 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.950
 until the neighbors the bones put them 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:22.040
 On cloth 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.340
 in a very simple bag is a 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.990
 pretty the kitchen is used a lot 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:34.560
 use for the herbs smell the pretty 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.720
 and this is with the purpose that you 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.560
 agents of santÃ© and can be a chemist 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.760
 called benzine also have it natural 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.040
 so if you put it in there because 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.980
 we put in a bag today because if not 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.160
 then know how to return the 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.180
 and when you see that you have the 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.890
 adequate consistency here for example 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.600
 we obviously still do not have the 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.930
 adequate consistency we have that 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.490
 continue living you will increase the 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:13.440
 tangerine peels that boil a 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:17.090
 moment more and then we go 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.770
 pack the dough on base 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.419
 I'm not going to leave it here so 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.560
 remember that you have to finish it 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:27.110
 boil and you will pack it in jars 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.210
 previously sterilized sterilized 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.660
 so I saved the closures in water 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:36.590
 warm on Fridays 10-15 minutes and 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.960
 there the base to pack is something very 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.110
 simple very simple has to be the 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.600
 hot flask and hot marmalade 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.550
 it is a very rich jam can be 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.670
 accompany 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.310
 the moments of breakfast snack and 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.280
 what is very father is that you are 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.470
 good jams said years ago about 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.600
 all because in some countries it is not 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.660
 they get citrus fruits or they do not get 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.900
 some all year round in mexico we are very 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.910
 lucky ones 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.310
 all year long we get 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.140
 almost all fruits with mandolin 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.240
 curiously it is a tender fruit that does not 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.880
 you get all year round you get in 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.520
