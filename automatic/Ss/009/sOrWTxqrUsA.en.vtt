00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.540
 YouTuber and Lord's Creatures 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.520
 good look in this video I come to you 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.010
 bringing a new program googling 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.360
 get to find this program on 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:46.060
 Atrix latency which will help them 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.280
 have less when we play online 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.520
 what happens to me is that I have a 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.500
 very slow internal and I need to use this 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.810
 program and I need to be the configuration 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.810
 which I am going to give now to reduce 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.900
 the lag or not having anything that the games 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.290
 likes good first let's open the 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.990
 exportable program 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.590
 Here is the smart one that I am going to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.439
 leave in the description 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.530
 I will also leave the page just in case 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.390
 you are the one that was for them to see and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.010
 have more details well here is the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.630
 page of him to download 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:33.500
 the program but I'll leave it too 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:38.740
 for mediafire and double click on this we 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:45.340
 says electrics latency equal to 3.0 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:49.630
 and then he tells me not to install 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.630
 you have to do that and then 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.829
 give it again to enter 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.500
 so when you do this, you 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.020
 You open at 5 they give you install they give you 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 remove again after lamenting and 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.810
 they leave it down 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.560
 and when they go to when they go to enter 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.080
 his game this platense 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.020
 I swear 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.070
 will deliver more explicit information 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.420
 to the game server which will tell you 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.060
 deliver the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.720
 the information that corresponds to the game 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.140
 in less seconds and that's very good of 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.080
 part of this program so it gives you 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.650
 minimize or close it does not matter 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.209
 configure the configuration enough the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.360
 configuration is going to be there all the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.989
 time but it's better to get minimized 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.989
 why 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.800
 I prefer that it be minimized as you see here 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.990
 nothing has been changed of what we have 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.910
 done but 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.490
 the closures minimize it but 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.600
 I prefer that the minimums good sometimes 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.830
 the famous portable program beatrix the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.530
 tension 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.880
 well let's go to the second step to be able 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.890
 have much more 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.830
 without which our supplier our 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.790
 internet if they have a wifi network they will 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.920
 serve this step let's open the center 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.770
 of configuration second click here on the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.650
 bar we're going to setup the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.010
 adapter we can not here double click on 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.010
 my 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:39.430
 the wifi network dv to the properties 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.520
 did not open here tells us that the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.470
 microstatic programmer has what 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.110
 let's click active are the programmer 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.420
 of judges data which does not help us 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.340
 much our daily use that the effective 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.940
 we demarcate and we give to be already with 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.050
 this has ensured that you can play 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.050
 an online game 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.330
 as god commands with little speed 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.680
 time 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.680
 no more 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.190
 Mr 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.379
 choling 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800
 I 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.340
 two
