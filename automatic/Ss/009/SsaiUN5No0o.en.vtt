 I have no bias or video 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.910
 I'm just part of the party of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.680
 birds and if the words that I argue 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.810
 possible for you can hear that I 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.120
 can not believe in god any baby 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.039
 we were playing war in the middle of the yard 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 our territory encircled by splinters 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.819
 of glass to defend a black flag 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.249
 planted on a pile of land accompanied 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:43.769
 date Jewish Christian Muslim brothers 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.390
 train all of the same 16 plastic 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.609
 time goes by and the weapons become 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.469
 automatic we asked them then change 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.760
 our targets none of us took part 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.859
 genocide 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.319

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.389
 with us god agrees we can more 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.129
 to speak then sitting at the fact I saw your 

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:00.719
 god I fought with him on behalf 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.579
 already a girl who is excised or 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.049
 Stones last I remember touati 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.370

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.470
 protect or is it the Kalashnikov 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.610
 when you execute those who protest and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.260
 not the same as saying dogs 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.720
 as well being a pastor martyr 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.620
 children on the hands morality and 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 cut well the next little stanzas 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.000

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.100

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.490
 shines a god of love the one who makes 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.200
 that we sow in the cages down the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 towers 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:54.020
 the one who makes us sow in the world 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.820
 and the surroundings and the one who condemns 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.290
 the text will have to ask the question is 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.450
 what he himself respects then my 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.310
 freedom of expression in so-called he 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.870
 is so taken victims it's me 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.270
 recalls the Nazis who decimate and those 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.370
 who draw if I intend to hell 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.140
 caricaturing to it's me alone that 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.900
 it concerns faith only look at this 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.760
 either and on morale quite often the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.260
 religion is only a social identity 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.730
 I enjoy freedom even if 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.800

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.770
 soul not to mention amalgam 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.840

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.530

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.440
 system tool with your two guards from 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.880

 journey is thanks to the quiet without 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.540
 personality I believe no one has 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.520
 idea 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.810

 we are all brothers yet religion 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.720
 is the cause of the biggest massacres 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.160
 on earth 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.790

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.050

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.800

 wear all love all humans of the 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.500
 world could cross into a religion 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.450
 crossroads and maybe that would believe her 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.829
