in very certain situations and to be

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
in very certain situations and to be
motivated<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:04.890> suggests<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.000> be

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
motivated also suggests that you can be

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
motivated also suggests that you can be
demotivated<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
demotivated and if you if you get to a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.350 
demotivated and if you if you get to a
point<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.460> you're<00:01:08.610> demotivated<00:01:09.270> it's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.700 
point where you're demotivated it's
actually<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> lot<00:01:09.810> harder<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
actually a lot harder to get out of that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.260 
actually a lot harder to get out of that
state<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.850> you're<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
state because you know you're in this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420 
state because you know you're in this
like<00:01:12.450> weird<00:01:12.630> depression<00:01:13.290> where<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.010> just

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
like weird depression where you just

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.100

feel<00:01:14.490> burnt<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.299> exactly<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.930> what

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
feel burnt out on exactly you know what

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.240 
feel burnt out on exactly you know what
you're<00:01:16.229> doing<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.680> struggled<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> lot<00:01:17.189> with

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you're doing and I struggled a lot with

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.160 
you're doing and I struggled a lot with
this<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.700> videos<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.600> why<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> had

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this on my videos and that's why I had

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630 
this on my videos and that's why I had
so<00:01:19.409> many<00:01:19.500> problems<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.189> last<00:01:20.430> year

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
so many problems with that last year

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.210 
so many problems with that last year
however<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.409> obviously<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:22.979> doing

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
however you know obviously I'm doing

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.590 
however you know obviously I'm doing
fine<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.640> that's<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.150> I've<00:01:24.390> created

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
fine now and that's because I've created

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.510 
fine now and that's because I've created
discipline<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:26.340> feel<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:26.759> discipline<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
discipline and I feel like discipline is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.740 
discipline and I feel like discipline is
something<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.030> develop<00:01:30.420> in

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
something that you have to develop in

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.420 
something that you have to develop in
order<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> really

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
order to you know you have to really

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.710 
order to you know you have to really
commit<00:01:32.549> yourself<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.270> say<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> know

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
commit yourself and say you know

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.340 
commit yourself and say you know
basically<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.970> done<00:01:36.390> then

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
basically if I don't get this done then

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.800 
basically if I don't get this done then
what's<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> point<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.450> being

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
and it could be completely random like

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.929 
and it could be completely random like
obviously<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.280> going<00:02:25.280> from<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.579> you<00:02:25.819> know<00:02:25.909> a

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
take a step forward in this direction

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.000 
take a step forward in this direction
you<00:02:56.780> know<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.049> how<00:02:57.169> I<00:02:57.200> applied<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.859> to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
you know and how I applied that to

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.319 
you know and how I applied that to
myself<00:02:58.159> was<00:02:58.639> actually<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.180> biggest

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
myself was actually the biggest

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.599 
myself was actually the biggest
challenge<00:02:59.930> because<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.620> always<00:03:01.219> you<00:03:01.489> know<00:03:01.579> I

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
challenge because I always you know I

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.039 
challenge because I always you know I
would<00:03:01.819> listen<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.150> these<00:03:02.299> stories<00:03:02.719> and<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:02.989> i

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
would listen to these stories and then i

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.599 
would listen to these stories and then i
would<00:03:03.169> get<00:03:03.319> motivated<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.010> obviously<00:03:04.400> that's

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
would get motivated and obviously that's

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.270 
would get motivated and obviously that's
kind<00:03:04.909> of<00:03:05.000> like<00:03:05.239> not<00:03:05.959> my<00:03:06.139> goal<00:03:06.349> I<00:03:06.709> didn't<00:03:07.159> really

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.830 
kind of like not my goal I didn't really
want<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.519> work<00:03:07.639> off<00:03:07.849> motivation<00:03:08.419> I<00:03:08.510> wanted<00:03:08.750> to

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
want to work off motivation I wanted to
