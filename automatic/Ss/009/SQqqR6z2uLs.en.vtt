g1 figures kind of have this reputation

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.370 
g1 figures kind of have this reputation
being<00:02:11.009> too<00:02:11.520> simplistic<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.450> old

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
being too simplistic but the old

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.430

diaclone<00:02:14.040> figures<00:02:14.460> or<00:02:15.110> whatever<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.230> guys

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
diaclone figures or whatever this guys

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.410 
diaclone figures or whatever this guys
supposed<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.040> whichever<00:02:17.760> seriously<00:02:18.240> comes

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.640 
supposed to be whichever seriously comes
from<00:02:18.660> I'm<00:02:19.440> actually<00:02:19.770> impressed<00:02:20.070> it's<00:02:20.670> not

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
from I'm actually impressed it's not

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.130 
from I'm actually impressed it's not
super<00:02:22.650> simple<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.070> actually<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:24.140> quite

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
super simple it actually is quite

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.920 
super simple it actually is quite
involved<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:26.370> articulation<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.660> arms

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
involved and for articulation the arms

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.630 
involved and for articulation the arms
are<00:02:28.050> very<00:02:28.200> close<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.650> modern<00:02:28.830> articulation

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
are very close to modern articulation

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.330 
are very close to modern articulation
get<00:02:29.760> forward<00:02:30.120> back<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:31.610> out<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:35.459> an<00:02:35.970> elbow

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
get forward back in out and an elbow

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.880 
get forward back in out and an elbow
rotating<00:02:38.340> fists<00:02:38.610> as<00:02:38.730> well<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.989> mean<00:02:40.709> there

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
rotating fists as well so I mean there

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.460 
rotating fists as well so I mean there
are<00:02:41.010> modern-day<00:02:41.820> figures<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:43.110> released

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
are modern-day figures like released

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.960 
are modern-day figures like released
when<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.620> past<00:02:43.920> three<00:02:44.190> years<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:44.730> only

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
when the past three years that have only

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.820 
when the past three years that have only
that<00:02:45.209> much<00:02:45.360> articulation<00:02:45.720> their<00:02:46.260> hands<00:02:46.620> so

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
that much articulation their hands so

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.790 
that much articulation their hands so
I'm<00:02:47.459> impressed<00:02:47.970> now<00:02:48.930> what<00:02:49.110> doesn't<00:02:49.530> impress

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
I'm impressed now what doesn't impress

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.830 
I'm impressed now what doesn't impress
me<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:51.180> does<00:02:52.020> not<00:02:52.230> lock<00:02:52.500> down<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.840> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
me is this does not lock down and the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.449 
me is this does not lock down and the
feet<00:02:55.080> don't<00:02:55.709> match<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.450> he's

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
feet don't match it like this so he's

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.520 
feet don't match it like this so he's
balanced<00:02:59.459> but<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.360> knock<00:03:00.870> him<00:03:01.080> back<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.440> he

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
balanced but you knock him back and he

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.289 
balanced but you knock him back and he
falls<00:03:01.770> back<00:03:03.440> otherwise<00:03:04.820> he's<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> great<00:03:06.120> little

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
falls back otherwise he's a great little

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.380 
falls back otherwise he's a great little
figure<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.080> him<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.940> can<00:03:12.090> put<00:03:12.299> his

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
figure I really like him you can put his

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.660 
figure I really like him you can put his
little<00:03:12.630> weapon<00:03:13.110> into<00:03:13.470> his<00:03:13.709> hand<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:17.549> way

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
little weapon into his hand and the way

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.210 
little weapon into his hand and the way
his<00:03:17.790> missile<00:03:18.120> launchers<00:03:18.420> work<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.950> they<00:03:19.950> sail

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
his missile launchers work is they sail

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.590 
his missile launchers work is they sail
on<00:03:20.340> his<00:03:20.459> shoulders<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.030> way<00:03:21.120> they<00:03:21.269> attach

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
on his shoulders but the way they attach

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.800 
on his shoulders but the way they attach
is<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:23.580> plug<00:03:23.850> them<00:03:24.060> into<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.420> side<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.630> his

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
is you plug them into the side of his

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.539 
is you plug them into the side of his
head<00:03:24.989> that's<00:03:25.380> how<00:03:25.590> he<00:03:25.650> gets<00:03:26.070> his<00:03:26.280> shoulder

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
head that's how he gets his shoulder

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.479 
head that's how he gets his shoulder
missile<00:03:26.970> launchers<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:28.040> what<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.190> nice<00:03:29.430> about

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.920 
missile launchers and what is nice about
doing<00:03:30.360> this<00:03:31.100> is<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:32.940> does<00:03:33.120> well<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.840> think

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
they're bit too big on his head but they

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.660 
they're bit too big on his head but they
do<00:03:35.549> lock<00:03:36.299> his<00:03:36.600> chest<00:03:37.110> into<00:03:37.410> place<00:03:37.650> which<00:03:38.459> is
