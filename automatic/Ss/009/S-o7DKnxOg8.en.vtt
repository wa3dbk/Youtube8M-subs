everybody<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.460> announced<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.720> then

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
everybody and announced that and then

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.829 
everybody and announced that and then
she<00:00:58.140> had<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.440> suddenly<00:00:58.650> go<00:00:59.010> lay<00:00:59.220> down<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.839> then

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
she had to suddenly go lay down and then

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.490 
she had to suddenly go lay down and then
sudden<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.350> had<00:01:01.530> feet<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> she<00:01:03.540> was<00:01:03.690> still<00:01:03.960> kind

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
sudden we had feet so she was still kind

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.670 
sudden we had feet so she was still kind
of<00:01:04.620> cold<00:01:04.920> her<00:01:05.820> core<00:01:06.090> temperature<00:01:06.690> herself<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of cold her core temperature herself I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
of cold her core temperature herself I
think<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.370> cold<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.240> she<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:09.750> not

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
think it's kind of cold and she was not

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
think it's kind of cold and she was not
that<00:01:10.470> relaxed<00:01:11.130> she<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> very<00:01:11.880> good

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that relaxed she was in a very good

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.560 
that relaxed she was in a very good
humor<00:01:12.230> but<00:01:13.230> I<00:01:13.530> wanted<00:01:14.250> her<00:01:14.430> line<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
humor but I wanted her line back for a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.360 
humor but I wanted her line back for a
while<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.780> wanted<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> slow<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.159> bird

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
while I wanted to slow down the bird

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.020 
while I wanted to slow down the bird
okay<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.290> think<00:01:19.620> there's<00:01:19.860> don't<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
okay and I think there's don't want it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.030 
okay and I think there's don't want it
to<00:01:21.180> happen

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
to happen

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.000 
to happen
fast<00:01:22.510> because<00:01:23.510> too<00:01:23.780> fast<00:01:24.050> isn't<00:01:24.350> necessarily

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
fast because too fast isn't necessarily

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.130 
fast because too fast isn't necessarily
good<00:01:25.930> so<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.230> my<00:01:27.740> thought<00:01:28.010> was<00:01:28.040> also<00:01:28.910> while<00:01:29.840> a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
good so and my thought was also while a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.930 
good so and my thought was also while a
prolapsed<00:01:31.010> cord<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.640> not<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:32.150> specific<00:01:32.800> danger

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
prolapsed cord is not a specific danger

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.540 
prolapsed cord is not a specific danger
equal<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:36.050> when<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.620> have<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:37.190> frank

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
equal to that when you have a frank

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.860 
equal to that when you have a frank
breech<00:01:37.850> or<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.600> vertex<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:40.240> school

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
breech or a vertex I school

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.450 
breech or a vertex I school
okay<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:43.040> mean<00:01:43.729> in<00:01:43.940> other<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:45.770> can<00:01:45.950> have<00:01:46.190> a

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
okay I mean in other you can have a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.450 
okay I mean in other you can have a
prolapse<00:01:47.240> with<00:01:47.780> foot<00:01:48.170> length<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.979> might<00:01:49.220> be

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
prolapse with foot length that might be

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.310 
prolapse with foot length that might be
existing<00:01:50.120> for<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.540> couple<00:01:50.840> battle<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.229> you

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
existing for a couple battle and you

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.440 
existing for a couple battle and you
never<00:01:51.470> they<00:01:51.620> just<00:01:51.860> fine<00:01:52.040> because<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:53.180> cord

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
never they just fine because the cord

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.350 
never they just fine because the cord
isn't<00:01:53.930> being<00:01:54.110> compressed<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.729> in<00:01:55.910> all<00:01:56.150> cases

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
isn't being compressed and in all cases

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.230 
isn't being compressed and in all cases
where<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:57.050> happen<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.530> stuff<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:58.240> still

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
where that to happen that stuff I still

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.330 
where that to happen that stuff I still
don't

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
don't

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240 
don't
so<00:02:01.340> my<00:02:02.030> thought<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.330> if<00:02:02.720> she's<00:02:03.020> lying<00:02:03.410> flat<00:02:03.710> is

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
so my thought is if she's lying flat is

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.850 
so my thought is if she's lying flat is
less<00:02:04.550> likely<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.000> collapse<00:02:05.360> it's<00:02:06.320> really<00:02:06.740> an

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
less likely to collapse it's really an

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.070 
less likely to collapse it's really an
okay<00:02:07.190> time<00:02:07.430> for<00:02:07.490> supine<00:02:08.119> position<00:02:08.690> if<00:02:08.929> the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
okay time for supine position if the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.949 
okay time for supine position if the
biggest<00:02:09.410> heart's<00:02:09.649> fine<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:11.480> will<00:02:11.690> slow

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
biggest heart's fine and that will slow

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.190 
biggest heart's fine and that will slow
it<00:02:12.080> down<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.330> that's<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:14.660> we<00:02:14.750> did<00:02:14.900> with<00:02:15.050> him

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
it down so that's what we did with him

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.900 
it down so that's what we did with him
for<00:02:15.410> awhile<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.220> baby<00:02:16.430> was<00:02:16.730> coming

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
for awhile but this baby was coming

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.490 
for awhile but this baby was coming
pretty<00:02:17.480> fast<00:02:17.570> anyway

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
pretty fast anyway

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.850 
pretty fast anyway
I<00:02:19.130> don't<00:02:19.340> think<00:02:19.400> floated<00:02:19.970> them<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.690> much<00:02:20.989> but

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
I don't think floated them that much but

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.160 
I don't think floated them that much but
I<00:02:22.160> think<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.850> fact<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.300> she<00:02:23.570> wasn't<00:02:23.780> holding

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
I think the fact that she wasn't holding

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.610 
I think the fact that she wasn't holding
herself<00:02:24.680> off<00:02:25.250> allowed<00:02:25.760> her<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.690> between<00:02:26.989> her

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
herself off allowed her in between her

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.240 
herself off allowed her in between her
contractions<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.670> rest<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.630> little<00:02:29.750> bit<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.500> to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
contractions to rest a little bit and to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.030 
contractions to rest a little bit and to
give<00:02:31.459> in<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.970> know<00:02:32.090> and

point<00:03:08.049> when<00:03:08.680> she<00:03:08.920> pushed<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:10.000> baby<00:03:10.180> started

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
point when she pushed the baby started

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.979 
point when she pushed the baby started
to<00:03:11.019> spontaneously<00:03:11.859> roll<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:13.030> way<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.959> I

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
to spontaneously roll the way that I

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.429 
to spontaneously roll the way that I
wanted<00:03:14.530> them<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.769> but<00:03:15.579> if<00:03:15.700> he<00:03:15.819> hadn't<00:03:16.389> I<00:03:16.599> would

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
wanted them to but if he hadn't I would

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.390 
wanted them to but if he hadn't I would
have<00:03:17.489> started<00:03:18.489> encouraging<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:20.049> roll<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:21.280> I

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
have started encouraging to roll and I

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.740 
have started encouraging to roll and I
would<00:03:21.609> have<00:03:21.730> done<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:22.000> for<00:03:22.030> him<00:03:22.419> because<00:03:22.569> I

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
would have done it for him because I

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.780 
would have done it for him because I
think<00:03:22.810> at<00:03:23.139> that<00:03:23.319> point<00:03:23.379> it<00:03:24.040> would<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.639> been

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
think at that point it would have been

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.899 
think at that point it would have been
pretty<00:03:25.060> easy<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.629> accomplish<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:27.579> baby

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
pretty easy to accomplish and the baby

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.929 
pretty easy to accomplish and the baby
actually<00:03:28.120> turned<00:03:28.750> very<00:03:29.019> nicely<00:03:29.730> then<00:03:30.730> this

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
actually turned very nicely then this

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.099 
actually turned very nicely then this
was<00:03:31.150> one<00:03:31.450> where<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.409> head<00:03:32.980> with<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.090> lat<00:03:34.299> okay

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
was one where the head with the lat okay

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.559 
was one where the head with the lat okay
that's<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.530> hip<00:03:35.769> we<00:03:36.220> had<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.669> hang<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.180> baby<00:03:37.359> a

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
that's the hip we had to hang the baby a

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.189 
that's the hip we had to hang the baby a
little<00:03:38.049> bit<00:03:39.359> we<00:03:40.359> bring<00:03:40.840> him<00:03:40.959> up<00:03:41.169> this<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.750> now

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
little bit we bring him up this and now

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.649 
little bit we bring him up this and now
we've<00:03:44.409> got<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.769> airway<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:46.000> rest<00:03:46.419> of<00:03:46.569> the

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
we've got the airway and the rest of the

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.059 
we've got the airway and the rest of the
head<00:03:46.840> isn't<00:03:47.049> going<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.500> come<00:03:47.650> off<00:03:47.829> because

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
head isn't going to come off because

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.270 
head isn't going to come off because
it's<00:03:48.519> it's<00:03:49.389> just<00:03:49.629> not<00:03:49.870> molded<00:03:50.379> and<00:03:50.530> she's<00:03:51.069> not

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
it's it's just not molded and she's not

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.300 
it's it's just not molded and she's not
that<00:03:51.609> dog<00:03:51.879> like<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.690> got<00:03:52.900> everything<00:03:53.290> out<00:03:53.650> too

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
that dog like we got everything out too

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.479 
that dog like we got everything out too
now

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
now

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:01.589 
now
so<00:03:55.389> we<00:03:56.819> then<00:03:57.819> you<00:03:58.299> decide<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:59.769> know<00:04:00.209> our<00:04:01.209> room

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
so we then you decide you know our room

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.780 
so we then you decide you know our room
was<00:04:01.810> still<00:04:02.049> not<00:04:02.169> a<00:04:02.229> form<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:02.979> we<00:04:03.099> elected<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.639> do

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
was still not a form so we elected to do

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.140 
was still not a form so we elected to do
he<00:04:04.120> need<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.720> oddity<00:04:05.079> here<00:04:05.319> here<00:04:05.919> and<00:04:06.150> it

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
he need to the oddity here here and it

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.479 
he need to the oddity here here and it
was<00:04:07.419> fairly<00:04:07.720> teeny<00:04:08.139> and<00:04:08.379> I<00:04:08.829> think<00:04:09.159> probably

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
was fairly teeny and I think probably

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.370 
was fairly teeny and I think probably
when<00:04:10.090> that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
when that

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:21.930 
when that
