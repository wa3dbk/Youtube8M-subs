00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
Falls layer 9 was a circle and the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.040 
Falls layer 9 was a circle and the
circle<00:02:56.989> just<00:02:57.470> pretty<00:02:57.739> much<00:02:58.360> went<00:02:59.360> behind<00:02:59.510> the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
circle just pretty much went behind the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.449 
circle just pretty much went behind the
eyes<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.940> give<00:03:02.090> him<00:03:02.239> some<00:03:02.420> skin<00:03:02.660> coloration

for the eyes I used it on both eyes I've
stretched<00:03:16.459> skewed<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.180> rotate<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.630> around

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
stretched skewed and rotate it around

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.680 
stretched skewed and rotate it around
both<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:18.890> those<00:03:19.280> are<00:03:19.579> oven<00:03:20.120> myth

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690

and that's 10 and 11 layer 12 you have

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.750 
and that's 10 and 11 layer 12 you have
the<00:03:29.870> eyeball<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:32.050> that<00:03:33.050> is<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.290> circle<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.700> I

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
the eyeball and that is a circle that I

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.640 
the eyeball and that is a circle that I
just<00:03:35.090> really<00:03:35.510> skewed<00:03:36.110> down<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.650> size<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.930> the

just really skewed down to size and the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.490 
just really skewed down to size and the
layer<00:03:40.190> 13<00:03:40.880> is<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.840> windsock<00:03:42.710> and<00:03:43.070> I<00:03:43.490> use<00:03:43.820> that

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
layer 13 is a windsock and I use that

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.590 
layer 13 is a windsock and I use that
for<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.590> bruising<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.310> his<00:03:46.460> eyeball<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.390> that

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
for the bruising of his eyeball and that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.380 
for the bruising of his eyeball and that
is<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> purplish<00:03:48.500> bruising<00:03:49.100> color<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.880> you'll

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
is a purplish bruising color that you'll

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.150 
is a purplish bruising color that you'll
have<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.780> go<00:03:50.930> in<00:03:51.110> and<00:03:51.350> tweak<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.800> to<00:03:51.890> get<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.130> to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
have to go in and tweak it to get it to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.900 
have to go in and tweak it to get it to
work<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.700> shade<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.240> you<00:03:53.480> prefer<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.910> I'm

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
work the shade that you prefer and I'm

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.250 
work the shade that you prefer and I'm
just<00:03:56.150> flipping<00:03:56.510> through<00:03:56.540> here<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:56.990> you<00:03:57.080> can

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
just flipping through here so you can

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.880 
just flipping through here so you can
see<00:03:57.310> where<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.580> placement<00:03:59.060> was<00:04:00.970> layer<00:04:01.970> 14<00:04:02.890> was

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
see where the placement was layer 14 was

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.210 
see where the placement was layer 14 was
the<00:04:04.790> wind<00:04:05.120> sock<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:06.290> time<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.560> outlined

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
the wind sock and that time I outlined

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.920 
the wind sock and that time I outlined
it<00:04:07.430> just<00:04:07.910> don't<00:04:08.300> line<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.570> give<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.720> some

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
it just don't line and give it some

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.820 
it just don't line and give it some
definition<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:10.460> eyelid<00:04:11.860> layer<00:04:12.860> 15<00:04:14.830> basically

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
definition the eyelid layer 15 basically

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.940 
definition the eyelid layer 15 basically
it's<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.459> circle<00:04:17.209> number<00:04:17.570> two<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:18.799> I've

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
it's the circle number two that I've

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.099 
it's the circle number two that I've
skewed<00:04:19.340> around<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:19.970> stretched<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:20.570> rotated

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
skewed around and stretched and rotated

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.170 
skewed around and stretched and rotated
it<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.380> give<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.709> old<00:04:22.700> type<00:04:23.390> shape<00:04:24.070> to

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
it to give it the old type shape to

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.040 
it to give it the old type shape to
contour<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.210> face<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:28.400> just<00:04:28.610> did<00:04:29.050> another

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
contour the face and I just did another

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.380 
contour the face and I just did another
on<00:04:30.710> 16<00:04:31.550> i<00:04:31.580> did<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:33.070> circle<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.280> just<00:04:35.120> to<00:04:35.210> give<00:04:35.360> it

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
on 16 i did a circle to just to give it

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.890 
on 16 i did a circle to just to give it
a<00:04:35.570> little<00:04:35.720> fullness<00:04:36.200> with<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.280> outline<00:04:37.730> of

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
now on 24 I use the windsock skewed it

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.580 
now on 24 I use the windsock skewed it
around<00:06:38.130> stretched<00:06:38.880> it<00:06:39.200> maneuvered<00:06:40.200> it<00:06:40.350> into

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
around stretched it maneuvered it into

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.410 
around stretched it maneuvered it into
place<00:06:40.860> where<00:06:41.190> I<00:06:41.220> wanted<00:06:41.670> it<00:06:42.500> and<00:06:44.150> I'm<00:06:45.150> going<00:06:45.360> to

place where I wanted it and I'm going to

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.940 
place where I wanted it and I'm going to
flip<00:06:45.540> between<00:06:45.690> the<00:06:46.050> two<00:06:46.200> so<00:06:46.350> you<00:06:46.440> can<00:06:46.650> kind<00:06:46.890> of

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
flip between the two so you can kind of

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.970 
flip between the two so you can kind of
see<00:06:48.650> later<00:06:49.650> 25<00:06:50.070> bees<00:06:50.940> are<00:06:51.330> all<00:06:51.680> merciless<00:06:52.680> and
