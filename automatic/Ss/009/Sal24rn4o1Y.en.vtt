00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
that they will just bend and break more

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.380

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
struggle to do it okay so leave them to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.899 
struggle to do it okay so leave them to
dry<00:01:41.049> and<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:42.499> read<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.039> some<00:01:43.249> the<00:01:43.579> other<00:01:43.729> day

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
dry and I read to some the other day

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.349 
dry and I read to some the other day
which<00:01:44.119> have<00:01:44.329> now<00:01:44.509> dried<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:46.399> what<00:01:47.060> I'm<00:01:47.179> gonna

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
which have now dried so what I'm gonna

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.789 
which have now dried so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:47.569> now<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:48.079> taking<00:01:48.889> a<00:01:48.979> color<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.469> think

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
do now is taking a color that I think

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.440 
do now is taking a color that I think
will<00:01:52.009> go<00:01:52.159> well<00:01:52.340> with<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.969> color<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:53.359> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
will go well with the color on the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.969 
will go well with the color on the
inside<00:01:54.850> I'm<00:01:55.850> going<00:01:55.999> to<00:01:56.090> mix<00:01:56.299> it<00:01:56.600> with<00:01:56.979> some

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
inside I'm going to mix it with some

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.129 
inside I'm going to mix it with some
traps<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.060> you'll<00:01:59.240> see<00:01:59.450> them<00:01:59.539> using<00:01:59.689> plenty<00:01:59.990> of

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
traps so you'll see them using plenty of

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.940 
traps so you'll see them using plenty of
Trex<00:02:00.469> Trex<00:02:00.649> is<00:02:01.039> just<00:02:01.249> a<00:02:01.459> vegetable<00:02:01.700> fat<00:02:02.270> and

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
Trex Trex is just a vegetable fat and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.719 
Trex Trex is just a vegetable fat and
you<00:02:03.950> can<00:02:04.130> usually<00:02:04.280> get<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.609> in<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
you can usually get it in the

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.760 
you can usually get it in the
supermarket's<00:02:05.509> down<00:02:06.079> there<00:02:06.319> where<00:02:06.679> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
supermarket's down there where the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.820 
supermarket's down there where the
butter<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.330> lard<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.170> things<00:02:09.440> are<00:02:09.709> okay

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
butter and lard and things are okay

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.400 
butter and lard and things are okay
now<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:11.970> makes<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> little<00:02:12.600> bit<00:02:12.750> softer

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
now it just makes it a little bit softer

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.680 
now it just makes it a little bit softer
because<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:15.660> can<00:02:15.810> either<00:02:15.930> roll<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.100> by<00:02:17.280> hand

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
because you can either roll this by hand

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.170 
because you can either roll this by hand
or<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:19.800> use<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> little<00:02:20.610> clay<00:02:20.940> gun

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
or you can use like a little clay gun

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.970 
or you can use like a little clay gun
like<00:02:21.540> what<00:02:21.720> I've<00:02:21.870> got<00:02:22.140> which<00:02:22.560> again<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.860> just

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
like what I've got which again I just

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.970 
like what I've got which again I just
got<00:02:23.310> off<00:02:23.370> Amazon<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:27.830> what<00:02:28.830> we're

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
got off Amazon this one so what we're

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.250 
got off Amazon this one so what we're
going<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.160> do<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:30.000> create<00:02:30.240> like<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.600> long<00:02:30.930> thin

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
going to do is create like a long thin

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.140 
going to do is create like a long thin
round<00:02:31.590> piece<00:02:31.920> which<00:02:32.100> we<00:02:32.250> will<00:02:32.370> put<00:02:32.580> around<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
round piece which we will put around the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.540 
round piece which we will put around the
edge<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.660> our<00:02:33.870> lettering<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.250> you're<00:02:35.400> doing

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
edge of our lettering so if you're doing

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.900 
edge of our lettering so if you're doing
it<00:02:35.670> freehand<00:02:36.080> see<00:02:37.080> literally<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:38.610> going<00:02:38.850> to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
it freehand see literally just going to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.610 
it freehand see literally just going to
roll<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:40.430> till<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.550> get<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.850> nice<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.060> thin<00:02:42.620> it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
roll it till you get it nice and thin it

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.850 
roll it till you get it nice and thin it
can<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:44.010> difficult<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.550> get<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.760> all<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:46.560> same

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
can be difficult to get it all the same

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.840 
can be difficult to get it all the same
width<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.860> I'm<00:02:50.160> going<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.370> put<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.700> through

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
width so I'm going to put it through

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.120 
width so I'm going to put it through
here<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.930> don't<00:02:52.110> have<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.530> do<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.740> we're<00:02:52.950> using

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
here you don't have to do it we're using

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.320 
here you don't have to do it we're using
one<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.400> these<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.820> find<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.060> little<00:02:54.180> bit

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
one of these I just find a little bit

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.670 
one of these I just find a little bit
easier<00:02:54.660> I'm<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.320> add<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> bit<00:02:55.650> more

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
easier I'm going to add a bit more

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.040 
easier I'm going to add a bit more
tracks<00:02:59.270> just<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.450> make<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.750> little<00:03:00.840> bit

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
tracks just to make it a little bit

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.750 
tracks just to make it a little bit
softer<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.650> goes<00:03:01.830> through<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.310> clay<00:03:02.520> got<00:03:02.730> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
softer so it goes through the clay got a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.610 
softer so it goes through the clay got a
bit<00:03:02.940> easier

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.370 

that's<00:03:07.620> quite<00:03:07.890> warm<00:03:08.190> today<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.610> hopefully<00:03:09.380> it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
that's quite warm today so hopefully it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.800 
that's quite warm today so hopefully it
means<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.040> icing<00:03:11.550> should<00:03:12.060> soften<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.630> go

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
means the icing should soften and go

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.780 
means the icing should soften and go
through<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.050> quite<00:03:13.260> easily<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:14.640> this

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
through it quite easily so with this

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.870 
through it quite easily so with this
thing<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:16.200> get<00:03:16.290> loads<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.650> different<00:03:16.880> little

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
thing you get loads of different little

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.090 
thing you get loads of different little
shapes<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.540> size<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.230> pieces<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:19.860> I'm<00:03:19.950> just

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
shapes and size and pieces so I'm just

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.220 
shapes and size and pieces so I'm just
going<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.250> use<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> little<00:03:20.850> round<00:03:21.090> one<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.660> don't

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
going to use a little round one I don't

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.630 
going to use a little round one I don't
want<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.440> too<00:03:22.620> thick<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:23.160> when<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> put<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.580> on

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
want it too thick that when I put it on

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.949 
want it too thick that when I put it on
it's<00:03:23.820> going<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.970> be<00:03:24.060> bigger<00:03:24.360> than<00:03:24.510> my<00:03:24.600> lighter

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it's going to be bigger than my lighter

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.580 
it's going to be bigger than my lighter
so<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.440> size<00:03:25.739> wise<00:03:26.010> will<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:28.290> top<00:03:28.470> of

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
so this size wise will do so just top of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.670 
so this size wise will do so just top of
that<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.950> end<00:03:29.070> screw<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.090> end<00:03:30.239> on

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.020 

okay<00:03:36.430> that's<00:03:36.849> my<00:03:36.970> icing<00:03:38.430> I'm<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.579> gonna<00:03:39.760> take

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
okay that's my icing I'm just gonna take

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.679 
okay that's my icing I'm just gonna take
a<00:03:40.060> piece<00:03:41.430> right<00:03:42.430> then<00:03:42.879> and<00:03:43.090> push<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.659> like

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
a piece right then and push it in like

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.080 
a piece right then and push it in like
that<00:03:44.079> okay<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:45.280> now<00:03:45.459> we're<00:03:45.579> just<00:03:45.730> gonna<00:03:45.819> push

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
that okay so now we're just gonna push

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.770 
that okay so now we're just gonna push
down<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.650> should<00:03:47.680> see<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:49.269> start<00:03:49.599> to<00:03:49.659> come

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
down and you should see it start to come

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.330 
down and you should see it start to come
out<00:03:49.989> right<00:03:50.140> it's<00:03:50.319> still<00:03:50.590> quite<00:03:50.769> hard<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.129> push

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
out right it's still quite hard to push

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.119 
out right it's still quite hard to push
through<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.840> do<00:03:53.049> sometimes<00:03:53.349> struggle

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
through and I do sometimes struggle

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.589 
through and I do sometimes struggle
getting<00:03:54.250> out<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:56.140> keep<00:03:56.590> going<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:58.299> it<00:03:58.450> just

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
getting out so keep going and it just

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.750 
getting out so keep going and it just
wants<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.840> be<00:03:58.930> long<00:03:59.170> enough<00:03:59.250> it<00:04:00.250> can<00:04:00.400> go<00:04:00.549> all

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
wants to be long enough it can go all

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.520 
wants to be long enough it can go all
the<00:04:00.790> way<00:04:01.030> around<00:04:01.359> so<00:04:01.629> I<00:04:01.750> think<00:04:01.930> that's<00:04:02.290> plenty

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
the way around so I think that's plenty

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.380 
the way around so I think that's plenty
line<00:04:02.829> I<00:04:02.859> have<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.159> go<00:04:03.250> around<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.760> letter<00:04:04.060> C

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
line I have to go around this letter C

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.420 
line I have to go around this letter C
so<00:04:04.599> when<00:04:05.260> you've<00:04:05.379> done<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:06.040> want<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.280> put

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
so when you've done that you want to put

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.550 
so when you've done that you want to put
a<00:04:06.459> little<00:04:06.640> bit<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.879> water<00:04:07.090> all<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.200> way<00:04:08.290> around

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
a little bit of water all the way around

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.089 
a little bit of water all the way around
the<00:04:08.709> edge<00:04:09.220> bit<00:04:10.290> now<00:04:11.290> careful<00:04:11.680> not<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.889> get<00:04:11.950> on

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
the edge bit now careful not to get on

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.140 
the edge bit now careful not to get on
the<00:04:12.159> back<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.489> if<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.639> get<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.819> on<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:12.970> back

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
the back so if you get it on the back

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.309 
the back so if you get it on the back
you'll<00:04:13.359> just<00:04:13.510> find<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.840> your<00:04:13.959> lettering

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
you'll just find that your lettering

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.469 
you'll just find that your lettering
sticks<00:04:15.159> to<00:04:15.370> whatever<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.819> put<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.090> down<00:04:16.209> I'm

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
sticks to whatever you put it down I'm

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.860 
sticks to whatever you put it down I'm
straight<00:04:16.840> away<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:19.419> I'm<00:04:19.479> going<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.660> do<00:04:19.720> that

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
straight away so I'm going to do that

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.490 
straight away so I'm going to do that
all<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.019> way<00:04:20.139> around

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.620 

okay<00:04:28.080> I'm<00:04:29.080> gonna<00:04:29.200> light<00:04:29.410> flap<00:04:30.360> when<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.390> put

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
okay I'm gonna light flap when I put

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.960 
okay I'm gonna light flap when I put
this<00:04:31.750> on<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:34.050> I'm<00:04:35.050> gonna<00:04:35.550> start<00:04:36.550> by<00:04:36.730> pressing

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
this on so I'm gonna start by pressing

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.060 
this on so I'm gonna start by pressing
it<00:04:37.270> I'll<00:04:37.540> just<00:04:37.810> lift<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.260> around<00:04:38.500> here<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:38.950> you

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
it I'll just lift it around here so you

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.230 
it I'll just lift it around here so you
can<00:04:39.220> get<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.430> around<00:04:39.520> this<00:04:39.700> edge<00:04:39.910> now<00:04:42.060> if<00:04:43.060> you

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
can get it around this edge now if you

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.880 
can get it around this edge now if you
think<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.540> looks<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.750> bit<00:04:43.780> bulky<00:04:44.320> in<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.650> size

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
think it looks a bit bulky in this size

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.650 
think it looks a bit bulky in this size
just<00:04:45.190> make<00:04:45.460> sure<00:04:45.670> it's<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:46.030> little<00:04:46.240> bit<00:04:46.390> thinner

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
just make sure it's a little bit thinner

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.060 
just make sure it's a little bit thinner
when<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:47.290> put<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.590> on<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:50.020> I'm<00:04:50.170> pushing<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.890> all

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
when you put it on so I'm pushing it all

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.120 
when you put it on so I'm pushing it all
the<00:04:51.130> way<00:04:51.340> around<00:04:51.610> now<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:53.590> push<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.980> in<00:04:54.070> a

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
the way around now just push it in a

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.200 
the way around now just push it in a
little<00:04:54.160> bit<00:04:54.400> with<00:04:54.580> you<00:04:54.670> paint<00:04:54.910> where<00:04:55.090> she

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
little bit with you paint where she

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.460 
little bit with you paint where she
paint<00:04:55.420> which<00:04:55.630> doesn't<00:04:55.870> have<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.110> be<00:04:56.200> worked<00:04:56.410> by

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
paint which doesn't have to be worked by

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.920 
paint which doesn't have to be worked by
the<00:04:56.560> way<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.830> do<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:57.220> just<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.700> make<00:04:57.820> sure

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
the way to do this just to make sure

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.010 
the way to do this just to make sure
they<00:04:58.930> stick<00:04:59.410> in<00:04:59.620> Nashik<00:05:00.100> going<00:05:00.430> on<00:05:01.020> especially

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
they stick in Nashik going on especially

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.570 
they stick in Nashik going on especially
bits<00:05:02.560> where<00:05:02.710> it's<00:05:02.830> difficult<00:05:03.010> to<00:05:03.280> get<00:05:03.430> your

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
bits where it's difficult to get your

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.180 
bits where it's difficult to get your
finger<00:05:03.910> into<00:05:04.030> okay<00:05:04.900> so<00:05:05.470> we've<00:05:05.620> comin<00:05:05.890> out<00:05:06.040> to

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
finger into okay so we've comin out to

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.150 
finger into okay so we've comin out to
the<00:05:06.250> bit<00:05:06.400> where<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:06.880> going<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.150> dry<00:05:08.100> so<00:05:09.100> I'm

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
the bit where it's going to dry so I'm

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.200 
the bit where it's going to dry so I'm
just<00:05:09.310> going<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.520> cut<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:09.820> so<00:05:10.000> it's<00:05:10.090> about

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
just going to cut that so it's about

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.920 
just going to cut that so it's about
level<00:05:10.570> with<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:12.390> I'm<00:05:13.390> just<00:05:13.419> going<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.750> push

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
level with that I'm just going to push

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:22.700 
level with that I'm just going to push
it<00:05:13.960> in<00:05:17.280> okay<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:18.340> that's<00:05:18.700> one<00:05:18.970> lighter<00:05:19.180> done

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.980 

now<00:05:23.910> these<00:05:24.910> letters<00:05:25.090> are<00:05:25.390> a<00:05:25.419> bit<00:05:25.570> harder

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
now these letters are a bit harder

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.780 
now these letters are a bit harder
because<00:05:26.110> they've<00:05:26.410> got<00:05:26.620> little<00:05:27.100> holes<00:05:27.430> cut<00:05:27.760> out

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
because they've got little holes cut out

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.130 
because they've got little holes cut out
so<00:05:28.300> again<00:05:28.900> exactly<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.530> same<00:05:30.840> just<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:31.930> bit<00:05:32.050> of

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
so again exactly the same just a bit of

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.440 
so again exactly the same just a bit of
water<00:05:32.550> in<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.760> centres<00:05:35.820> and<00:05:36.820> I<00:05:36.940> tend<00:05:37.270> to<00:05:37.330> do

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
water in the centres and I tend to do

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.890 
water in the centres and I tend to do
for<00:05:37.660> this<00:05:37.780> is<00:05:37.960> start<00:05:38.260> kind<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.500> over<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:38.979> top

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
for this is start kind of over the top

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.130 
for this is start kind of over the top
of<00:05:40.900> my<00:05:41.080> letter<00:05:41.290> and<00:05:41.740> try<00:05:42.630> make<00:05:43.630> it<00:05:43.720> easier<00:05:44.110> to

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
of my letter and try make it easier to

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.100 
of my letter and try make it easier to
lift<00:05:44.350> it<00:05:44.530> off<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:45.130> create<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.430> bit<00:05:45.580> of<00:05:45.669> a<00:05:45.729> circle

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.490 

and<00:05:50.710> then<00:05:50.889> I'm<00:05:50.979> just<00:05:51.039> gonna<00:05:51.280> cut<00:05:52.319> and<00:05:53.319> then

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
and then I'm just gonna cut and then

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.960 
and then I'm just gonna cut and then
what<00:05:53.650> I<00:05:53.680> want<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:53.889> do<00:05:53.949> is<00:05:54.069> using<00:05:54.250> my<00:05:54.400> paintbrush

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
what I want to do is using my paintbrush

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.230 
what I want to do is using my paintbrush
I'm<00:05:55.840> just<00:05:56.080> gonna<00:05:56.199> gently<00:05:57.000> try<00:05:58.000> and<00:05:58.150> poke<00:05:58.360> it<00:05:58.569> in

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
I'm just gonna gently try and poke it in

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.429 
I'm just gonna gently try and poke it in
which<00:06:01.240> is<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.389> bit<00:06:01.629> of<00:06:01.689> a<00:06:01.780> squeeze<00:06:01.930> because<00:06:02.229> I've

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
which is a bit of a squeeze because I've

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:08.469 
which is a bit of a squeeze because I've
used<00:06:02.560> kind<00:06:02.770> of<00:06:02.919> fat<00:06:03.189> piece

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:18.140 

I'm<00:06:09.479> gonna<00:06:09.660> poke<00:06:09.900> it<00:06:10.110> into<00:06:11.000> not<00:06:12.000> home<00:06:13.639> okay<00:06:17.150> so

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
I'm gonna poke it into not home okay so

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:32.700 
I'm gonna poke it into not home okay so
Sam<00:06:18.449> again<00:06:18.720> on<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:18.990> other<00:06:19.020> one

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.310 

push<00:06:33.710> my<00:06:33.860> paintbrush<00:06:34.370> back<00:06:34.670> in<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:35.900> open<00:06:36.200> out

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
push my paintbrush back in to open out

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.800 
push my paintbrush back in to open out
them<00:06:36.680> so<00:06:37.280> then<00:06:37.730> it's<00:06:37.880> exactly<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:38.330> same<00:06:38.510> all

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
them so then it's exactly the same all

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.060 
them so then it's exactly the same all
the<00:06:38.900> way<00:06:38.990> around<00:06:39.170> the<00:06:39.290> edge<00:06:39.380> is<00:06:39.650> what<00:06:39.830> we<00:06:39.920> did

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
the way around the edge is what we did
