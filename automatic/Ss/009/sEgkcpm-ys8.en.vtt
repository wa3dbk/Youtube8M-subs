believe their glory days are behind them

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.330 
believe their glory days are behind them
and<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:22.260> not<00:00:22.440> because<00:00:22.650> they<00:00:23.010> work<00:00:23.160> for

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
and it's not because they work for

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.779 
and it's not because they work for
Microsoft<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.780> not<00:00:24.960> because<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.260> this

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
Microsoft and it's not because of this

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.640 
Microsoft and it's not because of this
it's<00:00:26.789> because<00:00:27.150> well<00:00:28.050> there's<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> whole<00:00:28.470> lot<00:00:28.619> of

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it's because well there's a whole lot of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.230 
it's because well there's a whole lot of
other<00:00:28.830> issues<00:00:29.100> but<00:00:29.550> let's<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:29.940> say<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
other issues but let's just say the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.209 
other issues but let's just say the
biggest<00:00:30.450> one<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.900> they've<00:00:31.380> lost<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.890> lot<00:00:32.189> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
biggest one is they've lost a lot of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.810 
biggest one is they've lost a lot of
their<00:00:32.550> best<00:00:32.879> people<00:00:33.539> they<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:34.620> don't<00:00:35.489> really

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
their best people they just don't really

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
their best people they just don't really
have<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> mini<00:00:36.660> mall<00:00:36.810> at<00:00:37.440> least<00:00:37.620> that's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
have it in the mini mall at least that's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.550 
have it in the mini mall at least that's
what<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.130> believe<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.870> here's<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:40.079> reasoning

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
what I believe and here's my reasoning

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.450 
what I believe and here's my reasoning
behind<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.630> let's<00:00:42.630> take<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> trip<00:00:43.230> back

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
behind that let's take a trip back

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.060 
behind that let's take a trip back
that's<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> NES<00:00:45.090> days<00:00:45.770> rare<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:47.040> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
that's the NES days rare was a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.690 
that's the NES days rare was a
relatively<00:00:47.640> unknown<00:00:48.210> company<00:00:48.750> back<00:00:48.930> then

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
relatively unknown company back then

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.540 
relatively unknown company back then
very<00:00:50.700> few<00:00:51.030> people<00:00:51.450> actually<00:00:51.600> knew<00:00:52.140> them<00:00:52.380> and<00:00:52.649> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
very few people actually knew them and I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
very few people actually knew them and I
don't<00:00:53.760> believe<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.149> had<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.660> little<00:00:54.809> logo

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
don't believe they had that little logo

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410 
don't believe they had that little logo
that<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.890> today<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.180> game<00:00:57.360> that

to<00:05:26.069> the<00:05:26.129> perfect<00:05:26.490> time<00:05:26.639> I<00:05:26.879> think<00:05:27.360> was<00:05:27.479> a

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
to the perfect time I think was a

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.450 
to the perfect time I think was a
prequel<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.289> heard<00:05:28.860> they<00:05:29.009> were<00:05:29.069> supposed<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.370> be

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
making a trilogy out of it but I think

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.460 
making a trilogy out of it but I think
that<00:05:32.759> kind<00:05:33.030> of<00:05:33.090> fell<00:05:33.330> through<00:05:33.360> perfect<00:05:34.349> dark

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
that kind of fell through perfect dark

that kind of fell through perfect dark
zero<00:05:34.590> was<00:05:35.159> over<00:05:35.789> height<00:05:36.030> anticipation<00:05:36.930> was

them<00:07:32.599> no<00:07:33.319> longer<00:07:33.680> being<00:07:33.860> as<00:07:34.009> good<00:07:34.069> as<00:07:34.280> they

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 
them no longer being as good as they

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.029 
them no longer being as good as they
were<00:07:34.599> it's<00:07:35.599> because<00:07:35.900> they<00:07:36.020> lost<00:07:36.199> a<00:07:36.440> lot<00:07:36.710> of<00:07:36.740> key

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 
were it's because they lost a lot of key
