a<00:00:44.700> while<00:00:44.850> there<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.420> realized<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.110> lot

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
a while there I think I realized a lot

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.130 
a while there I think I realized a lot
sooner<00:00:46.829> than<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.460> admitted<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.120> myself<00:00:48.360> yeah

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
sooner than I admitted to myself yeah

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.979 
sooner than I admitted to myself yeah
cuz<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.219> along<00:00:50.600> there<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.750> no

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
cuz I was going along there was no

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.189 
cuz I was going along there was no
markers<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.100> long<00:00:53.430> time<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> told

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
markers for a long time then I told

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
markers for a long time then I told
myself<00:00:55.500> over<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> river<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.579> probably

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
myself over on a river so that probably

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
myself over on a river so that probably
figure<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.750> many

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
figure I know we don't need that many

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.290 
figure I know we don't need that many
markers<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.219> figured<00:00:59.579> well<00:00:59.760> maybe<00:00:59.789> they

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
markers then I figured well maybe they

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.680 
markers then I figured well maybe they
stopped<00:01:00.719> stolen<00:01:01.410> someone<00:01:01.770> wanted<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> memento
