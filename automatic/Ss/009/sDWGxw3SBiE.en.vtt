00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
looking directly at at the device you it

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.660 
looking directly at at the device you it
sort<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.810> suffers<00:04:12.349> from<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.489> know<00:04:13.579> if

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
sort of suffers from this you know if

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.729 
sort of suffers from this you know if
you<00:04:13.790> rotate<00:04:14.299> it<00:04:14.420> in<00:04:14.450> any<00:04:14.599> direction<00:04:14.840> sort<00:04:15.650> of

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
you rotate it in any direction sort of

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.250 
you rotate it in any direction sort of
gets<00:04:15.920> washed<00:04:16.220> out<00:04:16.579> so<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:17.930> doesn't<00:04:18.229> take

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
gets washed out so and it doesn't take

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.830 
gets washed out so and it doesn't take
much<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.400> rotation<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.150> get<00:04:20.329> that<00:04:20.510> washed

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
much of a rotation to get that washed

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.870 
much of a rotation to get that washed
out<00:04:21.139> look<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:22.070> in<00:04:22.160> other<00:04:22.250> words<00:04:22.460> if<00:04:22.580> you're<00:04:22.700> not

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
out look so in other words if you're not

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.610 
out look so in other words if you're not

can still play the game but again you

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.610 
can still play the game but again you
know<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:35.300> screen<00:04:35.540> could<00:04:35.720> be<00:04:35.870> better<00:04:36.080> quality

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
profile of device very thin nice compact

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.650 
profile of device very thin nice compact
easy<00:05:29.990> to<00:05:30.380> carry<00:05:30.710> very<00:05:31.520> portable<00:05:32.030> this<00:05:32.360> has

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
easy to carry very portable this has

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.800 
easy to carry very portable this has
high<00:05:32.900> portability<00:05:33.970> ratings<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.150> that<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.660> gets

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
high portability ratings so that it gets

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.719 
high portability ratings so that it gets
some<00:05:36.020> points<00:05:36.349> for<00:05:36.530> being<00:05:36.650> very<00:05:36.950> portable<00:05:37.430> and

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
some points for being very portable and

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.180 
some points for being very portable and
the<00:05:38.090> SD<00:05:38.419> card<00:05:38.450> slot<00:05:38.960> thing<00:05:39.200> is<00:05:39.320> cool<00:05:39.560> so<00:05:40.070> the

the SD card slot thing is cool so the

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.370 
the SD card slot thing is cool so the
game<00:05:40.370> device<00:05:40.729> had<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.120> right<00:05:41.300> idea<00:05:41.330> it<00:05:42.080> just

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
game device had the right idea it just

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.290 
game device had the right idea it just
fails<00:05:42.650> in<00:05:42.950> some<00:05:43.159> of<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.310> really<00:05:43.520> key<00:05:43.880> spots

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
fails in some of the really key spots

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.519 
fails in some of the really key spots
well<00:05:45.169> obviously<00:05:45.409> the<00:05:46.070> video

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:46.529 
well obviously the video

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.479 
well obviously the video
screen<00:05:46.769> and<00:05:46.979> of<00:05:47.579> course<00:05:47.879> the<00:05:48.119> sound<00:05:48.389> right<00:05:48.809> I

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:49.489 
screen and of course the sound right I

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:55.339 
screen and of course the sound right I
mean<00:05:50.489> it's<00:05:50.669> just<00:05:52.669> not<00:05:53.669> good<00:05:53.999> and<00:05:54.959> it's<00:05:55.139> worse

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
mean it's just not good and it's worse

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.489 
mean it's just not good and it's worse
on<00:05:55.619> some<00:05:55.829> of<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:55.979> other<00:05:56.129> games<00:05:56.429> so<00:05:57.289> on<00:05:58.289> a<00:05:58.349> scale

00:05:58.489 --> 00:05:58.499 
on some of the other games so on a scale

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:00.409 
on some of the other games so on a scale
of<00:05:58.649> 1<00:05:58.919> to<00:05:59.009> 10<00:05:59.069> I<00:05:59.219> give<00:05:59.429> this<00:05:59.519> device<00:05:59.849> about<00:06:00.059> a<00:06:00.119> 5

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
of 1 to 10 I give this device about a 5

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.989 
of 1 to 10 I give this device about a 5
i'd<00:06:00.689> say<00:06:00.839> it's<00:06:00.989> average<00:06:01.529> really<00:06:02.369> deducting

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:02.999 
i'd say it's average really deducting

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.779 
i'd say it's average really deducting
for<00:06:03.929> the<00:06:04.049> screen<00:06:04.379> and<00:06:04.619> the<00:06:04.709> sound<00:06:05.009> but<00:06:05.759> the

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
for the screen and the sound but the

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.639 
for the screen and the sound but the
fact<00:06:06.179> that<00:06:06.299> they<00:06:06.539> did<00:06:06.839> put<00:06:07.049> some<00:06:07.079> effort<00:06:07.349> into

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:07.649
