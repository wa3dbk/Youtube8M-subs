00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and right now what I can say is it's a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.600 
and right now what I can say is it's a
little<00:00:34.050> bit<00:00:34.200> heavy<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.890> my<00:00:35.010> liking<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.430> I

little bit heavy for my liking so I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.510

properly<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.719> don't<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.200> this

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

about<00:02:16.380> flicks<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:17.760> trying<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.180> keep<00:02:18.330> this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
about flicks but I'm trying to keep this

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.600 
about flicks but I'm trying to keep this
very<00:02:18.780> thin<00:02:19.260> obviously<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.920> outer<00:02:20.100> corner

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
very thin obviously in the outer corner

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.890 
very thin obviously in the outer corner
it's<00:02:20.730> gonna<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> little<00:02:21.240> bit<00:02:21.390> thicker<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
it's gonna get a little bit thicker and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.690 
it's gonna get a little bit thicker and
then<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.410> inner<00:02:22.590> corner<00:02:23.010> I'm<00:02:23.190> teeth<00:02:23.430> I'm

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
then in the inner corner I'm teeth I'm

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.360 
then in the inner corner I'm teeth I'm
keeping<00:02:24.030> us<00:02:24.150> thin<00:02:24.420> as<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.600> can<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.470> then<00:02:26.100> again

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
keeping us thin as I can and then again

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.580 
keeping us thin as I can and then again
with<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.700> flick<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.180> am<00:02:27.450> winging<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.110> out<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
with the flick I am winging it out a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.460 
with the flick I am winging it out a
little<00:02:29.040> bit<00:02:29.340> longer<00:02:29.850> than<00:02:30.300> what<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.900> would<00:02:31.230> say

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
little bit longer than what I would say

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.210 
little bit longer than what I would say
is<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.830> natural<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.959> very<00:02:34.260> very<00:02:34.530> thin<00:02:34.950> so

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
is is natural but it's very very thin so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.770 
is is natural but it's very very thin so
that<00:02:35.340> keeps<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.910> being<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.239> little<00:02:36.480> bit<00:02:36.600> more

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
that keeps it being a little bit more

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.020 
that keeps it being a little bit more
natural<00:02:37.260> if<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.590> would<00:02:37.800> just<00:02:37.980> focus<00:02:38.340> there

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
natural if this would just focus there

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.640 
natural if this would just focus there
we<00:02:39.630> go<00:02:39.840> maybe<00:02:40.200> yes<00:02:41.690> okay<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.930> there<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
we go maybe yes okay and there is the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.790

about<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.959> mascara<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.530> think<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.070> bit

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
about this mascara I think it's a bit

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.460 
about this mascara I think it's a bit
clumpy<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.150> weird<00:03:24.450> way<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.720> actually<00:03:25.079> really

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
clumpy in a weird way I actually really

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.500 
clumpy in a weird way I actually really
like<00:03:25.620> Columbia<00:03:26.040> mascaras<00:03:26.579> but<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.480> just

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.870 
like Columbia mascaras but this one just
looks<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.989> bit<00:03:28.019> weird<00:03:28.320> now<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:29.100> step<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.549> wasn't

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
looks a bit weird now this step I wasn't

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.640

actually<00:03:30.060> going<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.630> do<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.260> felt<00:03:31.530> like

actually going to do but I felt like

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.530 
actually going to do but I felt like
they<00:03:31.739> look<00:03:31.920> kind<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.280> needed<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.940> I'm
