you<00:00:25.769> never<00:00:25.949> know<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> lot<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> things<00:00:26.699> can

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you never know a lot of things can

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.660 
you never know a lot of things can
change<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:28.199> guess<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.039> could<00:00:29.250> say<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
change and I guess you could say that a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.840 
change and I guess you could say that a
deaf<00:00:29.849> ear<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> made<00:00:30.539> him<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:32.460> big

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
deaf ear that made him is that the big

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330 
deaf ear that made him is that the big
show<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.300> were<00:00:33.420> aiming<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.170> maybe<00:00:35.040> after

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
show we were aiming for so maybe after

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090 
show we were aiming for so maybe after
the<00:00:35.579> show<00:00:35.610> all<00:00:36.090> these<00:00:36.440> different<00:00:37.440> emotions

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the show all these different emotions

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.490 
the show all these different emotions
and<00:00:38.280> feelings<00:00:38.489> hit<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.989> definitely

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and feelings hit you but I definitely

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770 
and feelings hit you but I definitely
think<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.070> that's<00:00:41.370> probably<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.390> mistake

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
think that that's probably a mistake

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.470 
think that that's probably a mistake
that<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.379> lot<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.649> competitors<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.850> if

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that a lot of competitors do is they if

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.670 
that a lot of competitors do is they if

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that if you are if this is not the last

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
once you are at the more advanced levels

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.130 
once you are at the more advanced levels
which<00:03:53.430> she<00:03:53.790> does

which she does

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.170 
which she does
I<00:03:54.200> mean<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:55.100> did<00:03:55.220> resistance<00:03:55.700> training<00:03:55.940> all

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
I mean you did resistance training all

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.790 
I mean you did resistance training all
your<00:03:56.300> life<00:03:56.450> when<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.720> think<00:03:56.900> about<00:03:56.960> it<00:03:57.260> yeah

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
your life when you think about it yeah

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.840 
your life when you think about it yeah
yeah<00:03:58.610> you've<00:03:58.970> got<00:03:59.000> older<00:03:59.810> heavier<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:00.440> know

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
yeah you've got older heavier you know

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.610 
yeah you've got older heavier you know
that's<00:04:01.850> progressive<00:04:02.360> overload<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:03.530> know

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
that's progressive overload so you know

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.000 
that's progressive overload so you know
you<00:04:03.680> are<00:04:04.370> white<00:04:05.000> trained<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:06.500> some<00:04:06.650> extent

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
you are white trained to some extent

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.980 
you are white trained to some extent
even<00:04:07.220> before<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.150> got<00:04:08.300> really<00:04:08.569> serious<00:04:08.720> in

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
even before you got really serious in

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.750 
even before you got really serious in
this<00:04:09.110> so<00:04:09.590> what<00:04:09.800> she<00:04:09.950> can<00:04:10.100> handle<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.459> totally

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
this so what she can handle is totally

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.280 
this so what she can handle is totally
different<00:04:10.880> from<00:04:11.090> what<00:04:11.300> you<00:04:11.660> know<00:04:11.780> other

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
different from what you know other

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.080 
different from what you know other
people<00:04:12.680> out<00:04:12.740> there<00:04:12.920> can<00:04:13.040> handle<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.459> she's

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
people out there can handle and she's

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.840 
people out there can handle and she's
eating<00:04:14.420> plenty<00:04:14.750> compared<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:16.070> two<00:04:16.640> most

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
eating plenty compared to two most

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.220 
eating plenty compared to two most
females<00:04:17.209> i<00:04:17.299> would<00:04:17.419> say<00:04:17.540> four<00:04:17.780> for<00:04:17.989> most

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
females i would say four for most

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.830 
females i would say four for most
females<00:04:18.829> if<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.640> can<00:04:19.790> eat<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:19.940> gram<00:04:20.329> of<00:04:20.359> carb

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
females if you can eat a gram of carb

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.770 
females if you can eat a gram of carb
per<00:04:21.320> pound<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.799> body<00:04:21.859> weight<00:04:22.100> it's<00:04:23.000> your<00:04:23.450> like

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
per pound of body weight it's your like

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.380 
per pound of body weight it's your like
this<00:04:23.990> card<00:04:24.620> monster<00:04:24.980> pretty<00:04:25.490> much<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:26.360> know

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
this card monster pretty much you know

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.480 
this card monster pretty much you know
so<00:04:26.720> she's<00:04:26.930> eating<00:04:27.410> well<00:04:27.680> over<00:04:27.950> that<00:04:28.070> she's
