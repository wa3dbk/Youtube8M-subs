have<00:00:19.050> gotten<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.590> much<00:00:20.010> better<00:00:20.340> if<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.910> look

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
have gotten so much better if you look

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.029 
have gotten so much better if you look
at<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.240> early<00:00:21.630> 1900s<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.470> beginning<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
at the early 1900s the beginning of the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.109 
at the early 1900s the beginning of the
Industrial<00:00:23.670> Age

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
Industrial Age

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.259 
Industrial Age
we<00:00:24.630> were<00:00:24.810> spewing<00:00:25.529> crap<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.849> using

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we were spewing crap out and using

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.230 
we were spewing crap out and using
resources<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.680> did<00:00:29.010> not<00:00:29.220> even<00:00:29.550> care

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
resources up and and did not even care

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.880 
resources up and and did not even care
about<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.410> into<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> atmosphere

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
about what was going into the atmosphere

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.810 
about what was going into the atmosphere
or<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.880> water<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.360> anything<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:35.280> is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
or in the water or anything now it is

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.330 
or in the water or anything now it is
more<00:00:36.180> economical<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.140> guess<00:00:37.350> for

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
more economical and I guess for

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.780 
more economical and I guess for
publicity<00:00:38.579> sake<00:00:39.210> better<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:41.280> help<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
publicity sake better to to help the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.619 
publicity sake better to to help the
environment<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:43.250> they<00:00:44.250> recycle<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> lot<00:00:45.420> more

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
environment it's they recycle a lot more

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.600 
environment it's they recycle a lot more
of<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.809> stuff<00:00:46.079> there<00:00:46.350> where<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> used<00:00:47.489> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
of this stuff there where you used to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
of this stuff there where you used to
just<00:00:47.640> spew<00:00:48.300> stuff<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.870> smokestacks

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
just spew stuff out of smokestacks

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.830 
just spew stuff out of smokestacks
they'd<00:00:49.890> run<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.250> through<00:00:50.629> intercoolers<00:00:51.629> now

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
they'd run them through intercoolers now

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.830 
they'd run them through intercoolers now
and<00:00:52.170> actually<00:00:52.530> harvest<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> heat<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and actually harvest the heat and the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.529 
and actually harvest the heat and the
waste<00:00:55.110> from<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> scrub<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> they

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
waste from it and they can scrub it they

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.180 
waste from it and they can scrub it they
run<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> through<00:00:57.930> scrubbers<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.559> clean<00:00:59.039> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
run it through scrubbers and clean it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.380 
run it through scrubbers and clean it
