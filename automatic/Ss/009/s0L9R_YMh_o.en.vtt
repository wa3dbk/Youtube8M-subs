00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.799 
I think the first time message did have
a<00:00:45.520> good<00:00:45.640> idea<00:00:45.910> he<00:00:46.059> just<00:00:46.090> hit<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.390> back<00:00:46.539> or<00:00:46.719> do

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.430 

writing<00:02:40.660> signs<00:02:40.870> are<00:02:41.050> really<00:02:41.230> good<00:02:41.380> approach

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
writing signs are really good approach

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.370 
writing signs are really good approach
for<00:02:41.770> Fox<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.880> not<00:02:43.060> remarkably<00:02:43.720> disjointed

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
for Fox it's not remarkably disjointed

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.670 
for Fox it's not remarkably disjointed
but<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:45.370> combos<00:02:46.000> well<00:02:46.240> it's<00:02:46.630> something<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:47.410> lot

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
but it combos well it's something a lot

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.780 
but it combos well it's something a lot
of<00:02:47.770> time<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.010> can<00:02:48.100> get<00:02:48.280> away<00:02:48.340> with<00:02:48.550> if<00:02:48.670> you

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
of time you can get away with if you

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.610 
of time you can get away with if you
call<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> retreat<00:02:49.600> or<00:02:50.050> if<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:50.260> call<00:02:50.590> the

reasons for going here the my top jess
is<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.709> Mike<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.739> having<00:03:33.129> a<00:03:33.190> really<00:03:33.310> hard

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
is that Mike is having a really hard

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.170 
far it's at least working out better
than<00:04:14.370> last<00:04:14.670> game<00:04:15.320> okay<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:17.400> double<00:04:17.669> job<00:04:17.820> crab

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
than last game okay the double job crab

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.210 
than last game okay the double job crab
was<00:04:18.359> pretty<00:04:18.630> smart<00:04:18.959> Johnny<00:04:19.769> apparently

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
was pretty smart Johnny apparently

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.000 
was pretty smart Johnny apparently
called

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.880 

so<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.670> can<00:04:23.790> get<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.940> edge<00:04:24.150> guard<00:04:24.740> down<00:04:25.740> there

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
so you can get the edge guard down there

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.670 
so you can get the edge guard down there
was<00:04:26.040> little<00:04:26.430> questionable<00:04:26.790> I<00:04:27.350> kind<00:04:28.350> of<00:04:28.440> agree

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
was little questionable I kind of agree

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.590 
was little questionable I kind of agree
with<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:29.010> in<00:04:29.130> some<00:04:29.190> ways<00:04:29.550> because<00:04:30.030> my<00:04:30.360> just

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
with it in some ways because my just

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.090 
with it in some ways because my just
decided<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.110> stand<00:04:31.320> in<00:04:31.470> place<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.860> up<00:04:31.950> till

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
decided to stand in place and up till

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.620 
decided to stand in place and up till
like<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.310> lot<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.580> foxes<00:04:32.910> would<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.270> probably

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
like a lot of foxes would it probably

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.780 
like a lot of foxes would it probably
would<00:04:33.750> win<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.200> mic<00:04:34.920> instead<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.460> the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
would win the mic instead this is the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.500 
would win the mic instead this is the
swarthy<00:04:36.030> never<00:04:36.330> ran<00:04:36.450> toward<00:04:36.690> center<00:04:36.960> stage

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.090 

yeah<00:04:42.050> it's<00:04:42.230> seeking<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.560> those<00:04:42.710> lasers

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.510 

it's<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.220> jump<00:04:46.430> out<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.670> shame

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
it's the jump out of shame

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.300 
it's the jump out of shame
okay<00:04:48.090> so<00:04:49.020> jump<00:04:49.410> after<00:04:49.560> wake<00:04:49.800> up<00:04:49.949> is<00:04:50.069> pretty

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
okay so jump after wake up is pretty

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.300 
okay so jump after wake up is pretty
sparse

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
sparse

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.070 
sparse
there's<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:51.820> lot<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:51.970> times<00:04:52.240> you'll<00:04:52.480> do<00:04:52.690> passive

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
there's a lot of times you'll do passive

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.180 
there's a lot of times you'll do passive
options<00:04:53.410> when<00:04:53.560> they're<00:04:53.680> cornered<00:04:53.980> against

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
options when they're cornered against

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.310

something<00:05:19.280> easy<00:05:19.699> to<00:05:19.910> punish<00:05:20.060> it's<00:05:20.449> just<00:05:20.690> if

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
something easy to punish it's just if

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.020 
something easy to punish it's just if
Falcon<00:05:21.500> has<00:05:21.620> a<00:05:21.650> read<00:05:21.889> on<00:05:22.040> it<00:05:22.190> he's<00:05:22.910> in

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
Falcon has a read on it he's in

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.730 
Falcon has a read on it he's in
financial<00:05:23.389> losers<00:05:23.660> yeah<00:05:24.020> typically<00:05:24.530> with

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
financial losers yeah typically with

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.840 
financial losers yeah typically with
something<00:05:24.949> like<00:05:25.070> up<00:05:25.220> there<00:05:25.340> or<00:05:25.490> neutral<00:05:25.729> air

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
something like up there or neutral air

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.330 
something like up there or neutral air

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
even just run up grab my case space

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
even just run up grab my case space
themselves<00:05:28.790> like<00:05:28.910> just<00:05:29.120> far<00:05:29.270> away<00:05:29.389> enough

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.380 

and<00:05:34.569> Oh<00:05:34.780> down<00:05:35.500> smash<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:36.099> was<00:05:36.219> interesting

hard so

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.780 
hard so
there's<00:05:42.780> a<00:05:42.840> place<00:05:43.020> for<00:05:43.050> that<00:05:43.320> movie

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790

covered that I think he should have just
positioned<00:06:18.169> himself<00:06:18.349> to<00:06:18.650> knock<00:06:18.830> that's<00:06:19.340> due
