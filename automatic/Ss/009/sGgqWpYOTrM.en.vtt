time I heard it was all I heard I needed

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:18.150 
time I heard it was all I heard I needed
to<00:03:53.500> know<00:03:53.620> who<00:03:53.740> that<00:03:53.950> was<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.769> way<00:04:17.920> that's

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
to know who that was and in a way that's

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.250 
to know who that was and in a way that's
good<00:04:18.489> because<00:04:18.730> you<00:04:19.209> know<00:04:19.390> I<00:04:19.600> don't<00:04:19.840> take<00:04:20.019> it<00:04:20.170> on

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
good because you know I don't take it on

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.900 
good because you know I don't take it on
like<00:04:20.470> I'm<00:04:20.650> boring<00:04:21.070> it's<00:04:21.190> probably<00:04:21.489> from<00:04:21.609> their

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
like I'm boring it's probably from their

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.550 
like I'm boring it's probably from their
point<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.240> view<00:04:22.300> whatever<00:04:22.570> there<00:04:22.870> it's<00:04:23.320> going

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560

on<00:04:23.710> for<00:04:24.010> them<00:04:24.190> it's<00:04:25.030> what<00:04:25.240> came<00:04:25.480> up<00:04:25.690> but<00:04:26.050> I

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110

on for them it's what came up but I
wasn't<00:04:26.650> trying<00:04:26.890> I<00:04:27.100> wasn't<00:04:27.460> wasting<00:04:27.610> my<00:04:28.120> energy

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
wasn't trying I wasn't wasting my energy

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.840 
wasn't trying I wasn't wasting my energy
trying<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.810> figure<00:04:29.050> out<00:04:29.200> why<00:04:29.740> they<00:04:30.010> said<00:04:30.250> it

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.830 

I've<00:04:33.850> been<00:04:34.030> feeling<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.360> lot<00:04:34.540> of<00:04:34.600> pressure<00:04:36.840> in

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
I've been feeling a lot of pressure in

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.260 
I've been feeling a lot of pressure in
my<00:04:38.140> life<00:04:38.470> lately<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.520> that<00:04:39.669> seemed<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.240> be

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
my life lately and that seemed to be

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.320 
my life lately and that seemed to be
kind<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:40.810> microcosm<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.770> what<00:04:42.669> my<00:04:42.790> internal

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
kind of a microcosm of what my internal

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.570 
kind of a microcosm of what my internal
state<00:04:43.660> has<00:04:43.870> looked<00:04:44.110> like<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:45.220> wouldn't

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
state has looked like and I wouldn't

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.310 
state has looked like and I wouldn't
have<00:04:45.669> been<00:04:45.760> aware<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:47.620> degree<00:04:48.450> or<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.720> motion

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
have been aware the degree or the motion

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.530 
have been aware the degree or the motion
associated<00:04:50.880> with<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.030> pressure<00:04:52.300> I'm<00:04:52.510> feeling

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
associated with the pressure I'm feeling

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
associated with the pressure I'm feeling
without<00:04:53.470> having<00:04:53.890> seen<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.790> way<00:04:55.320> you<00:04:56.320> feel

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
without having seen it that way you feel

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.870 
without having seen it that way you feel
your<00:04:56.740> body<00:04:56.860> is<00:04:57.070> there<00:04:57.190> something<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.730> you

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
your body is there something that you

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.660 
your body is there something that you
want<00:04:58.450> or<00:04:59.310> don't<00:05:00.310> want

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.940 

I<00:05:04.260> feel<00:05:05.260> stopped<00:05:05.650> by<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.010> yeah<00:05:06.550> yeah<00:05:07.950> yeah

that<00:05:09.130> part<00:05:09.340> that<00:05:09.370> wants<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.790> get<00:05:09.970> away<00:05:10.120> the

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
that part that wants to get away the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.620 
that part that wants to get away the
voice<00:05:11.380> or<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.800> pressure<00:05:12.280> of<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:12.790> feels<00:05:13.450> like

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
voice or the pressure of that feels like

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.100 
voice or the pressure of that feels like
a<00:05:13.750> stalker<00:05:14.290> to<00:05:14.620> me<00:05:14.740> because<00:05:15.460> it's<00:05:15.730> old<00:05:16.000> in<00:05:16.390> my

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
a stalker to me because it's old in my

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.880 
a stalker to me because it's old in my
family<00:05:17.500> dynamic<00:05:18.480> what<00:05:19.480> I<00:05:19.510> was<00:05:19.660> also<00:05:20.140> aware<00:05:20.410> of

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
family dynamic what I was also aware of

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.280 
family dynamic what I was also aware of
in<00:05:21.100> my<00:05:21.400> part<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:23.830> is<00:05:24.130> how<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.790> wasn't<00:05:25.290> big

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
in my part of it is how it wasn't big

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.400 
in my part of it is how it wasn't big
floundering<00:05:27.040> motion<00:05:27.640> like<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.300> sometimes<00:05:28.660> have

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
floundering motion like I sometimes have

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.290 
floundering motion like I sometimes have
it<00:05:30.250> was<00:05:30.660> more<00:05:31.920> it<00:05:32.920> was<00:05:33.010> very<00:05:33.190> active<00:05:33.670> but<00:05:34.150> was

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
it was more it was very active but was

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.140 
it was more it was very active but was
more<00:05:34.570> low-key<00:05:35.170> and<00:05:35.410> more<00:05:35.970> continual<00:05:36.970> movement

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
more low-key and more continual movement

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:54.369 
more low-key and more continual movement
and<00:05:37.630> more<00:05:37.840> circular<00:05:42.060> hands<00:05:43.060> what's

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.769 

there<00:05:55.379> was<00:05:55.499> some<00:05:55.739> way<00:05:55.889> I<00:05:55.919> felt<00:05:56.489> caught<00:05:57.360> in<00:05:57.659> a

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
there was some way I felt caught in a

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.219 
there was some way I felt caught in a
concentric<00:05:58.699> circle<00:05:59.699> and<00:05:59.969> not<00:06:00.539> able<00:06:00.779> to<00:06:00.959> break

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
concentric circle and not able to break

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:10.370 
concentric circle and not able to break
it

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.230 

the<00:06:11.380> thing<00:06:11.560> that<00:06:11.740> was<00:06:11.830> more<00:06:12.220> disturbing<00:06:12.790> as<00:06:13.120> if

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
the thing that was more disturbing as if

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.540 
the thing that was more disturbing as if
I<00:06:13.300> was<00:06:13.420> floundering<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.560> may<00:06:14.890> be<00:06:14.950> easier<00:06:15.520> for

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
I was floundering it may be easier for

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.570 
I was floundering it may be easier for
me<00:06:15.850> to<00:06:16.000> manage<00:06:16.480> but<00:06:16.810> the<00:06:16.960> steadiness<00:06:17.620> of<00:06:17.770> my

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
me to manage but the steadiness of my

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.830 
me to manage but the steadiness of my
whole<00:06:18.820> dynamic<00:06:19.270> was<00:06:19.390> actually<00:06:19.660> pretty

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
whole dynamic was actually pretty

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.200 
whole dynamic was actually pretty
upsetting<00:06:20.290> the<00:06:20.800> fact<00:06:21.070> that<00:06:21.220> I<00:06:21.250> was<00:06:21.490> just<00:06:21.670> so<00:06:21.820> at

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
upsetting the fact that I was just so at

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.560 
upsetting the fact that I was just so at
ease<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:23.110> comfortable<00:06:23.860> with<00:06:24.310> you<00:06:25.090> know<00:06:25.180> this

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
ease and comfortable with you know this

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.300 
ease and comfortable with you know this
this<00:06:25.870> hovering<00:06:26.470> pattern<00:06:26.800> and<00:06:26.890> then<00:06:26.980> coming

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
this hovering pattern and then coming

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.700 
this hovering pattern and then coming
back<00:06:27.340> when<00:06:27.580> there<00:06:27.700> there<00:06:28.120> was<00:06:28.210> a<00:06:28.710> knowingness

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
back when there there was a knowingness

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.890 
back when there there was a knowingness
about<00:06:30.460> this<00:06:30.640> dynamic<00:06:31.030> that<00:06:31.210> was<00:06:31.420> actually

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
about this dynamic that was actually

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.020 
about this dynamic that was actually
disturbing<00:06:32.410> if<00:06:32.560> it<00:06:32.680> was<00:06:32.800> more<00:06:33.460> unpredictable

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
disturbing if it was more unpredictable

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.960 
disturbing if it was more unpredictable
or<00:06:34.540> more<00:06:34.690> erratic<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:36.580> would<00:06:36.760> be<00:06:36.850> more

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
or more erratic it would be more

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.090 
or more erratic it would be more
comfortable<00:06:37.240> but<00:06:37.960> the<00:06:38.320> fact<00:06:38.500> is<00:06:38.650> so

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
comfortable but the fact is so

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.690 
comfortable but the fact is so
entrenched<00:06:39.870> in<00:06:40.870> a<00:06:41.170> circular<00:06:41.440> motion<00:06:41.890> that<00:06:42.370> I

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
entrenched in a circular motion that I

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.400 
entrenched in a circular motion that I
couldn't<00:06:43.360> quite<00:06:43.480> break<00:06:43.780> out<00:06:43.960> of<00:06:44.140> you<00:06:44.290> know

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
couldn't quite break out of you know

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.250 
couldn't quite break out of you know
nothing<00:06:44.770> linear<00:06:45.550> or<00:06:45.760> geometric<00:06:46.420> haven't

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
nothing linear or geometric haven't

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.700 
nothing linear or geometric haven't
except<00:06:47.710> the<00:06:48.640> circle

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:11.389 

Oh

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:11.399 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:23.110 

and<00:07:12.399> pause

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:33.110 

and<00:07:24.120> now<00:07:24.449> I<00:07:26.030> noticed<00:07:27.030> you<00:07:27.240> stopped<00:07:31.880> just<00:07:32.880> my

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 
and now I noticed you stopped just my

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.969 
and now I noticed you stopped just my
depression<00:07:33.389> yes<00:07:34.380> I<00:07:36.470> just<00:07:37.470> became<00:07:37.650> very<00:07:37.710> aware

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 
depression yes I just became very aware

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.200 
depression yes I just became very aware
that<00:07:38.370> I<00:07:40.100> hold<00:07:41.100> myself<00:07:41.280> to<00:07:41.669> a<00:07:41.699> standard

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.210 
that I hold myself to a standard

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.520 
that I hold myself to a standard
sometimes<00:07:42.630> it's<00:07:42.840> not<00:07:42.960> mine

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:43.530 
sometimes it's not mine

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.510 
sometimes it's not mine
and<00:07:44.330> that's<00:07:45.330> what<00:07:45.539> this<00:07:45.810> whole<00:07:46.130> process<00:07:47.130> for

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 
and that's what this whole process for

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.800 
and that's what this whole process for
me<00:07:47.639> demonstrated<00:07:48.539> um<00:07:49.229> I<00:07:50.190> didn't<00:07:51.060> a<00:07:51.270> lot<00:07:51.660> of

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:51.810 
me demonstrated um I didn't a lot of

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.050 
me demonstrated um I didn't a lot of
with<00:07:52.080> the<00:07:52.229> open<00:07:52.500> floor<00:07:52.650> wouldn't<00:07:52.979> you<00:07:53.970> know

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 
with the open floor wouldn't you know

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.120 
with the open floor wouldn't you know
it's<00:07:54.449> just<00:07:54.840> realizing<00:07:55.380> that<00:07:55.470> you<00:07:55.590> do<00:07:55.710> it

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.130 
it's just realizing that you do it

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.420 
it's just realizing that you do it
yes<00:07:56.669> that's<00:07:57.479> then<00:07:57.900> it<00:07:58.050> opens<00:07:58.440> and<00:07:58.979> you<00:07:59.010> can<00:07:59.070> say

00:07:59.420 --> 00:07:59.430 
yes that's then it opens and you can say

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.520 
yes that's then it opens and you can say
okay<00:07:59.729> I'm<00:08:00.419> doing<00:08:00.539> that<00:08:00.780> now<00:08:01.050> you're<00:08:01.320> ready<00:08:01.470> to

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.590 
that I that I love the most about the
open<00:08:08.340> floor<00:08:08.550> is<00:08:08.669> it's<00:08:08.850> a<00:08:08.970> way<00:08:09.120> to<00:08:09.180> tap<00:08:09.570> into

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:09.600 
open floor is it's a way to tap into

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.469 
open floor is it's a way to tap into
what<00:08:10.530> some<00:08:11.100> of<00:08:11.130> our<00:08:11.310> stories<00:08:11.820> are<00:08:12.030> what<00:08:12.360> some
