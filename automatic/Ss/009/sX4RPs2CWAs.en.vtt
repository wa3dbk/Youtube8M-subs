00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.719 
got to remember either silver not a
gauzy<00:01:33.960> cat<00:01:34.140> expect<00:01:34.470> high<00:01:34.619> 80s<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.670> can

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
gauzy cat expect high 80s but as you can

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
gauzy cat expect high 80s but as you can
see<00:01:35.820> he's<00:01:35.909> got<00:01:36.000> 77<00:01:36.570> ball<00:01:36.750> control<00:01:37.079> which<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
see he's got 77 ball control which is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.999 
see he's got 77 ball control which is
pretty<00:01:37.650> nice<00:01:38.630> 8077<00:01:39.630> crossing<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.650> isn't

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
pretty nice 8077 crossing which isn't

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.399 
pretty nice 8077 crossing which isn't
the<00:01:41.070> greatest<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.520> i'll<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.000> later

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
the greatest but i'll get on that later

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
the greatest but i'll get on that later
867<00:01:43.409> curve<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.820> nice<00:01:44.970> actually

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
867 curve which is really nice actually

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
867 curve which is really nice actually
i<00:01:45.390> found<00:01:45.780> he<00:01:45.869> had<00:01:45.930> quite<00:01:45.990> nice<00:01:46.350> finesse<00:01:46.710> shot

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740

82<00:01:47.579> dribbling<00:01:48.240> i<00:01:48.360> actually<00:01:48.869> found<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.229> it's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
82 dribbling i actually found that it's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.749 
82 dribbling i actually found that it's
dribbling<00:01:49.710> slowed<00:01:49.979> him<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.130> quite<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> lot

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
dribbling slowed him down quite a lot

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.460 
dribbling slowed him down quite a lot
but<00:01:50.880> i<00:01:51.000> gained<00:01:51.299> his<00:01:51.450> subs<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.780> gone<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.200> later

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
but i gained his subs not gone to later

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
pass again a lie i think that should be

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.399 
pass again a lie i think that should be
a<00:02:16.340> lot<00:02:16.519> higher<00:02:16.700> around<00:02:16.849> eighty<00:02:17.290> seventy<00:02:18.290> nine

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
a lot higher around eighty seventy nine

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.170 
a lot higher around eighty seventy nine
shot<00:02:18.680> power<00:02:18.890> i<00:02:18.950> would<00:02:19.099> agree<00:02:19.220> with<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.549> but

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
shot power i would agree with that but

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.059 
shot power i would agree with that but
with<00:02:20.360> those<00:02:20.569> long<00:02:21.230> shots<00:02:21.500> he<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:21.739> could<00:02:21.920> not

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
with those long shots he just could not

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.759 
with those long shots he just could not
score<00:02:22.340> outside<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.819> box<00:02:23.200> 26<00:02:24.200> slide<00:02:24.440> tackle

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769

score outside the box 26 slide tackle
that<00:02:24.890> doesn't<00:02:25.159> matter<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.730> he's<00:02:26.690> actually

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
that doesn't matter and he's actually

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.750 
that doesn't matter and he's actually
got<00:02:27.110> there<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.349> go<00:02:27.440> fifty<00:02:27.890> three<00:02:28.099> volleys<00:02:28.459> and

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
got there you go fifty three volleys and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.100 
got there you go fifty three volleys and
he's<00:02:28.879> in<00:02:29.030> farm<00:02:29.269> from<00:02:29.390> bali<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:29.780> how<00:02:29.900> does<00:02:29.959> that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
he's in farm from bali so how does that

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.500 
he's in farm from bali so how does that
work<00:02:30.349> iain<00:02:30.739> logic<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:32.180> don't<00:02:32.329> know

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
work iain logic I just don't know

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.569 
work iain logic I just don't know
anymore<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.560> he's<00:02:33.680> obviously<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:34.129> all

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
anymore so he's obviously just all

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.910 
anymore so he's obviously just all
you've<00:02:34.790> seen<00:02:35.000> his<00:02:35.150> left-footed<00:02:35.629> me<00:02:36.140> medium

and<00:02:37.069> a<00:02:37.220> high<00:02:37.430> work-rate<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.480> that's

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
and a high work-rate so that's

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.990 
and a high work-rate so that's
absolutely<00:02:39.110> fine<00:02:39.319> he<00:02:39.470> tracks<00:02:39.769> back<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.310> he

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
absolutely fine he tracks back and he

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.460 
absolutely fine he tracks back and he
