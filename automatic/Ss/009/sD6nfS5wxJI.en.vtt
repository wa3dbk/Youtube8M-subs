00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to all guys welcome up 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.990
 official channel beatbox my 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.189
 brand new channel with already 300 subscribers is 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.580
 unbelievable 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:19.220
 today I bought a tac star sm 13 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.220
 sirius studio microphone boxing together 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.609
 in hindsight we are in this box 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.149
 then here it says we focus 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:47.280
 hand sm 13 to mark the same thing here and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.190
 the 13 th to the third has then back here 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.360
 let's say some features 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.820
 the model after nothing changes 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.079
 wait ok model after that would be 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.460
 the right one that does not change 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.699
 absolutely nothing because all 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.049
 written in English then bomb 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.119
 let's move on to content right away 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:15.710
 inside there are institutions understood 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:17.820
 understood Italian and then in English 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.700
 rightly we don't care 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.119
 because so much from how we use and leave 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 immediately beautiful briefcase we seem a 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.140
 bit that allow only the arms 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.350
 or to money 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:41.460
 it opens up so well there is this stuff 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:43.530
 we focus this lose 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.729
 microphone that I no longer have the idea of 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:53.579
 what's your name, I just know there's a 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:57.409
 elastic here then there is a rubber band here 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.390
 you can lose your life at the microphone 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.369
 here is a lever that you do this and do it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.790
 you can put sun and la instead 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.680
 splint explains splint depends which one 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.360
 complete to keep them pedestal 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.160
 would be 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:22.940
 then here that if you have not kind this 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:24.910
 like if as you type this that 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.470
 that would be to filter the item 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.860
 you can put this that you find in the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.860
 package 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:44.330
 then he made the city treat inside for 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.709
 keep it perfumed let's say and then there is 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.900
 this bit that I don't have the most 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.300
 pale of what it was for 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.940
 hook it somewhere now 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.890

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:05.270
 her plastic hairy beauty then pulls 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:07.280

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.730
 here the connection to the connection of 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.799
 cable that then puts the network where you want 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.410

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.670

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.840
