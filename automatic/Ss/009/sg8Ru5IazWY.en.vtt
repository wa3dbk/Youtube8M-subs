00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.010 

straight<00:00:18.330> away<00:00:18.510> again

straight away again

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.420 
straight away again
you<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:19.859> difference<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.180> actual<00:00:21.330> texture

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
you see difference in the actual texture

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.630 
you see difference in the actual texture
good<00:00:23.430> nap<00:00:23.580> enough<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.380> feels<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:26.160> lot

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
good nap enough and this one feels a lot

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.339 
good nap enough and this one feels a lot
more<00:00:26.699> plasticky<00:00:27.539> again<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.230> one<00:00:28.470> more

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
more plasticky again and this one more

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.930 
more plasticky again and this one more
like<00:00:31.940> softer<00:00:34.010> but<00:00:35.300> again<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> side<00:00:37.940> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
like softer but again from the side you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.229 
like softer but again from the side you
can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:41.360> isn't<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.690> bad<00:00:43.649> big<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.250> fair<00:00:44.460> at

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
can see isn't a bad big to be fair at

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.940 
can see isn't a bad big to be fair at
all<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> easiest<00:00:48.210> way<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> tell<00:00:49.110> the
