00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.940
 the 4th regiment of gap hunters 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.830
 welcomes for two weeks 50 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.650
 soldiers of the 12th Armored Regiment of 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.970
 canada based in quebec 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.710
 an opportunity to exchange certain 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.240
 know how and today it is a 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.980
 training session on 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.970
 fight 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.650
 this morning we made two types 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.599
 instruction a rifle instruction 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.789
 assault for men of rank and a 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.419
 automatic pistol instruction for 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.220
 the executives well they appreciated the 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.570
 especially disassembly reassembly because 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.710
 they do not have the same weapon 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.510
 who plays a long weapon 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.810
 unlike the famas they have m16 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.550
 they simply apply correctly 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.110
 security rules are rules 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.820
 security which are universal that 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.590
 in the US Army the army 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.570
 where the Canadian army 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.070
 applies the same rules for many 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.440
 of them it's a first approach 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.440
 French weapons including famas 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:12.049
 a beautiful soul is still very 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.049
 flexible a lot of mobility but 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.490
 much more stable at the sight of the shot 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.640
 you have burst so these three bullets 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.670
 it feels higher level of recoil 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.780
 it's definitely lightness us and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.289
 against stability 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.060
 precisely because he more - most 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.560
 people loved the experience 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.240
 it's the same caliber 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.030
 still interesting to share his 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.350
 new weapons knowledge 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.119
 the stay will continue the week 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.950
 next on the reliefs of devoluy 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.659
 for an approach to the techniques of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.319
 progression in a mountain environment 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.319
 winter
