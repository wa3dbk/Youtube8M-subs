well<00:00:09.280> we've<00:00:09.519> landed<00:00:09.760> a<00:00:10.000> couple<00:00:10.360> of<00:00:10.480> big

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
well we've landed a couple of big

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.230 
well we've landed a couple of big
cutthroats<00:00:11.290> here<00:00:11.650> and<00:00:11.799> because<00:00:12.790> we're<00:00:13.000> 10

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
cutthroats here and because we're 10

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.679 
cutthroats here and because we're 10
miles<00:00:13.510> back<00:00:13.660> in<00:00:14.049> the<00:00:14.200> in<00:00:14.380> the<00:00:14.710> wilderness<00:00:15.689> we

have to kill a few fish something we
hate<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.150> do<00:00:19.330> but<00:00:20.110> this<00:00:20.439> is<00:00:20.500> what<00:00:20.800> we<00:00:20.919> count<00:00:21.189> on

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
to eat when we're in the high country

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.100 
to eat when we're in the high country
it's<00:00:23.349> a<00:00:23.470> 10-mile<00:00:23.890> walk<00:00:23.970> Indiana's<00:00:24.970> so<00:00:25.660> you

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
it's a 10-mile walk Indiana's so you

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.109 
it's a 10-mile walk Indiana's so you
have<00:00:26.349> to<00:00:26.529> have<00:00:26.680> protein<00:00:26.950> and<00:00:27.399> these<00:00:27.939> big

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
have to have protein and these big

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.769 
have to have protein and these big
cutthroats<00:00:28.950> are<00:00:29.950> a<00:00:30.009> valuable<00:00:30.970> source<00:00:31.540> of

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
cutthroats are a valuable source of

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.569 
cutthroats are a valuable source of
protein<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.439> while<00:00:33.100> we<00:00:33.190> have<00:00:33.309> him<00:00:33.430> out<00:00:33.520> here

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
protein and while we have him out here

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.580 
protein and while we have him out here
just<00:00:33.969> show<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.270> just<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.750> little<00:00:35.260> bit<00:00:35.380> about

just show you just a little bit about
maybe<00:00:35.860> how<00:00:36.130> to<00:00:36.190> follow<00:00:36.520> fish<00:00:36.910> out<00:00:37.149> in<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.329> wild

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
maybe how to follow fish out in the wild

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.020 
maybe how to follow fish out in the wild
the<00:00:37.899> first<00:00:38.140> thing<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.350> you<00:00:38.559> do<00:00:38.739> is<00:00:39.429> find<00:00:39.820> a
