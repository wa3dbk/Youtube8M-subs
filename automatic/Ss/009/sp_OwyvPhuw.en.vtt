00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:01.920
 Hello guys 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.740
 the game is called visual 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.960
 this is not 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.040
 the calculated from pm 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.349
 to start 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.399
 we got 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:11.099
 the fetus 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.219
 16 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.650
 the height of the kidneys 21 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.490
 now however two 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.460
 let's do yes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.689
 6 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.509
 which multiplies 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.149
 polished ally 8 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.839
 force 250 thousand a bar 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.700
 political ally 6 21 will be zero pivot 5 107 9 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.100
 which multiplies 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.030
 coucher 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.670
 soon 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.050
 this year and 34 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.050
 the council of 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.450
 904 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 that equals 2 5 87 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.410
 save that name 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.790
 We'll do it like this. 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.790
 200 200 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.250
 the distance 721 but the height at which it is 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.470
 - this 2 point and 27 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.689
 these two bento 16 as I said is that the PT recalled 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.070
 So, how are we going to do this next moment? 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.950
 We're going to take away 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.390
 then this value will give 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.350
 223 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.030
 67 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.610
 now you're off the blitz 250 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.690
 and any of 220 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.860
 third pivot 54 3 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.940
 in this heat 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.360
 we are going to take 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 multiplied by 0 that opposed 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.610
 5 thousand by 24 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.610
 multiply by 0 to 0 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 I think it will 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.220
 which actually 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 coimbra 01 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:16.069
 we took 54 antenor collection we took the distance that will take us in the world 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.819
 we do like this 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.789
 we have value multiplied by percent 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.959
 we multiply 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.959
 your name 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.769
 55 910 year 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.089
 will, give 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.029
 I'm not alive and 32 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
 This is what we're going to take now I did not go 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.399
 as we already have the aim 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.499
 we need to know which quique force to highlight 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:00.509
 for that 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:01.809
 we got 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.189
 heights 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.649
 which multiplies 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.849
 He picks it up earlier. 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.199
 221 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.469
 which is the most b a video 32 6 3 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:16.779
 after multiplying 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.699
 subtract 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.509
 o 2d with 87 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.149
 because the wind is helping 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.209
 add 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.059
 the distance from the river 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:28.159
 This will give 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.059
 225 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.189
 lisboa 07 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.499
 we welcome in the reseacada april 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.499
 only 200 and 25 thousand 2 07 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.529
 and we have to go 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.769
 came from 87 thousand 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.139
 78 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.479
 so how stock cars 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.569
 pick up item 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.569
 87'- all 78 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.739
 to africa 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.809
 7 in May 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:28.150
 that's it folks 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.559
 but what I like 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:32.740
 about every year 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.740
 I saw the replay 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.979
 Thank you for any question.
