want<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.029> about<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> six<00:00:27.630> inch<00:00:27.840> tag<00:00:28.580> this

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
want to have about a six inch tag this

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.859 
want to have about a six inch tag this
where<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.820> gets<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.300> tricky<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:30.750> with

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
where it gets kind of tricky but with

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.020 
where it gets kind of tricky but with
time<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.260> becomes<00:00:31.560> really<00:00:31.830> easy<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.850> want

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
time it becomes really easy and you want

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.370 
time it becomes really easy and you want
to<00:00:33.120> whip<00:00:33.300> finish<00:00:33.890> nine<00:00:34.890> times<00:00:35.600> up<00:00:36.600> the

tight loops where they don't overlap do

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
tight loops where they don't overlap do
you<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.160> want<00:00:44.340> them<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.520> forward<00:00:45.110> after

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
you just want them going forward after

you just want them going forward after
you<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.289> nine<00:00:46.530> times<00:00:46.969> you<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> pinch

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you get nine times you want to pinch

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.110 
you get nine times you want to pinch
that<00:00:48.750> system<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.640> here's

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that system and as you can see here's

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
that system and as you can see here's
your<00:00:51.270> loop<00:00:51.480> there's<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.680> braid<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.920> goes

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
your loop there's the braid that goes

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.150 
your loop there's the braid that goes
through<00:00:53.550> wraps<00:00:54.000> nine<00:00:54.270> times<00:00:54.600> forward<00:00:55.160> here's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
through wraps nine times forward here's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
through wraps nine times forward here's
how<00:00:56.309> easy<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.699> wrap<00:00:57.270> nine<00:00:57.510> times<00:00:57.809> back<00:01:03.199> look

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
how easy it is wrap nine times back look

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.890 
how easy it is wrap nine times back look
at<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.680> entered<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.850> loop<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
at how you entered the loop of that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380 
at how you entered the loop of that
monofilament<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.640> bring<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> end<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
monofilament you bring the end of that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
monofilament you bring the end of that
braid<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:09.869> back<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.320> same<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.340> all

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
braid right back the same way and all

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
braid right back the same way and all
you<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.299> slide<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> together<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:18.720> let

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you do is you slide it together you let

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
you do is you slide it together you let
go<00:01:19.049> both<00:01:19.290> ends<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.030> pull<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> tight<00:01:21.570> like

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
go both ends and you pull it tight like

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.940 
go both ends and you pull it tight like
that<00:01:22.939> there<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.060> no<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> system<00:01:24.950> no

that there is no not in the system no

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.310 
that there is no not in the system no
not<00:01:26.159> at<00:01:26.310> all<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.900> braid<00:01:28.110> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
not at all all it is is the braid is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.859 
not at all all it is is the braid is
actually<00:01:28.710> cocooning<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.150> monofilament

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
want to leave a little bit of a tag in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.100 
want to leave a little bit of a tag in
with<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> braids<00:01:38.600> just<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.720> case<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.079> starts

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
with the braids just in case it starts

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710 
with the braids just in case it starts
flaring<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.030> then<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> monofilament

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
flaring and then on the monofilament

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
flaring and then on the monofilament
side<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> want<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.829> close<00:01:43.860> as<00:01:44.280> possible

about this is there's no not to that
system<00:01:57.780> I've<00:01:57.960> used<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.530> about<00:01:58.560> ten<00:01:58.920> years

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
system I've used it for about ten years

system I've used it for about ten years
now<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.610> never<00:01:59.790> had<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> problem<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.930> make<00:02:01.110> sure

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
now and never had a problem so make sure
