mike<00:00:16.430> my<00:00:16.880> character<00:00:17.330> certain<00:00:17.630> is<00:00:17.720> than<00:00:18.050> the

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
mike my character certain is than the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.010 
mike my character certain is than the
calotype<00:00:18.560> late<00:00:18.770> in<00:00:18.920> Harry<00:00:19.520> but<00:00:19.750> what<00:00:20.750> mainly

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
calotype late in Harry but what mainly

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.480 
calotype late in Harry but what mainly
because<00:00:21.110> you<00:00:21.619> know<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.890> entire<00:00:22.100> thing<00:00:22.369> is

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
because you know the entire thing is

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.730 
because you know the entire thing is
pretty<00:00:22.910> much<00:00:23.029> based<00:00:23.330> on<00:00:23.600> on<00:00:23.990> on<00:00:25.150> on<00:00:26.740> Edwards

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
pretty much based on on on on Edwards

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.500 
pretty much based on on on on Edwards
character<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:28.640> who<00:00:28.789> he<00:00:28.910> is<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:29.150> I<00:00:29.210> think<00:00:29.240> it's

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
character and who he is and I think it's

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.400 
character and who he is and I think it's
very<00:00:30.519> tortured<00:00:31.519> and<00:00:31.930> conflicted<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.050> stuff

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
very tortured and conflicted and stuff

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.170 
very tortured and conflicted and stuff
so<00:00:33.650> which<00:00:33.920> is<00:00:34.040> very<00:00:34.640> different<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.000> what<00:00:35.120> I

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
so which is very different to what I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.580 
so which is very different to what I
played<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:35.629> Harry<00:00:35.750> Potter<00:00:35.960> but<00:00:36.080> I<00:00:36.140> mean<00:00:36.290> yeah

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
played and Harry Potter but I mean yeah

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.530 
played and Harry Potter but I mean yeah
it's<00:00:37.309> a<00:00:37.400> completely<00:00:37.879> different<00:00:38.180> style<00:00:38.420> of

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
it's a completely different style of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.100 
it's a completely different style of
book<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:38.900> mean<00:00:39.050> it's<00:00:40.360> first-person<00:00:41.360> narrative

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
book I mean it's first-person narrative

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.670 
book I mean it's first-person narrative
it's<00:00:42.379> very<00:00:42.620> obsessive<00:00:45.309> and<00:00:46.780> kind<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:47.900> that's

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
it's very obsessive and kind of that's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.259 
it's very obsessive and kind of that's
how<00:00:48.860> it's<00:00:49.100> very<00:00:49.430> very<00:00:49.640> much<00:00:49.909> more<00:00:50.089> personal

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
how it's very very much more personal

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.509 
how it's very very much more personal
book<00:00:50.659> I<00:00:50.780> think<00:00:50.960> then<00:00:51.170> that<00:00:51.199> harry<00:00:52.010> potter<00:00:52.220> is<00:00:52.400> I

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
book I think then that harry potter is I

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.090 
book I think then that harry potter is I
mean<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.750> lot<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.589> different<00:00:54.860> ways<00:00:54.890> I<00:00:55.070> mean

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
mean and a lot of different ways I mean

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.219 
mean and a lot of different ways I mean
there's<00:00:55.339> only<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.640> two<00:00:56.299> characters<00:00:56.629> pretty

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
there's only the two characters pretty

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.149 
there's only the two characters pretty
much<00:00:57.409> and<00:00:57.619> a<00:00:57.860> trilogy<00:00:58.629> wow<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.809> guess<00:00:59.930> three<00:01:00.290> but

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
much and a trilogy wow I guess three but

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.299 
much and a trilogy wow I guess three but
um<00:01:01.629> essentially<00:01:02.629> two<00:01:02.839> it's<00:01:03.199> just<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.440> it's<00:01:03.769> just

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
um essentially two it's just a it's just

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.010 
um essentially two it's just a it's just
about<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.670> love<00:01:04.940> story<00:01:05.239> rather<00:01:05.570> than<00:01:05.720> the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
about a love story rather than the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.310 
about a love story rather than the
massive<00:01:06.680> adventure<00:01:07.540> entire<00:01:08.540> world<00:01:08.869> i<00:01:09.079> mean<00:01:09.109> it

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
massive adventure entire world i mean it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.319 
massive adventure entire world i mean it
says<00:01:09.560> as<00:01:09.979> much<00:01:10.009> as<00:01:10.310> possible<00:01:10.460> in<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.149> real

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
says as much as possible in the real

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.300 
says as much as possible in the real
world<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:11.960> it's<00:01:12.350> different<00:01:12.560> but<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.189> same

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
world so it's different but the same

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.590 
world so it's different but the same
time<00:01:13.460> do<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:13.609> see<00:01:13.729> any<00:01:13.880> similarities<00:01:14.090> between

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
time do you see any similarities between

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.029 
time do you see any similarities between
the<00:01:14.780> two<00:01:14.840> franchises<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.799> way<00:01:15.920> that

more action-oriented I mean and and the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.870 
more action-oriented I mean and and the
stage<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:36.560> did<00:01:36.710> have<00:01:36.859> were<00:01:37.039> just<00:01:37.249> kind<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.490> feels

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
stage I did have were just kind of feels

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.039 
stage I did have were just kind of feels
like<00:01:37.969> a<00:01:38.030> kind<00:01:38.329> of<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.859> bit<00:01:39.859> part<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.719> but<00:01:41.719> I<00:01:41.749> mean

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
like a kind of a bit part and but I mean

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.779 
like a kind of a bit part and but I mean
it's<00:01:42.710> kind<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:42.920> different<00:01:43.130> i<00:01:43.340> mean<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:43.640> is

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
it's kind of different i mean this is

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.149 
it's kind of different i mean this is
much<00:01:44.060> more<00:01:44.090> i<00:01:44.390> mean<00:01:44.719> we<00:01:45.109> were<00:01:45.200> very<00:01:45.439> extensive

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
much more i mean we were very extensive

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.730 
much more i mean we were very extensive
rehearsal<00:01:46.609> period<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.149> very<00:01:47.359> like<00:01:47.719> I<00:01:47.929> mean

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
rehearsal period and very like I mean

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.859 
rehearsal period and very like I mean
I<00:01:49.799> mean<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> difference<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.119> me<00:01:51.360> anyway<00:01:51.659> it's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
I mean the difference for me anyway it's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.149 
I mean the difference for me anyway it's
because<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> books<00:01:52.860> are<00:01:52.979> written

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
because because the books are written

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.480 
because because the books are written
from<00:01:53.340> ballast<00:01:53.670> reflective<00:01:54.180> I've<00:01:54.390> had<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
from ballast reflective I've had to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.100 
from ballast reflective I've had to
pretty<00:01:56.490> much<00:01:56.640> invent<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.600> character<00:01:58.080> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
pretty much invent the character of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
pretty much invent the character of
Edward<00:01:58.619> because<00:01:58.890> he's<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> books

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
Edward because he's just in the books

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.529 
Edward because he's just in the books
he's<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.710> enigma<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.920> mean<00:02:02.280> almost<00:02:03.210> I

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
he's just this enigma I mean almost I
