00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
being a little bit smaller just because

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.810 
being a little bit smaller just because
it's<00:01:43.960> easier<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.040> then<00:01:45.159> we<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.400> test<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.670> out

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
it's easier and then we can test it out

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.220 
it's easier and then we can test it out
here<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:49.240> is<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.510> test<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.080> the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
here this is this is a test so the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.810 
here this is this is a test so the
keyboard<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.710> actually<00:01:50.830> pretty<00:01:51.250> good<00:01:51.340> but

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
keyboard is actually pretty good but

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.340 
keyboard is actually pretty good but
some<00:01:52.180> people<00:01:52.420> might<00:01:52.570> not<00:01:52.780> like<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.020> some

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
some people might not like it some

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.460 
some people might not like it some
people<00:01:53.590> do<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:54.700> just<00:01:55.090> depends<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.870> personally

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
people do it just depends I personally

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.860 
people do it just depends I personally
like<00:01:56.620> SwiftKey<00:01:57.220> but<00:01:57.670> that's<00:01:58.330> just<00:01:58.540> personal

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
like SwiftKey but that's just personal

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.960 
like SwiftKey but that's just personal
preference<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.280> let's<00:02:00.430> go<00:02:00.520> ahead<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.729> check

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
preference so let's go ahead and check

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
show you guys what 100 operation looks

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.899 
show you guys what 100 operation looks
like<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.880> actual<00:02:07.360> messaging<00:02:08.200> app<00:02:08.909> so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
like in the actual messaging app so

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.620 
like in the actual messaging app so
let's<00:02:10.389> go<00:02:10.599> ahead<00:02:10.749> and<00:02:10.869> check<00:02:11.230> out<00:02:11.409> the<00:02:11.530> rose

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
let's go ahead and check out the rose

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.010 
let's go ahead and check out the rose
and<00:02:13.780> we're<00:02:14.110> gonna<00:02:14.200> go<00:02:14.350> back<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.570> 100

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
and we're gonna go back so this is 100

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.620 
and we're gonna go back so this is 100
operation<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.650> small<00:02:17.980> keyboard<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.610> if<00:02:18.880> you're

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
operation in small keyboard so if you're

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.450 
operation in small keyboard so if you're
right-handed<00:02:19.990> or<00:02:20.740> if<00:02:20.980> you're<00:02:21.160> left-handed

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
right-handed or if you're left-handed

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.720 
right-handed or if you're left-handed
I'm<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.570> it's<00:02:22.720> easier<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.110> type<00:02:23.440> but<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.490> looks

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
I'm so it's easier to type but it looks

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.390 
I'm so it's easier to type but it looks
kind<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.030> obnoxious<00:02:25.210> on<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.320> side<00:02:26.560> here<00:02:26.920> but

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
kind of obnoxious on the side here but

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.310 
kind of obnoxious on the side here but
it<00:02:27.880> still<00:02:28.150> works<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.540> then<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.660> can<00:02:28.870> do<00:02:28.990> this

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
it still works and then you can do this

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.940 
it still works and then you can do this
is<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:32.380> kind<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.950> harder<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
is the the kind of harder this is the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.060 
is the the kind of harder this is the
keyboard<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.110> doesn't<00:02:38.350> predict<00:02:38.830> very

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
keyboard see it doesn't predict very

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.160 
keyboard see it doesn't predict very
well<00:02:39.340> doesn't<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.210> don't<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.600> personally<00:02:40.990> don't

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
well doesn't I don't I personally don't

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.930 
well doesn't I don't I personally don't
like<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.680> it's<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:42.070> smaller<00:02:42.460> one<00:02:42.730> so

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
like it but it's the smaller one so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.510 
like it but it's the smaller one so
that's<00:02:43.660> another<00:02:43.990> thing<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.350> consider<00:02:44.520> and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
that's another thing to consider and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.740 
that's another thing to consider and
then<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.850> also<00:02:46.030> have<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.960> write<00:02:48.750> when

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
then you also have you can write when

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.960 
then you also have you can write when
you<00:02:49.840> change<00:02:50.110> languages<00:02:50.590> etc<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.640> different

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
you change languages etc the different

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.880 
you change languages etc the different
languages<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.600> can<00:02:52.750> write<00:02:52.990> in<00:02:53.170> for<00:02:53.770> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
languages that you can write in for the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.660 
languages that you can write in for the
keyboard<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:55.510> that's<00:02:56.230> something<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:57.490> you

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
keyboard so that's something that you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.700 
keyboard so that's something that you
can<00:02:58.000> also<00:02:58.210> use<00:02:58.390> if<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.960> don't<00:02:59.080> like<00:02:59.410> the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
can also use if you don't like the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.490 
can also use if you don't like the
keyboard<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.430> can<00:03:00.460> actually<00:03:00.910> type<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.300> it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
keyboard you can actually type with it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.560 
keyboard you can actually type with it
let's<00:03:02.500> go<00:03:02.650> ahead<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.950> remove<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:04.030> one-handed

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
let's go ahead and remove the one-handed

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.850 
let's go ahead and remove the one-handed
operation<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:06.690> let's<00:03:07.690> go<00:03:07.840> select<00:03:08.170> one<00:03:08.590> last

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
operation and let's go select one last

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.250 
operation and let's go select one last
thing<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.520> show<00:03:09.550> you<00:03:09.730> guys<00:03:10.260> will<00:03:11.260> do<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.990> then

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
thing to show you guys will do and then

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.090 
thing to show you guys will do and then
we'll<00:03:14.530> go<00:03:14.560> back<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:17.700> see<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.650> works

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
we'll go back and see so it works
