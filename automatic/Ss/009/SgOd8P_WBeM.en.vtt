00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.040
 and beauty people talk is as follows 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 You saw in the description of the video I 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.619
 I'm bringing a boxing to you today. 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.119
 here of r9 steam xr 9 280 x your little house 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.490
 who had been dating for a long time 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.460
 she is finally able to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.980
 It's okay, this version is here. 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.850
 a special version of the afire is and it has 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:45.000
 a single difference of steam dae x 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.700
 to around 9280 x is dual clock is this here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 it's also ok but it's the main 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.829
 difference from her to another other board 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.440
 of video 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.690
 bush if this is where she has support 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.449
 for four monitors and the other only three 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.719
 another difference in the gpu gpu 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.799
 This one here is a thousand megawatts in a boat. 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.750
 in Boston and 1,100 and clock while the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.439
 another she has 870 in Boston and 1,020 in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 clock 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.170
 This is a difference is her size . 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.610
 Also for the box you can see 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.439
 that she is much greater than the other I 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 can not always show that it has been 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.330
 the framework that I found the best 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.170
 because I'm recording with webcam 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.869
 but anyway here is how do we open it to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.670
 show you we will not show you 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.939
 the details of the top of the box 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.939
 Cashier 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.140
 the side here the other side 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.690
 detail here I already left open that is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.000
 to make it easier to open and here 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.670
 ago has nothing very different from 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 other plax down here you go 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.170
 find her code, and here are the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.369
 specs and I think thanks to my 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.290
 Webcam will not give you a chance to see 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:13.140
 right but I'll put it here 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:21.209
 everything in the description is going to open here will have 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:31.800
 from here and let me see if the hit opened it 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:34.110
 here is not so and here will be people already 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.870
 here to see the video card that is on TV 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.239
 To show you, I said that the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.630
 video card protection 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:48.620
 now you will have here doing here in 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.620
 old squeeze 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.380
 Let's leave it here on the side. 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.860
 let's see if peripherals things 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:08.310
 come here another box comes 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:13.350
 You can see inside the box you have 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.590
 there is little manual coming up a cable 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.590
 hdmi 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.470
 here are the adapters the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.250
 power of the eight-pin video card 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.040
 each installation drive 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.040
 the fire cable 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.920
 in which a propagandazinha of fidelity 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.099
 of the sapphire and that here I do not know the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:49.069
 what is beauty 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:53.519
 now let's go to the window plate here 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.890
 and the remarkable size of this 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.859
 another difference also concerns steam 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.140
 x for another simpler is that this 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.700
 From here you have a cooler 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.170
 it has a good heat dissipation 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.690
 greater because it is a bit more 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.310
 power at the clock speed 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.629
 Someone comes from the factory, however. 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:20.130
 you can increase further in the year of 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:24.060
 program that comes from the law that the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:29.580
 front of her simple three 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:32.130
 this top part with 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.870
 plastic still that name here steam x 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.900
 he is a neighbor and so he does not have 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.289
 nothing special and that's it 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.039
 guys 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:47.300
 my board will act a simple r 9 270 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.440
 This is where the power of it is much greater. 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.979
 this match is a different classic 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.470
 for the metal alloy light I do not know 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.530
 and that's it people, a few more 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.250
 information I will leave in the description of the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.199
 video card specifications are 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.910
 paulo too and that's it folks if you guys 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.830
 liked click did not like favorites 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.240
 possible to help the population and a fan 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.240
 here and I went
