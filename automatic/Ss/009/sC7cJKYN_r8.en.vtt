was a 24 kill streak and you'll see

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.909 
was a 24 kill streak and you'll see
about<00:00:06.779> halfway<00:00:07.140> through<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.560> game<00:00:07.589> right

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
about halfway through the game right

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.000 
about halfway through the game right
here<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.309> score<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:09.559> 4948<00:00:10.559> hunter<00:00:10.830> will

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
here the score is 4948 hunter will

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.879 
here the score is 4948 hunter will
basically<00:00:11.190> have<00:00:11.460> one<00:00:11.490> or<00:00:11.849> two<00:00:12.000> kills<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.929> at

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
basically have one or two kills and at

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.980 
basically have one or two kills and at
the<00:00:14.040> end<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> spree<00:00:14.820> here<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.780> not

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the end of the spree here it's it's not

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.420 
the end of the spree here it's it's not
even<00:00:16.230> close<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.890> thought<00:00:17.220> it'd<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.340> an

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
even close so I thought it'd be an

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.740 
even close so I thought it'd be an
entertaining<00:00:17.820> gameplay<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.330> share<00:00:18.570> with<00:00:18.660> you

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
entertaining gameplay to share with you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.720 
entertaining gameplay to share with you
guys<00:00:18.960> basically<00:00:19.710> my<00:00:19.890> snipe<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.520> on

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
guys basically my snipe was just on

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.540 
guys basically my snipe was just on
point<00:00:21.510> pretty<00:00:21.720> much<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.140> was<00:00:22.230> hitting<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.890> lot<00:00:23.460> of

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
point pretty much I was hitting a lot of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.710 
point pretty much I was hitting a lot of
shots<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:23.880> my<00:00:24.000> snipe<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.570> also

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
shots at my snipe and then I also

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
shots at my snipe and then I also
stopped<00:00:25.140> them<00:00:25.350> from<00:00:25.470> getting<00:00:25.619> heavy<00:00:25.920> ammo<00:00:26.310> as

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
stopped them from getting heavy ammo as

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.710 
stopped them from getting heavy ammo as
you'll<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.480> ended<00:00:27.660> up

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you'll see right here and I ended up

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.660 
you'll see right here and I ended up
getting<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.349> myself<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.039> getting<00:00:29.220> some<00:00:29.460> kills

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
getting it myself and getting some kills

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.700 
getting it myself and getting some kills
with<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.960> definitely<00:00:31.289> helps<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
with that so that definitely helps I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.610 
with that so that definitely helps I
almost<00:00:31.920> died<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.899> many<00:00:33.899> times<00:00:34.140> during<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
almost died like many times during the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.950 
almost died like many times during the
gameplay<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.360> somehow<00:00:36.360> managed<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> stay

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
gameplay but somehow managed to stay

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.959 
gameplay but somehow managed to stay
alive<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.280> my<00:00:38.399> best<00:00:38.550> spree<00:00:38.820> before

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
alive and I think my best spree before

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.569 
alive and I think my best spree before
this<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.570> maybe<00:00:40.230> 16<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.710> 17<00:00:41.070> kills<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
this was like maybe 16 or 17 kills and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
this was like maybe 16 or 17 kills and
it<00:00:42.090> actually<00:00:42.510> stopped<00:00:42.750> telling<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.469> one

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it actually stopped telling you what one

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.670 
it actually stopped telling you what one
streak<00:00:44.070> you're<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.280> after<00:00:44.550> 15<00:00:44.969> kills<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.780> was

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
streak you're on after 15 kills so I was

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.319 
streak you're on after 15 kills so I was
looking<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> corner<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.730> wondering<00:00:48.180> how

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
looking at the corner like wondering how

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
looking at the corner like wondering how
many<00:00:48.510> kills<00:00:48.750> am<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.960> didn't<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:49.950> kind<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> tree

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
many kills am I didn't what kind of tree

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.729 
many kills am I didn't what kind of tree
this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.910> had<00:00:51.000> no<00:00:51.149> idea<00:00:51.620> but<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
this is because I had no idea but it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.170 
this is because I had no idea but it
ended<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.250> ended<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.579> counting<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.090> was

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
ended up I ended up counting it it was

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.029 
ended up I ended up counting it it was
24<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.170> thought<00:00:55.500> it'd<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.620> pretty<00:00:55.770> cool<00:00:55.860> to
