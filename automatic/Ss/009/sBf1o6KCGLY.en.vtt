this video so as you can see now i have
about<00:00:34.320> from<00:00:35.250> 15<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:37.219> 20<00:00:38.219> i<00:00:38.250> guess<00:00:38.940> yeah<00:00:39.510> from

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
about from 15 to 20 i guess yeah from

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.869 
about from 15 to 20 i guess yeah from
from<00:00:40.200> 12<00:00:40.770> yes<00:00:41.629> low<00:00:42.629> FPS<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.290> should<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.649> about

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
from 12 yes low FPS it should be about

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.799 
from 12 yes low FPS it should be about
25<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.510> good<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.710> video<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.690> in

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
25 to be good in a good video so if I in

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.920 
25 to be good in a good video so if I in
turn<00:00:48.960> frappin<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:50.690> ergo<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:53.239> free<00:00:54.239> yeah

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
turn frappin on ergo so for or free yeah

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.639 
turn frappin on ergo so for or free yeah
which<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:56.760> terrible<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.660> that's

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
which is a really terrible and that's

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.310 
which is a really terrible and that's
because<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.250> recording<00:00:59.730> with<00:01:00.570> both<00:01:00.780> both

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
because I'm recording with both both

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.910 
because I'm recording with both both
camtasia<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.190> perhaps<00:01:02.660> but<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
camtasia and perhaps but if I got on the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.200 
camtasia and perhaps but if I got on the
camtasia<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.970> 20<00:01:06.950> about<00:01:07.950> 20<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:08.939> not

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
camtasia it is 20 about 20 so that's not

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.649 
camtasia it is 20 about 20 so that's not
not<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.049> good<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.330> solution<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
not so good so my solution to that is

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
not so good so my solution to that is
this<00:01:16.130> wait<00:01:17.130> second<00:01:17.909> yeah<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.340> what

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
this wait second yeah so this is what

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.999 
this wait second yeah so this is what
you're<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.540> download<00:01:21.689> its<00:01:22.229> minecraft

smaller resolution that's only thing

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.890 
smaller resolution that's only thing
that<00:01:35.570> can<00:01:36.590> pretty<00:01:37.590> much<00:01:37.680> effect<00:01:38.220> minecraft

record<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> smaller<00:02:10.349> ones<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.550> let's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
record in the smaller ones so let's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520 
record in the smaller ones so let's
resize<00:02:12.599> my

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
resize my

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.680 
resize my
down<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.950> course<00:02:17.010> minimize<00:02:17.690> my

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
down to this and of course minimize my

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.070 
down to this and of course minimize my
outer<00:02:19.650> city<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.270> can<00:02:21.420> see<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.870> now

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
outer city and as you can see it is now

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.130 
outer city and as you can see it is now
a<00:02:22.110> small<00:02:22.470> window<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.100> FPS<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.959> all<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.250> same

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
a small window and FPS is all the same

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.590 
a small window and FPS is all the same
yeah<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.800> about<00:02:29.250> hitting<00:02:29.730> when<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.940> turn

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
yeah now it is about hitting when I turn

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.790 
yeah now it is about hitting when I turn
out<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.790> fraps<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.440> record

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
out the fraps because it it the record

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.280 
out the fraps because it it the record
the<00:02:35.010> smaller<00:02:36.470> smaller<00:02:37.470> size<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:39.020> turn<00:02:40.020> off

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the smaller smaller size so turn off

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.270 
the smaller smaller size so turn off
fraps<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.870> resize<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:44.180> that's<00:02:45.180> done<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:46.280> now

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
fraps and resize it that's done and now

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.820 
fraps and resize it that's done and now

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
we have a big ol bigger window it's HD

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.940 
we have a big ol bigger window it's HD
it's<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:51.150> resolution<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:51.930> video<00:02:52.260> of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
it's the resolution of this video of

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.949 
it's the resolution of this video of
this<00:02:54.380> where<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.590> window<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.459> HD<00:02:57.239> which

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
this where this window is now HD which

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:06.680 
this where this window is now HD which
is<00:02:58.760> 1280<00:02:59.760> by<00:03:01.069> 720<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.660> turn<00:03:03.660> down<00:03:03.690> fraps<00:03:05.690> well

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
is 1280 by 720 and turn down fraps well

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.120 
is 1280 by 720 and turn down fraps well
it<00:03:07.290> went<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:08.209> 98<00:03:09.209> which<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.959> not<00:03:10.470> bad<00:03:10.500> actually

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
it went to 98 which is not bad actually

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.910 
it went to 98 which is not bad actually
when<00:03:11.640> i'm<00:03:11.790> recording<00:03:11.970> with<00:03:12.390> two<00:03:12.600> things<00:03:15.920> yeah

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
when i'm recording with two things yeah

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.949 
when i'm recording with two things yeah
so<00:03:17.549> ah<00:03:18.230> that's<00:03:19.230> pretty<00:03:20.130> much<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.340> fix<00:03:20.700> i<00:03:21.000> can

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
so ah that's pretty much the fix i can

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.840 
so ah that's pretty much the fix i can
show<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.290> share<00:03:22.650> your<00:03:22.829> resolutions<00:03:23.549> how<00:03:23.790> do

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
show you share your resolutions how do

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.280 
show you share your resolutions how do
they<00:03:24.090> work<00:03:25.190> it's<00:03:26.190> pretty<00:03:26.519> much<00:03:26.670> that's<00:03:27.000> four<00:03:27.540> 4

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
they work it's pretty much that's four 4

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.640 
they work it's pretty much that's four 4
by<00:03:28.470> 3<00:03:28.640> ratio<00:03:30.079> not<00:03:31.079> not<00:03:31.320> good<00:03:31.590> but<00:03:32.239> yeah<00:03:33.650> that's

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
by 3 ratio not not good but yeah that's

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.350 
by 3 ratio not not good but yeah that's
another<00:03:35.190> one<00:03:36.110> if<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.350> really<00:03:37.880> want<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.090> small
