slag next you're going to get up to its

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.520 
slag next you're going to get up to its
back<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.610> fire<00:02:10.119> your<00:02:10.330> body<00:02:10.569> boom<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.470> is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
back and fire your body boom this is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.620 
back and fire your body boom this is
where<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.830> lot<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.190> luck<00:02:12.400> comes<00:02:12.819> into<00:02:13.060> play<00:02:13.330> you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
where a lot of luck comes into play you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.750 
where a lot of luck comes into play you
want<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.349> high<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.860> shame<00:02:15.130> as<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.430> can<00:02:15.580> get

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
want as high of a shame as you can get

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.190 
want as high of a shame as you can get
so<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.000> way<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.630> do<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> first

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
so that way you can do the first

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.110 
so that way you can do the first
transition<00:02:17.680> without<00:02:17.920> downing<00:02:18.519> yourself<00:02:18.880> if

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
transition without downing yourself if

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.330 
transition without downing yourself if
you<00:02:19.810> do<00:02:19.989> end<00:02:20.170> up<00:02:20.260> downing<00:02:20.620> yourself<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.160> will

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
you do end up downing yourself it will

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.400 
you do end up downing yourself it will
beat<00:02:21.760> lead<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.239> death<00:02:22.540> unless<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.989> tentacle

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
beat lead to a death unless the tentacle

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.100 
beat lead to a death unless the tentacle
is<00:02:23.590> up<00:02:23.890> an<00:02:24.220> alternative<00:02:25.150> strategy<00:02:25.660> if<00:02:25.900> you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
is up an alternative strategy if you

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.080 
is up an alternative strategy if you
didn't<00:02:26.350> want<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.620> do<00:02:27.280> this<00:02:27.489> strategy<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:27.970> you

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
didn't want to do this strategy so you

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.270 
didn't want to do this strategy so you
can<00:02:28.269> wait<00:02:28.450> for<00:02:28.750> mashers<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.769> this<00:02:30.069> will

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
can wait for mashers to be up this will

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.870 
can wait for mashers to be up this will
allow<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.640> do<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.150> full<00:02:32.160> rocket<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.400> have
