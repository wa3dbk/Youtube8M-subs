the six is bigger it's the perfect size

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.710 
the six is bigger it's the perfect size
and<00:02:20.400> love<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:20.910> bigger<00:02:21.120> than<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.510> old

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and love that it's bigger than the old

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.640 
and love that it's bigger than the old
iPhones<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.730> plus<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.780> too<00:02:25.050> big<00:02:25.080> for

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
iPhones and the plus is just too big for

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.650 
iPhones and the plus is just too big for
me<00:02:25.740> in<00:02:25.890> my<00:02:26.040> opinion<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.240> already<00:02:27.360> have

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
me in my opinion so if you already have

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.270 
me in my opinion so if you already have
an<00:02:27.870> ipad<00:02:28.200> i<00:02:28.350> would<00:02:28.500> say<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> six<00:02:29.070> is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
an ipad i would say the six is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.220 
an ipad i would say the six is
definitely<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.700> way<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.820> go<00:02:29.970> because<00:02:30.330> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
definitely the way to go because the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.380 
definitely the way to go because the
plus<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.770> almost<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.610> tablet<00:02:32.940> within

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
plus is almost like a tablet within

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.450 
plus is almost like a tablet within
itself<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> size<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.860> tablet<00:02:35.250> to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
itself like is the size of a tablet to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.910 
itself like is the size of a tablet to
me<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.880> i<00:02:36.660> already<00:02:37.080> pretty<00:02:37.350> much<00:02:37.530> carry<00:02:37.800> this
