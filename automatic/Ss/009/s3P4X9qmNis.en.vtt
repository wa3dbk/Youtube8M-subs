I'm gonna detail this for Minecraft

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.700 
I'm gonna detail this for Minecraft
because<00:00:27.369> um<00:00:28.020> hopefully<00:00:29.020> you're<00:00:29.349> watching

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
this for Minecraft but if you play any

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.479 
this for Minecraft but if you play any
other<00:00:31.989> Java<00:00:32.439> game<00:00:32.710> this<00:00:32.860> will<00:00:33.010> make<00:00:33.160> it<00:00:33.280> run<00:00:33.430> a

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
other Java game this will make it run a

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.980 
other Java game this will make it run a
lot<00:00:33.820> smoother<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.300> lot<00:00:34.510> faster<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.930> lot<00:00:35.050> better<00:00:35.260> I

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
lot smoother a lot faster a lot better I

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.080 
lot smoother a lot faster a lot better I
use<00:00:37.990> this<00:00:38.230> method<00:00:38.440> to<00:00:39.010> make<00:00:39.130> my<00:00:39.310> minecraft<00:00:39.520> run

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
use this method to make my minecraft run

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.630 
use this method to make my minecraft run
super<00:00:40.480> smooth<00:00:40.720> I<00:00:40.930> get<00:00:41.230> 60<00:00:41.740> frames<00:00:41.770> per<00:00:42.220> second

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
super smooth I get 60 frames per second

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.200 
super smooth I get 60 frames per second
no<00:00:43.000> problem<00:00:43.540> when<00:00:44.200> normally<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:44.710> get<00:00:44.950> like<00:00:45.490> 15

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
no problem when normally I get like 15

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.200 
no problem when normally I get like 15
so<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:47.260> started<00:00:47.800> allocating<00:00:48.370> all<00:00:48.520> of<00:00:48.700> my<00:00:48.850> RAM

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
so I started allocating all of my RAM

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.480 
so I started allocating all of my RAM
for<00:00:50.190> Java

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
for Java

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.390 
for Java
not<00:00:52.000> all<00:00:52.180> of<00:00:52.210> it<00:00:52.420> about<00:00:52.690> half<00:00:52.990> so<00:00:53.590> basically

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
not all of it about half so basically

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.780 
not all of it about half so basically
based<00:00:54.670> on<00:00:54.820> what<00:00:55.030> kind<00:00:55.240> of<00:00:55.300> RAM<00:00:55.450> you<00:00:55.480> have<00:00:55.630> the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
based on what kind of RAM you have the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.240 
based on what kind of RAM you have the
requirements<00:00:57.790> are<00:00:57.850> gonna<00:00:57.940> be<00:00:58.030> different<00:00:58.239> now

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
requirements are gonna be different now

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.760 
requirements are gonna be different now
you<00:01:00.250> didn't<00:01:00.489> have<00:01:01.230> you're<00:01:02.230> gonna<00:01:02.380> need<00:01:02.620> to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
you didn't have you're gonna need to

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.160 
you didn't have you're gonna need to
have<00:01:02.920> at<00:01:03.070> least<00:01:03.100> four<00:01:03.550> gigs<00:01:03.850> of<00:01:03.970> RAM<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.960> either

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
have at least four gigs of RAM so either

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.789 
have at least four gigs of RAM so either
four<00:01:05.409> gigs

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
four gigs

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.980

you have four gigs you want to set at a
two<00:02:34.480> thousand<00:02:35.049> or<00:02:35.200> three<00:02:35.670> thousand<00:02:37.680> 16<00:02:38.680> gigs

two thousand or three thousand 16 gigs

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.949 
two thousand or three thousand 16 gigs
so<00:02:39.219> it's<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.459> five<00:02:39.670> thousand<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.329> know<00:02:40.359> just

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
so it's like five thousand you know just

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.390 
so it's like five thousand you know just
play<00:02:41.200> around<00:02:41.349> with<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.769> see<00:02:42.010> what<00:02:42.040> works<00:02:42.280> for

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400
