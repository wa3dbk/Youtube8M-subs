probably the most famous in that
company's<00:01:39.210> history<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.530> they

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
company's history and then you know they

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
company's history and then you know they
also<00:01:40.979> did<00:01:41.430> something<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:41.880> John<00:01:42.119> Cena<00:01:42.360> first

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.359 
also did something when John Cena first
came<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.079> when<00:01:43.229> Cena<00:01:43.439> first<00:01:43.710> came<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.280> his

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
came up when Cena first came up in his

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.920 
came up when Cena first came up in his
first<00:01:44.610> match<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.000> Smackdown<00:01:45.479> he<00:01:45.540> had<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> very

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
first match on Smackdown he had a very

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.469 
first match on Smackdown he had a very
competitive<00:01:46.290> match<00:01:46.649> against<00:01:46.950> Kurt<00:01:47.159> Angle<00:01:47.549> so

competitive match against Kurt Angle so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.910 
competitive match against Kurt Angle so
in<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> way<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> guess<00:01:49.380> he<00:01:49.500> kind<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.740> already

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
in a way I guess he kind of already

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.520 
in a way I guess he kind of already
established<00:01:50.579> himself<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> player<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.810> he

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
established himself as a player but he

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
established himself as a player but he
transitioned<00:01:53.399> into<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.610> feud<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:53.970> Chris

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
transitioned into a feud with Chris

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
transitioned into a feud with Chris
Jericho<00:01:54.509> where<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.590> beat<00:01:55.799> Jericho<00:01:56.250> he<00:01:56.430> might

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
Jericho where he beat Jericho he might

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.770 
Jericho where he beat Jericho he might
have<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:56.729> beaten<00:01:57.119> Jericho<00:01:57.450> more<00:01:57.630> than

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
have actually beaten Jericho more than

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
have actually beaten Jericho more than
once<00:01:57.930> he<00:01:58.140> might<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.380> beaten<00:01:58.530> him<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.770> TV

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
once he might have beaten him on TV

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.280 
once he might have beaten him on TV
first<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.579> then<00:01:59.670> on<00:02:00.540> pay-per-view<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.140> think

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
first and then on pay-per-view I think

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.069 
first and then on pay-per-view I think
it<00:02:01.350> was<00:02:01.439> vengeance<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.149> also<00:02:03.329> made

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
it was vengeance and that was also made

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.109 
it was vengeance and that was also made
to<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> pretty<00:02:04.799> shocking<00:02:05.430> thing<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.000> this

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
to be a pretty shocking thing that this

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
to be a pretty shocking thing that this

boy looking back on that I don't know

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:54.390 
boy looking back on that I don't know
what<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.680> hell<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.919> point<00:02:54.129> of<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.340> was

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
what the hell the point of that was

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.949 
what the hell the point of that was
being<00:02:54.849> that<00:02:55.030> they<00:02:55.180> sent<00:02:55.419> him<00:02:55.569> right<00:02:55.720> back<00:02:55.900> down

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
being that they sent him right back down

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.440 
being that they sent him right back down
to<00:02:56.319> developmental<00:02:56.829> but<00:02:57.790> they<00:02:57.879> had<00:02:58.000> Bo<00:02:58.209> Dallas

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
to developmental but they had Bo Dallas

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.970 
to developmental but they had Bo Dallas
I<00:02:58.750> think<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:59.049> might<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.290> been<00:02:59.349> in<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.620> forty

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
I think it might have been in that forty

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.860 
I think it might have been in that forty
man<00:03:00.159> Rumble<00:03:00.430> maybe<00:03:01.180> no<00:03:01.269> actually<00:03:01.629> no<00:03:01.720> when<00:03:01.840> I

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
man Rumble maybe no actually no when I

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.940 
man Rumble maybe no actually no when I
take<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.200> back<00:03:02.409> it<00:03:02.439> might<00:03:02.709> have<00:03:02.829> actually

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
take that back it might have actually

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.059 
take that back it might have actually
been<00:03:03.099> this<00:03:03.310> past<00:03:03.549> year's<00:03:03.790> Rumble<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.299> 2013

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
been this past year's Rumble in 2013

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.159 
been this past year's Rumble in 2013
they<00:03:06.069> put<00:03:06.280> him<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:06.519> there<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.939> think<00:03:07.750> he<00:03:07.930> won

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
they put him in there I think he won

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.659 
they put him in there I think he won
some<00:03:08.319> kind<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.590> match<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:09.040> earn<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.189> spot<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.579> the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
some kind of match to earn a spot in the

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.720 
some kind of match to earn a spot in the
Royal<00:03:09.790> Rumble<00:03:10.109> and<00:03:11.109> I<00:03:11.950> think<00:03:12.129> he<00:03:12.220> eliminated

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
Royal Rumble and I think he eliminated

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.849 
Royal Rumble and I think he eliminated
Wade<00:03:13.000> Barrett<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:13.750> then<00:03:14.169> he<00:03:14.260> beat<00:03:14.439> him<00:03:14.590> again

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
Wade Barrett and then he beat him again

Intercontinental title that was kind of
shocking<00:03:28.599> I<00:03:28.690> guess<00:03:29.609> maven<00:03:30.609> eliminating<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
shocking I guess maven eliminating the

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.809

Undertaker<00:03:32.049> in<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.290> Royal<00:03:32.530> Rumble<00:03:32.620> was<00:03:33.250> very

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
Undertaker in the Royal Rumble was very

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.099 
Undertaker in the Royal Rumble was very
shocking<00:03:34.180> that's<00:03:34.569> actually<00:03:34.870> one<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
shocking that's actually one of the

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.599 
shocking that's actually one of the
greatest<00:03:35.379> moments<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:35.769> Rumble<00:03:36.069> history<00:03:36.430> but

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
greatest moments in Rumble history but

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.759 
greatest moments in Rumble history but
that's<00:03:36.729> not<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> match<00:03:37.209> I'm<00:03:38.139> thinking<00:03:38.470> in<00:03:38.560> terms

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that's not a match I'm thinking in terms

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.289 
that's not a match I'm thinking in terms
of<00:03:38.919> matches<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.459> can't<00:03:39.819> think<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.090> anything

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
of matches I can't think of anything

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.420 
of matches I can't think of anything
else<00:03:40.510> off<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.959> top<00:03:41.139> of<00:03:41.169> my<00:03:41.409> head<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.159> do

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
else off the top of my head and I do

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.479 
else off the top of my head and I do
think<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:43.359> know<00:03:43.479> doing<00:03:44.199> an<00:03:44.379> angle<00:03:45.159> like<00:03:45.250> that

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
think you know doing an angle like that

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.009 
think you know doing an angle like that
every<00:03:45.760> now<00:03:45.879> and<00:03:46.090> then<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.599> don't<00:03:46.750> want<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.930> do

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
every now and then you don't want to do

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.020 
every now and then you don't want to do
it<00:03:47.139> too<00:03:47.260> often<00:03:47.489> absolutely<00:03:48.489> they<00:03:48.760> don't<00:03:48.940> do

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
it too often absolutely they don't do

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.170 
it too often absolutely they don't do
them<00:03:49.180> often<00:03:49.329> enough<00:03:50.280> clearly<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.489> have<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.030> go

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
them often enough clearly I have to go

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.170 
them often enough clearly I have to go
back<00:03:52.359> 12<00:03:53.139> years<00:03:53.409> to<00:03:53.650> think<00:03:53.859> of<00:03:53.979> one<00:03:54.159> you<00:03:54.459> know

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
back 12 years to think of one you know

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.159 
back 12 years to think of one you know
so<00:03:55.419> I<00:03:55.690> think<00:03:56.199> if<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.470> have<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.680> right<00:03:56.889> people

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
so I think if you have the right people

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.270 
so I think if you have the right people
absolutely<00:03:59.169> it<00:03:59.260> could<00:03:59.379> be<00:03:59.500> very<00:03:59.680> effective<00:03:59.799> in

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
absolutely it could be very effective in

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.770 
absolutely it could be very effective in
helping<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.790> get<00:04:00.939> somebody<00:04:01.269> over<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.629> just

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
helping to get somebody over you just

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.789 
helping to get somebody over you just
want<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.019> make<00:04:02.109> sure<00:04:02.139> you're<00:04:02.379> doing<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.680> with

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
want to make sure you're doing it with

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.349 
want to make sure you're doing it with
the<00:04:02.829> right<00:04:02.919> person<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.519> could<00:04:03.909> see<00:04:04.090> somebody

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
the right person I could see somebody

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.270 
the right person I could see somebody
like<00:04:04.689> Sami<00:04:04.989> Zayn<00:04:05.319> when<00:04:05.650> he's<00:04:05.799> ready<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.069> come
