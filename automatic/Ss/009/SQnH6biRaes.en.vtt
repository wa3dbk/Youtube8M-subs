side<00:01:34.350> view<00:01:35.689> because<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> whole<00:01:37.020> body<00:01:37.290> shifted

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
side view because the whole body shifted

out<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> we<00:01:43.710> had<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.950> cut<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> mortar<00:01:44.700> by

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
out so we had to cut the mortar by

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.899 
out so we had to cut the mortar by
pulling<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> wires

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
pulling the wires
