00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello how are we in a very study 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.990
 While we are here about to act but 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.929
 let's start with Miss 2000 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.590
 let's go cover your suffering your 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.080
 pain his agony where we would take him 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:28.440
 put an end 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.440
 stand up straight as usual for me 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.610
 ready 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.600
 what a good idea 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.630
 It scared me and it scared me 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.630
 and I'm filming nothing more 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.340
 Well first, it's going to be a simple 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.340
 line so that you see 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.430
 OK 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.079
 ah 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.350
 now a very funny part that 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.970
 touch pieces what I have hairs in the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.410
 arm so good you have to get them out there 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.900
 to eliminate them 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.990
 look how beautiful in the whole new world 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.390
 for me this is the truth that has lost 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.470
 in a way the arms stack 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.470
 it is always 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.690
 why 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.970
 the least 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.880
 feel later as much as I could but 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.220
 if at the time that one can not escape 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.070
 of your destiny you have to face it wanted 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.450
 do this 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.450
 this is a field 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.580
 ok ok 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.250
 so it is beautiful that you 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.359
 How is it going 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.360
 because it hurt 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.590
 there I see it straight 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.190
 yes yes there I see it perfect in the 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.190
 economic 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.960
 first let's make a little girl dale 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.960

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.319

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.470

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.120
 and scare postcards 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:34.570
 I scream but 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:37.470
 it feels completely bearable good 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.470
 I tell you we are 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.670
 we are treating veil in the arm but 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.920
 ingredient mind and although we undertook 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.660
 the cameras barely supported me the machine 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.660

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.990
 one thousand 991 study 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.530
 before I want to tell you before doing 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.510
 the tattoo I sent of course to 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.180
 Carolina the transfer with the photo with the 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:35.300
 transfer stuck so that the head of the 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.300
 what is there because it comes 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:56.790
 although really incredible even the 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.569
 shading perfection perfection 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.939
 of the lines 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.319

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.240
 spectacular I love how I love how 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.550
 it was until I felt it was not 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.499
 it hurt me for nothing or there are areas much 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.119
 more sensitive than feeling in says the 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:11.800
 prick obviously when you're going to feel 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:14.309
 but it's not a terrible pain 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.179
 that if it comes out I die that's totally 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:18.179
 bearable by is out of the game 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:15.860
