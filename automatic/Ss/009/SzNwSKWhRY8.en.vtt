of<00:06:49.950> this<00:06:50.400> entire<00:06:50.760> review<00:06:51.120> think<00:06:51.660> about<00:06:51.870> it

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
of this entire review think about it

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.409 
of this entire review think about it
what<00:06:52.169> competes<00:06:52.650> with<00:06:52.830> the<00:06:53.280> golf<00:06:53.669> diesel

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
what competes with the golf diesel

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.630 
what competes with the golf diesel
there's<00:06:55.320> only<00:06:55.440> one<00:06:55.710> car<00:06:55.950> that<00:06:56.130> comes<00:06:56.220> to<00:06:56.430> mind

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
there's only one car that comes to mind

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.790 
there's only one car that comes to mind
and<00:06:56.910> that's<00:06:57.270> the<00:06:57.479> chevy<00:06:57.750> cruze<00:06:58.050> and<00:06:58.290> that

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
and that's the chevy cruze and that

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.280 
and that's the chevy cruze and that
really<00:06:59.130> is<00:06:59.370> more<00:06:59.940> of<00:07:00.000> a<00:07:00.210> sedan<00:07:00.540> and<00:07:00.840> less<00:07:01.020> of<00:07:01.050> a

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
really is more of a sedan and less of a

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.890 
really is more of a sedan and less of a
hatchback<00:07:01.530> so<00:07:02.070> I<00:07:02.280> think<00:07:02.700> Volkswagen<00:07:03.630> at<00:07:03.750> least

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
hatchback so I think Volkswagen at least

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.870 
hatchback so I think Volkswagen at least
for<00:07:04.080> now<00:07:04.200> has<00:07:04.530> his<00:07:04.800> segment<00:07:05.070> sewn<00:07:05.520> up

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
for now has his segment sewn up

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.030 
for now has his segment sewn up
of<00:07:06.180> course<00:07:06.419> I've<00:07:06.570> only<00:07:06.690> had<00:07:06.960> about<00:07:07.140> 20<00:07:07.800> minutes

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040 
of course I've only had about 20 minutes

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.380 
of course I've only had about 20 minutes
to<00:07:08.100> drive<00:07:08.280> this<00:07:08.460> car<00:07:08.669> so<00:07:08.850> it<00:07:08.910> wouldn't<00:07:09.090> be<00:07:09.210> fair

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.390

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
to Volkswagen it wouldn't be fair to you

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.020
