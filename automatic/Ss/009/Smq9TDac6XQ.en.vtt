to this gun so with my sponsorship with
Puma<00:01:43.690> what<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.020> found<00:01:44.380> was<00:01:44.650> that<00:01:44.680> did<00:01:45.550> not<00:01:45.700> make

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
Puma what I found was that did not make

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.060 
Puma what I found was that did not make
such<00:01:46.150> good<00:01:46.360> stuff<00:01:46.570> for<00:01:46.780> freestyle<00:01:47.290> but

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
such good stuff for freestyle but

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.010 
such good stuff for freestyle but
evidently<00:01:48.460> over<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.090> last<00:01:49.270> two<00:01:49.509> years<00:01:49.539> there

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
evidently over the last two years there

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.719 
evidently over the last two years there
has<00:01:50.140> changed<00:01:50.740> forget<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.100> mountain<00:01:51.430> people

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
has changed forget the mountain people

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:02.969 
has changed forget the mountain people
who<00:01:51.910> use<00:01:52.119> Puma<00:01:52.539> as<00:01:52.750> freestyle<00:01:53.259> shoes<00:01:53.500> a<00:02:01.830> lot<00:02:02.830> of

you fans and asked us about the Puma
archive<00:02:05.110> light<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.740> we<00:02:05.830> decided<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.280> take<00:02:07.240> a

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
archive light so we decided to take a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.930 
archive light so we decided to take a
look<00:02:07.420> at<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.690> upon<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.380> first<00:02:08.590> observation<00:02:09.399> we

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
look at it upon the first observation we

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.460 
look at it upon the first observation we
were<00:02:10.030> skeptical<00:02:10.450> where<00:02:10.840> they'd<00:02:10.989> look<00:02:11.230> like<00:02:11.260> a

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
were skeptical where they'd look like a

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.590 
were skeptical where they'd look like a
freestyle<00:02:11.950> sure<00:02:12.190> even<00:02:12.580> felt<00:02:13.120> like<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.360> few

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
freestyle sure even felt like a few

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.110 
freestyle sure even felt like a few
stars<00:02:13.870> firstly<00:02:14.620> look<00:02:14.769> how<00:02:14.890> thick<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.640> soul<00:02:15.880> is

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
stars firstly look how thick the soul is

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.150 
stars firstly look how thick the soul is
but<00:02:16.450> nothing<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.019> tip<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.530> mean<00:02:17.769> it's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
but nothing is the tip I mean it's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.979 
but nothing is the tip I mean it's
fairly<00:02:18.340> around<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.940> broad<00:02:19.120> that's<00:02:19.630> not<00:02:19.810> like

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
fairly around in broad that's not like

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.449 
fairly around in broad that's not like
the<00:02:20.110> typical<00:02:20.230> shoe<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.799> we<00:02:21.040> use<00:02:21.250> for

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
the typical shoe that we use for

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.940 
the typical shoe that we use for
freestyle<00:02:21.880> but<00:02:22.150> on<00:02:23.110> second<00:02:23.650> observation

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
freestyle but on second observation

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.979 
freestyle but on second observation
realize<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.180> there's<00:02:25.329> more<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.780> shoe

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
realize that there's more to the shoe

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.789 
realize that there's more to the shoe
that<00:02:26.290> meets<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> eye

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
that meets the eye

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.259 
that meets the eye
like<00:02:27.780> flexibility<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.829> when<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.820> first<00:02:31.030> pick

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
like flexibility and when you first pick

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.340 
like flexibility and when you first pick
the<00:02:31.390> shoe<00:02:31.540> up<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.870> was<00:02:32.079> surprisingly<00:02:32.620> light<00:02:34.350> so

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
the shoe up it was surprisingly light so

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.630 
the shoe up it was surprisingly light so
I<00:02:35.410> stole<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.799> scale<00:02:36.070> from<00:02:36.190> my<00:02:36.310> mother's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
I stole the scale from my mother's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.090 
I stole the scale from my mother's
kitchen<00:02:37.049> so<00:02:38.049> we're<00:02:38.440> gonna<00:02:38.560> weigh<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.799> few

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
kitchen so we're gonna weigh a few

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.400 
kitchen so we're gonna weigh a few
things<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.489> for<00:02:39.910> comparison<00:02:40.209> first<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
things just for comparison first the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.979 
things just for comparison first the
gazelle<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.370> clocks<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.850> at<00:02:42.940> about<00:02:43.060> 200

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
gazelle and that clocks in at about 200

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.380 
gazelle and that clocks in at about 200
grams<00:02:44.230> next<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.130> knight<00:02:45.340> bomba<00:02:45.820> -<00:02:46.060> which

the<00:02:51.940> weight<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.390> those<00:02:52.870> shoes

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
the weight of those shoes

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.440 
the weight of those shoes
100<00:02:54.100> grams<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.670> pretty<00:02:54.880> much<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.120> same<00:02:55.269> way

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
100 grams it's pretty much the same way

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.520 
100 grams it's pretty much the same way
as<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.690> heavy<00:02:56.110> socks<00:02:56.760> dirty<00:02:57.760> heavy<00:02:58.150> socks<00:03:01.530> this

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
as to heavy socks dirty heavy socks this

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.800 
as to heavy socks dirty heavy socks this
thing<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.829> not<00:03:02.950> accurate<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.299> does<00:03:04.570> give

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
thing is not accurate but it does give

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.289 
thing is not accurate but it does give
you<00:03:04.930> an<00:03:05.049> idea<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:06.250> way<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.060> let's<00:03:07.209> look

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
you an idea of the way it so let's look

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.479 
you an idea of the way it so let's look
at<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.510> material<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.110> has<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.620> synthetic<00:03:08.890> nylon

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
at the material it has a synthetic nylon

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.449 
at the material it has a synthetic nylon
skin<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.390> has<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.720> rubber<00:03:10.930> sole<00:03:11.260> eco<00:03:12.040> earth-like

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
skin it has a rubber sole eco earth-like

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.400 
skin it has a rubber sole eco earth-like
cushioning<00:03:12.970> footbed<00:03:13.390> oh<00:03:13.540> well<00:03:13.750> that's<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.079> BS

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
cushioning footbed oh well that's the BS

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.319 
cushioning footbed oh well that's the BS
that<00:03:14.620> Puma<00:03:15.040> talks<00:03:15.579> about<00:03:15.760> on<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.030> Internet

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
that Puma talks about on the Internet

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.390 
that Puma talks about on the Internet
essentially<00:03:17.109> it's<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:17.799> some<00:03:18.040> sort<00:03:18.280> of

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
essentially it's just some sort of

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.310 
essentially it's just some sort of
cushioning<00:03:18.790> foam<00:03:19.150> it's<00:03:19.840> surprisingly

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
cushioning foam it's surprisingly

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.810 
cushioning foam it's surprisingly
minimal<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.190> doesn't<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.549> any

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
minimal and it doesn't have any

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.520 
minimal and it doesn't have any
unnecessary<00:03:22.180> stuff<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:22.989> which<00:03:23.170> makes<00:03:23.320> it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
unnecessary stuff on it which makes it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.410 
unnecessary stuff on it which makes it
quite<00:03:23.739> like<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.160> why<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.370> actually<00:03:24.610> works<00:03:25.120> is

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
quite like the why it actually works is

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.570 
quite like the why it actually works is
that<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:26.170> material<00:03:26.709> on<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.099> shoe<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.550> really

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
that the material on the shoe is really

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.860 
that the material on the shoe is really
soft<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.420> you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
soft and you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.600 
soft and you
to<00:03:29.230> complement<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.830> material<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.430> need<00:03:30.549> a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
to complement the material you need a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.610 
to complement the material you need a
material<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.209> supports<00:03:31.659> it<00:03:31.780> not<00:03:32.260> only<00:03:32.530> in

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
material that supports it not only in

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.009 
material that supports it not only in
flexibility<00:03:33.250> but<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:33.909> feeling<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.599> material

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
flexibility but in feeling the material

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.350 
flexibility but in feeling the material
on<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.260> toolbox<00:03:35.739> does<00:03:36.640> well<00:03:36.849> to<00:03:37.000> cushion<00:03:37.150> the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
on the toolbox does well to cushion the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.839 
on the toolbox does well to cushion the
pole<00:03:37.569> and<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.349> tip<00:03:38.620> here<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.069> should<00:03:39.400> as<00:03:39.610> well

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
pole and the tip here I should as well

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.300 
pole and the tip here I should as well
to<00:03:40.180> give<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.480> ball<00:03:40.690> rebound<00:03:41.379> and<00:03:41.709> what<00:03:42.099> makes

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
to give the ball rebound and what makes

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.250 
to give the ball rebound and what makes
a<00:03:42.430> shoe<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:42.790> comfortable<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
a shoe so comfortable is that the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.170 
a shoe so comfortable is that the
texture<00:03:44.650> on<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.830> shoe<00:03:45.010> is<00:03:45.129> really<00:03:45.159> soft<00:03:45.700> in

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
texture on the shoe is really soft in

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.119 
texture on the shoe is really soft in
order<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.690> support<00:03:47.019> that<00:03:47.230> soft<00:03:47.500> but<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.799> need

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
order to support that soft but you need

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.390 
order to support that soft but you need
a<00:03:48.159> very<00:03:48.370> flexible<00:03:48.720> soft<00:03:49.720> material<00:03:50.409> closing<00:03:51.310> it

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
a very flexible soft material closing it

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.460 
a very flexible soft material closing it
off<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:51.819> that's<00:03:52.450> where<00:03:52.629> this<00:03:52.750> foam<00:03:52.989> comes<00:03:53.290> in

off and that's where this foam comes in

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.649 
off and that's where this foam comes in
in<00:03:53.769> terms<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.220> grip<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.940> shoe<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.239> pretty<00:03:55.480> good

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
in terms of grip the shoe is pretty good

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.899 
in terms of grip the shoe is pretty good
at<00:03:55.810> block<00:03:56.079> but<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.709> certain<00:03:57.040> areas<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:57.849> does

at block but in certain areas it does

football<00:04:01.660> on<00:04:02.049> grass<00:04:02.410> don't<00:04:03.099> do<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.459> also

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
football on grass don't do it also

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.270

cement or Street a rough surface and
what<00:04:12.940> we<00:04:13.090> thought<00:04:13.329> was<00:04:13.629> a<00:04:13.659> disadvantage<00:04:14.440> at

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
what we thought was a disadvantage at

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.800 
what we thought was a disadvantage at
the<00:04:14.650> start<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.129> having<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.489> thick<00:04:15.879> sole<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.630> she

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
the start of having a thick sole and she

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.360 
the start of having a thick sole and she
turns<00:04:16.989> out<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.139> be<00:04:17.229> an<00:04:17.380> advantage<00:04:17.889> because

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
turns out to be an advantage because

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.640 
turns out to be an advantage because
it's<00:04:18.639> so<00:04:18.729> comfortable<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.359> soft<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:20.380> does<00:04:20.530> not

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
it's so comfortable and soft it does not

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.080 
it's so comfortable and soft it does not
hurt<00:04:20.829> your<00:04:21.039> feet<00:04:21.280> when<00:04:21.459> you're<00:04:21.549> doing<00:04:21.729> Lois

hurt your feet when you're doing Lois

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.850 
hurt your feet when you're doing Lois
apart<00:04:22.479> from<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.750> sole<00:04:22.990> being<00:04:23.289> really<00:04:23.590> thick

with the profile the shoe is really well
balanced<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:26.470> gives<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.770> low<00:04:26.949> center<00:04:27.340> of

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
balanced and gives you a low center of

balanced and gives you a low center of
gravity<00:04:27.430> Q<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:28.210> really<00:04:28.479> good<00:04:28.630> for<00:04:28.750> uppers<00:04:29.139> you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
gravity Q is really good for uppers you

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.710 
gravity Q is really good for uppers you
think<00:04:29.860> that's<00:04:30.039> weird<00:04:30.280> but<00:04:30.699> reaching<00:04:31.270> upwards

protrusions in it which can help you
grab<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.270> ball<00:04:52.450> so<00:04:53.320> all<00:04:53.560> these<00:04:53.710> properties

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
grab the ball so all these properties

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.440 
grab the ball so all these properties
actually<00:04:54.370> make<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.789> quite<00:04:55.000> good<00:04:55.180> for
