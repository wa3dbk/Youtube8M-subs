00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
gold and I'll actually do a comparison

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.270 
gold and I'll actually do a comparison
swatch<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> regular<00:01:07.229> color<00:01:07.680> tattoos

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
swatch to just the regular color tattoos

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.590 
swatch to just the regular color tattoos
I<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.390> regular<00:01:09.600> color<00:01:10.020> tattoo<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:11.189> in

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
I have the regular color tattoo here in

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.499 
I have the regular color tattoo here in
bad<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> bronze<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.159> also<00:01:14.400> has<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> bit

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
bad to the bronze so it also has a bit

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.560 
bad to the bronze so it also has a bit
of<00:01:15.750> shimmer<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.970> anything

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of shimmer to it but it's not anything

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.820 
of shimmer to it but it's not anything
like<00:01:19.549> this<00:01:20.549> gold<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> there's<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
like this gold one so there's a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
like this gold one so there's a
comparison<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.729> bad<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> bronze<00:01:25.020> from

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
comparison of bad to the bronze from

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590 
comparison of bad to the bronze from
their<00:01:25.950> original<00:01:26.460> color<00:01:26.670> tattoo<00:01:27.090> line<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
their original color tattoo line and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.350 
their original color tattoo line and
then<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.710> gold<00:01:29.009> rush<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.150> gold

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
then the gold rush as you can see gold

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.399 
then the gold rush as you can see gold
rush<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.720> way<00:01:31.070> more<00:01:32.070> shimmery<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.729> bold<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
rush is way more shimmery and bold now I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
rush is way more shimmery and bold now I
do<00:01:34.560> think<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.820> great

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
do think that this is a really great

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
do think that this is a really great
quality<00:01:36.780> eye<00:01:37.020> product<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> doesn't<00:01:38.009> crease

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
quality eye product it doesn't crease

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.370 
quality eye product it doesn't crease
easily<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.150> lasts<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.200> long<00:01:40.320> time

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
easily it lasts for a really long time

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.580 
easily it lasts for a really long time
the<00:01:41.369> application<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.090> pretty<00:01:42.270> easy<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.110> think

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the application is pretty easy I think

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
the application is pretty easy I think
the<00:01:43.710> only<00:01:43.890> drawback<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:45.119> think<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the only drawback I can really think of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.260 
the only drawback I can really think of
is<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.700> difficult<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
is that it is a little bit difficult to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.300 
is that it is a little bit difficult to
remove<00:01:48.780> these<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:50.100> are

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
remove these just because they are

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.069 
remove these just because they are
creamy<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.939> there's<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.630> much<00:01:51.750> shimmer

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
creamy and there's also so much shimmer

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780 
creamy and there's also so much shimmer
in<00:01:52.290> them<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.680> does<00:01:53.130> take<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> little<00:01:53.549> while<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
in them it does take a little while to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.240 
in them it does take a little while to
sort<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> work<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.020> off<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:55.560> eyelid<00:01:55.979> now
