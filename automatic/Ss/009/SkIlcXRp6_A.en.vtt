00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it's fat32 and that should work and then

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.710 
it's fat32 and that should work and then
that's<00:01:32.159> why<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> did<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.700> my<00:01:32.850> over<00:01:33.030> USB<00:01:33.240> and

that's why I did with my over USB and
then<00:01:33.930> i<00:01:33.960> reconfigured<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.729> plug

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
then i reconfigured it and now if plug

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.609 
then i reconfigured it and now if plug
it<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:37.549> you'll<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.820> USB<00:01:39.299> stick<00:01:39.750> there<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> go

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
it in you'll see USB stick there so go

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.340 
it in you'll see USB stick there so go
back<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> my<00:01:43.950> computer<00:01:44.509> they're<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.990> exact

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
back to my computer they're the exact

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.730 
back to my computer they're the exact
same<00:01:46.439> profile<00:01:48.140> I've<00:01:49.140> got<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> exact<00:01:49.710> same

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
same profile I've got the exact same

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.139 
same profile I've got the exact same
files<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.549> them<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.500> some<00:01:52.560> reason<00:01:53.149> this

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
files on them but for some reason this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.139 
files on them but for some reason this
one's<00:01:54.390> formatted<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> worked<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
one's formatted and it worked and this

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.770 
one's formatted and it worked and this
one's<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.960> farm<00:01:58.229> ID<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.310> doesn't<00:01:59.579> work

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
one's not farm ID and it doesn't work

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.560 
one's not farm ID and it doesn't work
I'm<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.960> sure<00:02:01.290> why<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.549> those<00:02:03.390> are

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
I'm not sure why it is but if those are

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
I'm not sure why it is but if those are
the<00:02:03.659> step<00:02:03.899> start<00:02:04.140> feature<00:02:04.439> problem<00:02:04.829> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the step start feature problem that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.119 
the step start feature problem that
should<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:06.600> hope<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.140> helped<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.799> didn't

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
should I hope this helped if it didn't

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.869 
should I hope this helped if it didn't
leave<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> comment<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.270> thanks<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.810> watching
