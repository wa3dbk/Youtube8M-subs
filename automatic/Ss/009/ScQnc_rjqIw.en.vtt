00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.210
 hello how are you old and dove and they 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.220
 lola 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.540
 today I want to show you a 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.930
 look I've been using a lot lately 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.790
 it is very easy to make great themes 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.250
 for summer because it's cool has 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:26.920
 a lot of light and it is this with golden shadows 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.920
 from iconix six coral I hope you like it 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.510
 before I always put the base first 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.100
 but recently a friend told me she is 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.630
 better to put the corrector first 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.320
 because that's how it lasts longer and you do not have to use 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.320
 so much base 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.120
 so first I put a concealer 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 of dark circles and then a concealer 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.280
 Special to cover granites and areas 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.280
 red 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.910
 then I'm not going to put this base that I 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.210
 like it because it is very light and easy to 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.210
 put 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.360
 but it does not have as much coverage then 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.340
 then I put on some of this 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 Makeup powder to seal make 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.820
 that lasts longer and also to unify more 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 the tone of the legs 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.630
 for eyebrows lately I'm using 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.690
 this kit that has a shadow in cream 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 dark and a powder more clarita 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.760
 so what I do is that first I 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.410
 I comb my eyebrows 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.410
 then I put on the dark shadow 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.200
 He blurred it with this brush 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.620
 then clarita and return it to 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.620
 blur 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.460
 good 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.990
 for the eyes first I'm going to start with 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.490
 this golden shadow in cream and I 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.490
 I put on the mobile eyelid with my finger 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.950
 and with a small brush on the line 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.670
 under the eye because it opens us up a lot and 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.670
 it gives more shine 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 after I put this brown shadow on the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.860
 part where -according to the eye to give it more 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.860
 depth 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.140
 and with a brush clean it blew with 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.040
 Windshield motions to give you a 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.040
 smoking effect 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.510
 to define more eyes I'm going to get 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.490
 a line with this brown eyeliner what 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.050
 more hit the lashes you can and 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.440
 What I like from the pencil is that 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.300
 has a sponge to blur 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.340
 and I'm also going to put it under the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.430
 golden line where the eyelashes are and 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.290
 with a sponge it diffuses it and before 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.180
 mascara I'm going to put the golden shade on 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.980
 cream but now the center of the eyelid 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.000
 to the corner of the lacrimal to give more 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.000
 intensity to gold 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.380
 to finish with the eyes I'm going to put 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.390
 this mascara that of my favorites because 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.280
 there is a lot of volume and I put on 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.700
 several layers of the lashes above and 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.700
 in the one below 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.120
 to see me a little more tanned use 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.060
 this monster and I put it in the form of 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.540
 3 on the forehead below the commons and 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.540
 in the chin 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.510
 and the balls that are made when 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.700
 smile I put this blog that also 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.200
 you the makeup tutorial last and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.790
 I love it because it's orange trees this and 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.790
 this does not fit us or all 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.040
 and finally the lips first I put on 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.480
 this moisturizer after those of linen and 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.780
 I also fill them with this crayon 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.780
 coral 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.590
 and to give them more brightness or volume and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.810
 use color from the istic which is also 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.190
 coral and I loved it because it moisturizes you 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.190
 soft and esther or sticky 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.800
 there is almost I forget but one of my 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.810
 favorite steps is the illuminator that 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.430
 It gives more light and freshness to the face and 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.050
 I usually put it on top of the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.640
 cheekbones 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.640
 under the arch of the eyebrows 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.500
 and here that I do not know what it's called by this 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.960
 long that is done above the lip 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.790
 this is the end and what I like is 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.400
 which is perfect for summer because 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.690
 it is fresh very bright and the golden one is 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.250
 a color that suits us all 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.730
 because it makes our skin look more 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.709
 quality 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.840
 at least I wanted to say that this the issues 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.220
 great for the day but if you want 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.320
 go out at night you want to have 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.550
 a little more intense the makeup what 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.530
 I usually do is that I wear 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.540
 False eyelashes if you do not know how 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.820
 put you leave them in the comments if 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.290

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.680
 I also leave my social networks for 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.930

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.490

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.430
