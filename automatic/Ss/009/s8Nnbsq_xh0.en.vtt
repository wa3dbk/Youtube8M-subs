gonna do the same old stones licks which
is<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.990> don't<00:00:22.890> know<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.160> these<00:00:23.279> are

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
is like I don't know what these are

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.620 
is like I don't know what these are
called<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:23.820> chords<00:00:24.119> these<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.390> but

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
called or what chords these are but

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.900 
called or what chords these are but
sixth<00:00:25.140> fret<00:00:25.410> middle<00:00:25.890> finger<00:00:26.310> third<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
sixth fret middle finger third from the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.700 
sixth fret middle finger third from the
top<00:00:28.730> fifth<00:00:29.730> fret<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.779> finger<00:00:30.900> fourth<00:00:31.560> from

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
top fifth fret first finger fourth from

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.939 
top fifth fret first finger fourth from
the<00:00:31.769> top<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.320> put<00:00:34.500> them<00:00:34.590> together

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.770 

and<00:00:37.129> that's<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.519> familiar<00:00:38.059> if<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:38.449> slide

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
and that's the familiar if you slide

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.060 
and that's the familiar if you slide
them<00:00:38.899> up

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.569 

and<00:00:45.070> then<00:00:45.460> you<00:00:45.550> just<00:00:45.730> do<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.850> couple<00:00:46.030> hammer<00:00:46.420> ons

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.880 

so<00:00:51.579> altogether<00:00:51.910> it<00:00:52.359> should<00:00:52.629> sound<00:00:52.840> like<00:00:53.019> this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.610 

and<00:00:56.300> then<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.540> a<00:00:57.570> blues<00:00:57.870> since<00:00:58.380> it's<00:00:58.530> an

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and then to do a blues since it's an

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
and then to do a blues since it's an
open<00:00:58.890> tuning<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.460> kind<00:00:59.790> of<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
open tuning you kind of just do it a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.580 
open tuning you kind of just do it a
little<00:01:00.300> bit<00:01:00.510> differently

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.389 

you<00:01:07.039> can<00:01:07.219> you<00:01:08.210> can<00:01:08.240> do<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.570> because<00:01:08.750> that's

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
you can you can do that because that's

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.959 
you can you can do that because that's
everything's<00:01:10.399> really<00:01:10.520> easy<00:01:10.729> when<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.939> have

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
everything's really easy when you have

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:13.419 
everything's really easy when you have
it<00:01:11.149> open<00:01:11.270> tuning<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.380> then<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.070> rest<00:01:13.280> is

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
it open tuning and then the rest is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:19.190 
it open tuning and then the rest is
gonna<00:01:13.520> be<00:01:13.640> barring<00:01:14.210> you're<00:01:14.810> just<00:01:14.929> gonna<00:01:15.079> bar

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.020 

and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.040> go

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.240 

so<00:01:24.030> that's<00:01:24.979> 11th<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
so that's 11th and then you do the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.190 
so that's 11th and then you do the
which<00:01:31.250> basically<00:01:31.610> Evaristo<00:01:32.329> song<00:01:32.630> has<00:01:32.899> so<00:01:33.170> you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
which basically Evaristo song has so you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.010 
which basically Evaristo song has so you
do<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.860> just<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.310> bar<00:01:34.570> just<00:01:35.570> kind<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:35.869> hit<00:01:35.990> the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
do the just the bar just kind of hit the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.740 
do the just the bar just kind of hit the
top<00:01:36.289> four<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:36.770> don't<00:01:36.950> really<00:01:37.219> need<00:01:38.180> those<00:01:38.450> and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
top four you don't really need those and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.039 
top four you don't really need those and
then<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.259> do<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:40.030> inversion<00:01:41.030> which<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
then you do the inversion which is the

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.219 
then you do the inversion which is the
11th<00:01:42.619> now<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.310> 13th<00:01:44.299> fret<00:01:45.789> second<00:01:46.789> string<00:01:47.229> and

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
11th now the 13th fret second string and

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.639 
11th now the 13th fret second string and
then<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:48.530> twelfth<00:01:48.740> fret<00:01:49.210> fourth<00:01:50.210> string<00:01:50.649> from

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
then the twelfth fret fourth string from

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.919 
then the twelfth fret fourth string from
the<00:01:51.740> top<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.909> should<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.210> keep<00:01:56.360> practicing

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
the top you should just keep practicing

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:53.020 
the top you should just keep practicing
that<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.850> then<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.579> should<00:02:01.909> go<00:02:02.030> like<00:02:02.060> this

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:07.180 

so<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.630> basically

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.730 

so<00:03:08.190> you're<00:03:08.310> basically<00:03:08.700> doing<00:03:09.180> an<00:03:09.930> e<00:03:10.230> chord<00:03:10.530> as

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
so you're basically doing an e chord as

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.030 
so you're basically doing an e chord as
if<00:03:12.050> yeah<00:03:13.050> as<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> were<00:03:13.590> doing<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.890> regular

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
if yeah as if you were doing a regular

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.000 
if yeah as if you were doing a regular
ecord<00:03:15.020> but<00:03:16.020> since<00:03:16.200> it's<00:03:16.320> an<00:03:16.380> open<00:03:16.590> tuning<00:03:16.890> it's

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
ecord but since it's an open tuning it's

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.170 
ecord but since it's an open tuning it's
a<00:03:17.070> totally<00:03:17.310> different<00:03:17.340> chord<00:03:17.790> which<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.120> don't

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
a totally different chord which I don't

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.650 
a totally different chord which I don't
know<00:03:18.330> what<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.510> is

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
know what it is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.550 
know what it is
Summit's<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.720> then<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.990> let<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.380> your

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
Summit's and then you let go of your

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.600 
Summit's and then you let go of your
ring<00:03:23.130> finger

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.130 

and<00:03:29.000> then<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.270> let<00:03:29.420> go<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.600> middle<00:03:29.930> finger

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
and then you let go the middle finger

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.480 
and then you let go the middle finger
and<00:03:30.230> it's<00:03:30.380> that<00:03:30.500> same<00:03:30.710> old<00:03:30.860> hammer-ons<00:03:31.340> you

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
and it's that same old hammer-ons you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.830 
and it's that same old hammer-ons you
just<00:03:31.640> got<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.850> keep<00:03:31.940> doing<00:03:32.270> it<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.480> figure<00:03:32.750> it

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
just got to keep doing it to figure it

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.740 
just got to keep doing it to figure it
out

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.020 

and<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.170> top<00:03:39.280> now<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.310> version<00:03:41.000> a

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
and then the top now a version a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.700 
and then the top now a version a
different<00:03:41.720> variation<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.590> you'll

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
different variation of that that you'll

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.590 
different variation of that that you'll
hear<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:42.980> lot<00:03:43.160> other<00:03:43.400> live<00:03:43.670> albums<00:03:44.180> instead<00:03:44.510> of

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
hear a lot other live albums instead of

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.640 
hear a lot other live albums instead of
doing<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:47.020> do<00:03:48.020> what<00:03:48.290> we<00:03:48.380> were<00:03:48.470> doing

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
doing this you do what we were doing

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.770 
doing this you do what we were doing
before
