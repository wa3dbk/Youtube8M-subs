hi i'm michael froman hi cycles
I'm<00:00:09.599> gonna<00:00:09.690> go<00:00:09.870> through<00:00:10.049> the<00:00:10.139> basics<00:00:10.620> of

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
I'm gonna go through the basics of

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.579 
I'm gonna go through the basics of
removing<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.580> road<00:00:11.790> bike<00:00:11.969> front<00:00:12.240> wheel<00:00:12.589> taking

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:13.589 
removing a road bike front wheel taking

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.650 
removing a road bike front wheel taking
it<00:00:13.679> out<00:00:13.830> putting<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.309> back<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.669> readjusting

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
it out putting it back in readjusting

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.730 
it out putting it back in readjusting
the<00:00:15.749> brakes<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.200> making<00:00:16.440> sure<00:00:16.590> they're

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the brakes and making sure they're

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160 
the brakes and making sure they're
centralised<00:00:17.540> the<00:00:18.540> first<00:00:18.750> thing<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:18.990> need<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
centralised the first thing you need to

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.920 
centralised the first thing you need to
know<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.770> most<00:00:20.130> brakes<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> lever<00:00:21.180> that

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
know is most brakes have a lever that

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.630 
know is most brakes have a lever that
releases<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.620> brakes<00:00:22.830> apart<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> little<00:00:23.430> bit

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
releases the brakes apart a little bit

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.450 
releases the brakes apart a little bit
this<00:00:24.180> allows<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.690> tire<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.140> fit<00:00:25.290> through<00:00:25.620> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
this allows the tire to fit through the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.800 
this allows the tire to fit through the
brake<00:00:26.640> pads<00:00:28.820> we're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.940> to<00:00:30.000> release<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
brake pads we're going to release the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.560 
brake pads we're going to release the
quick-release<00:00:31.380> skewer<00:00:32.450> unwind<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
quick-release skewer unwind the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.540 
quick-release skewer unwind the
left-hand<00:00:33.990> side<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> drop<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> wheel<00:00:37.350> out

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
left-hand side and drop the wheel out

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.069 
left-hand side and drop the wheel out
now<00:00:38.550> something<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.880> can<00:00:39.120> often<00:00:39.240> happen<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
now something that can often happen is

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.980 
now something that can often happen is
the<00:00:40.590> brake<00:00:40.770> gets<00:00:41.010> bumped<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.480> moves<00:00:42.690> across

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
the brake gets bumped and moves across

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.560 
the brake gets bumped and moves across
on<00:00:43.140> an<00:00:43.230> angle<00:00:43.560> so<00:00:43.820> then<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:44.970> you<00:00:45.150> put<00:00:45.450> your

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
on an angle so then when you put your

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.650 
on an angle so then when you put your
front<00:00:45.720> wheel<00:00:45.900> back<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:47.239> you<00:00:48.239> wonder<00:00:48.510> why<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
front wheel back in you wonder why the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.280 
front wheel back in you wonder why the
brakes<00:00:48.960> are<00:00:49.140> touching<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.650> side<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:52.170> can

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
brakes are touching one side you can

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.920 
brakes are touching one side you can
quite<00:00:52.530> easily<00:00:53.060> push<00:00:54.060> that<00:00:54.180> across<00:00:54.450> gently<00:00:56.930> put

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
quite easily push that across gently put

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.310 
quite easily push that across gently put
the<00:00:57.960> front<00:00:58.170> wheel<00:00:58.260> back<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:59.870> do<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> skewer

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the front wheel back in do the skewer

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
the front wheel back in do the skewer
back<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.680> making<00:01:02.579> sure<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> wheels

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
back up making sure that the wheels

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
back up making sure that the wheels
seated<00:01:03.809> fully<00:01:04.079> up<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.499> the<00:01:04.710> bottom<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.039> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
seated fully up in the bottom of the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:16.240 
seated fully up in the bottom of the
forks<00:01:05.429> and<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.719> the<00:01:06.810> center

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.720 

she's<00:01:16.760> going<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.910> close<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.330> brakes<00:01:17.510> up<00:01:17.690> again

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
she's going to close the brakes up again

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.330 
she's going to close the brakes up again
if<00:01:19.730> I<00:01:19.850> look<00:01:19.880> at<00:01:20.150> him<00:01:20.270> one<00:01:21.260> sides<00:01:21.560> got<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.800> gap<00:01:22.070> and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
if I look at him one sides got a gap and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.060 
if I look at him one sides got a gap and
the<00:01:23.000> other<00:01:23.120> side<00:01:23.330> hasn't<00:01:23.680> there's<00:01:24.680> two<00:01:24.890> ways

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
the other side hasn't there's two ways

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.920 
the other side hasn't there's two ways
to<00:01:25.250> handle<00:01:25.370> this<00:01:25.670> one<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:26.540> can<00:01:26.660> just<00:01:26.690> grab

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
to handle this one you can just grab

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.410 
to handle this one you can just grab
your<00:01:27.080> brakes<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.560> gently<00:01:28.120> maneuver<00:01:29.120> them<00:01:29.270> or

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
your brakes and gently maneuver them or

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.840 
your brakes and gently maneuver them or
ship<00:01:29.630> them<00:01:29.660> across<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:31.010> other<00:01:31.070> way<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.340> do<00:01:31.550> it

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
ship them across the other way to do it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.910 
ship them across the other way to do it
most<00:01:32.330> brakes<00:01:32.630> either<00:01:32.840> have<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.110> three<00:01:33.650> or<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.890> two

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
most brakes either have a three or a two

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.190 
most brakes either have a three or a two
Melo<00:01:34.280> Lemke<00:01:34.700> or<00:01:35.150> possibly<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.720> Phillips<00:01:36.140> head

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
Melo Lemke or possibly a Phillips head

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.870 
Melo Lemke or possibly a Phillips head
on<00:01:36.500> one<00:01:36.860> side<00:01:37.630> by<00:01:38.630> adjusting<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.880> will

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
on one side by adjusting that will

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.910 
on one side by adjusting that will
actually<00:01:41.180> move<00:01:41.330> your<00:01:41.390> brakes<00:01:41.780> back<00:01:42.530> into<00:01:42.830> the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
actually move your brakes back into the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.220 
actually move your brakes back into the
center<00:01:43.330> now<00:01:44.330> I've<00:01:44.420> got<00:01:44.570> clearance<00:01:44.810> on<00:01:45.020> both

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
center now I've got clearance on both

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.980 
center now I've got clearance on both
sides<00:01:45.910> always<00:01:46.910> when<00:01:47.360> you've<00:01:47.480> removed<00:01:47.630> and

brakes back on etc grab a handful of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.460 
brakes back on etc grab a handful of
Levites<00:01:52.940> it's<00:01:53.150> actually<00:01:53.479> work<00:01:53.690> before<00:01:54.320> you

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
Levites it's actually work before you

Levites it's actually work before you
right<00:01:54.850> that's<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.119> basics<00:01:56.540> of<00:01:56.690> taking<00:01:56.840> the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
right that's the basics of taking the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.420 
right that's the basics of taking the
front<00:01:57.260> wheel<00:01:57.440> out<00:01:57.619> putting<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.100> back<00:01:58.190> in
