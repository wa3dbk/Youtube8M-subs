00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi today I'm trying to answer to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.230
 a question that really makes me very 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.130
 often but that she has to put in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.450
 inside a culture hillock so 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.799
 before starting this video it's 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.940
 maybe be telling you not to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.859
 take for cash all that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 I tell you to check the information 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.580
 that I give you to go see others 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.289
 sources to gather all the info 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.689
 that you will even accumulated and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.789
 you forge your own opinion as well 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.990
 So what are they going on 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.820
 were waiting in a culture for his purpose 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.500
 so we're going to put a law pretty well 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.420
 decomposed when we see the currently 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.739
 on the screen something very light of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.630
 degraded property it must be a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.129
 wood that is well over two years of 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.120
 decomposition actually even wood that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.219
 we use for the chimney for 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.600
 burn is not decomposed he did not 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.430
 not been attacked enough by the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.570
 mushrooms 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.550
 so we 'll get some wood in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.350
 border in the beers it's this wood there 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.820
 that I'm going to use a party for 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 put in time tubes bus from 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.140
 culture so we see in this wood there by 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 example we see that mushrooms that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.620
 attacked the line 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.100
 in fact you know that the ars are 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.049
 consisting of two materials of two 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.119
 main elements there is lignin and 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.439
 there is cellulose so the line is 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.420
 which makes a very strong tree 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.580
 very resistant is very very hard 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.840
 this is the cellulose line what makes 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.490
 that it can be supple it's a bit more 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.630
 fibrous that's what makes it possible 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.470
 be flexible and move a little bit with 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.159
 the broken sense wind 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.540
 so we see that there is a lot of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.630
 mushrooms mushrooms in general 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.520
 consumes the lineage of the woods of the trees 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.930
 there are some mushrooms that concerns 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.130
 only cellulose does not even know 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.750
 this portion of mushrooms that is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.100
 feed only cellulose 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.979
 general mushrooms consumes the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.630
 wood lignin so these undergrowth lake has 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.400
 been rid of all this line that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.799
 we are interested in what is useful for 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.090
 our culture on purpose in fact so there we 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.710
 see a mushroom that takes the line 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.479
 wood, but it will also require 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.810
 mushrooms consumes lignin from the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.610
 Straw 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 there we see a bundle of straw they have 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.810
 collected small grains of wheat that have 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.369
 sprouted and who made small 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.720
 20 10 he also sends 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.700
 mushrooms that consume Lenin from 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.619
 this straw boot here is the little 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.790
 globe the Rabelais team who have booked 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.439
 they are still green and not yet 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.299
 line 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.770
 this is us what interests us it is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.149
 really mushrooms end what we 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.500
 interested is the wood that has become 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.289
 the sheaves is extremely light 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.459
 extremely friable we recognize 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.110
 following in fact when we see a wood that 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.670
 was cleared saline that was 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.590
 broken down by the mushrooms it is 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.940
 extremely light and that's what's worth 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.830
 that they will really disinterested 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.900
 because there will only be 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.190
 line the value the trips we see 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.230
 exactly is breaking 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.280
 easily with one hand and we see 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.840
 that there is no lignin at all 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.239
 it's just cellulose and the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.769
 cellulose cellulose its excellent is going 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.420
 put that intervene purpose because the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.670
 cellulose case like a sponge to itself 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.200
 water gorging it's going to be to attack 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.599
 by all the soil life of the bacteria 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.769
 can consume solid cellulose 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.239
 full of micro organisms can 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.040
 consume cellulose while the 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.060
 lignin except mushrooms are no 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.980
 big world that can attack him 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.380
 so it's really these woods that are going 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.360
 We are interested in extremely light 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.470
 extremely friable that's it I you 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.310
 advise to put inside a 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.900
 fight there so we see a champion and a 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.489
 piece of wood that was broken down by the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.650
 mushrooms and we see that once he 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.900
 was attacked by the mushrooms ben that 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.070
 can be either a very good one a very 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.720
 good hiding place for all the life of the soil 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.170
 the cd provided for example but there can 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.209
 to have a quantity of life from the bed jump 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.569
 of living in a wood of compounds by the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.250
 mushrooms 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 when we say we need wood 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.859
 old beware of the woods 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.150
 floated for example I told you that 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.530
 I recovered from the good edge of the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.940
 river but the driftwood dances and the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.680
 wood that was lower than the river 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.480
 who had no contact with the air the 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.150
 mushrooms could not grow and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.319
 it became a very very hard box 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.060
 those voices that are about reducing the woods 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.500
 floated on the disadvantage also in 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.090
 the same time the goals 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.790
 and then that's all for this 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.409
 video so I hope it was clear 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.629
 and then here you are, see you soon 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.629
 for a next video thank you
