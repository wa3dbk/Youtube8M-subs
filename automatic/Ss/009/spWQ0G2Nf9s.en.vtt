00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
so let's take a look at one just the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.410 
so let's take a look at one just the
front<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> package<00:00:34.280> some<00:00:35.280> information

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.970 

more<00:00:39.420> information<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:40.200> you're<00:00:40.350> interested<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
more information if you're interested to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.610 
more information if you're interested to
read<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.850> also<00:00:42.000> had<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.660> types<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
read they also had some other types I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.240 
read they also had some other types I
have<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.550> auto<00:00:44.850> off<00:00:45.270> version<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
have an auto off version of this but the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.729 
have an auto off version of this but the
base<00:00:47.489> fell<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.329> bulb<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.620> or

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
base fell off the bulb so it's more or

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.910 
base fell off the bulb so it's more or
less<00:00:49.800> useless<00:00:53.539> back<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> package<00:00:56.690> and

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
less useless back of the package and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
less useless back of the package and
another<00:00:58.920> side<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:02.390> let's<00:01:03.390> take<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> look<00:01:03.899> at

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
another side so let's take a look at

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.820 
another side so let's take a look at
this<00:01:04.260> bulb<00:01:05.689> like<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.840> said<00:01:07.049> these<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.439> the

there's 100 there 7d there's 4d and
there's<00:01:57.960> 20<00:01:58.969> how<00:01:59.969> does<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.329> work<00:02:00.600> well<00:02:01.409> on

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
there's 20 how does this work well on

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.929 
there's 20 how does this work well on
the<00:02:01.649> bottom<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.100> each<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:02.520> bulbs

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the bottom of each of these bulbs

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.249 
the bottom of each of these bulbs
there's<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.990> little<00:02:04.320> microchip<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:06.079> you<00:02:07.079> can

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
there's a little microchip as you can

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.559 
there's a little microchip as you can
see<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:10.400> controls<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.640> current<00:02:11.879> going

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
see and that controls the current going

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.500 
see and that controls the current going
into<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.140> ball

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
into the ball

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.350 
into the ball
so<00:02:15.510> we'll<00:02:16.200> do<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.379> one<00:02:16.620> more<00:02:16.680> time<00:02:16.830> here<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.519> go
