00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
which meant the four-wheel drive Audi

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.130 
which meant the four-wheel drive Audi
had<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.860> massive<00:03:26.280> advantage<00:03:26.790> off<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.570> line

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
the early up to 90 in fact it was a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:48.510 
the early up to 90 in fact it was a
little<00:03:37.500> bit<00:03:37.920> quicker

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.800 

once<00:03:49.520> again<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:49.820> was<00:03:49.850> wet<00:03:50.180> when<00:03:50.330> we<00:03:50.480> filmer

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
forward in the m6

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.860 
forward in the m6
going<00:03:52.550> through<00:03:52.760> our<00:03:52.850> favorite<00:03:53.300> corner<00:03:53.720> the

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
going through our favorite corner the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.290 
going through our favorite corner the
test<00:03:54.110> track<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:55.010> as<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.370> can<00:03:55.490> see<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.730> m6<00:03:56.120> was

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
test track and as you can see the m6 was

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.150 
test track and as you can see the m6 was
all<00:03:56.450> over<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:56.990> place<00:03:57.110> whilst<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.680> Ford<00:03:57.950> just

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
all over the place whilst the Ford just

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.000 
all over the place whilst the Ford just
basically<00:03:58.760> drove<00:03:58.970> through<00:03:59.270> with<00:03:59.420> no<00:03:59.540> problems

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
basically drove through with no problems

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.010 
basically drove through with no problems
even<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.610> lack<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:01.880> inertia<00:04:02.360> in<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.720> Ford

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
even so the lack of inertia in the Ford

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.430 
even so the lack of inertia in the Ford
was<00:04:03.440> very<00:04:03.830> obvious<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.460> beside<00:04:05.210> it<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.960> m6

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
was very obvious and beside it the m6

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.710 
was very obvious and beside it the m6
felt<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:06.800> a<00:04:06.830> bit<00:04:07.010> of<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.160> tank<00:04:07.510> although<00:04:08.510> it

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
felt like a bit of a tank although it

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.540 
felt like a bit of a tank although it
did<00:04:09.020> provide<00:04:09.500> us<00:04:09.560> with<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:10.010> perfect

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
did provide us with the perfect

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.130 
did provide us with the perfect
opportunity<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.210> do<00:04:11.540> some<00:04:11.750> gratuitous

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
opportunity to do some gratuitous

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.870 

and<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.769> was<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:19.949> same<00:04:20.160> when<00:04:20.340> we<00:04:20.400> compared<00:04:20.789> the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
and it was the same when we compared the
