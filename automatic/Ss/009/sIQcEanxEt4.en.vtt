 santandereanos through is important 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.269
 program if we say that's what I'm 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.829
 Looking in Santander not only the 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.210
 unity of the liberal party but the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.400
 unity of all and all 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.800
 santandereanos around a proposal 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.800
 and even inclusive santander and even 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.930
 Santander that wants to recover the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.050
 greatness of our department you 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.390
 I said in the speech yesterday 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.550
 upon receiving the endorsement he said that I want 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.350
 tell them that I have always been liberal 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.460
 Many people identify me that I have not been 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.560
 liberal wants to clarify that is not that 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.500
 we ever heard and read about 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.130
 comments where they said that where here 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.840
 I was liberal 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 and what we were telling him yesterday is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.979
 I since the early 90s I 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.020
 I was with the new liberalism that 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.090
 Dr. Carlos Sherry 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.770
 crossbowmen accompanied the campaigns 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.530
 Presidents of Dr. Horacio Serpa 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.210
 in the liberal party and that I joined the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.509
 departmental administration in the year 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.840
 2004 as a share of that political agreement 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.759
 of the new liberalism is then with the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.700
 colonel aguilar and how is the result 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.289
 I arrived at the departmental government 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.610
 many have said says today I do twist 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.770
 for you supporting now to deal and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.899
 it turns out that he was his container for the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.450
 governorship of Santander in another era and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.640
 you hard against diaz now it's good 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.619
 you were affected by the doctor 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.619
 be with that campaign never never to 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.200
 contrary what I also stated in the 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.909
 yesterday is that what he showed us 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.280
 that big debate is that you can do a 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.099
 debate with ideas and also what we 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.049
 makes great in public life the 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.360
 parties to which we integrate the 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.370
 political parties is the union the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.140
 true greatness is that is the union and 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.780
 is what we have shown because here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
 we do not want to talk about campaigns 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.189
 partisan campaigns 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.900
 these campaigns around a name if 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.760
 we do not want to talk about a campaign in 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.349
 around the development and progress of 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.629

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.709
 as agent of the department and good 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.230
 the current governor has also complied 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.120
 an important role in the development and 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.159

 parties will accompany him and that in 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.840

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.480
 formal authorization also to invite 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.640

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.659
 santandereanos that the doctor serpa well 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.209
 he stated that the candidacy of 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.129
 pour summer was born from an agreement n 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.409
 a political decision that the candidacy 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.120
 of fun you will see is born to collect the 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.379
 sentiment and the will of this 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.450
 santandereanas of these beloved 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.549
 Santandereans who believe in living tavera 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.260
 and that's why the liberal party says let's 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.610
 to trust in the will of the 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
 santandereanos let's pick up that 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.019
 Santandereans feeling and for 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.510
 that they made that decision to say 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.790
 let's unite around living and the task that 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.620
 should develop from now on is to call 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.329

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.769
 our proposal to invite them to 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.049

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.060
 is to call the party citizen option to 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.849

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.870
