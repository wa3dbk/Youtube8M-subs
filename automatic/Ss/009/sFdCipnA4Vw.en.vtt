have<00:01:49.000> hair<00:01:49.440> this<00:01:50.440> is<00:01:50.650> rounded<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.300> most

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
have hair this is rounded and the most

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.570 
have hair this is rounded and the most
important<00:01:53.170> thing<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.410> is<00:01:53.590> flexible<00:01:54.130> okay

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
important thing this is flexible okay

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.330 
important thing this is flexible okay
and<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.630> how<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.290> works<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.950> put<00:01:57.250> the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
and so how it works is that you put the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.900 
and so how it works is that you put the
hair<00:01:57.580> in<00:01:57.759> here<00:01:58.860> there's<00:01:59.860> some<00:02:00.040> notches<00:02:00.430> there

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
hair in here there's some notches there

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.820 
hair in here there's some notches there
and<00:02:01.180> based<00:02:01.420> on<00:02:01.570> how<00:02:01.750> much<00:02:01.899> hair<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.380> there<00:02:02.500> you

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
and based on how much hair and there you

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.310 
and based on how much hair and there you
can<00:02:02.860> cause<00:02:03.190> tension<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.479> conforms<00:02:05.110> and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
can cause tension and it conforms and

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.400 
can cause tension and it conforms and
