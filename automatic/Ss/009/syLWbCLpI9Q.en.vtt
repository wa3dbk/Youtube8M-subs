00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
it's not an an ideal place to live where

it's not an an ideal place to live where
people<00:03:34.489> could<00:03:34.790> just<00:03:34.910> live<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.269> without

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
people could just live there without

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.890 
people could just live there without

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
working and it's you know really nice so

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.710 
working and it's you know really nice so
it<00:03:39.500> makes<00:03:39.769> sense<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.790> think<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.569> bottom

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
it makes sense and I think the bottom

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.439 
it makes sense and I think the bottom
line<00:03:41.930> about<00:03:42.349> this<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.769> if<00:03:43.280> you're<00:03:43.819> actually<00:03:44.419> a

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
line about this is if you're actually a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.479 
line about this is if you're actually a
fiscal<00:03:44.989> conservative<00:03:45.199> so<00:03:46.129> if<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.280> actually

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
fiscal conservative so if you actually

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.559 
fiscal conservative so if you actually
care<00:03:47.060> about<00:03:47.949> reducing<00:03:48.949> debt<00:03:49.549> lowering<00:03:50.209> the

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
care about reducing debt lowering the

care about reducing debt lowering the
deficit<00:03:51.169> um<00:03:51.940> not<00:03:52.940> not<00:03:53.720> spending<00:03:54.500> money<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.949> the

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
that they get incensed at the idea of

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
play well even if that is what you

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.449 
play well even if that is what you
believe<00:04:10.730> then<00:04:11.419> you<00:04:11.569> should<00:04:11.810> just<00:04:11.900> flat-out

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
believe then you should just flat-out

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
100% be in favor of this because this is

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.949

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
less I know it's counterintuitive but

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.830

result of that show that you'll actually

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.630 
result of that show that you'll actually
save<00:04:32.780> money<00:04:33.020> if<00:04:33.260> we<00:04:33.440> just<00:04:33.470> fund<00:04:34.160> these<00:04:34.310> tiny

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
worked and it's a reasonable idea

worked and it's a reasonable idea
I<00:04:53.180> can<00:04:53.900> change<00:04:54.080> my<00:04:54.200> position<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:54.980> this<00:04:55.760> right

I can change my position and this right

I can change my position and this right
here<00:04:56.120> swung<00:04:56.480> me<00:04:56.660> from<00:04:56.960> I<00:04:57.290> didn't<00:04:58.160> really<00:04:58.340> have

here swung me from I didn't really have

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.180 
here swung me from I didn't really have
a<00:04:58.550> position<00:04:58.820> on<00:04:59.210> how<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.860> approach<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.040> issue

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
a position on how to approach the issue

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.830 
a position on how to approach the issue
of<00:05:01.400> homelessness<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:02.090> mean<00:05:02.240> I'm<00:05:02.330> obviously<00:05:02.750> in

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
of homelessness I mean I'm obviously in

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.720 
of homelessness I mean I'm obviously in
favor<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:03.200> social<00:05:03.380> safety<00:05:03.650> nets<00:05:04.010> and<00:05:04.250> I'm

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
favor of social safety nets and I'm

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.180 
favor of social safety nets and I'm
obviously<00:05:05.000> in<00:05:05.390> favor<00:05:05.600> of<00:05:05.810> things<00:05:06.050> like<00:05:06.260> food

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
obviously in favor of things like food

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.840 
obviously in favor of things like food
stamps<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:07.790> Welfare<00:05:08.080> but<00:05:09.080> this<00:05:09.980> this<00:05:10.340> idea

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
stamps and Welfare but this this idea

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.330 
stamps and Welfare but this this idea
right<00:05:11.120> here<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:11.540> think<00:05:11.900> is<00:05:12.050> even<00:05:12.530> better<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.010> we

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
right here I think is even better and we

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.620 
right here I think is even better and we
should<00:05:13.370> probably<00:05:13.670> try<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.000> implement<00:05:14.450> this

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
should probably try to implement this

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.140 
should probably try to implement this
not<00:05:15.620> just<00:05:15.800> on<00:05:15.980> a<00:05:16.040> state<00:05:16.310> level<00:05:16.460> not<00:05:16.790> just<00:05:16.970> at<00:05:17.090> a

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
not just on a state level not just at a

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.760 
not just on a state level not just at a
local<00:05:17.510> level<00:05:17.630> but<00:05:17.810> probably<00:05:18.230> on<00:05:18.350> a<00:05:18.410> federal

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
local level but probably on a federal

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.460 
local level but probably on a federal
level<00:05:18.890> as<00:05:19.280> well
