00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
you ask me the first one is this not a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.750 
you ask me the first one is this not a
little<00:00:33.989> setup<00:00:34.199> with<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> piston<00:00:34.949> and<00:00:35.129> glowstone

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
little setup with a piston and glowstone

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
here and then have the glowstone and
you'll<00:00:44.550> need<00:00:44.699> an<00:00:44.820> upside-down<00:00:45.179> piston<00:00:45.749> to<00:00:45.839> get

the upside down piston you'll have to
set<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> block<00:00:47.640> back<00:00:48.179> here<00:00:48.449> like<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.320> then

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
set a block back here like so and then

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.829 
set a block back here like so and then
place<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.309> pit<00:00:50.609> place<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> piston<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.749> and

then you can go ahead and get rid of the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.829 
then you can go ahead and get rid of the
block<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.760> won't<00:00:53.909> need<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.089> for<00:00:54.239> anything<00:00:54.390> and

some redstone so what's your lose you
just<00:00:58.320> walk<00:00:58.679> straight<00:00:59.010> down<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.300> this

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
just walk straight down here like this

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.009 
just walk straight down here like this
also<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.710> used<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.640> potion<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.239> night

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019

vision<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.860> that's<00:01:05.009> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> just

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
vision and that's going to make it just

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
vision and that's going to make it just
a<00:01:05.759> lot<00:01:05.970> cooler<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.110> we'll<00:01:07.290> go<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> underneath

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
a lot cooler so we'll go to underneath

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.069 
a lot cooler so we'll go to underneath
here<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.549> enough<00:01:09.149> that<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.689> still<00:01:09.899> get

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
here just enough that we can still get

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.410 
here just enough that we can still get
the<00:01:10.259> lever<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.009> we'll<00:01:11.369> hit<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the lever and we'll hit it and now the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.730 
the lever and we'll hit it and now the
glow<00:01:12.630> stones<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:12.990> her<00:01:13.079> head<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.619> can

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
glow stones on her head and as you can

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.920 
glow stones on her head and as you can
see<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.070> turn<00:01:14.340> around<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.149> can<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
see we can turn around and we can see so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.080 
see we can turn around and we can see so
much<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.469> see<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.710> entire<00:01:16.979> cave<00:01:17.460> system

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
much you can see this entire cave system

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
much you can see this entire cave system
that's<00:01:18.960> underneath<00:01:19.290> us<00:01:19.619> as<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.860> tell

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
that's underneath us as you can tell

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.850 
that's underneath us as you can tell
there's<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.369> pretty<00:01:20.790> complex<00:01:21.619> system<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.740> we

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
there's a pretty complex system here we

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
there's a pretty complex system here we
can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.100> there's<00:01:23.310> an<00:01:23.399> abandoned<00:01:23.969> mine<00:01:24.180> shaft

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can see there's an abandoned mine shaft

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.679 
can see there's an abandoned mine shaft
over<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:26.070> kinds<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> stuff<00:01:26.969> and<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
over there all kinds of stuff and it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.819 
over there all kinds of stuff and it
just<00:01:27.750> makes<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.110> really<00:01:28.290> cool<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
just makes it really cool because you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.730 
just makes it really cool because you
can<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:29.850> you're<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.680> anyway<00:01:31.680> so

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
can see what you're going for anyway so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.050 
can see what you're going for anyway so
that's<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.189> way<00:01:32.219> to<00:01:32.399> do<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.820> we're<00:01:32.969> going

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that's one way to do it but we're going

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.340 
that's one way to do it but we're going
to<00:01:33.149> break<00:01:33.329> out<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:33.960> check<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to break out here and go check out the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.959 
to break out here and go check out the
other<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:34.740> alright<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.520> other<00:01:35.640> way<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> do

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
other way alright so the other way to do

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.520 
other way alright so the other way to do
it<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:36.930> easier<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.439> you're

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
it is actually a lot easier what you're

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.840 
it is actually a lot easier what you're
going<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.710> need<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.920> some<00:01:38.070> glow<00:01:38.250> stone<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
going to need is some glow stone and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
to do it a couple times but if you do it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.880

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
now I am underneath and I can

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.740 
now I am underneath and I can
look<00:02:02.040> around<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.520> still<00:02:02.790> see<00:02:03.000> same<00:02:03.540> cave

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
look around and still see same cave

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.050 
look around and still see same cave
system<00:02:04.260> I<00:02:04.470> just<00:02:05.010> all<00:02:05.220> over<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.640> again<00:02:05.850> this

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
system I just all over and again this

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.490 
system I just all over and again this
one's<00:02:06.300> lit<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.660> more<00:02:06.840> normally<00:02:07.230> it'll<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.470> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
one's lit up more normally it'll be a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.190 
one's lit up more normally it'll be a
lot<00:02:07.650> darker<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.220> make<00:02:08.580> sure<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.790> have<00:02:08.910> a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
lot darker so make sure you have a

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.390 
lot darker so make sure you have a
splash<00:02:10.200> potion<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.860> night<00:02:11.040> vision

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
splash potion of the night vision

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
splash potion of the night vision
because<00:02:11.640> that'll<00:02:11.850> let<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.090> see<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.020> much

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
because that'll let you see just so much

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.260 
because that'll let you see just so much
more<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.490> other<00:02:14.640> good<00:02:14.790> thing<00:02:14.850> about<00:02:14.970> this

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
more so the other good thing about this

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.210 
more so the other good thing about this
one<00:02:15.480> compared<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.080> piston<00:02:16.440> one<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.040> can

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
one compared to the piston one is I can

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.150 
one compared to the piston one is I can
go<00:02:17.250> down<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> lot<00:02:18.060> more<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.930> go<00:02:19.080> to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
go down a lot more like I can go to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.250 
go down a lot more like I can go to
let's<00:02:20.160> say<00:02:20.430> pretty<00:02:20.970> far<00:02:21.210> down<00:02:21.420> right<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
let's say pretty far down right here and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.630 
let's say pretty far down right here and
I<00:02:22.860> can<00:02:23.160> place<00:02:24.120> only<00:02:24.840> two<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.800> place<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.400> write

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
I can place only two so place to write

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.730 
I can place only two so place to write
like<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.240> do<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.720> again<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.440> I'm<00:02:28.680> a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
like that and do it again now that I'm a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.010 
like that and do it again now that I'm a
little<00:02:28.980> bit<00:02:29.100> lower<00:02:29.510> as<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.570> can<00:02:30.780> see<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> can

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
little bit lower as you can see I can

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.900 
little bit lower as you can see I can
see<00:02:31.440> more<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.040> grass<00:02:32.310> looks<00:02:32.610> kind<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.850> weird

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
see more the grass looks kind of weird

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.700 
see more the grass looks kind of weird
but<00:02:33.570> now<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.840> I'm<00:02:33.930> lower<00:02:34.110> all<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.380> potions

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
but now that I'm lower all the potions

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.730 
but now that I'm lower all the potions
won't<00:02:35.070> off<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.430> let's<00:02:35.820> take<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.090> again<00:02:36.740> now

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
won't off so let's take it again now

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.020 
won't off so let's take it again now
that<00:02:37.770> I'm<00:02:37.980> lower<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.490> see<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> little<00:02:38.910> bit

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that I'm lower I can see a little bit

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.850 
that I'm lower I can see a little bit
better<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.450> what<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.720> wanted<00:02:40.050> now<00:02:40.470> when<00:02:40.590> i<00:02:40.620> move

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
better of what I wanted now when i move

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.230 
better of what I wanted now when i move
it<00:02:41.070> kind<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.280> throws<00:02:41.520> me<00:02:41.730> out<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.210> you

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
it kind of throws me out of it so you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.000 
it kind of throws me out of it so you
got<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.540> careful<00:02:43.020> just<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.740> look<00:02:43.890> around

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
got to be careful just to look around

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.130 
got to be careful just to look around
and<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.430> move<00:02:44.670> too<00:02:44.940> much<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.110> go

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and that move too much but there you go

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.660 
and that move too much but there you go
you<00:02:46.320> can<00:02:46.500> see<00:02:46.650> cave<00:02:46.890> system<00:02:47.220> here's<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.520> one

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
you can see cave system here's the one

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.480 
you can see cave system here's the one
that's<00:02:47.850> literally<00:02:48.360> right<00:02:48.660> next<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.050> us<00:02:49.080> as<00:02:50.070> you

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
that's literally right next to us as you

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.510 
that's literally right next to us as you
can<00:02:50.580> see<00:02:50.820> right<00:02:51.410> here<00:02:52.410> somewhere<00:02:52.830> where<00:02:53.310> are

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
can see right here somewhere where are

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.000 
can see right here somewhere where are
you<00:02:53.670> oh<00:02:53.880> there<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.740> can<00:02:55.860> see

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you oh there it is so as you can see

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.300 
you oh there it is so as you can see
pretty<00:02:56.430> cool<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.330> just<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> say<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.530> think

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
pretty cool I just have to say I think

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.680 
pretty cool I just have to say I think
it's<00:02:59.430> pretty<00:02:59.610> awesome<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.060> again<00:03:00.540> those<00:03:00.630> are

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it's pretty awesome so again those are

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.660 
it's pretty awesome so again those are
the<00:03:00.870> two<00:03:01.050> ways<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.320> do<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.490> there's

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the two ways to do it I think there's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.760 
the two ways to do it I think there's
another<00:03:03.030> way<00:03:03.390> basically<00:03:03.990> they<00:03:04.230> all<00:03:04.350> involve

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
another way basically they all involve

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.040 
another way basically they all involve
glowstone<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.700> no<00:03:06.120> matter<00:03:06.300> how<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.600> do<00:03:06.900> it

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
glowstone and no matter how you do it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.229 
glowstone and no matter how you do it
they<00:03:07.200> all<00:03:07.350> work<00:03:07.590> pretty<00:03:07.890> well<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.550> with<00:03:09.090> that

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
they all work pretty well so with that

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.729 
they all work pretty well so with that
said<00:03:09.480> thanks<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:09.930> much<00:03:10.170> for<00:03:10.380> watching<00:03:10.410> this
