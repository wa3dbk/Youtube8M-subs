00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
stuff like summer on smash is just he

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.400 
stuff like summer on smash is just he
could<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.120> done<00:00:42.270> without<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
could have done without that that that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
could have done without that that that
guy<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> guy<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.120> produced<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
guy I think the guy that produced it is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.270 
guy I think the guy that produced it is
the<00:00:45.899> guy<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.020> wrapped<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.100> dude

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the guy that wrapped on it and the dude

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.970 
the guy that wrapped on it and the dude
should<00:00:47.640> stick<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.030> producing<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:48.770> he<00:00:49.770> can

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
should stick to producing because he can

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.939 
should stick to producing because he can
trap<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.399> anything<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.559> rest<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
