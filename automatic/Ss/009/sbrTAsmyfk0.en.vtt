00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
how to create a how to make a block

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.660 
how to create a how to make a block
transparent<00:00:19.410> um<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> make<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
transparent um so I just want to make a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.480 
transparent um so I just want to make a
quick<00:00:23.910> side<00:00:24.269> note<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.890> know<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.189> said<00:00:26.460> that

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
quick side note here I know I said that

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.910 
quick side note here I know I said that
I<00:00:26.730> would<00:00:26.849> most<00:00:27.420> likely<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> tree<00:00:28.410> tutorial

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
I would most likely do a tree tutorial

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.049 
I would most likely do a tree tutorial
soon<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.689> well<00:00:31.619> next<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
soon and I'm well next and I'm going to

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.600 
soon and I'm well next and I'm going to
get<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.329> out<00:00:33.510> very<00:00:34.050> soon<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.739> that's<00:00:35.280> going

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
get that out very soon but that's going

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.400 
get that out very soon but that's going
to<00:00:35.700> take<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.270> little<00:00:36.540> while<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.140> me<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
to take a little while for me to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.220 
to take a little while for me to
actually<00:00:37.559> make<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.190> figured<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.670> would<00:00:38.820> make

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
actually make and I figured I would make

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.869 
actually make and I figured I would make
um<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:41.090> tutorial<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:43.440> pretty<00:00:44.399> short<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
um a tutorial that was pretty short and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.840 
um a tutorial that was pretty short and
useful<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.980> might<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.250> well<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.640> done

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
useful and I might as well get that done

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.069 
useful and I might as well get that done
so<00:00:48.629> anyway<00:00:49.530> um<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:51.180> tutorial

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so anyway um this is this tutorial

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
so anyway um this is this tutorial
assumes<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.649> you've<00:00:52.800> already<00:00:53.070> created<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
assumes that you've already created a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.110 
assumes that you've already created a
basic<00:00:54.449> block<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:54.989> know<00:00:55.199> how<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.860> that

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
basic block and you know how to do that

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.849 
basic block and you know how to do that
and<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> create<00:00:58.289> textures

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and that you know how to create textures

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.029 
and that you know how to create textures
but<00:00:59.789> I've<00:01:00.449> already<00:01:00.750> gone<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.590> created

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
but I've already gone in and created

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.000 
but I've already gone in and created
some<00:01:02.070> well<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.120> texture<00:01:03.840> pay<00:01:04.379> no<00:01:04.530> attention<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
some well a texture pay no attention to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.890 
some well a texture pay no attention to
this<00:01:05.339> stuff<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> upcoming<00:01:06.600> tree

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
this stuff this is for the upcoming tree

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.149 
this stuff this is for the upcoming tree
tutorial<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.020> our<00:01:10.229> new<00:01:10.530> texture

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
tutorial the this is our new texture

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
tutorial the this is our new texture
it's<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:13.590> bad<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.000> works

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's really really bad but it works

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920 
it's really really bad but it works
basically<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.930> transparent

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
basically I just have a transparent

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.469 
basically I just have a transparent
block<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.090> how<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.270> do

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
block so if you don't know how to do

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.050 
block so if you don't know how to do
that<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.780> GIMP<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:23.340> easy<00:01:23.460> just

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that in GIMP it really really easy just

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.740 
that in GIMP it really really easy just
google<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.840> um<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.540> little

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
google it um and then I have little

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.770 
google it um and then I have little
outline<00:01:29.270> with<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.630> turquoise<00:01:31.409> color<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.780> I've

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
outline with the turquoise color so I've

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.910 
outline with the turquoise color so I've
already<00:01:34.110> gone<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> set<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.799> texture<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
already gone in and set the texture of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.429 
already gone in and set the texture of
the<00:01:38.579> block<00:01:39.150> tutorial<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:40.189> 25<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.579> that

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
the block tutorial or 25 which is that

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.100 
the block tutorial or 25 which is that
texture<00:01:43.439> index<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.390> all<00:01:45.390> we're<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
texture index and all we're going to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.569 
texture index and all we're going to
need<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.950> make<00:01:49.159> actually<00:01:50.159> I'm<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
need to do to make actually I'm going to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
need to do to make actually I'm going to
delete<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.000> method<00:01:51.509> because<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:51.960> going

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
delete this method because that's going

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
delete this method because that's going
to<00:01:52.290> mess<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:53.509> all<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.810> need<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.920> make

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to mess it up all we need to do to make

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.060 
to mess it up all we need to do to make
the<00:01:57.360> block<00:01:59.390> transparent<00:02:00.530> using<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.619> texture

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the block transparent using that texture

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.730 
the block transparent using that texture
is<00:02:02.360> we<00:02:03.360> want<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.659> say<00:02:04.100> public<00:02:05.100> boolean<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
is we want to say public boolean is

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.730 
is we want to say public boolean is
opaque<00:02:09.020> cube

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
opaque cube

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.680 
opaque cube
and<00:02:12.150> we're<00:02:13.150> going<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.420> return<00:02:13.840> false<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.690> what

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
and we're going to return false and what

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.370 
and we're going to return false and what
this<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.020> going<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.320> do<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.770> um<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:19.380> twofold

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
this is going to do is um it's twofold

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.010 
this is going to do is um it's twofold
it<00:02:20.680> required<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.820> make<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.300> transparent

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
little bit self-explanatory basically

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
since it's transparent it is no longer

in<00:03:12.460> normal<00:03:12.790> block<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.240> we<00:03:13.510> have<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.750> tell<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.320 
in normal block and we have to tell the
game<00:03:14.200> then<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.280> needs<00:03:15.430> special<00:03:15.910> rendering

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
game then it needs special rendering

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.530 
game then it needs special rendering
code<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.620> if<00:03:17.860> we<00:03:17.890> run<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.280> game<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:22.180> let<00:03:22.420> it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
code so if we run the game and we let it

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.600 
code so if we run the game and we let it
load

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.660 

if<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:29.880> go<00:03:30.000> into<00:03:30.120> single<00:03:30.450> player<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:31.470> have<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.400> lot

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
if we go into single player I have a lot

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.180 
if we go into single player I have a lot
of<00:03:32.700> new<00:03:33.150> world<00:03:33.360> because<00:03:33.900> i'm<00:03:34.050> too<00:03:34.530> lazy<00:03:34.740> to

name stuff here's our new biome if we go

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.190 
name stuff here's our new biome if we go
down<00:03:41.910> you'll<00:03:42.420> see<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.750> we<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:42.900> our

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
down you'll see that we have our

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.050 
down you'll see that we have our
tutorial<00:03:43.770> or<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.130> if<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.240> place<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.660> down<00:03:45.990> it

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
tutorial or and if we place this down it

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.200 
tutorial or and if we place this down it
functions<00:03:48.060> as<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.800> normal<00:03:50.370> block<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:50.940> it's

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
functions as the normal block but it's

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.580 
functions as the normal block but it's
completely<00:03:51.510> um<00:03:54.350> I'm<00:03:55.350> trapped<00:03:56.420> it's

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
completely um I'm trapped it's

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.460 
completely um I'm trapped it's
completely<00:03:58.590> transparent<00:03:58.950> as<00:03:59.930> it<00:04:00.930> should<00:04:01.320> be

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
completely transparent as it should be

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.370 
completely transparent as it should be
now<00:04:02.040> you'll<00:04:02.430> also<00:04:02.640> note<00:04:03.260> something<00:04:04.260> I'm

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
now you'll also note something I'm

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.250 
now you'll also note something I'm
noticing<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.459> side<00:04:05.990> seems<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.140> be

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
noticing is that the side seems to be

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.000 
noticing is that the side seems to be
transparent<00:04:07.860> but<00:04:08.160> if<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.610> put<00:04:09.390> down<00:04:09.570> glass

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
transparent but if we put down glass

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.229 
transparent but if we put down glass
you'll<00:04:11.010> see<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.400> that's<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.820> case<00:04:11.850> also

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
you'll see that that's the case also

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.630 
you'll see that that's the case also
with<00:04:12.510> glass<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.410> it's<00:04:13.709> not<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.920> glitch<00:04:14.310> with<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
with glass so it's not a glitch with the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.800 
with glass so it's not a glitch with the
code<00:04:15.000> that's<00:04:15.989> just<00:04:16.260> how<00:04:16.530> minecraft<00:04:17.100> handers

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
code that's just how minecraft handers

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.349 
code that's just how minecraft handers
handers<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:19.260> hinders<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.980> that's<00:04:20.820> how<00:04:21.000> the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
handers it hinders it that's how the

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.150 
handers it hinders it that's how the
game<00:04:21.480> hand<00:04:21.810> handles<00:04:22.550> rendering<00:04:24.830> so<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.890> can

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
game hand handles rendering so you can

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.040 
game hand handles rendering so you can
see<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:28.440> looks<00:04:28.680> pretty<00:04:29.100> decent<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.600> that's

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
see it looks pretty decent so that's

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.590 
see it looks pretty decent so that's
going<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.530> be<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.830> for<00:04:31.860> this<00:04:32.160> tutorial<00:04:32.340> um<00:04:32.850> I've
