00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hey guys here for the 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.429
 notebooksbilliger.de blog and have here 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.380
 we like the new lenovo yoga tablet eight 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.740
 the name already betrays an 8 inch 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.630
 tablet runs on itroid and I want 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.680
 now first the technical data 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.199
 present 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.850
 So here the display ago 8 should like 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.199
 said an ips display with a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:31.140
 resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels from here 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:34.010
 16 megapixel camera and under the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.410
 display then also two speakers 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.340
 and before we turn it over 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.899
 you see here that it is quite a 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.579
 special tablet that looks 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.590
 not like any other 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.739
 we have here once here 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.410
 this round something 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.960
 and then it's too narrow here could 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 Remember keyboard from a manufacturer 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.730
 I do not know, I have that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.559
 Of course, it looks and has to be similar 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.059
 say this gets the tablet 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.620
 if we put it down already one 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.570
 right angle which we already quite good 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.610
 but here are also 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.600
 another stand 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.220
 this will make the angle even bigger 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.220
 which is nice if you are 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.290
 do a little something on the way 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.030
 Wanted to watch her movie then 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.710
 we can put the tab down like that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.420
 which is cool, of course 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.580
 is just the right angle for it 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.740
 here under the flap the aluminum 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.710
 we have in micro sd card reader 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.040
 and not in this model now 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.369
 but there is also a model with 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.930
 a sim card slot on the back 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.320
 we also have a 5 megapixel 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.780
 Camera you briefly around the device around 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.670
 there we have in micro usb port for 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.490
 charge and sync and one 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 power button and on the other side 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.009
 a headphone jack as well here 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.119
 still the volume key and a 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.649
 integrated microphone must say 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.350
 that feels really good too 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.850
 this is just here that it is pointed here 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.009
 actually only the display is to be 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 It is super easy on this page 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.730
 The focus here is on the left 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.260
 side there where it stops and thereby leaves 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.420
 that's it 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.640
 I also think it's a lot better 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.909
 Of course it does not matter what it is called here 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.680
 closer to the lacks just fine and it 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.510
 also adds a 10 inch version 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.930
 the whole, of course, even better 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.860
 made the way 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:36.319
 should i have a short anroid 4.2 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.500
 jelly bean then go 802.11 bgn and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.720
 bluetooth 4.0 and as processor one 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.200
 mtk 81 25 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.840
 with 1.2 ghz is also also a 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.640
 quad-core processor so players 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.579
 Applications should not be a problem 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.680
 if one gigabyte of memory and 16 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.060
 GB memory for the users if you can 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.220
 we do not have enough on the back 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.970
 yes this micro SD card slot not around 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.970
 to expand with you 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.450
 super fast I like it all 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.989
 Unfortunately still have not get back 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.769
 play and set that I do it once 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.299
 if we have wlan so many 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.609
 Thanks for watching this is the new one 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:25.150
 Lenovo Yoga Tablet 8 1 8 inch Android 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.900
 tablet with exceptional shape 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.900
