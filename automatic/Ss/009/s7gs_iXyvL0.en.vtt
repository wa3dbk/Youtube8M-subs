Smith<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.160> Colorado<00:00:35.580> I<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:35.970> also<00:00:36.450> fits<00:00:36.960> into

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
Smith of Colorado I think also fits into

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
Smith of Colorado I think also fits into
that<00:00:37.260> group<00:00:37.440> talent-wise<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.520> character

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that group talent-wise the character

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
that group talent-wise the character
concerns<00:00:39.060> could<00:00:39.510> push<00:00:39.720> him<00:00:39.810> down<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.990> boards

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
concerns could push him down the boards

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.020 
concerns could push him down the boards

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that may fit into that first round spot

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.920

slides I think Williams could get looks
as<00:00:54.660> safety<00:00:54.990> as<00:00:55.080> well<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.920> another<00:00:56.100> role<00:00:56.370> we

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
as safety as well now another role we

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.610

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
on to the safety position we saw last

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.969 
on to the safety position we saw last
year<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> couple<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.840> guys<00:01:09.990> Eric<00:01:10.439> Berry<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
year a couple of guys Eric Berry and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.499 
year a couple of guys Eric Berry and
Earl<00:01:11.159> Thomas<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.729> went<00:01:11.850> early<00:01:12.179> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> draft

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
Earl Thomas that went early in the draft

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.999 
Earl Thomas that went early in the draft
doesn't<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.380> look<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.649> there's<00:01:13.890> that

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
doesn't really look like there's that

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.620 
doesn't really look like there's that
kind<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.189> talent<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.640> year<00:01:14.700> that's<00:01:15.420> really

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
kind of talent this year that's really

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.569 
kind of talent this year that's really
baronet<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.289> safety<00:01:16.920> position<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.399> think

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
baronet that safety position I think

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.190 
baronet that safety position I think
teams<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> need<00:01:18.149> safeties<00:01:18.600> are<00:01:18.749> just<00:01:18.929> out<00:01:19.079> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
teams that need safeties are just out of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.179

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.380 
range good athletic ability but you know
really<00:01:26.280> doesn't<00:01:26.609> show<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.759> against<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> run

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
really doesn't show up against the run

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.029 
really doesn't show up against the run
could<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.899> corner<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> NFL<00:01:28.649> then<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
could be a corner in the NFL then you

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.010 
could be a corner in the NFL then you
have<00:01:29.130> quit<00:01:29.340> Carter<00:01:29.640> from<00:01:29.759> Oklahoma<00:01:30.479> JK<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
have quit Carter from Oklahoma JK and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.719 
have quit Carter from Oklahoma JK and
Jarrett<00:01:31.259> from<00:01:31.409> Temple<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.859> really<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.249> they

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
Jarrett from Temple I really like they

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.069 
Jarrett from Temple I really like they
could<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:32.999> a<00:01:33.030> salad<00:01:33.359> strong<00:01:33.600> safety<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
could be a salad strong safety in the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.469 
could be a salad strong safety in the
NFL<00:01:34.140> marcus<00:01:34.920> gilchrist<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.609> Clemson<00:01:36.060> who

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
NFL marcus gilchrist at Clemson who

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.389 
NFL marcus gilchrist at Clemson who
likely<00:01:37.020> projects<00:01:37.380> from<00:01:37.530> corner<00:01:37.859> to<00:01:37.890> safety

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
likely projects from corner to safety

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.069 
likely projects from corner to safety
and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:38.759> Josh<00:01:39.179> Thomas<00:01:39.450> from<00:01:39.719> Buffalo<00:01:40.049> i

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and then Josh Thomas from Buffalo i

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.840 
and then Josh Thomas from Buffalo i
think<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.439> getting<00:01:40.679> more<00:01:40.829> looks<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.189> safety<00:01:41.579> at

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
think is getting more looks to safety at

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.370 
think is getting more looks to safety at
the<00:01:41.999> end<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.179> corner<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.929> if<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.079> lump<00:01:43.229> them

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the end the corner so if you lump them

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.690 
the end the corner so if you lump them
all<00:01:43.439> together<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.979> take<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.280> corner<00:01:44.520> backs

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
all together you take your corner backs

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.249 
all together you take your corner backs
and<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.149> safeties<00:01:45.539> obviously<00:01:45.869> safety<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and your safeties obviously safety is a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.660 
and your safeties obviously safety is a
little<00:01:46.469> weak<00:01:46.590> overall<00:01:47.069> load<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.429> give<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
little weak overall load you give the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.209 
little weak overall load you give the
grade<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.780> cornerback<00:01:49.409> class<00:01:49.649> has<00:01:49.950> some

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
grade as the cornerback class has some

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.459 
grade as the cornerback class has some
talent<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.969> the<00:01:51.060> very<00:01:51.240> top<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.659> i<00:01:51.810> think<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
talent at the very top but i think the

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.770 
talent at the very top but i think the
depth<00:01:52.710> falls<00:01:53.039> off<00:01:53.249> fast<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.359> nothing<00:01:54.659> in

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
depth falls off fast and just nothing in

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.149 
depth falls off fast and just nothing in
the<00:01:54.869> safety<00:01:55.079> class<00:01:55.380> i<00:01:55.530> think<00:01:55.679> you<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.829> able<00:01:56.069> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the safety class i think you get able to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370 
the safety class i think you get able to
c<00:01:56.310> minus<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> look<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.959> defensive

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
c minus that as a look at the defensive

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.719 
c minus that as a look at the defensive
backs<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.889> year's<00:01:59.069> draft<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.579> best
