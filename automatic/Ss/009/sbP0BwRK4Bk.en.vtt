 as a selection in the tournament of the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.589

 quite focused on what the cup is 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.910
 d'or or mexico more in the area has always 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.410
 been the rival to beat we do not know the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 commitment that we have 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.550
 of course there are selections that have 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.570
 good level that have improved in the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.850
 last years 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.489
 we do not underestimate anyone even to 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.110
 those of our group are rivals who 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.360
 in previous editions we have 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.150
 complicated there is no easy rival in the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.550
 football and we have to have a lot 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.680
 patience and concentration to win 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.440
 all matches well very well as 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.229
 always them at all times at a hundred and 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.300
 ready to play work always at 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.300
 maximum and prepared for 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.380
 to be able to draw results that now with 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.090
 the choices that I suffered so to speak 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.670
 with the selection and more carlos remove them 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.189
 with great enthusiasm with all the commitment 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.619
 that I 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.069
 to face these tournaments and the truth 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.289
 that very very good for us are 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.579
 aware what we play and what not 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.380
 it's worth something more than winning 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.420
 be in conferaciones cup I think that 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.709
 we did not have that responsibility 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.509
 the plumbers yes but that too 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.189
 have the peace of mind that should be 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.770
 no no no no let's put more pressure 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.569
 ourselves beyond what is 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.069
 say and beyond what you can 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.289
 say we have to keep the 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.450
 calm work hard as we are 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.220
 doing and knowing that if we give the hundred 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.899
 for granted we are going to get 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.599
 objectives before the respectable all type 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.099
 of opinions and in the end everything that 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.720
 says or what I can say what 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.020

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.630
 giant or 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.050

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.750
 zone 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.460

 mexico as a reference if we do not go to 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.430
 put into controversial statements if 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.810
 we are the giant or I are the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.560
