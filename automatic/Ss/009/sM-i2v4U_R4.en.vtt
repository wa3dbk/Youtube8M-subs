00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 I will be an infidelity here we have 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.000
 the solution will be right now I will not 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.040
 I think you love the subject but if you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.530
 is going to be very useful hopefully that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 not at this moment some day there is always 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.160
 What to know in case of fire 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.750
 in case of flood in case of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.850
 infidelity in case you appreciated it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.740
 shoe all the solutions are very 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.199
 useful and that's why we love to give you 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.340
 welcome by hand the theme this topic is 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.330
 complicated above all is a very 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.969
 painful 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.399
 because once you have the certainty of 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.660
 that something is happening with your partner 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.700
 then the world is coming down 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 all the expectations that you had of 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.899
 soon they collapse you feel threaten to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 your life having children in between or not 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 because that future I had studying 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 with that person it seems that I do not know 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 will give or at least the basic element 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.250
 of love that one is joy the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.440
 trust the second element the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.600
 Trust has been hurt by this 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.539
 act of infidelity but but there are in 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.760
 Infidelity is not nothing bad confidence 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.920
 but also respect yes of course 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 It is basic if we have as 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 Agreements 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.660
 a relationship in a relationship not 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.580
 we should promise to make sure you do not 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.100
 I will be unfaithful there are promises and agreements 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.500
 implicit in relationships and this 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.480
 part where we agreed to be together good 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.460
 it's basically about we remember 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.500
 be together like this we're going to be does not come 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.120
 in this implicit agreement that there is a 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 third or up to a quarter in discord 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.290
 not then we want this part of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.920
 respect because there is an implicit agreement 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.229
 in the relationship nothing happens when the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.650
 person realizes that they are being 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.990
 unfaithful 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.960
 the pain part is not and what is it 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.940
 what should he do because finally he 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.710
 feel one as one feels shattered 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.930
 or are bits because all those 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.960
 illusions as you say all these 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.090
 plans but I believe that more is the the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.550
 trust and respect that they had 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.990
 stayed in a compromise and it turns out that 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.880
 that commitment for nothing I send this to a 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.170
 part there is a big solution and what 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.110
 first what to do in this case 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.820
 is talking and talking in the plural 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.009
 it is very important the person who has 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.050
 been deceived feels very hurt and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.480
 immediately it is prey is prepared 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.280
 blame the other why you did not do this 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.290
 how did you dare how is it possible if I 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 I trust in you here the problem of the two 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.849
 it's moments of the two it's about 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.640
 ask him hey we have a problem 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.709
 we have to do with this 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.599
 because I'm being hurt 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.910
 hurt because this we had not 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.519
 agreed and because I would like to know what 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.250
 you think first the first question 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.590
 is you think you are willing to follow 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.870
 after an infidelity maybe first 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.760
 you think not because anger makes you 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.650
 think what but think if you really 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.959
 you want to do it there are ways to power 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.819
 work with this but if you say I do not 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.950
 I'm willing when I'm willing to 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.390
 tolerate not one single then then 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.950
 also do it with the couple delights 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.079
 look, I think we 'll have to talk to 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.519
 make a healthier separation because 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.250
 I am very resentful because I am very 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.680
 come on, I'm very hurt 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.260
 After the questions I asked, I wanted 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.720
 of bad me and you have to have this the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.549
 infidelity is a decision all the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.079
 I think many people believe that it is the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.569
 logical consequence of a bad relationship 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.069
 hey because you put the horn on him because 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.889
 we get along well because they had not 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.660
 good sex because we did not talk today no 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.390
 it is logical is not logical a bad relationship 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.190
 unhappy 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.200
 because of a bad relationship you can 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.630
 talk with the couple you can decide 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.160
 seek professional help the most you can 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.380
 If you want to leave the house without giving 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.840
 no explanation if it was the case very 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.090
 but I do not recommend it either 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.160
 Well, but the point is that it's not 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.110
 logical consequence the infidel decides 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.970
 doing it somehow seems good to you 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.190
 idea may already be for an adventure 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.990
 look for something that did not have or to compensate 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.660
 something that is missing but is 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.030
 deciding a very painful method is a 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.560
 method that very well effective and is a 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.930
 method that will hurt him 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.430
 same the unfaithful to the deceived person and 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.230
 even the person who gets involved 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.820
 in this because in the end this person 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.700
 is living from a relationship that is not 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.530
 We talked about it a while ago, it's like 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.480
 pendant of a little devil of light that 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.920
 they are stealing the light of the other you feel 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.510
 very smart and in the end you just do 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.880
 short and melted fuses 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.739
 to the neighbor and everyone is melted 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.600
 when you do that you can not hang on 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.010
 a relationship that is not yours if you 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.200
 you are the person who is living this 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.109
 but for example you in all these years 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.510
 career you meet a couple who 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.419
 have said to each other I thank you 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.380
 very much your time I do not love you anymore if 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.300
 I want a lot but now 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.770
 I want to be with you and I'm leaving there 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.230
 couples of great maturity who have 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.870
 got yes but you need to work 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.010
 much to be able to have great communication what 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.870
 what happens is that in the couple also 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.150
 we should be able to tell us any 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.650
 thing sometimes happens that as I say how 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
 is going to put her as she is going to put on 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.800
 if I tell him that I do not want to be 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.110
 start making claims and reproaches that 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.670
 I want to avoid but if we open the 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.560
 communication channels is a good 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.050
 idea then I think about inferiority 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.060
 do not blame yourself, you can be the worst 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.150
 partner of the earth so let's think the worst 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.580
 that in the infinity has committed the other 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.460
 and he has decided to do it now not you 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.990
 feel neither obliged forced to 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.820
 to go fumbling in details that are going to 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.190
 hurt because you start the questions 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.710
 where were you where you took it 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.270
 more you were doing for where you were going that end 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.710
 of the week that you were not sure 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.570
 you left too 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.400
 I know you do not want to know because 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.840
 torments with painful details for 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.430
 who wants to be here what you're trying 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.810
 to do is first find out if it's going to 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.960
 forward or not going forward if they are 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.670
 willing and not worth in this of good 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.050
 and we will come back and nothing happened and 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.669
 excuse me 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.830
 and here we are talking about a problem 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.020
 seriously we should forgive a 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.360
 infidelity or I do not think to forgive 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.919
 moment is not the best word first 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.539
 would see what efforts we are going to make 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.370
 what are we going to do together to be able 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.400
 get out of this and seek help 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.319
 specialized we could not think that 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.150
 because we have good will and we 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.310
 we want it to be very valid simply 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.680
 go to the thing to heal remember to be 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.659
 He has lost the trust and confidence 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.490
 it's difficult to restore you're a process 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.319
 of trust and respect then 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.210
 I think I have to talk if we're 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.490
 willing to seek this help and not 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.550
 simply this matter of goodwill 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.009
 and I would say an infidelity of a unique 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.110
 occasion for whatever reason it may be 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.750
 it could be manageable but a 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.719
 repetitive inferiority one of second 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.789
 third or already of this one then once 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.990
 a month, I think it's something that 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.080
 person has as a behavior 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.150
 pathological and already that person should 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.009
 work it on your own is no longer 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.509
 a couple problem because it is no longer 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.129
 it matters that I make the other person 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.870
 will recurrently be looking for something 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.000
 out of the relationship because maybe the most 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.639
 healthy for me to retire and no longer be 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.590
 thinking if they forgive 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.180
 I would not forgive a person who has 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.949
 diabetes for having it simply the 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.050
 It has but he has to seek addressed 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:50.180
 clear now tell me something you know 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:50.180
 faithful men if many of some something 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.360
 Well now it's very difficult with a 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:07:00.389
 couple has already committed this situation 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.599
 infidelity and that you decide you decide 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:06.840
 not that you will forgive but you decide 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:08.039
 Call him give him an opportunity and continue with 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.800
 follow with nothing clear 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:13.379
 we say invest to work them 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.090
 really really works after or 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:17.569
 it's really worth it that your 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.969
 go back to using time 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:22.279
 for this person if you both value that the 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:24.559
