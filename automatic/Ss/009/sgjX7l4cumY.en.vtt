daily I think that the sexiness and the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.490 
daily I think that the sexiness and the
sweetness<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.420> someone<00:01:57.840> who<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.380> their

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500

20s<00:01:58.950> let's<00:01:59.460> say<00:01:59.549> 18<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.560> 40<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:02.070> probably

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
20s let's say 18 to 40 would probably

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.550 
20s let's say 18 to 40 would probably
let<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.509> little<00:02:03.750> bit<00:02:03.929> more<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.500> I

however<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.020> thought<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.530> was<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.860> little<00:05:12.250> too

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
however I thought it was a little too

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.670 
however I thought it was a little too
strong<00:05:12.820> just<00:05:12.850> because<00:05:13.480> I<00:05:13.690> did<00:05:13.930> over<00:05:14.290> apply<00:05:14.650> I

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
strong just because I did over apply I

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.740 
strong just because I did over apply I
did<00:05:15.010> four<00:05:15.400> applications<00:05:16.060> with<00:05:16.270> this<00:05:16.390> one<00:05:16.600> I

did four applications with this one I

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.340 
did four applications with this one I
think<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:17.230> three<00:05:17.980> is<00:05:18.280> more<00:05:18.790> than<00:05:18.970> enough

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
think that three is more than enough

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.140 
think that three is more than enough
this<00:05:20.350> is<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.590> very<00:05:20.830> strong<00:05:21.340> it's<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:21.820> little<00:05:22.030> bit

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
this is a very strong it's a little bit

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.100 
this is a very strong it's a little bit
bold<00:05:22.540> as<00:05:22.870> well<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.460> bottle<00:05:24.850> is<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.110> just

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
bold as well so the bottle is a just

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.900

your typical square bottle so I did put

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.090 
your typical square bottle so I did put
a<00:05:27.970> little<00:05:28.360> bit<00:05:28.479> of<00:05:28.600> a<00:05:28.660> dent<00:05:28.930> in<00:05:29.140> it<00:05:29.290> so<00:05:29.919> we<00:05:29.979> got

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
a little bit of a dent in it so we got

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.890 
a little bit of a dent in it so we got
