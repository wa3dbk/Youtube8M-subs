00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Internet go use a coax cable that will

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.049 
Internet go use a coax cable that will
go<00:00:52.559> between<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.969> house<00:00:54.239> jack<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:56.699> modem

hook<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:59.070> you'll<00:00:59.219> take<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> cat5

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
hook it up and then you'll take a cat5

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
hook it up and then you'll take a cat5
cable<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:02.250> here

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
cable like this right here

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.760 
cable like this right here
you'll<00:01:03.600> put<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.080> end<00:01:04.350> into<00:01:04.799> your<00:01:05.700> modem<00:01:06.770> and

you'll put one end into your modem and
it<00:01:08.100> typically<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.790> has<00:01:09.000> that's<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> only

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it typically just has that's the only

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
it typically just has that's the only
connector<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.799> has<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.130> doesn't<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.520> another

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
connector it has it doesn't have another

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.690 
connector it has it doesn't have another
one<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> other<00:01:13.710> end<00:01:13.799> put<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
one and then take the other end put it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.200 
one and then take the other end put it
in<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.840> router<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.460> yellow<00:01:17.759> jack<00:01:18.030> I

along<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> front<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.750> you'll<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.860> bunch

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
along the front here you'll have a bunch

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.380 
along the front here you'll have a bunch
of<00:01:38.280> them<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> they'll<00:01:38.729> probably<00:01:38.970> come<00:01:39.360> up

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
of them and they'll probably come up

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.880

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.830 
take your router and turn it on and
sometimes<00:02:02.700> they'll<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.000> an<00:02:03.180> on/off<00:02:03.479> button

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
sometimes they'll have an on/off button

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
sometimes they'll have an on/off button
and<00:02:03.990> back<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.409> lot<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.979> times<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.340> don't

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and back a lot of times they don't

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.920 
and back a lot of times they don't
because<00:02:05.670> these<00:02:05.790> pieces<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.270> equipment<00:02:06.450> aren't

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
because these pieces of equipment aren't

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.020 
because these pieces of equipment aren't
designed<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.740> power<00:02:07.979> cycled<00:02:08.520> frequently

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
designed to be power cycled frequently

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.630 
designed to be power cycled frequently
and<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.720> what<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.259> power<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.679> your

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and so what you do is power up your

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.890 
and so what you do is power up your
router<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.959> same<00:02:13.200> thing<00:02:13.440> will<00:02:13.560> happen

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
router and the same thing will happen

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.360 
router and the same thing will happen
we'll<00:02:13.989> come<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.230> with<00:02:14.500> red<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:14.890> yellow<00:02:14.950> lights

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
we'll come up with red and yellow lights

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.789 
we'll come up with red and yellow lights
along<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.819> front<00:02:16.590> typically<00:02:17.590> I'll<00:02:17.680> have

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
along the front typically I'll have

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.759 
along the front typically I'll have
lights<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.189> indicate<00:02:18.700> what<00:02:18.909> the<00:02:19.060> wireless

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
lights that indicate what the wireless

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.440 
lights that indicate what the wireless
transmitters<00:02:20.769> doing<00:02:21.159> and<00:02:21.400> what<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.329> other

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
transmitters doing and what the other

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.500 
transmitters doing and what the other
network<00:02:23.260> jacks<00:02:23.560> are<00:02:23.799> doing<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.209> will<00:02:25.299> come

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
network jacks are doing and it will come

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.589 
network jacks are doing and it will come
up<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:26.370> red<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.489> yellow<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.000> then<00:02:28.269> as<00:02:28.450> it

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
up in red and yellow and then as it

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.210 
up in red and yellow and then as it
makes<00:02:28.810> connection<00:02:29.349> with<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.620> router<00:02:29.829> and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
makes connection with the router and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.949 
makes connection with the router and
establishes<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.209> connection<00:02:31.420> into<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
establishes a connection into the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.679 
establishes a connection into the
internet<00:02:32.500> then<00:02:32.950> its<00:02:33.220> lights<00:02:33.670> will<00:02:34.000> turn<00:02:34.030> blue

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
internet then its lights will turn blue

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.479 
internet then its lights will turn blue
and<00:02:34.720> green<00:02:35.140> also<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.799> when<00:02:36.099> everything's

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
and green also and when everything's

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.420 
and green also and when everything's
blue<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.879> green<00:02:37.150> then<00:02:37.810> you're<00:02:38.019> ready<00:02:38.230> to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
blue and green then you're ready to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.099 
blue and green then you're ready to
connect<00:02:39.430> up<00:02:39.609> with<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.120> Netgear<00:02:40.599> router<00:02:40.870> and

connect up with the Netgear router and

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.960 
connect up with the Netgear router and
start<00:02:41.349> using<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:41.950> typically<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.939> way

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
start using it and typically the way

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.059 
start using it and typically the way
you'll<00:02:43.239> want<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.480> do<00:02:43.689> that<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:44.200> plug<00:02:44.859> in

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
you'll want to do that is plug in

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.420 
you'll want to do that is plug in
