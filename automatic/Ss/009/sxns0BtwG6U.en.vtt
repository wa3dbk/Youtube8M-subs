we<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:41.129> things<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.520> do

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.889 

you<00:00:49.370> might<00:00:49.519> have<00:00:49.640> seen<00:00:49.699> that<00:00:50.000> before<00:00:50.120> from<00:00:50.629> a

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
you might have seen that before from a

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.029 
you might have seen that before from a
few<00:00:51.199> other<00:00:51.440> Zelda<00:00:52.129> games<00:00:53.589> this<00:00:54.589> one's<00:00:54.800> not

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
few other Zelda games this one's not

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.490 
few other Zelda games this one's not
really<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.460> well<00:00:56.239> known<00:00:56.629> glitch<00:00:56.930> partially

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
really a well known glitch partially

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.959 
really a well known glitch partially
because<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:57.860> not<00:00:58.010> really<00:00:58.339> helpful<00:00:58.940> for

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
because it's not really helpful for

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.029 
because it's not really helpful for
helpful<00:00:59.600> for<00:00:59.989> speed<00:01:00.260> runners<00:01:00.589> and<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.829> majority

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
helpful for speed runners and a majority

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.410 
helpful for speed runners and a majority
of<00:01:01.519> a<00:01:01.670> way<00:01:01.879> I<00:01:02.229> mean<00:01:03.519> it<00:01:04.519> does<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> very<00:01:05.000> very

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
of a way I mean it does a very very

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.539 
of a way I mean it does a very very
specific<00:01:05.930> thing<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.530> it's<00:01:06.680> not<00:01:06.979> really<00:01:07.399> that

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
specific thing and it's not really that

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.260 
specific thing and it's not really that
useful<00:01:07.790> ever<00:01:08.649> so<00:01:09.649> it's<00:01:10.520> just<00:01:10.729> sort<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.149> way

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
useful ever so it's just sort of a way

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.230 
useful ever so it's just sort of a way
to<00:01:11.299> solve<00:01:11.750> some<00:01:12.020> puzzles<00:01:12.200> challenges<00:01:12.950> if

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
to solve some puzzles challenges if

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.340 
to solve some puzzles challenges if
you're<00:01:14.240> curious<00:01:14.450> like<00:01:14.750> glitch<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.049> actually

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
you're curious like glitch is actually

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.430 
you're curious like glitch is actually
fairly<00:01:15.500> hard<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:15.950> do<00:01:16.130> its<00:01:16.399> a<00:01:16.490> 2<00:01:16.729> frame<00:01:17.030> window

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
fairly hard to do its a 2 frame window

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.399 
fairly hard to do its a 2 frame window
if<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.590> took<00:01:18.770> me<00:01:18.920> around<00:01:19.360> 30<00:01:20.360> or<00:01:20.570> 40<00:01:20.899> tries<00:01:21.140> to

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
if it took me around 30 or 40 tries to

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.100 
if it took me around 30 or 40 tries to
do<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.179> don't<00:01:23.179> expect<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.690> get<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.929> on<00:01:24.020> your

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
do so don't expect to get it on your

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.070 
do so don't expect to get it on your
first<00:01:24.319> shot<00:01:25.300> there's<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.360> bit<00:01:26.539> of<00:01:26.569> editing<00:01:26.750> of

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
first shot there's a bit of editing of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.499 
first shot there's a bit of editing of
this<00:01:27.200> video<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.830> try<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.429> make<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:29.060> bit

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
this video to try and make that a bit

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.590 
this video to try and make that a bit
more<00:01:29.659> clear<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:34.220> what<00:01:34.670> exactly<00:01:34.759> does<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.390> do

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
more clear so what exactly does that do

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.090 
more clear so what exactly does that do
well<00:01:38.890> for<00:01:39.890> some<00:01:40.159> reason<00:01:40.190> well<00:01:41.920> planets<00:01:42.920> are

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
well for some reason well planets are

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.559 
well for some reason well planets are
split<00:01:43.399> up<00:01:43.520> galaxies<00:01:43.940> I<00:01:43.970> split<00:01:44.240> up<00:01:44.270> into<00:01:44.420> these

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
split up galaxies I split up into these

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.090 
split up galaxies I split up into these
things<00:01:44.630> called<00:01:44.990> planets<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.619> planets<00:01:46.009> are

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
things called planets and planets are

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.719 
things called planets and planets are
split<00:01:46.310> up<00:01:46.340> into<00:01:46.580> zones<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.159> each<00:01:49.159> zone<00:01:49.490> has<00:01:49.700> a

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
split up into zones and each zone has a

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.210 
split up into zones and each zone has a

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
few layers of items on it and for some

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.600 
few layers of items on it and for some
reason<00:01:52.250> doing<00:01:52.940> this<00:01:53.060> glitch<00:01:54.069> the<00:01:55.069> zeroeth

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
reason doing this glitch the zeroeth

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.850 
reason doing this glitch the zeroeth
layer<00:01:55.879> of<00:01:56.179> item<00:01:56.569> gets<00:01:56.840> restored<00:01:57.440> from<00:01:57.709> the

layer of item gets restored from the
last<00:01:58.039> galaxy<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.670> were<00:01:58.789> in<00:01:59.060> don't<00:01:59.509> ask<00:01:59.810> me<00:02:00.170> why

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
last galaxy you were in don't ask me why

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.919 
last galaxy you were in don't ask me why
it<00:02:00.470> works<00:02:01.129> but<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:02.090> usually<00:02:02.209> means<00:02:02.569> poins

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
it works but that usually means poins

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.449 
it works but that usually means poins
and<00:02:03.200> power-ups<00:02:03.470> or<00:02:03.770> places<00:02:04.190> where<00:02:04.220> they're

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
and power-ups or places where they're

not<00:02:04.550> supposed<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:05.000> be<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.500> can<00:02:06.649> have<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
not supposed to be so you can have the

not supposed to be so you can have the
cloud<00:02:07.069> power<00:02:07.310> up<00:02:07.459> here<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.849> manage<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.569> get

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
cloud power up here and manage to get

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.040 
cloud power up here and manage to get
stuff<00:02:09.410> done<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.739> way<00:02:10.069> it's<00:02:11.000> not<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.840> easy

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
stuff done that way it's not that easy

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.680 
stuff done that way it's not that easy
though<00:02:12.379> in<00:02:12.879> order<00:02:13.879> for<00:02:14.060> us<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.540> everything

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
though in order for us to do everything

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.130 
though in order for us to do everything
like<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.760> we'll<00:02:16.760> need<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:17.239> three<00:02:17.720> pieces<00:02:17.900> of

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
like this we'll need all three pieces of

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.890 
like this we'll need all three pieces of
clouds<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.300> excuse<00:02:20.300> my<00:02:20.450> fumbling<00:02:20.810> around

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
clouds so excuse my fumbling around

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.580 
clouds so excuse my fumbling around
tryna<00:02:21.910> get<00:02:22.910> up<00:02:23.150> on<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.390> platform<00:02:23.720> with<00:02:24.379> all

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
tryna get up on that platform with all

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.229 
tryna get up on that platform with all
three<00:02:24.830> please<00:02:25.010> pieces<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.550> cloud<00:02:25.790> it's<00:02:26.060> not

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
three please pieces of cloud it's not

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.970 
three please pieces of cloud it's not
going<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.480> take<00:02:26.720> me<00:02:28.810> probably<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:30.319> little<00:02:30.769> bit

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
going to take me probably a little bit

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.089 
going to take me probably a little bit
longer<00:02:31.250> than<00:02:31.519> I<00:02:31.550> wanted<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.739> come<00:02:33.950> on

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
longer than I wanted it to so come on

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.040 
longer than I wanted it to so come on
there<00:02:34.760> we<00:02:34.970> go

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
there we go

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.940 
there we go
I<00:02:36.580> haven't<00:02:37.580> practiced<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.600> much<00:02:38.950> thankfully

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
I haven't practiced that much thankfully

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.520 
I haven't practiced that much thankfully
if<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.190> die<00:02:40.430> or<00:02:40.790> if<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:41.300> gain<00:02:41.510> over<00:02:41.870> this

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
if you die or if you gain over this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.050 
if you die or if you gain over this
glitch<00:02:42.830> doesn't<00:02:43.130> go<00:02:43.220> away<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.850> pretty

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
glitch doesn't go away so you pretty

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.520 
glitch doesn't go away so you pretty
much<00:02:44.210> only<00:02:44.450> need<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.780> do<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.930> once<00:02:45.200> for<00:02:45.410> your

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
much only need to do it once for your

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.890 
much only need to do it once for your
entire<00:02:45.740> practice<00:02:46.040> session<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.600> we're<00:02:47.780> going

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
entire practice session so we're going

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.800 
entire practice session so we're going
to<00:02:47.960> use<00:02:48.050> my<00:02:48.080> own<00:02:48.260> cloud<00:02:48.470> over<00:02:48.650> here<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.660> get<00:02:50.660> up

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
to use my own cloud over here and get up

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.160 
to use my own cloud over here and get up
on<00:02:50.960> this<00:02:51.110> thing<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.820> onto<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.970> swing<00:02:53.170> that

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
on this thing and onto the swing that

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.080 
on this thing and onto the swing that
ledge<00:02:54.470> up<00:02:54.680> there<00:02:54.710> is<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.130> 2d<00:02:55.460> section<00:02:55.910> and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
ledge up there is a 2d section and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.640 
ledge up there is a 2d section and
there's<00:02:56.240> an<00:02:56.360> invisible<00:02:56.540> wall<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:57.140> front<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.560> it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
there's an invisible wall in front of it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.760 
there's an invisible wall in front of it
so<00:02:58.280> in<00:02:58.550> order<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.940> get<00:02:59.450> over<00:02:59.840> that<00:02:59.990> be<00:03:00.230> mushroom

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
so in order to get over that be mushroom

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.410 
so in order to get over that be mushroom
we<00:03:00.890> need<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.130> use<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> few<00:03:01.550> clouds<00:03:01.790> here<00:03:02.210> and

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
we need to use a few clouds here and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.240 
we need to use a few clouds here and
sort<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.350> skip<00:03:04.070> all<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:05.470> we<00:03:06.470> do<00:03:06.770> need<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:06.950> keep

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
sort of skip all that we do need to keep

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.160 
sort of skip all that we do need to keep
the<00:03:07.430> cloud<00:03:07.760> power<00:03:08.150> up<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:08.600> we're<00:03:08.900> going<00:03:09.080> to

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
the cloud power up so we're going to

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.390 
the cloud power up so we're going to
need<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.350> do<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.470> little<00:03:09.620> bit<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:09.860> tricky<00:03:10.190> stuff

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
need to do a little bit of tricky stuff

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.840 
need to do a little bit of tricky stuff
to<00:03:10.580> avoid<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.970> bubbles<00:03:11.830> some<00:03:12.830> basic<00:03:13.280> complex

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
to avoid the bubbles some basic complex

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.320 
to avoid the bubbles some basic complex
platforming<00:03:14.450> here<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.870> that's<00:03:15.020> that's<00:03:15.770> that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
platforming here and that's that's that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.370 
platforming here and that's that's that
much<00:03:17.330> harder<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.690> do<00:03:17.780> than<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.050> looks<00:03:18.200> by<00:03:18.350> the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
much harder to do than it looks by the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.440 
much harder to do than it looks by the
way<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.800> one<00:03:19.730> more<00:03:19.940> for<00:03:20.060> here<00:03:20.300> there<00:03:20.930> we<00:03:21.080> go<00:03:22.450> we

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
way and one more for here there we go we

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.670 
way and one more for here there we go we
need<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.690> keep<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.960> cloud<00:03:24.170> power<00:03:24.440> because

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
need to keep the cloud power because

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.680 
need to keep the cloud power because
otherwise<00:03:24.920> if<00:03:25.310> we<00:03:25.460> stand<00:03:25.820> on<00:03:26.030> those<00:03:26.210> clouds<00:03:26.450> as

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
otherwise if we stand on those clouds as

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.740 
otherwise if we stand on those clouds as
a<00:03:26.720> regular<00:03:27.170> Mario<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.920> will<00:03:28.190> not<00:03:28.550> work<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
a regular Mario it will not work the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.000 
a regular Mario it will not work the
clouds<00:03:29.990> will<00:03:30.170> disappear<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.620> won't<00:03:30.830> be<00:03:30.890> able

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
clouds will disappear and won't be able

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.370 
clouds will disappear and won't be able
to<00:03:31.130> get<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.580> thing<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.120> time<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:33.020> there<00:03:33.260> we

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
to get to the thing in time and there we

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.140 
to get to the thing in time and there we
go<00:03:33.530> just<00:03:33.560> need<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.040> wait<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.580> get<00:03:34.760> out<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.030> that

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
go just need to wait to get out of that

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:53.149 
go just need to wait to get out of that
weighs<00:03:35.510> enemy<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:37.270> there<00:03:38.270> we<00:03:38.480> go

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.710 

thankfully<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.400> need<00:03:54.670> for<00:03:54.970> cloud<00:03:55.209> Mario<00:03:55.629> is

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
thankfully the need for cloud Mario is

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.380 
thankfully the need for cloud Mario is
over<00:03:56.099> you<00:03:57.099> can<00:03:57.250> see<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.489> as<00:03:57.939> we<00:03:58.180> get<00:03:58.299> to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
over you can see that as we get to

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.880 
over you can see that as we get to
different<00:03:58.629> planets<00:03:58.780> in<00:03:59.049> different<00:03:59.349> zones<00:03:59.530> the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
different planets in different zones the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.309 
different planets in different zones the
items<00:04:00.579> are<00:04:00.790> back<00:04:01.510> where<00:04:01.720> they're<00:04:01.870> supposed<00:04:02.019> to

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
items are back where they're supposed to

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.350 
items are back where they're supposed to
be<00:04:02.379> it<00:04:03.040> only<00:04:03.250> affects<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.790> first<00:04:03.970> zone<00:04:04.180> of

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
be it only affects the first zone of

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.880 
be it only affects the first zone of
each<00:04:04.480> planet<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.079> it's<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.319> really<00:04:05.500> weird

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
each planet so it's a really weird

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.360 
each planet so it's a really weird
interesting<00:04:06.430> glitch<00:04:07.409> but<00:04:08.409> it's<00:04:08.709> there<00:04:08.980> you

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
interesting glitch but it's there you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.560 
interesting glitch but it's there you
want<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.610> play<00:04:09.700> around<00:04:09.849> with<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.760> I'm<00:04:16.060> just

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
want to play around with it so I'm just

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.740 
want to play around with it so I'm just
gonna<00:04:16.989> get<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.289> rest<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.590> four<00:04:18.090> stars<00:04:19.090> it

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
gonna get the rest of the four stars it

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.050 
gonna get the rest of the four stars it
doesn't<00:04:20.049> really<00:04:20.260> matter<00:04:20.729> there<00:04:21.729> isn't<00:04:21.970> really

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
doesn't really matter there isn't really

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.570 
doesn't really matter there isn't really
that<00:04:22.560> anything<00:04:23.560> interesting<00:04:23.710> going<00:04:24.010> on<00:04:24.310> it's

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
that anything interesting going on it's

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.460 
that anything interesting going on it's
just<00:04:24.729> some<00:04:24.880> fairly<00:04:25.360> basic<00:04:25.630> platforming<00:04:26.380> to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
just some fairly basic platforming to

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.400 
just some fairly basic platforming to
get<00:04:26.620> these<00:04:26.800> although<00:04:27.699> I'm<00:04:27.910> not<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:29.260> greatest

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
get these although I'm not the greatest
