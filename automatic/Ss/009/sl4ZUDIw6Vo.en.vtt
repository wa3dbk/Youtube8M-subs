00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello to you jess and this video 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.810
 application overview 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.530
 voice recorder but as you guessed it 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.179
 app to record sound proposal 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.990
 looks like this design 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.060
 Of course a little bit strange but not 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 less this application performs its 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 functions are very nothing at all of them 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.930
 bring on keystroke starts 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.330
 Record in this application is provided 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.980
 Antique phone lock that is straight 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.100
 the application can turn off the lock 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.100
 phone and as you can see is recording 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.800
 numbers and also displayed at the top 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.590
 volume level sound she writes well 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.960
 here by pressing 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.620
 although it is interesting to stop recording 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.660
 if i get a file manager like this 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.170
 How does this file look like here? 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.539
 manager 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.539
 connect the phone to the computer through 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:06.659
 usb and open the song through the conductor not 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.040
 it will turn out when it comes to initially with 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.430
 throw on skydrive 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:19.759
 as you can see here you can do it but it 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.759
 let's listen to one speaker entries below 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:36.120
 and how would I answer the phone 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.870
 departed the phone at a distance of 7 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.640
 meters when you hear the recorder perform 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.470
 whether its functions it probably depends 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.670
 most likely from the microphones 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.360
 There are two phones here 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.970
 writes the top one microphone and down there 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.479
 small hole every song you can 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.030
 edit 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.610
 that is, change its name or 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.250
 change color I don't know who needs it 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.800
 it is personally not very useful new 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:14.850
 hello domain and what I wrote and also 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.860
 You can change the color here 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.880
 socket 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.459
 variegated color needs to be customized 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.560
 very accurately also increase increase 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.290
 brightness 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.769
 what I chose a terrible color but also clicking 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.489
 here 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.700
 select the color and save button 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:39.120
 and there is such a strip 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.780
 a certain color and here's a click on 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.690
 pencil can send songs 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.610
 skydrive and then from the computer account 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.549
 go in and go skydrive 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.519
 upload this song and it is amr format 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:04.860
 appear so demand to allow access 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:06.630
 although I also did and I understand it even 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.739
 indicator should appear 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.940
 here saw the general loading went all so 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.760
 you can just take everything 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.930
 delete and forget about it the corner of your 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.870
 body us app 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.870
 I did not understand 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.970
 delete all deleted that is probably 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.190
 because there was a sound recording 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.470
 Of course, if you go to the application to work 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.740
 there will be no senseless living 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.720
 icon that displays names 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:48.010
 records but no less than you did see 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.450
 to be in trend here and see for 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.570
 that there is no record she just simply 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.150
 spinning and the application is curled up and 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:02.020
 record it still have to block 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.660
 turn on the phone leave the phone you 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.550
 connected in this way even if 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.760
 automatic blocking will be off anyway 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.440
 it will not work but it is already 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.390
 features of our operating system 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.780
 Well , thank you all for your attention to 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.780
 dating
