that doesn't have silicones that's truly

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219

weigh<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.530> down<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.159> dry<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> out<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.030> dries

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
weigh it down or not dry it out it dries

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
weigh it down or not dry it out it dries
it<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> weird<00:01:51.840> way<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.590> lot

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it out in a weird way and I think a lot

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.990 
it out in a weird way and I think a lot
of<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.979> has<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> shampoo<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
of it has to do with the shampoo and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.179 
of it has to do with the shampoo and
conditioner<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.740> think<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.829> would<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.009> liked

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
conditioner I think I would have liked

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
conditioner I think I would have liked
to<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.399> seen<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.729> leave-in<00:01:57.119> conditioner<00:01:57.659> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to have seen a leave-in conditioner in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
to have seen a leave-in conditioner in
this<00:01:57.990> line<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.439> well<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.399> would

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
this line as well I think that would

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.800 
this line as well I think that would
have<00:01:59.640> helped<00:01:59.880> tame<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> frizz<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.689> bit

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
have helped tame the frizz a little bit

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.139 
have helped tame the frizz a little bit
after<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.590> shower<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> chrome<00:02:02.759> boosting

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
after the shower but the chrome boosting

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
after the shower but the chrome boosting
spray<00:02:03.390> kind<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.689> helps<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.110> kind<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.439> apply<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
spray kind of helps I kind of apply that

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.289 
spray kind of helps I kind of apply that
after<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> shower<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.790> apply<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.090> for

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
after the shower I apply it for

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.029 
after the shower I apply it for
touch-ups<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> also<00:02:07.049> apply<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.439> once<00:02:07.860> I'm

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
touch-ups but I also apply it once I'm

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
touch-ups but I also apply it once I'm
out<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> shower<00:02:08.340> all<00:02:08.879> over<00:02:09.330> before<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.720> go

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
out of the shower all over before I go

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.600 
out of the shower all over before I go
ahead<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.410> these<00:02:10.560> two<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:11.280> I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
ahead with these two if I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.800 
ahead with these two if I
to<00:02:11.700> choose<00:02:11.880> two<00:02:12.060> products<00:02:12.390> from<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.570> entire

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to choose two products from the entire

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.810 
to choose two products from the entire
line<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.440> would<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:14.070> two<00:02:14.400> styling
