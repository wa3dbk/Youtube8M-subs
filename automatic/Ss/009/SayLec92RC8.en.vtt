00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.470
 Look at the supercar I found sanshou 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.090
 they 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.300
 cool right not trash and now you me 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.759
 They say too fucking right it's a great to have 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.859
 a super rare car that you can only 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.260
 find in sanchez shores 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.350
 I found this location but this one 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.340
 car and stays in different locations 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.650
 random so if you stay 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 Circling and not finding it's just you give 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.460
 a little more than one hour 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 You will see him parked in some 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 place on the map that there is only you with 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.420
 garage and custom zalo it gives a 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.550
 I work to find but after you 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.649
 to find you will see that he has thousands 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.870
 of consolidation options 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.520
 since cutting bucket places the astro 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.860
 putting a motor out the car is very 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.899
 door 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.340
 initially tax can be saved in 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.860
 garage but after one of the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.350
 Last updates hence banned 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.550
 so from what I know it may even be that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.430
 this news has already become noticeable 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 It might be rather save in the garage but 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.220
 as far as I know you can not save it 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.080
 then around with something that is boring 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.930
 because the car is very crazy and pruning 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.030
 very rare houngbo in which you end up not 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.280
 you can store in the garage where the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.250
 boring things that have in the game but even 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.869
 so if you catch them uniformly and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.640
 'focus' use it 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.710
 You're going to have a lot of fun because you have 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.950
 a lot of great things that you can be 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.549
 doing with the car and is very crazy 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.590
 same 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.229
 if you liked and liked, want more videos 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.329
 of cars so old hoop customization 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.450
 this way in this style of video you 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.729
 gives a range in the video advances values â€‹â€‹and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.530
