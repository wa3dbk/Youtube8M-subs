00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
let's find your plane from here hearing

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.000 
let's find your plane from here hearing
process<00:02:29.900> will<00:02:30.900> complete<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.470> tuning<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.980> the

is a cello purple it's that line that

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.340 
is a cello purple it's that line that
runs<00:03:20.370> around<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.970> violin<00:03:21.360> family<00:03:21.600> instrument

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
runs around the violin family instrument

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.090 
runs around the violin family instrument
and<00:03:23.010> it's<00:03:23.310> there<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.410> isolate<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> top<00:03:25.830> from

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
and it's there to isolate the top from

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.040 
and it's there to isolate the top from
the<00:03:26.130> sides<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:27.030> keep<00:03:27.150> vibration<00:03:27.840> from<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
the sides to keep vibration from the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.350 
the sides to keep vibration from the
strings<00:03:28.590> from<00:03:29.070> transferring<00:03:29.760> from<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.030> side

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
strings from transferring from the side

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.260 
strings from transferring from the side
and<00:03:30.840> being<00:03:31.140> lost<00:03:31.260> energy

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:49.000 

and<00:03:39.270> then<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.130> binding<00:03:43.849> so<00:03:44.849> we<00:03:45.770> this<00:03:46.770> is

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
and then the the binding so we this is

00:03:49.010 --> 00:04:04.160 
and then the the binding so we this is
which<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.160> what<00:04:00.560> or<00:04:01.560> Blackwood<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.870> we<00:04:03.959> get<00:04:04.080> the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
which is what or Blackwood so we get the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.240 
which is what or Blackwood so we get the
advantage<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.709> sound<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.190> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
advantage of the sound of the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.400 
advantage of the sound of the
workability<00:04:06.769> now<00:04:07.970> totally<00:04:08.970> what's<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.480> what

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
workability now totally what's the what

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.800 
workability now totally what's the what
kind<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.680> overtones<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.790> sounds<00:04:12.569> should<00:04:12.750> I

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
kind of overtones and sounds should I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.039 
kind of overtones and sounds should I
expect<00:04:13.140> with<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.850> sinker<00:04:14.850> redwood<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.600> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
expect with the sinker redwood and the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.680 
expect with the sinker redwood and the
Rosewood<00:04:16.889> back<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.400> sound<00:04:17.579> well<00:04:18.150> they're

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
Rosewood back and sound well they're

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.509 
Rosewood back and sound well they're
there<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.410> like<00:04:19.739> they're<00:04:19.919> like<00:04:20.100> two<00:04:20.340> different

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
there to like they're like two different

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.790 
there to like they're like two different
colors<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.540> when<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.840> put<00:04:22.079> them<00:04:22.139> together<00:04:22.320> if

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
colors and when you put them together if

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.469 
colors and when you put them together if
they<00:04:22.950> leave<00:04:23.130> me<00:04:23.250> blend<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.639> little<00:04:23.790> bit<00:04:24.030> but

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
they leave me blend a little bit but

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.850 
they leave me blend a little bit but
mostly<00:04:24.750> they'll<00:04:24.930> complement<00:04:25.410> should<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:25.650> give

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
mostly they'll complement should I give

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.740 
mostly they'll complement should I give
you<00:04:26.010> up<00:04:26.160> they'll<00:04:26.580> evoke<00:04:27.000> something<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:27.630> you

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
you up they'll evoke something in you

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.080 
you up they'll evoke something in you
because<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.860> there's<00:04:29.100> two<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.490> them<00:04:29.610> so

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
because of that there's two of them so

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.230 
because of that there's two of them so
what<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.600> what<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.169> redwood<00:04:31.770> will<00:04:31.979> do<00:04:32.190> is<00:04:32.880> in

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
what the what the redwood will do is in

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.230 
what the what the redwood will do is in
these<00:04:33.450> properties<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:34.560> comes<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.280> life<00:04:35.520> more

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
these properties it comes to life more

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.230 
these properties it comes to life more
quickly<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:37.320> let's<00:04:37.560> say<00:04:37.770> spruce<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.030> same

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
quickly and let's say spruce to the same

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.870 
quickly and let's say spruce to the same
amount<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.570> energy<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.710> when<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.310> when<00:04:41.729> you

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
amount of energy so when you when you

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.140 
amount of energy so when you when you
use<00:04:42.240> your<00:04:42.450> fingernail<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.260> this<00:04:43.890> to<00:04:44.460> pluck<00:04:44.970> the

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
use your fingernail on this to pluck the

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.240 
use your fingernail on this to pluck the
string<00:04:45.510> it's<00:04:46.020> less<00:04:46.320> energy<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.860> would<00:04:47.039> with<00:04:47.220> a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
string it's less energy you would with a

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.880 
string it's less energy you would with a
flat<00:04:47.520> pick<00:04:47.850> uh-huh<00:04:48.660> this<00:04:48.960> redwood<00:04:49.560> would

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
flat pick uh-huh this redwood would

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.219 
flat pick uh-huh this redwood would
respond<00:04:50.400> quicker<00:04:50.940> with<00:04:51.419> more<00:04:51.630> volume<00:04:51.810> in

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
respond quicker with more volume in

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.180 
respond quicker with more volume in
spruce<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:53.760> other<00:04:53.910> quality<00:04:54.950> are<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:55.979> other

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
spruce the other quality are the other

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.770 
spruce the other quality are the other
thing<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.789> quality<00:04:57.240> is<00:04:57.300> helpful<00:04:57.750> for

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
thing that that quality is helpful for

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.560 
thing that that quality is helpful for
is<00:04:58.169> if<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.770> play<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.190> open<00:04:59.610> tunings<00:05:00.060> where

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
is if you play the open tunings where

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.270 
is if you play the open tunings where
that<00:05:00.720> you've<00:05:01.200> actually<00:05:01.380> tuned<00:05:01.710> swings<00:05:02.100> down

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
that you've actually tuned swings down

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.070 
that you've actually tuned swings down
so<00:05:02.789> there's<00:05:03.000> less<00:05:03.150> tension<00:05:03.419> on<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.780> string

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
so there's less tension on the string

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.840 
so there's less tension on the string
less<00:05:04.289> energy<00:05:04.710> going<00:05:04.889> into<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.250> guitar<00:05:05.370> top

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
less energy going into the guitar top

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.690 
less energy going into the guitar top
you'll<00:05:06.330> get<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.750> quicker<00:05:07.200> louder<00:05:07.830> response<00:05:08.400> to

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
you'll get a quicker louder response to

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.240 
you'll get a quicker louder response to
that<00:05:08.880> opinion<00:05:09.150> would<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.720> it's<00:05:10.680> got<00:05:10.889> its<00:05:11.130> own

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
that opinion would and it's got its own

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
that opinion would and it's got its own
characteristic<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.800> tongue<00:05:13.940> in<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.180> of

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
characteristic of tongue in and of

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.580 
characteristic of tongue in and of
itself<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:15.810> those<00:05:15.990> are<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.260> things<00:05:16.500> that

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
itself but those are the things that

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.250 
itself but those are the things that
really<00:05:16.889> make

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
really make

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.710 
really make
desirable<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.100> really<00:05:18.670> fine<00:05:18.940> plus<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.510> really

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
desirable and really fine plus it really

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.920 
desirable and really fine plus it really
looks<00:05:20.020> cool<00:05:20.140> and<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:22.330> nature<00:05:22.600> of<00:05:22.780> it

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
looks cool and the the nature of it

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.590 
looks cool and the the nature of it
being<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.410> old<00:05:23.880> again<00:05:24.880> I'll<00:05:25.000> do<00:05:25.150> this<00:05:25.270> on<00:05:25.450> the

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
being so old again I'll do this on the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.990 
being so old again I'll do this on the
tour<00:05:25.840> but<00:05:26.470> it's<00:05:26.770> got<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.190> advantage<00:05:27.490> that<00:05:27.670> old

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
tour but it's got the advantage that old

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.780 
tour but it's got the advantage that old
violin<00:05:28.540> is<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:29.230> resins<00:05:29.920> in<00:05:30.070> the<00:05:30.190> wood<00:05:30.400> that

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
violin is the resins in the wood that

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.630 
violin is the resins in the wood that
polymerize<00:05:31.480> got<00:05:31.810> harder<00:05:32.380> it's<00:05:32.710> more<00:05:33.010> resonant

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
polymerize got harder it's more resonant

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.460 
polymerize got harder it's more resonant
than<00:05:34.000> if<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.240> wood<00:05:34.420> was<00:05:34.660> cut<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:35.170> just<00:05:35.320> dried

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
than if the wood was cut and just dried

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:45.090 
than if the wood was cut and just dried
so<00:05:38.470> it's<00:05:38.770> got<00:05:38.920> mojo<00:05:39.310> you<00:05:42.030> describe<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:44.100> way

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
so it's got mojo you describe the way

we<00:07:45.400> let<00:07:45.550> them<00:07:45.760> speak<00:07:46.030> for<00:07:46.090> themselves

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
we let them speak for themselves

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.240
