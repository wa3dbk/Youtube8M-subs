00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.660
 You can live with Fred Rutten with this one 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.070
 division points well if you can 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.820
 objectively go look at the after it 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.769
 competition image 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.150
 Well then you have to live more in it 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.630
 but I am not satisfied with it 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.119
 what is wrong with it yes I think 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.349
 that we certainly get in the first of 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.329
 number of times 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.609
 give ordinary green chance through 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:30.529
 a replay ball is very sloppy is that 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:33.590
 Nelom yes that was my point entirely 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.140
 not necessary and it is very annoying that 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.269
 that's right 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.980
 just before rest I think is just or 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.780
 two men's office because that 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.390
 those things just lie on the ball 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.350
 and watch how i measure karim the ball 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.120
 and that is still one 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.859
 joint if you then take it easy with the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.320
 inning because normally just go 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.789
 lucy with a sat on you a 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.589
 half a meter beside him he shot me nicely 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.649
 within 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.170
 yes but you used to be at tnt after 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.449
 huge if your balls are under 16 there 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.860
 arrived a bit than if the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.270
 quality of the player 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.730
 why can you do so little in the second half 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.190
 more alignment well I find the new 2 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.240
 days had a chance last week 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.820
 would see energy in the course alone 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.600
 you later waiting and it I found 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.600
 the second half them 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.100
 was a competition of opportunities over and over 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.870
 again for feyenoord but i think too 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.580
 for groningen 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.860
 you could have done such excellent things 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.590
 Rijkerbeek do it cases yes therefore 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.810
 it is also painful that right 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.670
 josje a point here today but may 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.469
 you normally look at you go to 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.789
 groningen memories learn come it 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.530
 easy money in a phase of this 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.069
 competition to the roads that have three points 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.189
 you can secure again and then 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.969
 a regular competition then you say ok 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.969
 and just play an empire 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.459
 you within those very many teams then will 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.259
 be good but don't know now 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.750
 satisfied link then happens in the final phase 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.740
 you will find the action of the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.380
 logical for all 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.729
 to reject he know you i got it 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.520
 frankly also not seen i have 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.060
 only heard that he 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.370
 with his hand towards that player 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.080
 but what I understand from the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.970
 people who are familiar with it 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.430
 it's not a striking move 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.780
 Subscribers do n't hit you like Hitler explains 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.070
 it then hey 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.020
 do you have a mother to see 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.580
 I can honestly say I can not 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.660
 values ​​are considered as one 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.100
 has hit 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.230
 yes then it would really be there for us 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.570
 if you have not defeated then is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.040
 he can be severely punished 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.450
 to the east in recent weeks not good 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.930
 two points from the last three 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.050
 matches 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.720
 how come now you think then 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.340
 various causes in that but I want now 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.840
 sit in their front training 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.850
 that makes no sense 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.070
 We must hear that third place safely 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.390
 and we are going to deal with it now 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.010
 apologies you are not missing yet 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.520
 a lot of people or something no no I mean 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.800
 don't make it 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.030
 I sometimes have the idea that that 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.150
 feyenoord previously one with next year 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.580
 is busy and not this year's 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.410
 A difficult house paper sometimes does sometimes 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.860
 I feel that my dad you see that 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.360
 still there 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.860
 I don't go there on facts does that 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.450
 magazine I appreciate on its own 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.920
 for example, well I think it is very 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.620
 unwise yes because because then again 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.120
 just another day for a competition 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.740
 then put it down again yes I like it 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.690
 I do n't think it's really professional 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.600
 ruben who is actually bothered by man no me 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.050
 not but all about is possible 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.640
 give it a less after the third 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.530
 you do well that you helped 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.090
 every now and then by the management of the club 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.370
 are you with me and choose looked questioning again 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.940
 to yes yes yes no but no my own that 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.430
 words those that you put in your mouth 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.830
 wants to explain that it does not lead to it 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.780
 off but clock then just ask 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.200
 yes it seems a bit off the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.200
 to focus
