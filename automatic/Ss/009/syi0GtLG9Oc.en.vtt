thrown around like a doll and trusting
the<00:00:17.550> boy<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.910> also<00:00:18.060> think<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.510> there's<00:00:19.439> not<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the boy I also think that there's not a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
the boy I also think that there's not a
lot<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.220> boys<00:00:20.460> out<00:00:20.880> there<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.539> skating

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
lot of boys out there that are skating

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.929 
lot of boys out there that are skating
that<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.170> big<00:00:22.410> enough<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.160> pears<00:00:23.460> if<00:00:23.850> you

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
that are big enough to do pears if you

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.700 
that are big enough to do pears if you
want<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.240> succeed<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.660> pairs<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
want to succeed in pairs you have to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.740 
want to succeed in pairs you have to
have<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> big<00:00:26.220> difference<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.359> all<00:00:27.539> those

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
have a big difference to do all those

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.980 
have a big difference to do all those
tricks<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.680> all<00:00:28.859> those<00:00:29.039> lifts<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.939> even<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
tricks to do all those lifts and even to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.080 
tricks to do all those lifts and even to
do<00:00:31.109> everything<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.949> pairs<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:32.969> we

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
do everything in pairs I think if we

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
do everything in pairs I think if we
look<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> Russian<00:00:33.899> today<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.280> have

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
look at the Russian today they all have

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.910 
look at the Russian today they all have
that<00:00:35.730> difference<00:00:36.239> while<00:00:37.050> most<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.469> them<00:00:37.649> does

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that difference while most of them does

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.770 
that difference while most of them does
and<00:00:38.309> last<00:00:38.940> year<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.270> were<00:00:39.300> second<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and last year we were second in the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240 
and last year we were second in the
world<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.320> looked<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> podium<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
world and we looked at the podium and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.160 
world and we looked at the podium and
all<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.149> girls<00:00:42.360> we're<00:00:42.540> almost<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.989> same

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
all all the girls we're almost the same

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.779 
all all the girls we're almost the same
I<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.950> guys<00:00:44.100> were<00:00:44.129> almost<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> same

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
I and all the guys were almost the same

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.729 
I and all the guys were almost the same
height<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.690> strength<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> pursuer<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
height the strength of pursuer and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.040 
height the strength of pursuer and
Eisler<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.520> their<00:00:47.670> lips<00:00:48.050> undisputably

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
Eisler is in their lips undisputably

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.510 
Eisler is in their lips undisputably
they<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> best<00:00:49.980> lips<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> world<00:00:51.390> I

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
they have the best lips in the world I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.450 
they have the best lips in the world I
think<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.850> lifts<00:00:54.270> they're<00:00:54.719> still<00:00:55.020> getting

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
think with lifts they're still getting

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.799 
think with lifts they're still getting
their<00:00:56.460> suit<00:00:56.670> evolving<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.570> there's<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
their suit evolving because there's a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
their suit evolving because there's a
lot<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> things<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.250> real<00:00:59.489> changes

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
lot of things that with real changes

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.810 
lot of things that with real changes
every<00:01:00.149> year<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.690> push<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
every year that you can push the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.100 
every year that you can push the
legality<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.850> everything<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.600> little<00:01:03.629> bit

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
legality of everything just a little bit

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
legality of everything just a little bit
further<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.070> think<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.700> more

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
further and I think the more and more

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.340 
further and I think the more and more
you<00:01:06.119> see<00:01:06.170> pairs<00:01:07.310> have<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.420> sort<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.840> longer

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you see pairs have a sort of a longer

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.520 
you see pairs have a sort of a longer
period<00:01:10.710> together<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:12.020> more<00:01:13.020> chance

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
period together they have a more chance

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.770 
period together they have a more chance
of<00:01:13.740> coming<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.310> ideas<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.420> going

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
of coming up with ideas that are going

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.950 
of coming up with ideas that are going
to<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:16.049> dangerous<00:01:17.360> sometime<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> does<00:01:18.720> No

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
to be dangerous sometime it does No

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
physical strength is a huge plus for the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.580 
physical strength is a huge plus for the
pair<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:17.610> he's<00:02:17.940> had<00:02:18.239> some<00:02:18.510> concerns<00:02:19.050> at<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
pair but he's had some concerns at the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.370 
pair but he's had some concerns at the
start<00:02:20.180> when<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.209> got<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.540> Isabel<00:02:21.959> she<00:02:21.989> was<00:02:22.260> so

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
start when I got to Isabel she was so

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.590 
start when I got to Isabel she was so
small<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.820> there<00:02:23.820> were<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.120> many<00:02:24.239> things

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
small that there were so many things

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.449 
small that there were so many things
that<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:25.080> could<00:02:25.350> do<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> took<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
that we could do it all it took was a

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.490 
that we could do it all it took was a
little<00:02:26.730> convincing<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.420> get<00:02:27.840> Isabel<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.320> try

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
little convincing to get Isabel to try

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.259 
little convincing to get Isabel to try
it<00:02:28.560> because<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.860> lot<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.100> things<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.550> do<00:02:29.730> you

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
it because a lot of things we do you

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.699 
it because a lot of things we do you
wouldn't<00:02:30.510> get<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> lot<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.900> teams<00:02:31.080> even<00:02:31.380> trying

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
wouldn't get a lot of teams even trying

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.110 
wouldn't get a lot of teams even trying
because<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.280> girl<00:02:32.430> would<00:02:32.519> just<00:02:32.670> say<00:02:32.790> no<00:02:32.970> I'm

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
because the girl would just say no I'm

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.090 
because the girl would just say no I'm
not<00:02:33.150> gonna<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.690> because<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.680> boy<00:02:34.830> for

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
not gonna do that because the boy for

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.320 
not gonna do that because the boy for
one<00:02:35.190> isn't<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.670> stable<00:02:35.970> enough<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
one isn't going to be stable enough and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.479 
one isn't going to be stable enough and
two<00:02:36.810> doesn't<00:02:37.110> trust<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.440> boy<00:02:37.560> enough<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.069> do

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
two doesn't trust the boy enough to do

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.170 
two doesn't trust the boy enough to do
things<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.910> that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
things like that
