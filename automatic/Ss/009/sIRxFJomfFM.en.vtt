00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all so it's us we're going to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.640
 find today for a small 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.370
 tutorial where I'm going to introduce you two 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.920
 of linghem poster software and the other 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.480
 game fire good sense of the software that are 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.390
 they have they proved themselves on 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:23.100
 on dofus have it really helps 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.619
 to boost your your pc for my poor 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.029
 in the world there is good play multi 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.010
 so it's with a fluidity that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.269
 no longer to prove 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 they have been powerful for years 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.719
 on who are on the ground and that's 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.969
 better from year to year so everything so 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.260
 for all that is links I'm going 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.890
 you put them directly the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.570
 description 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.879
 there I go all I really do you 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.530
 first talk about how to do them 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.730
 operate and then I gave my 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 point of view vis-à-vis these two 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.879
 software for me which one is the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.960
 better 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.390
 so we go as first started 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.739
 by game booster game booster which is a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.379
 software that I use for several 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.769
 years since 2010 if I'm 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.020
 remember it's really software 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.159
 I enjoyed at first I 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.500
 did not believe it too much I was a little 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.000
 skeptical and finally finally that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.680
 is well proven and we come back the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.869
 difference when we play at run away 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.580
 so sometimes you have to know what 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.229
 game booster was missing finally we can 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.240
 walk for all all types of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.520
 game so you can match it game 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.509
 which he doubts you are passing 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.840
 a lot of time on it 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.280
 but rome added as much as you want 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.600
 for example if I want to boost 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 league of legends I do not know if that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.670
 walk but I can try it because 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.960
 that I have a dream but 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.270
 but hey we can try so yet 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.320
 of a new one by the way this is a 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.970
 times dumplings and once you 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
 download it you have to 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.509
 will finally make dofus dofus will not be 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.920
 not on it gives you and add 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.360
 directly so as I come from you 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.409
 show your keys add up wanted 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.750
 search directly for your records 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.789
 do not panic if it's not on you 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.439
 know it do it 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.439
 so once you had launched it 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.869
 in fact you are to configure and there 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:09.069
 you will see a whole list of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.680
 process services et cetera who me who 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.100
 is turning right now on your on 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.569
 your pc and that is an asset that is not 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.799
 not indispensable 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.180
 ie, for example, for example 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.360
 unnecessary services so all that is 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.890
 what it was but you know it's 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.760
 not really useful but it takes that 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.540
 takes up space 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.430
 it weighs its weight so in fact game 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.549
 booster is going to go to say how to put them 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.769
 paused and beats to focus on 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.060
 the game so it's up to you to choose this 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.640
 So you remove everything 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.109
 is useless services that will be it will be 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.900
 removed automatically finally it's 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.790
 remove directly then the same for 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.680
 others and others there are 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.570
 four that are removed directly and 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.090
 the windows service frankly 8 9 at 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.170
 me then at the level of the processes to 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.579
 you choose what you want or 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.500
 not for example I would never 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.070
 use google especially to listen 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
 music 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.359
 so I will not close everything that is 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.160
 google chrome because that i will have less 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.470
 of fun to play and you can everything to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.720
 does it if so really you it's 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.670
 that to play I have no problem 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.620
 the same for skype or think stupid and it's 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.299
 all that is in fact it kills you 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.160
 say all there is all that is not 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.750
 essential 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.310
 once it's done click on 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.200
 folded hop 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.500
 I do not do it but among them are already 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.440
 facts you click on dofus and you m 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.020
 you do booster is launched once 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.260
 that it's done that alone in slip launcher 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.520
 launches you play and 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.200
 frankly here you are doing the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.819
 quiet noise there is no problem 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.620
 for that would really tell you a 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.620
 a nice fluidity 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.260
 so frankly really nice had 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.810
 then that's it back to the mode 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.630
 normal and all that was closed under 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:06.780
 the sa that opens is that if we have 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.250
 successful so so that's so it's 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.660
 really a good software that is 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.150
 really nice to use 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.370
 it allows a good fluidity of the game 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.440
 it's really cool 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.239
 another Serbian game fire may more 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.950
 different I'm going to show you that so 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.430
 you open it directly already have it 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.560
 is in English 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.610
 compared to game booster where you have some 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.460
 multiple languages ​​that you can 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.230
 choose the 8 in English so you 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.140
 worry not panic not I will you 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.310
 show directly used first 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.860
 you and others he must have 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.100
 open to the vagaries of all you do 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.140
 gaming profile and there you ticked all you 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.170
 tick all everything except systems 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.170
 security so not otherwise it's fine when he 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.810
 when a fire will be lit all that 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.640
 is at large etc will crash and blow 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.930
 it's not necessarily flow wanted fast 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.030
 I'm losing something that frankly 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.110
 English goes to opel shot and otherwise you 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.720
 change everything you put high 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.510
 power club performance and you checked 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.680
 all the boxes that are above that 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.160
 it will really done it really well 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.300
 bump your pc once it's done 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.430
 we make a knock and as I did just 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.360
 before scoring tender and gaming mode 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.520
 and there you will see that 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.889
 there the facade will change in falling 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.069
 windows xp so that's done i do not know 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.319
 if you have it at last that's it change 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.949
 well it's a little retro side it's 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:30.849
 cool we went back to a paragraph 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.750
 guys so it must be these facts there 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.610
 ago 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.230
 so he's going to get here by ippon game 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.940
 boost the two do go here so it's 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.710
 normal if they are no longer there it works 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.480
 always 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.830
 they are he is tidied here and so that 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.180
 you are in windows xp you think 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.670
 absolutely everything you do you 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.950
 can really launched so office or 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.540
 so other games like I've never 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.950
 saw someone play with fire sheaths 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.130
 will be our game but maybe it's 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.620
 possible ansériens pavement before me I 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.740
 frankly I do not know but you 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.680
 throw dofus and there is no problem 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.730
 it's just that with this one when 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:11.810
 you have multiple accounts you are going 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:13.580
 to be looked at actually that's it's got 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.170
 put like that so it's a joke to 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.460
 variable part plus net inflow the fat 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.520
 pig line to theo so that's a bit 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.770
 galley at first but but we get used 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.550
 very quickly so 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.790
 so that's it then for what is 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.460
 in my opinion it is a little bit of 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.610
 share and frankly it's true what 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.050
 clearly at the capacity level 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.060
 properly speaking game fire I 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.170
 the impression that he is a little above 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:43.770
 from the fact that we go back and forth and 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.470
 others is a little above 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.770
 I have the movements are more fluid and 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.810
 c 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.340
 but on the other hand after a certain 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.039
 time for example three four hours of 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.639
 non-stop game frankly your 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.199
 computer 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.690
 how that but I 'm fed up 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:01.530
 to wait for laptop it burns a little 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:03.629
 it's the heater well there is a small 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.159
 worry with then me personally 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:07.020
 when I leave two sons then I 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:08.240
 I have a lot a lot a lot I have 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.490
 wait at ten minutes for 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.740
 fight for it to calm down and it's a bit 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.930
 unpleasant frankly while even 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.880
 the 400 discs on game booster we did not 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.169
 not at all because the facade does not 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.990
 not change it's just dofus they 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.039
 do I want his volumes? 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.169
 the impression that it is more pleasant to 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.030
 play game booster even though I finally have 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:29.159
 it may seem a little less 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.740
 performing well then it's really like 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.090
 you feel if you have a beast of 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.060
 pc frankly do not hesitate to 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.469
 do not equal fire but but otherwise stay 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.870
 deaf booster game its worth also know 

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:41.789
 the costs so here I hope this 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.159
 video helped you do not hesitate to 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:45.419
 leave a green thumb and 

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:48.289
 comments if you have questions 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.289
 see you
