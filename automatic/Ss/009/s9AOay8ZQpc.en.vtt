which comes to about a dollar six per
can<00:02:31.709> while<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.860> Mike's<00:02:33.070> Hard<00:02:33.490> Lemonade<00:02:33.900> $6.99

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
can while the Mike's Hard Lemonade $6.99

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.350 
can while the Mike's Hard Lemonade $6.99
so<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.620> comes<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.980> about<00:02:36.130> dollar<00:02:36.700> seventeen

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
so that comes to about dollar seventeen

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.090 
so that comes to about dollar seventeen
per<00:02:38.080> bottle<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.560> course<00:02:38.830> they're<00:02:39.010> in

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
per bottle of course they're in

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.190 
per bottle of course they're in
different<00:02:39.400> apps<00:02:39.610> right<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.510> calculate<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
different apps right so I calculate the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.500 
different apps right so I calculate the
best<00:02:41.380> way<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.560> calculate<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.510> calculator

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
best way to calculate it is a calculator

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.230 
best way to calculate it is a calculator
per<00:02:43.780> ounce<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.370> turns<00:02:45.550> out<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> ballot

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
per ounce so it turns out the ballot

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.880 
per ounce so it turns out the ballot
line<00:02:46.420> comes<00:02:47.380> out<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.860> 13<00:02:48.640> cents<00:02:49.180> per<00:02:49.480> ounce

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
line comes out to 13 cents per ounce

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.190 
line comes out to 13 cents per ounce
while<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.190> Mike's<00:02:51.780> strawberry<00:02:52.780> margarita

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
comes to 10 cents per ounce so you

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.440 
comes to 10 cents per ounce so you
definitely<00:02:55.690> get<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.440> cheaper<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:58.269> get<00:02:58.420> a
