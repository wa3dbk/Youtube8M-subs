urine or water dumps but Jarrah proposes
it<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.109> he<00:04:03.260> could<00:04:03.440> pretend<00:04:03.829> to<00:04:03.980> know<00:04:04.280> better<00:04:04.540> of

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680

maybe<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.889> briefly<00:04:10.250> flares<00:04:10.730> like<00:04:10.970> that

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
maybe it briefly flares like that

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.150 
maybe it briefly flares like that
because<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.930> combustion<00:04:12.500> is<00:04:12.620> momentarily

because the combustion is momentarily

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
clearly what we are seeing is an engine
