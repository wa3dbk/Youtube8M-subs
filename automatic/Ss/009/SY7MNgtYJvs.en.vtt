in<00:00:05.049> this<00:00:06.049> videotape<00:00:06.620> we're<00:00:06.950> not<00:00:07.099> only<00:00:07.399> going

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
in this videotape we're not only going

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.209 
in this videotape we're not only going
to<00:00:07.759> focus<00:00:07.939> on<00:00:08.389> weighing<00:00:08.719> some<00:00:08.990> techniques<00:00:09.440> but

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
to focus on weighing some techniques but

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.190 
to focus on weighing some techniques but
rather<00:00:10.490> we<00:00:10.700> will<00:00:10.849> try<00:00:11.180> to<00:00:11.240> teach<00:00:11.719> students

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
rather we will try to teach students

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.220 
rather we will try to teach students
those<00:00:12.680> exercises<00:00:13.480> which<00:00:14.480> will<00:00:14.689> teach<00:00:14.930> how<00:00:15.199> to

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
those exercises which will teach how to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.470 
those exercises which will teach how to
improve<00:00:15.680> those<00:00:16.070> useful<00:00:16.309> qualities<00:00:17.119> for

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
improve those useful qualities for

improve those useful qualities for
combat<00:00:17.960> for<00:00:18.350> instance<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.160> blow<00:00:19.400> power<00:00:19.730> or

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
combat for instance the blow power or

combat for instance the blow power or
the<00:00:20.119> fluency<00:00:20.720> of<00:00:20.750> movements<00:00:21.320> although<00:00:22.099> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.669 
technique is an important aspect today
we<00:00:25.429> will<00:00:25.579> focus<00:00:25.789> on<00:00:26.150> fluency<00:00:26.630> power<00:00:27.349> and

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
we will focus on fluency power and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.189 
we will focus on fluency power and
learning<00:00:28.460> how<00:00:28.579> to<00:00:28.640> apply<00:00:28.909> the<00:00:29.509> Wing<00:00:29.720> Tsun

in a combat sport not so much in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.650 
in a combat sport not so much in
personal<00:00:36.920> defence<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.090> distance<00:00:38.480> of

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
personal defence it is the distance of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.230 
personal defence it is the distance of
legs<00:00:39.020> reach<00:00:39.410> that's<00:00:40.220> why<00:00:40.490> it<00:00:40.850> will<00:00:40.970> start

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.210 
legs reach that's why it will start
speaking<00:00:41.420> about<00:00:41.810> it<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.680> doesn't<00:00:43.100> mean

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
speaking about it and that doesn't mean

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.430 
speaking about it and that doesn't mean
we'll<00:00:43.430> always<00:00:43.700> have<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.330> start<00:00:44.570> from<00:00:44.750> there<00:00:44.960> we

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
we'll always have to start from there we

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.290 
we'll always have to start from there we
will<00:00:45.590> have<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.830> look<00:00:46.070> at<00:00:46.130> all<00:00:46.520> distance<00:00:46.970> types

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
will have a look at all distance types

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.330 
will have a look at all distance types
and<00:00:47.720> later<00:00:48.140> on<00:00:48.410> we<00:00:48.710> will<00:00:48.860> go<00:00:49.040> into<00:00:49.220> more

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
and later on we will go into more

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.250 
and later on we will go into more
details<00:00:49.850> what's<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.660> strategy<00:00:50.900> in<00:00:51.170> the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
details what's the strategy in the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.410 
details what's the strategy in the
distance<00:00:51.680> when<00:00:52.160> he<00:00:52.310> places<00:00:52.550> himself<00:00:52.910> at<00:00:53.360> a

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
distance when he places himself at a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.540 
distance when he places himself at a
distance<00:00:53.990> in<00:00:54.170> which<00:00:54.380> his<00:00:54.590> blows<00:00:54.890> can<00:00:55.130> reach<00:00:55.340> me

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
distance in which his blows can reach me

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.110 
distance in which his blows can reach me
that's<00:00:55.940> when<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.240> combat<00:00:56.600> will<00:00:56.930> begin<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:58.370> I

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
that's when the combat will begin and I

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.580 
that's when the combat will begin and I
don't<00:00:59.180> wait<00:00:59.750> for<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.170> attack<00:01:02.200> once<00:01:03.200> he<00:01:03.410> comes

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
don't wait for the attack once he comes

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.219 
don't wait for the attack once he comes
closer<00:01:03.950> at<00:01:04.369> a<00:01:04.430> critical<00:01:04.699> distance<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.720> he

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
closer at a critical distance and he

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.410 
closer at a critical distance and he
wants<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.710> throw<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.979> kick<00:01:07.310> then<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:08.060> protect

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
wants to throw a kick then I protect

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.380 
wants to throw a kick then I protect
myself<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:09.409> way<00:01:12.430> this<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.580> what's<00:01:13.820> necessary

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
myself this way this is what's necessary

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.880 
myself this way this is what's necessary
to<00:01:14.930> do<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.440> protect<00:01:15.770> oneself<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.730> strike

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
to do to protect oneself and to strike

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.200 
to do to protect oneself and to strike
strategy<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.310> as<00:01:19.610> follows

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
strategy is as follows

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.060 
strategy is as follows
we<00:01:20.600> are<00:01:20.720> in<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.080> distance<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.710> when<00:01:21.920> he

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
we are in the distance and when he

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.490 
we are in the distance and when he
places<00:01:22.370> in<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.729> critical<00:01:23.210> distance<00:01:23.450> then<00:01:24.229> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
places in the critical distance then the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.980 
places in the critical distance then the
combat<00:01:24.890> begins<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.550> I<00:01:25.909> don't<00:01:26.240> wait<00:01:26.540> for<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
combat begins and I don't wait for the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.770 
combat begins and I don't wait for the
attack<00:01:27.260> but<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:27.800> rather<00:01:28.130> enter<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.030> at<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
attack but I rather enter and at the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.590 
attack but I rather enter and at the
same<00:01:29.990> time<00:01:30.229> I<00:01:30.290> protect<00:01:30.800> myself<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.460> must<00:01:32.420> have

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
same time I protect myself you must have

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.480 
same time I protect myself you must have
seen<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:33.020> when<00:01:33.290> entering<00:01:33.680> I<00:01:33.920> didn't<00:01:34.220> enter

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
seen that when entering I didn't enter

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.670 
seen that when entering I didn't enter
in<00:01:34.670> any<00:01:34.820> way<00:01:35.030> but<00:01:35.510> rather<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:36.080> protect<00:01:36.500> myself

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
in any way but rather I protect myself

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.180 
in any way but rather I protect myself
against<00:01:37.520> his<00:01:37.729> kick<00:01:38.000> by<00:01:38.990> lifting<00:01:39.229> my<00:01:39.830> knee<00:01:39.890> I

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
against his kick by lifting my knee I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.850 
against his kick by lifting my knee I
protect<00:01:41.060> myself<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.720> way<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.229> if<00:01:42.770> he

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
protect myself this way and if he

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.080 
protect myself this way and if he
doesn't<00:01:43.250> strike<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.420> may<00:01:44.750> attack
