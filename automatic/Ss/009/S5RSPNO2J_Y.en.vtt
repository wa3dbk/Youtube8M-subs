00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.410
 Hello such in this that I come to 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.240
 leave this video that as you see in the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.750
 top part is about this 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.980
 product that for me is something miraculous 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.310
 because the truth is that I was already 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.610
 looking to be one for me what 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.950
 is my skin too oily 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.140
 and well before I go into mine 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.050
 I want to tell you a little more about 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.150
 of milk of magnesia what is it used for? 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.150
 what other uses can you give them? 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.740
 so that they know more than anything a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.410
 little more 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.410
 because the permanence as you already know is 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.570
 It is a product to relieve 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.059
 even some doctors also 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.829
 can prescribe for those skins very 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.829
 very sensitive 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.760
 especially in the underarm area that does not 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.399
 tolerate some surplus for example a 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.159
 deodorant too much with too much 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.049
 perfume that can not tolerate it because a 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.760
 little bit of this helps to calm that area 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.400
 just like I did 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.020
 awaited by my face for me and for my 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.770
 fat appearance that I had in my 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.710
 face and then the first video I saw in 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.100
 the stand of youtube iphone ter or something 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.110
 so you know her 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.270
 she was talking about milk of magnesia 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.359
 of what she has 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.119
 the benefit that yesterday saw and interested me 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:43.939
 very much what I did then go to 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.939
 the pharmacy and buy more a little boat 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.240
 or four weeks what they do is also 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.469
 the milk of magnesia is magnify 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.710
 our face applying it in the morning 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:00.320
 during before our makeup we 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.640
 can notify the face in what it is 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.250
 in this area tel 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.700
 can help us a lot to remove the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.369
 brightness even if we have some 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.520
 redness of grains pickets of moscos si 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.920
 we have some 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.590
 some injury to our face this we 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.019
 You can really help 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.730
 to calm down accelerate a little more than 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.459
 been somewhat knowing enough 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.160
 nice for my face has been something 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.780
 miraculous 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.590
 because it helps me a lot to calm down 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.569
 those shines that come out in my face 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.730
 both in the zone t and the zone of my 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.090
 cheeks on my eyelids everything had 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.400
 very fatty and this has helped me a lot 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.709
 for some girls they have ours to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.440
 same as mine very very fatty I 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.209
 I recommend that you use a moisturizer 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.590
 after the choice magnesia for 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.890
 moisturize certain areas of our face 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.050
 that sometimes we can try to resect 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.480
 or doing without wanting to do not miss us almost 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:09.680
 everything as is the area of ​​our legs 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.310
 they are quite hydrated and it is very 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.860
 very 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.620
 very important that we take care of those areas or 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.319
 well if we use a contour of a cream 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.739
 Eye contour is also very good 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.780
 It is highly recommended for girls who 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.650
 they have the complexion 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.709
 normal have already seen that as I comment 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.030
 They can be very dry and even 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.990
 it can irritate 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.720
 but then if you have the area of ​​very, very 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.880
 fat and in other parts of this shift not 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.340
 you have dry then you can only 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.800
 Apply a little droplet on what is the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.020
 area you spread it very well and then 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.140
 applied moisturizer so you do not get 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.220
 cause no problem if passing two or 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.590
 three days you already feel something 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.880
 irritation or something on your skin for better 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.520
 suspend the and 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.670
 and better to look for alternatives in my case 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.290
 I'm doing very well it 's going very well with this 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.140
 with milk of magnesia I use it 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.540
 before I apply makeup me 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.970
 with a clean face washed and everything 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.580
 I apply 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.850
 I put on a moisturizer as my base 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.850
 of makeup 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.110
 very well with dust and nothing happens 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.720
 it helps me pretty much controls the brightness 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.150
 during the day my makeup takes me 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.600
 some 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.139
 13 controls untouched or is like the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.330
 5 hours and I speak 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.819
 little shine over here is for the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.360
 t zone and then there is already retired with a 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:53.120
 Kleenex and tape already only applied the 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.400
 Kleenex and remove the excess fat and 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.620
 this is going very well, they help me but 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.409
 Be very careful not to leave with 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.389
 with the opinion and use the waves and if you see 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.270
 as I tell them if they see any reaction is 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.159
 favorable after two or three three 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.139
 times that they are being applied for 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:13.430
 suspend it and go with a dermatologist 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.740
 so they get it done and 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.350
 because everything in excess also makes 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.780
 hurts 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.000
 also investigate that the lesson 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.570
 magnesia can sometimes 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.720
 get to clog the pores but if 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.440
 we have a routine where 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.650
 let's include the weekly installation or 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.420
 daily exploration this can help us 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.190
 enough so that your pores if you 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.320
 I recommend that you remove it very well 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.050
 before using it 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.900
 so that its consistency is a bit more 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.300
 specific 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.659
 I use it 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.050
 we have thought that way and even though it is the 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.050
 spray 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.880
 by applying it only goes so 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.880
 I need 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.830
 and left dry on what is the fan 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.529
 of the work my skin 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.199
 Then he applied the 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.599
 my moisturizer and with the 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:17.120
 universal and so good girls I hope 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:20.660
 that this has served 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.330
 this opinion of milk of magnesia 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.610
 If you have any doubt any comments 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.910
