00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
then she escaped up in this and he's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.959 
then she escaped up in this and he's
shooting<00:00:40.770> these<00:00:41.280> flick<00:00:42.180> missiles<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
shooting these flick missiles and

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
shooting these flick missiles and
Superman<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.600> behind<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.289> grabs<00:00:46.530> them<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
Superman right behind and grabs them and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.569 
Superman right behind and grabs them and
put<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.120> Flex<00:00:48.390> none<00:00:48.629> from<00:00:48.750> hitting<00:00:48.989> her<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
put the Flex none from hitting her and

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
put the Flex none from hitting her and
this<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:51.000> ladders<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.960> most<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
this is like ladders but it's most I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
this is like ladders but it's most I
think<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.370> whole<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> doesn't<00:00:54.239> show<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
think this whole it doesn't show it

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.889 
think this whole it doesn't show it
but<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.500> think<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> movie<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
but I think this is like in the movie it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.840 
but I think this is like in the movie it
will<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.199> attached<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.550> take<00:00:59.730> an

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
will be attached to this I think take an

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
will be attached to this I think take an
escape<00:01:00.270> pod<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.629> something<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.680> does<00:01:01.859> open

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
escape pod or something and it does open

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.350 
escape pod or something and it does open
and<00:01:02.640> close<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> seat<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.150> there

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
foot missiles shoot I really like this

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.760 
foot missiles shoot I really like this
set<00:01:50.759> um<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> flick<00:01:52.619> missiles

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
set um I don't like the flick missiles

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.999 
set um I don't like the flick missiles
they<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.460> shoot<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:55.009> like

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
they don't shoot really well see like

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.870 
they don't shoot really well see like
that's<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.299> pretty<00:01:58.310> but<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that's it it's pretty but it's up in the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.649 
that's it it's pretty but it's up in the
sky<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.340> don't<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> lot<00:02:03.329> for

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
sky so I think you don't get a lot for

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.410 
sky so I think you don't get a lot for
$25<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:04.680> was<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> lot<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.100> money<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.640> don't

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
$25 there was a lot of money and don't

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.020 
$25 there was a lot of money and don't
get<00:02:06.570> much<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.079> $25<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.489> part

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
get much for $25 just this little part

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.740 
get much for $25 just this little part
and<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.590> i<00:02:10.619> thought<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.099> was<00:02:11.220> should<00:02:11.489> have

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
and this so i thought it was should have

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.370 
and this so i thought it was should have
more<00:02:11.960> like<00:02:12.260> 17<00:02:13.100> or<00:02:13.130> 18<00:02:13.370> instead<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.240> 25<00:02:14.720> this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
more like 17 or 18 instead of 25 this

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.890 
more like 17 or 18 instead of 25 this
