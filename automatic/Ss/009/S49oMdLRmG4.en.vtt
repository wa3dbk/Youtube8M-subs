suited<00:02:08.349> for<00:02:08.410> coach<00:02:08.679> but<00:02:08.890> obviously<00:02:09.130> we<00:02:09.250> ought

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
suited for coach but obviously we ought

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
suited for coach but obviously we ought
to<00:02:09.369> make<00:02:09.459> an<00:02:09.580> adjustment<00:02:09.670> because<00:02:10.119> they

to make an adjustment because they

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
against this with that lineup so we

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.300
