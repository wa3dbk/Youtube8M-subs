00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it's pretty simple and to the point but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.260 
it's pretty simple and to the point but
you<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.500> few<00:00:47.039> loading<00:00:47.640> screens<00:00:48.000> like

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.560 
you do get a few loading screens like
for<00:00:48.570> example<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.079> open<00:00:49.379> eyes<00:00:49.590> tunes<00:00:49.950> here

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
for example if I open eyes tunes here

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.939 
for example if I open eyes tunes here
you<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.289> loading<00:00:52.620> screen

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.279 
you get it like a little loading screen
and<00:00:53.190> heads<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:54.020> lock<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.350> unlock<00:00:55.649> noises

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
and heads like lock and unlock noises

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.580 
and heads like lock and unlock noises
and<00:00:58.670> that<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> number<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.440> basically<00:01:01.440> why<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and that is number two basically why I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.080 
and that is number two basically why I
like<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.949> room<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
like this room is just because of the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.359 
like this room is just because of the
overall<00:01:03.420> design<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.199> icons<00:01:04.680> looks<00:01:05.040> really

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
nice and well done so that is number two

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.560 
nice and well done so that is number two
and<00:01:11.250> coming<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.790> number<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and coming in at number one we have

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.050

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
android HD honeycomb and you could

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.609 
android HD honeycomb and you could
probably<00:01:15.210> already<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:15.900> why<00:01:16.080> i<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.590> just

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
probably already see why i like it just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that you have going on there and even if

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.219

going<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> i<00:01:26.299> really<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.689> design<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
going on i really like that design and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.310 
going on i really like that design and
it<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:29.100> reminds<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.700> Android<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it just reminds you of Android and the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.310 
it just reminds you of Android and the
icons<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.340> pretty<00:01:32.549> nice<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
icons are pretty nice as well so you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
icons are pretty nice as well so you
just<00:01:34.470> take<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> look<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> few<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> them<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
just take a look at a few of them and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.140 
just take a look at a few of them and
also<00:01:36.900> why<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.610> changes<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
also why like is because it changes the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
also why like is because it changes the
UI<00:01:39.390> around<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.500> loot<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.860> music

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
UI around like you loot your music

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.969 
UI around like you loot your music
player<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.610> got<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:42.090> green<00:01:43.079> play/pause<00:01:43.950> button

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
player you got a green play/pause button

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.429 
player you got a green play/pause button
and<00:01:44.820> uh<00:01:45.890> yeah<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.070> gives<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.549> new<00:01:47.790> look<00:01:48.439> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
and uh yeah it just gives a new look so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.499 
and uh yeah it just gives a new look so
overall<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.060> most

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
overall this is like one of the most

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
overall this is like one of the most
complete<00:01:51.869> themes<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:53.100> why<00:01:53.340> it's

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
complete themes and that's why it's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.330 
complete themes and that's why it's
number<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:54.110> definitely<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.290> android<00:01:56.009> HD

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
number one definitely get android HD

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.709 
number one definitely get android HD
honeycomb<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.939> probably<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> best

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
honeycomb is probably one of the best

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.620 
honeycomb is probably one of the best
things<00:01:57.869> I've<00:01:58.409> seen<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.979> while<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.630> that
