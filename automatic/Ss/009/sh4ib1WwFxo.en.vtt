00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.590
 human factors in decision 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.509
 our decision is to chip each and every 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.039
 I use that word of flaking. 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.599
 I think there are already a lot of people 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.840
 my back 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.480
 by the way my mother spoke is chipping 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.559
 but I have a friend who talks a lot 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.790
 And that word I remembered beautiful but the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.010
 indecision 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.040
 She's an interesting thing, right? 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.000
 I was watching a comment on the tv where 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.000
 a girl, right? 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.199
 had packed all the trousseaus had 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.729
 prepared to dig had already two fords 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.400
 Neither, and she said no, it's not going to happen. 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.570
 I can not marry now I'm already 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.879
 with doubts 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.650
 Then she had so many doubts she started. 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.080
 to present this in the tv itself 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.400
 saying look I have not know not 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.800
 I can do this, it's a situation. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.870
 that when we hear the person talking 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.500
 It seems the answer is simple, is not it you? 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.450
 do the couple decide, will not you and the person 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.240
 You may even decide but I think 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.680
 indecision is a little compound 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.110
 plus neat and full of indy components is a 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.390
 composed of more leads I 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.460
 would be more correct derivations 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.170
 of things that were happening 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.909
 in our lives 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.270
 Mother's marriage often did not 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.930
 right or the difficulties that the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.210
 Someone 's wedding had 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.180
 have influenced you and it is a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.990
 we can not shut the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.659
 mouth 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.479
 even because our life has to flow from 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.360
 legal form in a quiet way right 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.030
 late life is anyway not right 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.289
 make a nice life make a living 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 Nice you need accurate time. 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.549
 try to see situations with more 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.519
 clarity 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.049
 I do not know, that's ok, I'm talking about 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.870
 a situation I saw on TV that was a 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.470
 who had been reiki and who had not 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.160
 knows to marry arrudão 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.520
 It's no use, you're staying eight years. 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.500
 kong 10 years with someone and find here the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.720
 jet a long time does not work like this 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.090
 Yeah, I think we have a route. 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.550
 to know the person and this route 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.950
 he can not be all muddled by 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.620
 our emotions than our desires 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.580
 for our needs right who we 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.890
 We do 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.930
 then eight years will not make any 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.050
 difference because there are people who are there 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.459
 20 years and an unhappy day and 20 years right? 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.360
 I think you have to have common sense in 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.070
 relationship has to have a lot of talk right 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.640
 But we're going, you do not want to. 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.280
 stay 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.130
 yes yes the person who does not want to lose the 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.870
 physical and sexual contact with her 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.990
 because I missed a lot of thing but 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.840
 also if you do not want to see the 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.330
 life right to the reality of life is not only 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.209
 this reality is not several things 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.709
 What do we have that our 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.260
 available right 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.100
 I think sex is such a compound 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.590
 the 23 percent in our complexity 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.050
 spiritual emotional right 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.060
 it is important of course that it is all that 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.489
 You have is important, but you have to 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.800
 be done in the right proportions and 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.489
 our relationship with the other time agent 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.040
 of I love you business deal 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.580
 you and nobody lived a year with the person 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.900
 It's called a two year old amateur. 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.739
 not people 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.620
 When we are love, we call everyone and 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.709
 you choose a person to choose this 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.989
 person there demands time and only has the 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.230
 and discovering that it is an issue is not only 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.519
 You love and you do not accept people. 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.140
 should be to find out if that person 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.820
 can follow in your life 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.239
 Indecision is the cause of indecision in 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.760
 work is iron work talking our 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.860
 but I do not know if I stay, your son has 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.080
 what to think about the things of the stop 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.960
 It makes a pit stop and speaks like that is good. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.510
 this work is what I'll do I 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.460
 I need it because if you have 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.810
 work need 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.240
 the rest is no longer worth anything 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.560
 You need to work to do 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.900
 but I do not like it but you have to 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.669
 work to earn your buck and 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.500
 getting organized to do something 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.320
 What do you like in the front? 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.360
 in fact then everything is a way 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.600
 logical intelligence and common sense 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.790
 maybe a lot of chat is too much 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.180
 a lot of brainstorming with other people 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.260
 that can say anything but in 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.110
 decision 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.220
 It will always work in our 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.900
 course of emotional cake, which is 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.260
 so I want to be a thing but I 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.320
 I'm doing this, I did not have to do it. 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:19.210
 you have need now you have things 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.919
 you do not need to make and decide 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.919
 something is always against us not 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.440
 it's against the other 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.570
 notes there in the point of view also 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.790
 wrong do not send me an email saying 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.860
 An idea of ​​what you're talking about now is 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.220
 my point of view you have the right to 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.690
 to have your own decision is something that 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.080
 people who pay for the duck 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.990
 You have no right way and decide by a 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.020
 way if your life is decided and 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.669
 It can be against or in favor of you, huh? 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.680
 so it's better if we reflect 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.400
 enough about what we have to 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.740
 do 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.900
 I always do that thing of saying if 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.640
 clinging sheets of paper puts it all 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.039
 which is positive on a leaf all that is 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.539
 negative on the other and after the scale 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.160
 You will see which side you have to 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:09.710
 that's just it 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:12.020
 if you talk but it's hard, look, I know 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:17.690
 difficult decision so do not 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.310
 we're talking about indecision when you 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.070
 You have to make the decision if you have to 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.229
 exceed your fears your 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.320
 lack in history everything that is thing 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.960
 that bothers you emotionally and maybe 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.870
 You do not have the strength to do this, do not you? 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.590
 so it's a good idea that we 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.500
 clarify seek help if it is the case and 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.570
 seek guidance a single orientation 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.440
 can not solve everyone has to 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.530
 do 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.480
 a therapy then exists that have to 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.040
 get advice from several people 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.470
 continue to question until a 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.620
 When you speak I believe that for 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:59.220
 here on this goes, right? 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.710
 is this our site is the www points between 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.900

 owner of astral paralysis course

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:29.190
 Zero participate in it as you go to

 And will our people tell you that it's 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.850
 You know what I think, I know I will. 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.950
 having to learn a lot is not a 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.530
 this here but I would very much like the 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.550
 people could be better than us 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.150
 are 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:52.400
 So that's it, people take care of themselves. 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.400
 next human factors
