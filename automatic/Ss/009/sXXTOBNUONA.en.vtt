ken<00:00:18.510> son<00:00:18.900> which<00:00:19.260> means<00:00:19.560> they<00:00:19.830> were<00:00:19.890> grown<00:00:20.760> in

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.550 
ken son which means they were grown in
Kumamoto<00:00:21.840> Prefecture<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:23.180> I<00:00:24.470> noticed<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
Kumamoto Prefecture and I noticed that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920 
Kumamoto Prefecture and I noticed that
here<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.920> Japan<00:00:26.279> they<00:00:26.460> always<00:00:26.730> put<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.570> always

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
here in Japan they always put not always

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.769 
here in Japan they always put not always
but<00:00:28.170> usually<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.939> package<00:00:29.939> tomatoes<00:00:30.480> in

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
but usually the package tomatoes in

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.310 
but usually the package tomatoes in
these<00:00:31.019> plastic<00:00:31.800> containers<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
these plastic containers like this and

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.600 
these plastic containers like this and
they<00:00:34.320> always<00:00:35.030> put<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> tomato<00:00:36.480> tops<00:00:37.110> down<00:00:37.610> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
they always put the tomato tops down so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
they always put the tomato tops down so
you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.570> bottom<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you can see this is the bottom of the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.500 
you can see this is the bottom of the
package<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.550> tomato<00:00:41.850> tops<00:00:42.149> are<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
package and the tomato tops are on the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
package and the tomato tops are on the
bottom<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.739> believe<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.280> reason<00:00:44.430> they<00:00:44.610> do

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
bottom and I believe the reason they do

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.029 
bottom and I believe the reason they do
this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> tomatoes<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.440> old

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
this is because if the tomatoes are old

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.910 
this is because if the tomatoes are old
or<00:00:47.690> they're<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.590> high<00:00:49.890> quality

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
or they're not like really high quality

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.490 
or they're not like really high quality
tomatoes<00:00:50.730> usually<00:00:51.180> around<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> tomato<00:00:52.170> tops

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
tomatoes usually around the tomato tops

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
tomatoes usually around the tomato tops
it's<00:00:52.770> green<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.579> discolored<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.420> something<00:00:54.870> so

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it's green or discolored or something so

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.060 
it's green or discolored or something so
they<00:00:55.649> put<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.430> facing<00:00:56.820> down<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
they put them facing down so that the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.979 
they put them facing down so that the
customers<00:00:59.070> can't<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.449> quality<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
customers can't see the quality of the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.109 
customers can't see the quality of the
tomatoes<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.899> then<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.700> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> called

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
tomatoes and then I got this is called

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
America but uh what's amazing is that

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.070 
America but uh what's amazing is that
although<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.470> imported<00:02:18.280> from<00:02:18.460> America
