00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
stove so that the water that we put into

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.529 
stove so that the water that we put into
the<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.920> start<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> boil<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:51.120> once<00:00:51.360> we

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the can can start to boil then once we

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.180 
the can can start to boil then once we
see<00:00:51.750> water<00:00:52.050> vapor<00:00:52.350> come<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.829> we're<00:00:53.100> gonna

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
see water vapor come out we're gonna

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.930 
see water vapor come out we're gonna
wait<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.940> minute<00:00:54.180> before<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.629> take<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.899> off

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
wait one minute before we take it off

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.549 
wait one minute before we take it off
now<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> take<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.510> tongs<00:00:57.809> wrap<00:00:58.410> the

now you want to take your tongs wrap the
can<00:00:58.770> from<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> bottom<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> super<00:01:00.210> quickly

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
can from the bottom and super quickly

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.620 
can from the bottom and super quickly
dump<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> into<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> water<00:01:01.500> ready<00:01:02.039> set<00:01:05.630> whoa

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
dump it into the water ready set whoa

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.539 
dump it into the water ready set whoa
that<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.830> awesome<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.680> was<00:01:10.680> awesome

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that was awesome that was awesome

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.120 
that was awesome that was awesome
let's<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.330> super<00:01:12.900> slo-mo<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> what's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
let's see that in super slo-mo so what's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
let's see that in super slo-mo so what's
going<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.000> nature<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.659> trying

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
going on here is that nature is trying

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.380 
going on here is that nature is trying
to<00:01:22.140> make<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.979> come<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.580> balance<00:01:23.909> so

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to make this can come to a balance so

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
to make this can come to a balance so
with<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.720> water<00:01:25.140> vapor<00:01:25.409> coming<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
with all that water vapor coming out of

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.280 
with all that water vapor coming out of
the<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.460> whenever<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.119> take<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.080> put

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the can whenever you take that and put

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.340 
the can whenever you take that and put
it<00:01:28.320> upside<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:28.979> you're<00:01:29.880> creating<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> seal<00:01:30.960> on

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it upside down you're creating a seal on

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
it upside down you're creating a seal on
the<00:01:31.500> bottom<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.909> none<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the bottom of the can so none of that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.030 
the bottom of the can so none of that
can<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.869> anywhere<00:01:34.290> whenever<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.710> hits<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
can go anywhere whenever it hits the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.980 
can go anywhere whenever it hits the
cold<00:01:35.280> water<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.180> causes<00:01:36.689> all<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
cold water and so it causes all that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
cold water and so it causes all that
water<00:01:37.290> vapor<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.799> turn<00:01:38.040> into<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> couple

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
water vapor to turn into just a couple

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.030 
water vapor to turn into just a couple
of<00:01:39.030> drops<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.570> water<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.140> has<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> bunch<00:01:40.950> of

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
of drops of water and has a bunch of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910 
of drops of water and has a bunch of
extra<00:01:41.490> space<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.119> must<00:01:42.390> enclose<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.740> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
extra space so it must enclose so that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.590 
extra space so it must enclose so that
it<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.189> make<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.850> extra<00:01:45.299> space<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it can make up for the extra space that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
it can make up for the extra space that
was<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.320> whenever<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.920> was<00:01:47.070> heated<00:01:47.340> also

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
was there whenever it was heated also

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.310 
was there whenever it was heated also
you'll<00:01:48.149> notice<00:01:48.329> whenever<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.840> pick<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you'll notice whenever you pick up the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.660 
you'll notice whenever you pick up the
can<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.430> bit<00:01:50.520> of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
can is that there is a little bit of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.670 
can is that there is a little bit of
water<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> canvas<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.810> force<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.350> pulling

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
water in the canvas the force is pulling

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.010 
water in the canvas the force is pulling
it<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.939> whenever<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.570> hits<00:01:54.750> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
it up into the can whenever it hits that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.139 
it up into the can whenever it hits that
cold<00:01:55.320> water<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.280> guys<00:01:56.430> want<00:01:56.670> more<00:01:56.790> videos
