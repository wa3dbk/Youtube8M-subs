as we were walking around fincon in New

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.770 
as we were walking around fincon in New
Orleans<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.610> got<00:00:02.760> asked<00:00:03.030> more<00:00:03.240> than<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.389> handful

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
Orleans we got asked more than a handful

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.510 
Orleans we got asked more than a handful
of<00:00:03.840> times<00:00:04.110> what<00:00:04.529> we<00:00:04.650> recommend<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.370> get

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
of times what we recommend to get

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.430 
of times what we recommend to get
started<00:00:06.000> with<00:00:06.150> video<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.810> told<00:00:07.109> them<00:00:07.259> there's

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
started with video I told them there's

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.690 
started with video I told them there's
three<00:00:07.649> things<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:07.980> they<00:00:08.130> need<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.340> take<00:00:08.490> into

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
three things that they need to take into

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.370 
three things that they need to take into
consideration<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.719> content<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.230> their

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
consideration the content of their

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.410 
consideration the content of their
videos<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.160> audio<00:00:11.490> quality<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:12.000> their<00:00:12.150> videos

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
videos the audio quality of their videos

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.030 
videos the audio quality of their videos
and<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.870> video<00:00:13.110> quality<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.620> their<00:00:13.740> videos

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
and the video quality of their videos

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.589 
and the video quality of their videos
the<00:00:14.400> order<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.000> rank<00:00:15.210> those<00:00:15.420> are

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the order in which I rank those are

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.939 
the order in which I rank those are
actually<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> little<00:00:16.139> counterintuitive<00:00:16.410> I

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
actually a little counterintuitive I

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
actually a little counterintuitive I
think<00:00:17.220> content<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> most<00:00:18.180> important<00:00:18.690> but

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
think content is the most important but

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.170 
think content is the most important but
a<00:00:19.289> close<00:00:19.619> second<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.160> actually<00:00:20.580> audio<00:00:20.939> quality

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
a close second is actually audio quality

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.910 
a close second is actually audio quality
believe<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.720> or<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.140> think<00:00:22.199> audio<00:00:22.710> quality

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
believe it or not I think audio quality

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.620 
believe it or not I think audio quality
and<00:00:23.250> videos<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.730> more<00:00:23.970> important<00:00:24.420> than<00:00:24.510> video

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
and videos is more important than video

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.839 
and videos is more important than video
quality<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.680> pressed<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.580> would<00:00:26.730> actually

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
quality so if pressed I would actually

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.279 
quality so if pressed I would actually
put<00:00:27.090> more<00:00:27.359> money<00:00:27.510> into<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.840> better<00:00:28.050> microphone

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
put more money into a better microphone

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.040 
put more money into a better microphone
than<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> camera<00:00:29.340> itself<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.029> show<00:00:30.210> why<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> say

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
than the camera itself to show why I say

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.510 
than the camera itself to show why I say
that<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> couple<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.949> examples<00:00:32.070> so

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
that I have a couple of examples so

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
that I have a couple of examples so
let's<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.570> clips<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.079> we'll

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
let's go to the clips and then we'll

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.150 
let's go to the clips and then we'll
talk<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.590> afterwards

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
talk about it afterwards

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.430 
talk about it afterwards
so<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.640> example<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.270> iPhone<00:00:37.020> quality

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so this is an example of iPhone quality

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590 
so this is an example of iPhone quality
video<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.850> high<00:00:39.059> end<00:00:39.300> audio

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
video but with a really high end audio

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.920 
video but with a really high end audio
this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> rode<00:00:40.610> nt1-a<00:00:41.640> microphone<00:00:42.540> running

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this is a rode nt1-a microphone running

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.510 
this is a rode nt1-a microphone running
through<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> Toft<00:00:43.469> audio<00:00:43.860> design<00:00:44.190> sound

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
through the Toft audio design sound

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.860 
through the Toft audio design sound
board<00:00:44.850> which<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.090> about<00:00:45.270> four<00:00:45.480> thousand

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
board which is about four thousand

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
board which is about four thousand
dollars<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.770> really<00:00:47.129> nice<00:00:47.280> leveling<00:00:47.789> amp<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
dollars the really nice leveling amp is

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.299 
dollars the really nice leveling amp is
the<00:00:48.600> name<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> compressor<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the name of that compressor and the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.130 
the name of that compressor and the
whole<00:00:50.430> computer<00:00:50.789> setup<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.050> an

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
whole computer setup so this is an

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560 
whole computer setup so this is an
example<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:53.520> nice<00:00:53.699> audio<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.420> with

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
example of really nice audio but with

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
example of really nice audio but with
just<00:00:54.840> okay<00:00:55.260> video<00:00:55.649> quality<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:56.370> here's<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
just okay video quality now here's the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.790 
just okay video quality now here's the
other<00:00:56.820> extreme<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> awesome<00:00:58.530> video
