00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.859
 in Krefeld there are about 100 treasures hidden 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.079
 they are looking for the so-called Geo Kerscher 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.059
 these are modern treasure hunters who play as part of one as well 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 Go DPS device in hand and look for these treasures 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.170
 how it works and how you need it all was a long way off 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.669
 a look 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.789
 Of course, what you really need is the GPS device 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.150
 at pay the device I want in the end can not find the treasure still 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.370
 very important 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.080
 to have a pin with him should not be missing in any basic equipment 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.420
 and that I still take with me 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.380
 up to the example of a calculator 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.630
 a flashlight 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.250
 and that I still have it with me 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.310
 such a small telescope mirror 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.430
 which actually starts such a geo-caching tours 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.090
 between those for me, of course, at home on the PC 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.250
 I'm looking for that 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.420
 Out of the question because I want to search 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.910
 although Roger made me gps the whole team 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.210
 and then you start 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.130
 What is the only thing you need a mirror for now? 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.880
 but you need this player that is appreciated by many 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.840
 on the way hints are hidden 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.590
 the twelve in the form of so small plaques even among those 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.150
 Countries are appropriate 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.910
 and Una this note can be found behind the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.110
 the treasure in the end not and therefore 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.640
 For example, you have Kleint alesco games with you and stuff like that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.000
 to be able to find better 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 What do you personally like about geo-caching? 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.320
 the couple that of course that one 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.240
 Places looks like here I might not have come that way yet 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.580
 you just see Final Four being green is just great Â» 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.030
 what should you call when geo-caching necessarily pay attention 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.970
 Of course you should be fully motivated to respect 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.210
 This includes, for example, the unpaved roads really only hurt 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.590
 if that is really necessary as now in the case where you want to know that 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.620
 the treasure is close by it is here to see that the treasure and 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.240
 Punkrock must be a few meters high 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.580
 and 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.460
 if the biggest tree in the area 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.070
 that could be it 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.430
 because Kershaw often amplify in tree roots or something 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.889
 Gomez I know it could also be a minster 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.859
 If I shiver now 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.779
 actually found Ahmadinejad 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.489
 the most important person has been found is that you search the logbook and the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.669
 Owner writes a nice there and his own name proves that 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.209
 keeps my shape and just neat pen for that one here 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.619
 looks 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:27.439
 as so often 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.109
 Nobody in there appreciates the people next to Fred Durst's ascent 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.549
 After I signed up I can also book items 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.250
 It is important to always exchange this only in equivalent item 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.269
 or higher again may 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.340
 For example, if I capitulated for some of those seven now, for example 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.159
 These times bracket this take not so much value these seven degrees 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.219
 possible if I have not registered logbook and also items 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.699
 bought wanted reported 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:56.079
 and close the whole tightly so that no moisture comes in 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.869
 and so of course the whole well hidden well so that 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.369
 no uninvolved 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:04.059
 but only the treasure hunter Fischer Turbine will find a bit of numbers 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.389
 with greens 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.369
 quite frankly not so 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.369
 he fits is a hobby that brings you out into nature 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:15.179
 you get to know places you would probably never have discovered aslan 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:18.639
 It is relatively cheap and anyone can join 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.899
 and he would like to find a treasure for me
