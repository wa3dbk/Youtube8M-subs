you're watching it right now so there's

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.720 
you're watching it right now so there's
not<00:02:32.500> really<00:02:32.590> too<00:02:32.799> much<00:02:32.830> need<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.250> me<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.459> say

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
not really too much need for me to say

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.030 
not really too much need for me to say
that<00:02:33.760> much<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.830> just<00:02:35.890> plays<00:02:36.519> nice<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
that much but it just plays nice and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.030 
that much but it just plays nice and
just<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.220> generally<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> nice<00:02:40.470> my<00:02:41.470> stage<00:02:41.769> to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040

just is generally a nice my stage to
play<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:44.310> think<00:02:45.310> I've<00:02:45.400> gone<00:02:45.519> through<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.819> one

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
play I think I've gone through that one

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.589 
play I think I've gone through that one
like<00:02:46.090> three<00:02:46.299> times<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:47.440> on<00:02:48.120> ya<00:02:49.120> might<00:02:49.360> liave

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
like three times but on ya might liave

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.539 
like three times but on ya might liave
video<00:02:49.989> made<00:02:50.230> stay<00:02:50.470> if<00:02:50.530> you're<00:02:50.769> unaware<00:02:50.980> well

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
video made stay if you're unaware well

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.680

there<00:02:51.819> Oh<00:02:52.060> six<00:02:53.049> let's<00:02:53.410> play<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:55.420> really

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
there Oh six let's play and I really

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.119 
there Oh six let's play and I really
think<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.930> should<00:02:55.959> rename<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.319> show<00:02:56.680> time<00:02:56.920> to

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
think I should rename that show time to

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.699 
think I should rename that show time to
tweak<00:02:57.370> out<00:02:57.579> because<00:02:57.849> i<00:02:58.140> do<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.410> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
tweak out because i do like the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.890 
tweak out because i do like the
relaxation<00:03:00.370> where<00:03:00.760> i<00:03:00.790> can<00:03:00.970> have<00:03:01.120> while<00:03:01.360> just

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
relaxation where i can have while just

relaxation where i can have while just
playing<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.260> game<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.560> doing<00:03:02.860> commentary
