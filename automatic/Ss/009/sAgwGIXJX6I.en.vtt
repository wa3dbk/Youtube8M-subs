00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
here is I'm running to the left side of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.569 
here is I'm running to the left side of
the<00:00:47.969> screen<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.289> enabling<00:00:49.980> me<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the screen and that is enabling me to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
the screen and that is enabling me to
render<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.360> world<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> spawn

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
render the world so that when I spawn

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.260 
render the world so that when I spawn
into<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> next<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> be

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
into it next all this is going to be

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.569 
into it next all this is going to be
rendered<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.620> pretty<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:55.890> that's<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
rendered so pretty much that's what you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
rendered so pretty much that's what you
do<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.289> point<00:00:58.530> you're

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
do and then so at this point you're

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.340 
do and then so at this point you're
gonna<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.980> third<00:00:59.250> person<00:00:59.430> countdown<00:01:00.350> you

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
gonna have a third person countdown you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.119 
gonna have a third person countdown you
know<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.680> two<00:01:02.039> three<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
know one two three go and then on go is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
know one two three go and then on go is
when<00:01:05.970> we're<00:01:06.240> both<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.659> leave<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.200> I'm

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
when we're both going to leave and I'm

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
when we're both going to leave and I'm
gonna<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.909> bit<00:01:09.030> later<00:01:09.659> than<00:01:09.869> he<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
gonna go a little bit later than he is

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679 
gonna go a little bit later than he is
so<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.010> might<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:11.939> kicked<00:01:12.210> instead

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
so that way I might get kicked instead

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.050 
so that way I might get kicked instead
of<00:01:12.840> actually<00:01:13.290> main<00:01:13.470> menuing<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
of actually main menuing it and so if it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.760 
of actually main menuing it and so if it
worked<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:15.570> message<00:01:16.409> should<00:01:16.590> pop<00:01:16.740> up

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
worked and then message should pop up

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
worked and then message should pop up
just<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.549> right<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> then

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
just like that one right there and then

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.270 
just like that one right there and then
you<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.229> sometimes<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.920> might<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
you know sometimes it might have a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.530 
you know sometimes it might have a
glitch<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> character<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.330> bomb

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
glitch for you to character this is bomb

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
glitch for you to character this is bomb

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and it should bring it back up just like

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.640 
and it should bring it back up just like
mine<00:01:24.869> didn't<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> know<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:28.470> works

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
mine didn't you know so that that works

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.760 
mine didn't you know so that that works
wonderfully<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.409> go<00:01:31.530> back

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
wonderfully so then you just you go back

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.990 
wonderfully so then you just you go back
into<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> last<00:01:32.280> world<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.759> played

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
into the last world that you played

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
into the last world that you played
which<00:01:33.450> should<00:01:33.659> now<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.960> copied<00:01:34.140> over<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
which should now be copied over for the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.289 
which should now be copied over for the
world<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.490> were<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.150> just

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
world that you were just that you just

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.940 
world that you were just that you just
copied<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:36.900> friend<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.530> whoever<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
copied from your friend or whoever you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.289 
copied from your friend or whoever you
do<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.130> from<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.570> now<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:41.299> almost

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
do it from and so now you have a almost

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.940 
do it from and so now you have a almost
completely<00:01:42.750> blank<00:01:43.110> world<00:01:43.350> pretty<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:43.740> what

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
completely blank world pretty much what

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
completely blank world pretty much what
this<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
this will do is that if it's a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.870 
this will do is that if it's a
completely<00:01:45.869> new<00:01:45.990> world<00:01:46.140> it'll<00:01:46.560> make<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> only

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
completely new world it'll make it only

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
completely new world it'll make it only
the<00:01:48.180> things<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> you've<00:01:48.659> rendered<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the things that you've rendered is the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.149 
the things that you've rendered is the
only<00:01:49.560> things<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.159> what

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
only things that you can see and so what

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.830 
only things that you can see and so what
you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.759> shows<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.540> copy

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you know this shows that you can copy

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.420 
you know this shows that you can copy
another<00:01:55.140> person's<00:01:55.560> world<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> will<00:01:56.219> only

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
another person's world but it will only

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.670 
another person's world but it will only
it<00:01:57.149> will<00:01:57.270> only<00:01:57.360> copy<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> stuff<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.560> you've

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it will only copy the stuff that you've

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.370 
it will only copy the stuff that you've
gone<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> rendered<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.930> went<00:02:01.110> ahead<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
gone and rendered so we went ahead and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.280 
gone and rendered so we went ahead and
rendered<00:02:01.619> all<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.390> would<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.750> in

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
rendered all this so what I would do in

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.929 
rendered all this so what I would do in
order<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.619> make<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.920> achievement<00:02:05.399> easier<00:02:05.850> on

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
order to make this achievement easier on

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.819 
order to make this achievement easier on
yourself<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> first<00:02:06.630> thing<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> would

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
yourself is the first thing that I would

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.529 
yourself is the first thing that I would
do<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> probably<00:02:08.429> go<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.910> corruption<00:02:09.179> first

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
do is probably go for corruption first

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.199 
do is probably go for corruption first
because

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
because

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.759 
because
once<00:02:11.629> you<00:02:11.750> get<00:02:11.870> corruption<00:02:12.290> down<00:02:12.439> you<00:02:12.620> can

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
once you get corruption down you can

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.160 
once you get corruption down you can
easily<00:02:12.980> just<00:02:13.810> by<00:02:14.810> purification<00:02:15.680> powder<00:02:15.860> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
easily just by purification powder and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.530 
easily just by purification powder and
hollow<00:02:18.170> seeds<00:02:18.500> from<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.890> Dryad<00:02:19.420> which<00:02:20.420> will

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
hollow seeds from the Dryad which will

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.640 
hollow seeds from the Dryad which will
make<00:02:20.659> your<00:02:20.780> job<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> lot<00:02:21.170> easier

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
make your job a lot easier

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.220 
make your job a lot easier
so<00:02:22.159> just<00:02:22.400> corruption<00:02:23.090> first<00:02:23.329> then<00:02:23.900> use<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
so just corruption first then use the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.530 
so just corruption first then use the
purification<00:02:24.560> powder<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.430> set<00:02:25.760> down<00:02:25.939> a<00:02:26.299> whole

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
purification powder to set down a whole

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.899 
purification powder to set down a whole
bunch<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.099> or<00:02:28.099> get<00:02:28.280> rid<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.549> most<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.819> the

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
bunch of the or get rid of most of the

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.410 
bunch of the or get rid of most of the
corruption<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.780> then<00:02:30.170> plant<00:02:30.409> your<00:02:31.420> plant

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
corruption and then plant your plant

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.259 
corruption and then plant your plant
your<00:02:32.540> hollowed<00:02:33.140> seeds<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:34.579> know<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.120> you

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
your hollowed seeds you know and you

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.550 
your hollowed seeds you know and you
know<00:02:35.329> usually<00:02:35.569> what<00:02:35.870> I'll<00:02:35.959> do<00:02:36.109> is<00:02:36.260> I'll<00:02:36.409> have<00:02:36.439> a

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
know usually what I'll do is I'll have a

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.800 
know usually what I'll do is I'll have a
base<00:02:36.769> house<00:02:37.010> where<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.280> have<00:02:37.459> all<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.329> NPC's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
base house where I have all the NPC's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.300 
base house where I have all the NPC's
living<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> NPC's<00:02:41.500> or<00:02:42.500> not<00:02:43.010> nothing

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
living and then the NPC's or not nothing

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.190 
living and then the NPC's or not nothing
with<00:02:43.400> NPCs<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.180> usually<00:02:44.540> I'll<00:02:45.139> have

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
with NPCs and then usually I'll have

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.800 
with NPCs and then usually I'll have
just<00:02:45.859> a<00:02:45.980> I'll<00:02:46.370> destroy<00:02:46.730> everything<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.599> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
just a I'll destroy everything on the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.210 
just a I'll destroy everything on the
world<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.200> way<00:02:48.319> everything<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.709> blank<00:02:48.980> kind

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
world that way everything is blank kind

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.830 
world that way everything is blank kind
of<00:02:49.280> like<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:49.519> we<00:02:49.609> have<00:02:49.790> here<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.209> blank<00:02:50.690> and

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
of like what we have here just blank and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.030 
of like what we have here just blank and
then<00:02:50.959> I'll<00:02:51.049> have<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.349> little<00:02:51.530> sky<00:02:51.829> bridge

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
then I'll have this little sky bridge

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.759 
then I'll have this little sky bridge
here<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.329> that<00:02:53.480> sky<00:02:53.690> bridge<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.170> what<00:02:54.680> I'm

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
here and so that sky bridge is what I'm

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.710 
here and so that sky bridge is what I'm
gonna<00:02:54.889> be<00:02:55.040> using<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.370> hollow<00:02:55.579> or<00:02:55.879> corrupt<00:02:56.150> and

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
gonna be using the hollow or corrupt and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.599 
gonna be using the hollow or corrupt and
so<00:02:56.870> usually<00:02:57.260> I'm<00:02:57.709> not<00:02:57.950> sure<00:02:58.099> how<00:02:58.220> long<00:02:58.370> this

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
so usually I'm not sure how long this

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.789 
so usually I'm not sure how long this
bridge<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.389> but<00:02:59.569> I<00:02:59.599> have<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.900> at<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.139> three<00:03:00.470> and

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
bridge is but I have it at the three and

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.819 
bridge is but I have it at the three and
tall<00:03:01.549> yeah<00:03:02.209> three<00:03:02.540> tall<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.079> however<00:03:03.379> long<00:03:03.680> in

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
tall yeah three tall and however long in

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.830 
tall yeah three tall and however long in
length<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.879> you<00:03:05.030> know<00:03:05.120> usually<00:03:05.569> if<00:03:05.629> you<00:03:05.720> get

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
length and you know usually if you get

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.960 
length and you know usually if you get
most<00:03:06.079> of<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.290> corrupted<00:03:06.859> or<00:03:07.099> hollowed<00:03:07.639> it'll

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
most of that corrupted or hollowed it'll

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.530
