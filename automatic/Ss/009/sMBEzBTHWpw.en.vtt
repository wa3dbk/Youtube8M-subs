 comments it was coming is that the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.950
 guys, the problem here is the face. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.540
 one more thing you can not take the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.310
 effect was the west that has many 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 comments of this kind do not stay here. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.250
 hunting all the people because it's a 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.680
 public more then it is what 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.590
 It happens the following guys are if you 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.490
 update your windows 8 windows in case 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.780
 huh 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.820
 You will not be able to use 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.009
 transparency there stryker that was 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.580
 problem that makes it transparent where 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.530
 lia 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.260
 he is also that many people had doubt 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.550
 she made another doubt video 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.140
 As for this, but if it really is is the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.730
 people are not getting more because 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.720
 to the updates that Microsoft is 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.190
 making 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.940
 most people who have this 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.210
 problem is those that windows 8.1 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.580
 these people will not be able to update the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.100
 dwd wmm in spend here is the function that 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.830
 lets leaving is transparent so it 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.960
 turns the transparent black so it is 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.110
 a very good thing that microsoft 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.110
 took it because it 's a fucking freshness 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.230
 windows 8 in my opinion sucks 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.660
 man he's kind 12 past when he left 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.209
 everybody I want shit and in mine 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.870
 opinion is that right there for it is a 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.630
 It's crap and I'm not using it anymore. 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.760
 Windows 8 is on and I heard it 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.350
 according to some sources leaving youtube 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.910
 even who has windows 8 is 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.190
 automatically upgrade to the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.560
 windows 8 points 1 and that this year even 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.790
 another version of another 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.739
 English, which has already closed on 28 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.540
 even the professional will now be the new 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.180
 windows with another name that we still 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.280
 do not know what's probably not going 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.360
 be windows 9 as many were 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.090
 saying there but it's galera there's no more 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.010
 what to do to activate the effect was 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.640
 It is if you really want it on windows 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.780
 8 Is there a way, yes, here, do not you? 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.730
 will like him a lot 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.290
 You do not have to format the pc or me. 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.480
 find a program that deletes 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.160
 updates you have made and if you 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.350
 already with 28 points you will have to 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.360
 was to kill even because I do not believe 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.920
 that you can get back with 28 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.080
 unless you still have a 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.380
 restoration saves on your computer the 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.209
 which I find very difficult is because when 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.280
 time passes so the previous points 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.900
 they will be erased not to mention much 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.680
 space on your hd 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.830
 there the way is to format the guys do not have 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.240
 a lot to do here 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.190
 unfortunately more 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.230
 is who you want and activate the effect can 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.540
 It is formatting the sign computers 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.820
 The process I explained in this video is 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.710
 there's a part where I'm teaching ac 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.930
 that appears a little white square here 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.250
 Okay, you can move the mouse over that 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.380
 It will turn red, it will have written. 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.750
 title explain how to leave 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.910
 transparent in case you can not do it is 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.520
 this video is because here or update 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.800
 stock of this other video and who is 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.780
 Anyone who has questions about this video made a 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.360
 another video is also in the description of 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.920
 sicÃ³ does not understand this also 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.690
 here I'm doing now it was just for 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.570
 inform you that you will not have any more 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.790
 The way it is unfortunately will end this 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.280
 stop leaving one of the transparent 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.000
 there's a certainty the guys who want to have 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.250
 a plunger feels a legal transparency is 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.470
 that everton everything else 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.680
 the recommendation is that you are 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.360
 migrating to windows 7 because it is 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.310
 as if it were a windows xp for it is the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.160
 which is what will stay for a long time 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.720
 why because I do not believe that 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.480
 people will get used to it early on 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.330
 a new version of another in douz 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.970
 so this is it people this video here 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.290
 It did not help much in this whole you already 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.600
 are informed that it is not my 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.780
 guilt okay and I preferred to answer the 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.520
 comments for virgil this time here 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.170
 Why a lot of people ask me then? 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.110
 I'll send this video here in 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:03.730
 comments as an answer are people 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.980
 I hope you do not stay 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.020
 annoyed at this is unfortunately the 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.090
 microsoft is doing a lot of bossa 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.470
 shitting it all like youtube did not 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.680
 is in several changes 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.870
 it's no longer today that it's not cool right? 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.750
 but I hope you all have 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.340
 understand and comment on any questions 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.380
 down I'll be doing the 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.670
 possible to help you are in your 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.380
 start 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.380
 a hug and where I went
