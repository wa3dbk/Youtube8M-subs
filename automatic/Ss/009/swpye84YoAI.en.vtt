00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
little negative thing I have to say

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
little negative thing I have to say
about<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.590> thing<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
about this thing is actually that it's a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.910 
about this thing is actually that it's a
little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:30.960> hard<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> remove<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.770> your

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
little bit hard to remove with your

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.670 
little bit hard to remove with your
makeup<00:01:32.250> remover<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.390> mean<00:01:33.720> basically<00:01:34.259> just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
makeup remover but I mean basically just

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.679 
makeup remover but I mean basically just
makes<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.640> stick<00:01:36.150> longer<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.630> guess

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
makes it you know stick longer I guess

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.260 
makes it you know stick longer I guess
on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> eyelashes<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> went
