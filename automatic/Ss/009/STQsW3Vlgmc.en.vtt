00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
alright so here's the complete loop that

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.059 
alright so here's the complete loop that
I<00:00:04.529> have<00:00:04.799> as<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.220> now<00:00:05.720> and<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:07.140> don't<00:00:07.950> really

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
I have as in now and I don't really

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.650 
I have as in now and I don't really
think<00:00:08.189> pressure<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.360> be<00:00:09.480> too<00:00:09.630> much

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
think pressure is going to be too much

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.009 
think pressure is going to be too much
of<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.050> problem<00:00:10.849> however<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:12.179> no<00:00:12.660> idea<00:00:12.809> i'm

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
of a problem however I have no idea i'm

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.020 
of a problem however I have no idea i'm
talking<00:00:13.349> about<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.889> please<00:00:14.309> feel<00:00:14.700> free<00:00:14.759> to

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
talking about so please feel free to

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.730 
talking about so please feel free to
correct<00:00:15.179> me<00:00:18.020> there's<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.230> T<00:00:19.380> line<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:21.740> right

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
correct me there's the T line and right

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.609 
correct me there's the T line and right
now<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.400> completely<00:00:23.789> fooled<00:00:25.880> and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
now it's just completely fooled and

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.509 
now it's just completely fooled and
bubbles<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.740> forming<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.369> they

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
bubbles are forming here like they

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.970 
bubbles are forming here like they
should<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.060> they're<00:00:30.539> starting<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> slowly<00:00:31.170> but

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
should so they're starting to slowly but

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.280 
should so they're starting to slowly but
surely<00:00:32.369> collect<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> t-line<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.140> that's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
surely collect on the t-line so that's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.209 
surely collect on the t-line so that's
good<00:00:35.360> looking<00:00:36.360> pretty<00:00:36.570> clean<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.500> out

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
good looking pretty clean all that out

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.090 
good looking pretty clean all that out
take<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:39.110> very<00:00:40.110> quiet<00:00:40.350> pump<00:00:40.770> I'll<00:00:40.920> Larry

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
take your very quiet pump I'll Larry

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.690 
take your very quiet pump I'll Larry
like<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> power<00:00:41.820> seems<00:00:42.180> pretty<00:00:42.360> good<00:00:43.700> but

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
like it the power seems pretty good but

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.880 
like it the power seems pretty good but
it's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.329> little<00:00:45.360> too<00:00:45.629> bright<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:47.149> hopefully

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
it's a little too bright but hopefully

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.660 
it's a little too bright but hopefully
there's<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:51.140> radiator<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.379> mean<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> yeah

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
there's that radiator I mean the yeah

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.010 
there's that radiator I mean the yeah
the<00:00:53.760> radiator<00:00:54.090> back<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:57.020> there

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the radiator back there and then there

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.260 
the radiator back there and then there
is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:59.449> how<00:01:00.449> i<00:01:00.480> mounted<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.070> rad<00:01:02.090> on<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
is the how i mounted the rad on the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.800 
is the how i mounted the rad on the
front<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> antec<00:01:04.110> 902<00:01:05.270> pretty<00:01:06.270> stereotype

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
front of the antec 902 pretty stereotype

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.920 
front of the antec 902 pretty stereotype
case<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.530> uh<00:01:07.909> works<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.090> good<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.390> this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
case but uh works pretty good for this

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
case but uh works pretty good for this
again<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.970> pump<00:01:12.360> that's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
again and then there's the pump that's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.380 
again and then there's the pump that's
all<00:01:12.780> gutted<00:01:13.549> with<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> trunk<00:01:15.090> sirs

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
all gutted with all of the trunk sirs

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
all gutted with all of the trunk sirs
there's<00:01:15.689> there's<00:01:15.990> nothing<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.700> except

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
there's there's nothing in there except

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.580 
there's there's nothing in there except
for<00:01:18.140> well<00:01:19.490> water<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:23.090> these<00:01:24.090> lines<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.750> very

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
for well water and these lines have very

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560 
for well water and these lines have very
little<00:01:25.799> pressure<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.460> feel<00:01:26.700> well<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.270> mean<00:01:27.450> they

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
little pressure I feel well I mean they

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
little pressure I feel well I mean they
have<00:01:27.689> pressure<00:01:27.960> obviously<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.950> don't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
have pressure obviously but I don't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.100 
have pressure obviously but I don't
really<00:01:29.759> feel<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.119> water<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.720> through<00:01:30.840> them

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
really feel a water going through them

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.810 
really feel a water going through them
so<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.439> hoping<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.159> lot<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:34.610> flow<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
so I'm hoping then a lot of the flow is

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.700 
so I'm hoping then a lot of the flow is
entrapped<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.720> there

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:53.140 

you

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.300 

all<00:01:54.150> right<00:01:54.330> so<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.810> December<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.590> 25th

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
all right so it's December the 25th

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.700 
all right so it's December the 25th
meaning<00:01:56.790> it's<00:01:56.910> Christmas<00:01:57.390> morning<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:58.440> I<00:01:58.560> was

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
meaning it's Christmas morning and I was

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.090 
meaning it's Christmas morning and I was
letting<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.070> thing<00:01:59.130> run<00:02:00.590> overnight<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.010> it's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
letting this thing run overnight so it's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.940 
letting this thing run overnight so it's
been<00:02:02.190> running<00:02:02.370> for<00:02:02.490> least<00:02:03.090> 12<00:02:03.960> hours<00:02:04.290> or<00:02:04.770> more

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
been running for least 12 hours or more

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.760 
been running for least 12 hours or more
and<00:02:05.870> there's<00:02:08.330> thankfully<00:02:09.330> no<00:02:09.720> leaking<00:02:10.530> looks

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
and there's thankfully no leaking looks

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
and there's thankfully no leaking looks
like<00:02:10.979> Santa<00:02:11.540> okay<00:02:12.540> gave<00:02:13.020> me<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.320> asked<00:02:14.330> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
like Santa okay gave me what I asked and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.930 
like Santa okay gave me what I asked and
considering<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:16.260> first<00:02:16.560> loop<00:02:16.980> that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
considering this is my first loop that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.420 
considering this is my first loop that
I've<00:02:18.060> built<00:02:18.830> I'm<00:02:19.830> pretty<00:02:20.520> lucky<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.430> last

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
I've built I'm pretty lucky and so last

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.490 
I've built I'm pretty lucky and so last
night<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:26.660> feel<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.900> managed<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.320> get

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
night I was I feel like I managed to get

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410 
night I was I feel like I managed to get
at<00:02:28.680> least<00:02:28.710> ninety<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.700> ninety-five<00:02:30.060> percent

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
at least ninety to ninety-five percent

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.630 
at least ninety to ninety-five percent
of<00:02:30.780> all<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.500> air<00:02:31.680> out<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.160> loop<00:02:32.340> there's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
of all the air out of the loop there's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.910 
of all the air out of the loop there's
still<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.300> good<00:02:34.170> deal<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:35.030> there's<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
still a good deal of there's like a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.100 
still a good deal of there's like a
pocket<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.010> air<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.430> can't<00:02:38.790> really<00:02:39.150> get

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
pocket of air that I can't really get

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.920 
pocket of air that I can't really get
out<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:40.620> somewhere<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.120> radiator

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
out and it's somewhere in the radiator

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.580 
out and it's somewhere in the radiator
but<00:02:43.459> all<00:02:44.459> also<00:02:45.450> good<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.780> far<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.380> I'll

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
but all also good so far so I'll

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.280 
but all also good so far so I'll
probably<00:02:47.240> maybe<00:02:48.240> later<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.840> day<00:02:48.870> maybe

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
probably maybe later on the day maybe

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.960 
probably maybe later on the day maybe
the<00:02:49.500> 26<00:02:49.950> actually<00:02:50.550> start<00:02:52.370> plugging<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.610> stuff

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the 26 actually start plugging in stuff

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.820 
the 26 actually start plugging in stuff
and<00:02:54.330> testing<00:02:54.900> temperatures<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.530> thing<00:02:55.740> to

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
and testing temperatures and thing to

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.729 
and testing temperatures and thing to
see<00:02:55.860> there's<00:02:56.130> any<00:02:56.310> change<00:02:57.440> alright<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.620> this

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
see there's any change alright so this

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.259 
see there's any change alright so this
is<00:02:59.510> continuation<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> log<00:03:01.140> um<00:03:02.060> puters<00:03:03.060> on

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
is continuation of the log um puters on

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.720 
is continuation of the log um puters on
I<00:03:03.660> don't<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.470> one<00:03:05.400> hundred<00:03:05.640> forty

tests<00:03:29.239> possibly<00:03:30.239> fine<00:03:30.480> obviously<00:03:31.410> I'm<00:03:31.470> while

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
tests possibly fine obviously I'm while

tests possibly fine obviously I'm while
we're<00:03:31.739> talking<00:03:31.860> right<00:03:32.130> now<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.519> then<00:03:33.709> over

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
we're talking right now and then over

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:42.830 
we're talking right now and then over
here<00:03:37.640> seems<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.910> be<00:03:39.000> locked<00:03:39.269> at<00:03:39.660> about<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:41.840> hope

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
here seems to be locked at about I hope

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.340 
here seems to be locked at about I hope
I<00:03:42.959> said<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.200> could<00:03:43.320> shell<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.790> 25<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.030> 26<00:03:45.540> looks

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
I said you could shell it 25 to 26 looks

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.830 
I said you could shell it 25 to 26 looks
like<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.620> was<00:03:46.769> spelled<00:03:46.980> up<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.250> 26<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.570> Prime

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
like it was spelled up to 26 but Prime

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.120 
like it was spelled up to 26 but Prime
has<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.290> tendency<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:51.620> be<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> little<00:03:52.680> overkill

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
has a tendency to be a little overkill

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.890 
has a tendency to be a little overkill
so<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.780> waters<00:03:55.560> getting<00:03:55.680> warmed<00:03:56.130> up<00:03:56.250> now

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
so and the waters getting warmed up now

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.950 
so and the waters getting warmed up now
but<00:03:57.900> um

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
but um

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.040 
but um
it's<00:04:00.260> about<00:04:01.000> um<00:04:02.770> 10<00:04:03.770> Celsius<00:04:04.450> less<00:04:05.450> than<00:04:05.930> what

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
it's about um 10 Celsius less than what

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.630 
it's about um 10 Celsius less than what
I<00:04:06.080> had<00:04:06.290> before<00:04:06.440> so<00:04:06.890> there's<00:04:07.070> definitely<00:04:07.220> a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
I had before so there's definitely a

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.860 
I had before so there's definitely a
upgrade<00:04:10.840> that's<00:04:11.840> good<00:04:12.110> um<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:14.450> think

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
upgrade that's good um and I think

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.690 
upgrade that's good um and I think
because<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.740> didn't<00:04:16.280> test<00:04:16.760> much<00:04:17.320> with<00:04:18.320> uh<00:04:18.700> you

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
because I I didn't test much with uh you

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.210 
because I I didn't test much with uh you
know<00:04:19.820> not<00:04:20.600> an<00:04:20.750> overclocked<00:04:21.230> but<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.739> feeling

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
know not an overclocked but I feeling

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.790 
know not an overclocked but I feeling
this<00:04:22.250> thing<00:04:22.520> has<00:04:22.730> lots<00:04:22.970> of<00:04:23.320> water<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.470> heat<00:04:24.740> up

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
this thing has lots of water to heat up

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.040 
this thing has lots of water to heat up
but<00:04:25.460> when<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:25.880> starts<00:04:26.090> getting<00:04:26.150> hot<00:04:26.450> it's<00:04:26.780> you

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
but when it starts getting hot it's you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.310 
but when it starts getting hot it's you
know<00:04:27.140> had<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> hard<00:04:27.500> time<00:04:27.560> cooling<00:04:27.980> it<00:04:28.100> but<00:04:28.250> um

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
know had a hard time cooling it but um

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.350 
know had a hard time cooling it but um
this<00:04:30.320> wasn't<00:04:30.500> really<00:04:30.740> appointing<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.550> point

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
this wasn't really appointing the point

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.000 
this wasn't really appointing the point
of<00:04:32.480> this<00:04:32.600> whole<00:04:32.660> project<00:04:33.140> wasn't<00:04:33.500> even<00:04:33.770> really

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
of this whole project wasn't even really

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.950 
of this whole project wasn't even really
cooling<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:35.150> mean<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.550> I'm<00:04:38.300> pretty<00:04:38.450> happy<00:04:38.570> with

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
cooling I mean so I'm pretty happy with

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.360 
cooling I mean so I'm pretty happy with
this<00:04:39.140> I<00:04:39.410> mean<00:04:39.530> at<00:04:39.770> least<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:40.040> wasn't

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
this I mean at least it wasn't

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.850 
this I mean at least it wasn't
downgraded<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:40.940> think<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.540> hope<00:04:42.260> because<00:04:42.740> I

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
downgraded I think I hope because I

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
downgraded I think I hope because I
haven't<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.760> know<00:04:43.790> but<00:04:44.750> um<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.520> teach<00:04:46.520> I<00:04:46.640> seem

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
haven't you know but um I teach I seem

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.680 
haven't you know but um I teach I seem
to<00:04:46.970> remember<00:04:47.090> around<00:04:47.720> 30<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:51.880> 36<00:04:52.880> or<00:04:53.180> so<00:04:53.420> on

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
to remember around 30 to 36 or so on

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.460 
to remember around 30 to 36 or so on
stock<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.610> that's<00:04:56.330> pretty<00:04:56.600> good<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.290> fans

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
stock so that's pretty good and the fans

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.910 
stock so that's pretty good and the fans
aren't<00:04:57.740> even<00:04:58.010> really<00:04:58.720> honor<00:04:59.720> other<00:05:00.200> than<00:05:00.440> I'd

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
aren't even really honor other than I'd

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.980 
aren't even really honor other than I'd
say<00:05:01.100> they're<00:05:01.280> about<00:05:01.430> doing<00:05:01.970> eight<00:05:02.600> hundred<00:05:02.900> to

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
say they're about doing eight hundred to

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.990 
say they're about doing eight hundred to
a<00:05:03.020> thousand<00:05:03.440> rpm<00:05:03.800> which<00:05:04.180> is<00:05:05.920> very<00:05:06.920> quiet<00:05:07.190> it's

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
a thousand rpm which is very quiet it's

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.680 
a thousand rpm which is very quiet it's
probably<00:05:08.240> like<00:05:08.570> 20<00:05:08.870> DB<00:05:09.230> or<00:05:09.260> so<00:05:09.740> um<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:10.690> I'm

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
probably like 20 DB or so um so I'm

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.360 
probably like 20 DB or so um so I'm
happy<00:05:12.050> with<00:05:12.230> that<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:12.890> mean<00:05:13.040> I<00:05:13.070> already

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
happy with that and I mean I already

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.470 
happy with that and I mean I already
wanted<00:05:13.670> to<00:05:13.760> cool<00:05:13.940> well<00:05:14.060> if<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.300> could<00:05:14.450> just

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
wanted to cool well if I could just

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.160 
wanted to cool well if I could just
crank<00:05:15.200> them<00:05:15.290> up<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.940> but<00:05:16.940> as<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:17.930> to<00:05:18.020> hear

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
crank them up and but as you to hear

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.380 
crank them up and but as you to hear
they're<00:05:18.380> it's<00:05:18.580> definitely<00:05:19.580> a<00:05:19.610> much<00:05:20.090> noisier

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
they're it's definitely a much noisier

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.510 
they're it's definitely a much noisier
but<00:05:21.230> it's<00:05:21.440> going<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.620> start<00:05:21.890> going<00:05:22.070> off<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.280> lot

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
but it's going to start going off a lot

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:30.920 
but it's going to start going off a lot
about<00:05:22.640> their<00:05:24.370> see<00:05:25.540> okay<00:05:26.540> so<00:05:26.600> i<00:05:27.230> will<00:05:27.770> be<00:05:27.800> back

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.409 

alright<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:31.919> is<00:05:32.100> why<00:05:32.280> figure<00:05:32.970> is<00:05:33.150> pretty

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
alright so this is why figure is pretty

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:39.409 
alright so this is why figure is pretty
much<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.660> end<00:05:33.900> of<00:05:34.639> this<00:05:35.639> project<00:05:36.630> um<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:38.419> I

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
much the end of this project um and I

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.629 
much the end of this project um and I
believe<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:40.080> ending<00:05:40.560> result<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.280> I

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
believe the ending result is that I

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.689 
believe the ending result is that I
didn't<00:05:42.270> really<00:05:42.479> gain<00:05:43.350> or<00:05:43.710> lose<00:05:43.889> too<00:05:44.580> much

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
didn't really gain or lose too much

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.520 
didn't really gain or lose too much
performance<00:05:45.150> I<00:05:45.600> don't<00:05:45.870> think<00:05:45.930> I<00:05:46.050> gained<00:05:46.259> much

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
performance I don't think I gained much

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.370 
performance I don't think I gained much
when<00:05:47.400> it<00:05:47.460> comes<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:47.820> cooling<00:05:48.150> simply<00:05:49.139> because

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
when it comes to cooling simply because

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.379 
when it comes to cooling simply because
I<00:05:49.410> have<00:05:49.620> too<00:05:49.770> much<00:05:49.979> tubing<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:52.560> really

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
I have too much tubing and that really

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.240 
I have too much tubing and that really
the<00:05:54.389> radiator<00:05:54.810> is<00:05:54.930> only<00:05:55.139> going<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.440> be<00:05:56.070> doing

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
the radiator is only going to be doing

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.520 
the radiator is only going to be doing
as<00:05:56.520> much<00:05:56.669> as<00:05:56.820> you<00:05:56.880> can<00:05:57.060> I<00:05:57.330> mean<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.930> only<00:05:58.080> way

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
as much as you can I mean the only way

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.430 
as much as you can I mean the only way
better<00:05:58.740> would<00:05:58.949> be<00:05:58.979> probably<00:05:59.660> less<00:06:00.660> tubing<00:06:01.139> a

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
better would be probably less tubing a

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.960 
better would be probably less tubing a
reservoir<00:06:02.160> and<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:03.270> bigger<00:06:04.250> radiator<00:06:05.250> to<00:06:05.520> you

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
reservoir and a bigger radiator to you

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.110 
reservoir and a bigger radiator to you
know<00:06:06.860> release<00:06:07.860> all<00:06:08.039> that<00:06:08.070> heat<00:06:08.370> and<00:06:08.520> stuff<00:06:08.759> so

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
know release all that heat and stuff so

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.510 
know release all that heat and stuff so
um<00:06:09.449> I<00:06:10.110> think<00:06:10.560> I<00:06:11.009> finished<00:06:11.539> pretty<00:06:12.539> much

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
um I think I finished pretty much

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.830 
um I think I finished pretty much
filling<00:06:14.520> up<00:06:14.699> all<00:06:14.820> the<00:06:14.910> tubing<00:06:15.240> there's<00:06:15.449> just<00:06:15.720> a

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
filling up all the tubing there's just a

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.960 
filling up all the tubing there's just a
tiny<00:06:16.110> bit<00:06:16.229> about<00:06:16.530> was<00:06:16.740> left<00:06:16.979> I<00:06:17.250> mean<00:06:17.460> there's

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
tiny bit about was left I mean there's

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.870 
tiny bit about was left I mean there's
been<00:06:18.030> absolutely<00:06:18.509> no<00:06:19.080> noise<00:06:19.430> I'm<00:06:20.430> very<00:06:20.490> happy

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
been absolutely no noise I'm very happy

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.499 
been absolutely no noise I'm very happy
with<00:06:21.030> it<00:06:21.090> it's<00:06:21.270> much<00:06:21.449> quieter<00:06:21.720> much<00:06:22.710> cooler<00:06:23.039> I

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
with it it's much quieter much cooler I

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.210 
with it it's much quieter much cooler I
mean<00:06:24.509> we're<00:06:25.289> not<00:06:25.410> cool<00:06:25.590> as<00:06:25.710> the<00:06:25.830> temperature

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
mean we're not cool as the temperature

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.480 
mean we're not cool as the temperature
but<00:06:26.370> just<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.789> lot<00:06:27.800> awesomer<00:06:28.800> I<00:06:28.830> guess<00:06:29.099> to<00:06:29.280> say

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
but just a lot awesomer I guess to say

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.870 
but just a lot awesomer I guess to say
it<00:06:29.639> was<00:06:29.940> fun<00:06:30.150> project<00:06:30.539> to<00:06:30.570> put<00:06:30.750> together<00:06:30.870> but

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
it was fun project to put together but

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.969 
it was fun project to put together but
you<00:06:32.880> know<00:06:33.030> I'm<00:06:33.300> I<00:06:33.840> wasn't<00:06:34.289> really<00:06:34.440> you<00:06:34.889> know

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
you know I'm I wasn't really you know

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:36.649 
you know I'm I wasn't really you know
going<00:06:35.370> out<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.820> actually<00:06:36.120> improve

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
going out to actually improve

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.210 
going out to actually improve
performance<00:06:37.080> in<00:06:37.440> long<00:06:37.590> run<00:06:37.710> it<00:06:37.889> was<00:06:38.010> mainly

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
performance in long run it was mainly

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.010 
performance in long run it was mainly
just<00:06:38.430> to<00:06:38.550> get<00:06:38.789> it<00:06:38.909> working<00:06:39.060> and<00:06:39.449> not<00:06:39.659> have<00:06:39.840> to

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
just to get it working and not have to

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.719 
just to get it working and not have to
use<00:06:40.169> a<00:06:41.060> huge<00:06:42.060> aftermarket<00:06:43.039> cooler<00:06:44.039> because<00:06:44.370> of

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
use a huge aftermarket cooler because of

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.740 
use a huge aftermarket cooler because of
my<00:06:45.150> special<00:06:45.870> I<00:06:46.050> mean<00:06:46.229> 58<00:06:46.770> 70<00:06:47.750> thermalright

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
my special I mean 58 70 thermalright

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.710 
my special I mean 58 70 thermalright
Spitfire<00:06:49.320> cooler<00:06:50.180> yeah<00:06:51.180> I'll<00:06:51.300> give<00:06:51.449> some

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
Spitfire cooler yeah I'll give some

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.250 
Spitfire cooler yeah I'll give some
final<00:06:52.320> camera<00:06:52.680> angles<00:06:52.979> here<00:06:53.190> of<00:06:53.729> things

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.850 

there's<00:06:58.260> the<00:06:58.470> radiator<00:06:58.860> back<00:06:59.340> there<00:06:59.639> and<00:07:00.860> the

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
there's the radiator back there and the

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.339 
there's the radiator back there and the
tubing<00:07:02.220> going<00:07:02.580> to<00:07:02.699> that<00:07:03.020> and<00:07:04.430> back<00:07:05.430> here<00:07:06.349> just

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:07.349 
tubing going to that and back here just

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.080 
tubing going to that and back here just
make<00:07:07.620> out<00:07:08.039> see<00:07:08.580> bikes<00:07:08.729> sneak<00:07:09.060> it<00:07:09.180> back<00:07:09.300> here

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
make out see bikes sneak it back here

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.610 
make out see bikes sneak it back here
that<00:07:11.020> the<00:07:11.620> age<00:07:12.160> 50<00:07:12.669> is<00:07:12.880> plugged<00:07:13.360> in<00:07:13.510> and<00:07:13.810> excuse

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
that the age 50 is plugged in and excuse

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.070 
that the age 50 is plugged in and excuse
me<00:07:14.740> age<00:07:14.830> 70<00:07:15.280> it's<00:07:16.000> working<00:07:16.180> just<00:07:16.330> fine<00:07:16.570> and

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
me age 70 it's working just fine and

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.189 
me age 70 it's working just fine and
then<00:07:18.070> the<00:07:18.639> tubing<00:07:18.940> goes<00:07:19.090> around<00:07:19.330> and<00:07:19.840> writing

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
then the tubing goes around and writing

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.090 
then the tubing goes around and writing
to<00:07:20.490> pump<00:07:21.490> them<00:07:21.699> back<00:07:22.060> after<00:07:22.419> a<00:07:22.660> loop<00:07:22.810> in<00:07:23.410> the

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
to pump them back after a loop in the

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.830 
to pump them back after a loop in the
main<00:07:24.250> reason<00:07:24.520> why<00:07:24.639> once<00:07:24.970> again<00:07:25.240> i<00:07:25.449> decide<00:07:25.750> to

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
main reason why once again i decide to

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.689 
main reason why once again i decide to
do<00:07:25.960> sit<00:07:26.139> long<00:07:26.290> tubing<00:07:26.650> is<00:07:26.770> because<00:07:27.100> i<00:07:27.340> didn't

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:27.699 
do sit long tubing is because i didn't

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:29.629 
do sit long tubing is because i didn't
want<00:07:27.729> to<00:07:27.850> have<00:07:28.000> to<00:07:28.030> go<00:07:28.240> buy<00:07:28.389> another<00:07:28.419> reservoir

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 
want to have to go buy another reservoir

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:33.900 
want to have to go buy another reservoir
because<00:07:30.639> i<00:07:30.910> was<00:07:31.090> advised<00:07:31.960> that<00:07:32.290> having<00:07:33.130> to<00:07:33.340> too

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:33.910 
because i was advised that having to too

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.370 
because i was advised that having to too
short<00:07:34.210> of<00:07:34.300> tubing<00:07:34.960> is<00:07:35.020> going<00:07:35.139> to<00:07:35.199> blow<00:07:35.320> the

short of tubing is going to blow the
lines<00:07:35.680> off<00:07:35.919> the<00:07:37.530> loop<00:07:38.530> because<00:07:39.100> this<00:07:39.550> pump

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:39.790 
lines off the loop because this pump

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.670 
lines off the loop because this pump
would<00:07:40.000> be<00:07:40.090> too<00:07:40.240> powerful<00:07:40.419> for<00:07:40.780> such<00:07:41.440> small

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 
would be too powerful for such small

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.920 
would be too powerful for such small
tubing<00:07:42.040> and<00:07:42.220> such<00:07:42.729> a<00:07:42.760> little<00:07:43.300> amount<00:07:43.419> of<00:07:43.690> the

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930 
tubing and such a little amount of the

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.500 
tubing and such a little amount of the
space<00:07:44.830> to<00:07:44.979> work<00:07:45.070> with<00:07:45.130> but<00:07:45.639> all<00:07:46.180> in<00:07:46.419> all

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.510 
space to work with but all in all

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.480 
space to work with but all in all
there's<00:07:46.780> seems<00:07:47.470> to<00:07:47.620> be<00:07:47.710> very<00:07:47.740> little<00:07:48.190> pressure

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490 
there's seems to be very little pressure
