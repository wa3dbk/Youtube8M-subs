00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
so once you've downloaded the app and

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.840 
so once you've downloaded the app and
launched<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.830> first<00:01:13.100> thing<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.430> will<00:01:13.549> see

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
is the tap to start tutorial I really

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.940 
is the tap to start tutorial I really
like<00:01:17.149> apps<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.750> have<00:01:17.990> these<00:01:18.229> interactive

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
like apps that have these interactive

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.090 
like apps that have these interactive
tutorials<00:01:20.110> when<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.200> have<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.380> subject<00:01:21.710> ready

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
tutorials when you have a subject ready

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.399 
tutorials when you have a subject ready
to<00:01:22.280> be<00:01:22.399> captured<00:01:22.970> simply<00:01:23.540> captured<00:01:24.080> as<00:01:24.229> you

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
to be captured simply captured as you

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.680 
to be captured simply captured as you
would<00:01:24.619> any<00:01:24.770> other<00:01:25.009> camera<00:01:25.640> app<00:01:25.700> tap<00:01:26.000> the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
would any other camera app tap the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.840 
would any other camera app tap the
subject<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.380> focus<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:27.950> then<00:01:28.310> hit<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.670> button

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
subject to focus it then hit the button

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.810 
subject to focus it then hit the button
to<00:01:29.180> take<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.450> shot<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.860> few<00:01:31.039> tips<00:01:31.280> before
