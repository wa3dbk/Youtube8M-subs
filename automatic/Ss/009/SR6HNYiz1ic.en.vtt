00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
right here I guess you could say it's

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.449 
right here I guess you could say it's
like<00:03:50.700> charging<00:03:51.269> up<00:03:51.419> and<00:03:51.599> then<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.840> fires<00:03:53.389> and

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
like charging up and then it fires and

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.089 
like charging up and then it fires and
that's<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.669> that's<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.239> does<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.889> all

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
that's it that's all it does that is all

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.330 
that's it that's all it does that is all
Rick<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.329> robotic<00:04:00.840> interactive<00:04:01.410> k9<00:04:01.919> does

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
Rick the robotic interactive k9 does

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.940 
Rick the robotic interactive k9 does
nothing<00:04:03.090> else<00:04:03.299> just<00:04:04.169> going<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.410> turn<00:04:04.769> him<00:04:04.919> back

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
nothing else just going to turn him back

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.839 
nothing else just going to turn him back
into<00:04:05.160> its<00:04:05.790> dog<00:04:06.060> mode<00:04:07.129> so<00:04:08.129> both<00:04:08.340> modes<00:04:08.639> are

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
into its dog mode so both modes are

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.759 
into its dog mode so both modes are
actually<00:04:09.269> pretty<00:04:09.510> nice<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.290> they<00:04:10.500> really

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
actually pretty nice but they really

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.089 
actually pretty nice but they really
don't<00:04:10.950> do<00:04:11.549> anything<00:04:12.169> other<00:04:13.169> than<00:04:13.379> make<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.650> few

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
don't do anything other than make a few

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.379 
don't do anything other than make a few
annoying<00:04:14.760> sounds<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.919> that<00:04:16.940> cannon<00:04:17.940> blasts

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
annoying sounds and that cannon blasts

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.589 
annoying sounds and that cannon blasts
that's<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.989> nothing<00:04:19.680> else<00:04:20.099> on<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:21.359> would

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
that's it nothing else on this would

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.870 
that's it nothing else on this would
actually<00:04:21.780> look<00:04:22.169> pretty<00:04:22.229> decent<00:04:23.099> compared<00:04:23.639> to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
actually look pretty decent compared to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.689 
actually look pretty decent compared to
the<00:04:24.030> 12-inch<00:04:24.539> figures<00:04:24.690> but<00:04:25.229> since<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:25.800> do<00:04:25.949> not

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
the 12-inch figures but since I do not

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.459 
the 12-inch figures but since I do not
have<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.720> 12-inch<00:04:28.169> SPD<00:04:28.949> figures<00:04:29.460> anymore<00:04:30.060> I

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:30.469 
have the 12-inch SPD figures anymore I

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:35.350 
have the 12-inch SPD figures anymore I
figure<00:04:31.469> why<00:04:32.340> not<00:04:32.370> review<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.300> compared<00:04:33.840> to

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
figure why not review it compared to

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.609 
figure why not review it compared to
I'm<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.449> game<00:04:36.629> down<00:04:37.789> Jason<00:04:38.959> so<00:04:39.959> yeah<00:04:40.319> as<00:04:40.499> you

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:40.619 
I'm the game down Jason so yeah as you

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:42.529 
I'm the game down Jason so yeah as you
can<00:04:40.800> see<00:04:40.979> he's<00:04:41.249> an<00:04:41.399> eight<00:04:41.550> inch<00:04:41.759> figure<00:04:42.209> and<00:04:42.419> it

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
can see he's an eight inch figure and it

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.659 
can see he's an eight inch figure and it
doesn't<00:04:43.139> look<00:04:43.199> right<00:04:43.529> it<00:04:43.739> just<00:04:43.769> I<00:04:44.159> guess<00:04:44.399> it's

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
doesn't look right it just I guess it's

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.239 
doesn't look right it just I guess it's
