we're<00:00:28.500> shooting<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.279> October<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
we're shooting this in October so the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.290 
we're shooting this in October so the
the<00:00:31.220> foliage<00:00:32.220> doesn't<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the foliage doesn't have that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030 
the foliage doesn't have that
breathtaking<00:00:33.930> look<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> does<00:00:34.530> most<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:34.949> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
breathtaking look at it does most of the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.580 
breathtaking look at it does most of the
year<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.820> variety<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.449> Toyo<00:00:37.440> -<00:00:37.890> Shiki<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
year this variety is Toyo - Shiki it's a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.410 
year this variety is Toyo - Shiki it's a
dissected<00:00:40.590> variety<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.460> omotte<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> city

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420

dissected variety to omotte in the city
but<00:00:42.600> what<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> want<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> show<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.910> is

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
but what I want to show you is this is

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
but what I want to show you is this is
where<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> graft<00:00:45.780> union<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.440> right<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.250> so

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
where the graft union is right here so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.970 
where the graft union is right here so
this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.300> Japanese<00:00:48.899> maple<00:00:49.079> seedling<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this is a Japanese maple seedling and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.880 
this is a Japanese maple seedling and
then<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.480> desired<00:00:51.930> variety<00:00:52.649> from

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
then this is the desired variety from

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.190 
then this is the desired variety from
from<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.570> grafted<00:00:54.870> onto

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
from here up and that was grafted onto

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.770 
from here up and that was grafted onto
this<00:00:55.440> seedling<00:00:55.969> now<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> part<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
this seedling now this is the part that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.720 
this seedling now this is the part that
we're<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.949> plant<00:00:59.190> we're<00:00:59.399> trying<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
we're this is the plant we're trying to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
we're this is the plant we're trying to
retain<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.899> happens<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> have

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
retain but what happens is when you have

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
retain but what happens is when you have
a<00:01:01.949> high<00:01:02.250> graph<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.570> lot<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> times

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a high graph like this a lot of times

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
a high graph like this a lot of times
plants<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.680> either<00:01:04.890> grafted<00:01:05.399> up<00:01:05.520> high<00:01:05.729> like

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
plants are either grafted up high like

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.710 
plants are either grafted up high like
this<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.380> low<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.009> in<00:01:08.100> either<00:01:08.250> case

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
this or way down low but in either case

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
this or way down low but in either case
anything<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.990> grows<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> actual<00:01:11.250> root

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
anything that grows on the actual root

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.460 
anything that grows on the actual root
stock<00:01:11.880> because<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> root<00:01:12.540> stock<00:01:12.780> itself<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
stock because the root stock itself is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.460 
stock because the root stock itself is
just<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.159> generic<00:01:14.340> Japanese<00:01:15.270> maple<00:01:15.689> Acer<00:01:16.229> Paul

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
just a generic Japanese maple Acer Paul

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
just a generic Japanese maple Acer Paul
made<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:16.890> upright<00:01:17.729> variety<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> Japanese

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
made them upright variety of Japanese

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
made them upright variety of Japanese
maple<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.340> happens<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
maple and and this happens a lot to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.350 
maple and and this happens a lot to
people<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.610> growth<00:01:23.610> coming<00:01:24.119> from

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
people they get growth coming from

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
people they get growth coming from
underneath<00:01:24.750> their<00:01:25.229> their<00:01:25.530> Japanese<00:01:25.950> maple

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
underneath their their Japanese maple

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.980 
underneath their their Japanese maple
they<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.060> what's<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.630> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
they don't know what's going on they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.210 
they don't know what's going on they
can't<00:01:28.200> figure<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.860> they're<00:01:28.979> afraid<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
can't figure it out so they're afraid to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.490 
can't figure it out so they're afraid to
do<00:01:29.460> anything<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.780> important

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
do anything but it's really important

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.490 
do anything but it's really important
that<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.520> remove<00:01:33.030> all<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.439> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that you remove all this because this is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.190 
that you remove all this because this is
not<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.189> desired<00:01:35.610> variety<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.750> desired

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
not the desired variety the desired

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.480 
not the desired variety the desired
variety<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:40.229> part<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:40.770> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
variety is this part up here so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.249 
variety is this part up here so
basically<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.119> would<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.540> through<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
basically I would go through here and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
basically I would go through here and
remove<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.759> now<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> next<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
remove all that now the next thing this

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.770 
remove all that now the next thing this
plant<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> want<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> weep<00:01:47.189> over<00:01:47.780> so

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
plant is going to want to weep over so

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.850 
plant is going to want to weep over so
the<00:01:48.899> next<00:01:49.079> thing<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.290> we're<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.770> is

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the next thing that we're going to do is

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.109 
the next thing that we're going to do is
we're<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.159> put<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> stake<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
we're going to put a stake here and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.690 
we're going to put a stake here and
we'll<00:01:51.570> probably<00:01:52.020> train<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.860> upright

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
we'll probably train this up upright

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
we'll probably train this up upright
just<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.420> until<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> gets<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.649> maybe

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
just like that until it gets up maybe

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.310 
just like that until it gets up maybe
this<00:01:56.130> high<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:57.090> we'll<00:01:57.270> we'll<00:01:57.659> train<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this high and then we'll we'll train it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.780 
this high and then we'll we'll train it
so<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.590> starts<00:01:58.860> weeping<00:01:59.280> that's<00:01:59.399> really

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
so it starts weeping that's really

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.760 
so it starts weeping that's really
really<00:02:00.000> important<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.720> this<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.470> kind<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
really important and this is the kind of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.679 
really important and this is the kind of
thing<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.070> people<00:02:02.250> make<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> huge<00:02:03.149> mistake<00:02:03.329> I

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
thing that people make a huge mistake I

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.690 
thing that people make a huge mistake I
will<00:02:03.750> show<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.320> next<00:02:04.380> plant<00:02:04.920> because

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
will show you in this next plant because

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.350 
will show you in this next plant because
here<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.780> small<00:02:07.369> small<00:02:08.369> seedlings<00:02:09.149> on

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
here there are small small seedlings on

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.199 
here there are small small seedlings on
here<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:09.899> small<00:02:10.170> suckers<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.850> can<00:02:12.000> see

here or small suckers and if you can see
how<00:02:12.390> easily<00:02:12.860> when<00:02:13.860> these<00:02:14.040> things<00:02:14.280> first<00:02:14.610> come

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
how easily when these things first come

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.460 
how easily when these things first come
out<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.270> they're<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.690> little<00:02:15.930> tiny<00:02:16.140> leaf

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
out and they're just a little tiny leaf

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.320 
out and they're just a little tiny leaf
bud<00:02:16.739> that's<00:02:17.310> really<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.030> ideal<00:02:18.390> time

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
bud that's really the ideal time

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.000 
bud that's really the ideal time
because<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:19.930> just<00:02:20.050> pick<00:02:20.320> them<00:02:20.440> off<00:02:20.620> or

now over here this is a plant that I

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.880 
now over here this is a plant that I
bought<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.960> bought<00:02:55.960> it<00:02:56.350> from<00:02:56.530> another

but<00:03:10.570> this<00:03:10.900> plant<00:03:11.290> should<00:03:11.650> have<00:03:11.740> been<00:03:11.890> pruned

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
but this plant should have been pruned

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.890 
but this plant should have been pruned
when<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.700> should<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.000> been<00:03:13.090> trained<00:03:13.600> and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
when it should have been trained and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.960 
when it should have been trained and
pruned<00:03:14.680> what<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:14.980> was<00:03:15.100> really<00:03:15.459> really<00:03:15.640> young

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
pruned what it was really really young

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.090 
pruned what it was really really young
and<00:03:16.240> what<00:03:16.750> we're<00:03:16.930> doing<00:03:16.959> now<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.650> we're<00:03:17.860> trying

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
and what we're doing now is we're trying

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.740 
and what we're doing now is we're trying
to<00:03:18.310> make<00:03:18.610> something<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.270> thing<00:03:19.540> and

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
to make something of this thing and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.960 
to make something of this thing and
salvage<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.740> into<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:20.980> nice<00:03:21.190> plan<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.790> we<00:03:21.940> will

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
salvage it into a nice plan and we will

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.140 
salvage it into a nice plan and we will
easily<00:03:22.510> be<00:03:22.900> able<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.170> achieve<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:23.830> but<00:03:24.550> I'm

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
easily be able to achieve that but I'm

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.240 
easily be able to achieve that but I'm
going<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.480> do<00:03:26.200> something<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.739> little<00:03:26.860> drastic

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
going to do something a little drastic

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.670 
going to do something a little drastic
right<00:03:27.730> here<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.780> got<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.050> take<00:03:29.230> this<00:03:29.410> whole

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
right here and I got to take this whole

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.370 
right here and I got to take this whole
branch<00:03:29.920> off<00:03:30.280> because<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:31.450> not<00:03:31.750> where<00:03:32.260> it

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
branch off because it's not where it

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.800 
branch off because it's not where it
needs<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:32.800> it's<00:03:33.730> way<00:03:34.000> too<00:03:34.060> close<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.510> the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
needs to be it's way too close to the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.160 
needs to be it's way too close to the
ground<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:37.209> doesn't<00:03:37.600> add<00:03:37.780> anything

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
ground and it just doesn't add anything

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.690 
ground and it just doesn't add anything
to<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.590> value<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.070> plant<00:03:39.340> now<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.519> can

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
to the value of the plant now you can

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.060 
to the value of the plant now you can
see<00:03:39.970> we're<00:03:40.750> going<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.900> end<00:03:41.050> up<00:03:41.080> with<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> really

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
see we're going to end up with a really

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.770 
see we're going to end up with a really
crazy<00:03:42.400> stem<00:03:42.850> what<00:03:43.120> I'm<00:03:43.180> going<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.390> do<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.630> I'll

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
crazy stem what I'm going to do is I'll

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.270 
crazy stem what I'm going to do is I'll
keep<00:03:43.989> training<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.500> thing<00:03:44.709> up<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:45.010> way

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
keep training this thing up this way

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.190 
keep training this thing up this way
then<00:03:45.730> we'll<00:03:45.970> start<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.360> get<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.510> nice<00:03:46.720> head<00:03:47.019> on

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
then we'll start to get a nice head on

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.199 
then we'll start to get a nice head on
it<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.560> once<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.280> happens<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:48.940> I'll<00:03:49.060> go

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
it and once that happens and I'll go

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.850 
it and once that happens and I'll go
down<00:03:49.390> through<00:03:49.660> here<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.930> start<00:03:50.170> removing<00:03:50.320> all

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
down through here and start removing all

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.560 
down through here and start removing all
this<00:03:51.070> stuff<00:03:51.370> I'm<00:03:51.820> going<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.090> have<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.300> crooked

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
this stuff I'm going to have a crooked

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.440 
this stuff I'm going to have a crooked
stem<00:03:53.080> because<00:03:53.830> this<00:03:54.220> plant<00:03:54.519> was<00:03:54.670> not<00:03:54.940> properly

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
stem because this plant was not properly

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.759 
stem because this plant was not properly
trained<00:03:55.840> when<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.050> was<00:03:56.170> young<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:56.410> there's

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
trained when I was young so there's

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.350 
trained when I was young so there's
nothing<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:57.130> can<00:03:57.280> do<00:03:57.400> about<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.700> but

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
nothing I can do about that but

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.000 
nothing I can do about that but
eventually<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:59.019> will<00:03:59.320> still<00:03:59.560> end<00:03:59.739> up<00:03:59.800> with<00:03:59.890> a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
eventually I will still end up with a

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.830 
eventually I will still end up with a
nice<00:04:00.160> plan<00:04:00.550> now<00:04:01.060> let<00:04:01.209> me<00:04:01.300> show<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.570> I'm<00:04:01.690> going

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840

to show you a different same weeping

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.900 
to show you a different same weeping
variety<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.860> second<00:04:06.220> variety<00:04:06.580> but<00:04:06.700> one

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
variety of the second variety but one

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.229 
variety of the second variety but one
that<00:04:07.090> has<00:04:07.269> been<00:04:07.800> grown<00:04:08.800> properly<00:04:09.550> from<00:04:10.120> the

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
that has been grown properly from the

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.990 
that has been grown properly from the
very<00:04:10.450> beginning<00:04:11.670> alright<00:04:12.670> now<00:04:12.760> this<00:04:12.940> is

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
very beginning alright now this is

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.300 
very beginning alright now this is
another<00:04:13.390> dissected<00:04:14.080> variety<00:04:14.500> has<00:04:14.650> red<00:04:14.920> leaves

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
another dissected variety has red leaves

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.820 
another dissected variety has red leaves
this<00:04:15.430> variety<00:04:15.940> as<00:04:16.030> an<00:04:16.180> eBrush<00:04:16.510> adair<00:04:16.900> this

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
this variety as an eBrush adair this

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.400 
this variety as an eBrush adair this
plant<00:04:18.250> as<00:04:18.580> you<00:04:18.700> can<00:04:18.880> see<00:04:19.150> for<00:04:19.930> one<00:04:20.169> it<00:04:20.320> was

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
plant as you can see for one it was

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.469 
plant as you can see for one it was
grafted<00:04:20.650> down<00:04:20.979> lower<00:04:21.250> but<00:04:21.549> again<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.360> can

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
grafted down lower but again it can

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.270 
grafted down lower but again it can
still<00:04:22.750> have<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.080> ability<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.560> scratch<00:04:24.100> to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
still have the ability to scratch to

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.520 
still have the ability to scratch to
just<00:04:24.460> about<00:04:25.120> 2<00:04:25.330> inches<00:04:25.600> above<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.900> ground<00:04:26.020> and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
just about 2 inches above the ground and

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.200 
just about 2 inches above the ground and
this<00:04:27.100> will<00:04:27.250> still<00:04:27.490> have<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.760> ability<00:04:28.180> to

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
this will still have the ability to

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.210 
this will still have the ability to
produce<00:04:28.510> suckers<00:04:29.080> down<00:04:29.289> there<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.800> got<00:04:30.100> to

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
produce suckers down there so you got to

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.469 
produce suckers down there so you got to
be<00:04:30.310> diligent<00:04:30.550> about<00:04:30.970> removing<00:04:31.900> all

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
be diligent about removing all

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.420 
be diligent about removing all
but<00:04:32.840> see<00:04:33.050> this<00:04:33.229> plant<00:04:33.560> from<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.919> very<00:04:34.130> young<00:04:34.370> age

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
but see this plant from a very young age

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.240 
but see this plant from a very young age
was<00:04:35.270> trained<00:04:35.599> upright<00:04:36.139> with<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.500> single<00:04:36.919> stem

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
was trained upright with a single stem

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.159 
was trained upright with a single stem
and<00:04:37.490> what's<00:04:37.970> going<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.210> happen<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.840> this<00:04:38.960> is

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
and what's going to happen is this is

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.230 
and what's going to happen is this is
going<00:04:39.349> to<00:04:39.440> develop<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.919> beautiful<00:04:40.370> head<00:04:40.639> it's

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
going to develop a beautiful head it's

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.570 
going to develop a beautiful head it's
going<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:41.479> weep<00:04:41.660> down<00:04:41.979> as<00:04:42.979> somebody<00:04:43.400> who

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
going to weep down as somebody who

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.460 
going to weep down as somebody who
bought<00:04:43.849> this<00:04:44.060> plant<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.449> grow<00:04:44.630> on<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.289> is

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
bought this plant to grow on this is

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.990 
bought this plant to grow on this is
going<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.710> be<00:04:45.770> a<00:04:45.800> lot<00:04:46.039> easier<00:04:46.069> for<00:04:46.639> me<00:04:46.729> to<00:04:46.759> work

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
going to be a lot easier for me to work

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.430 
going to be a lot easier for me to work
with<00:04:47.240> because<00:04:47.449> this<00:04:47.750> plant<00:04:48.020> was<00:04:48.080> properly

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
with because this plant was properly

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.089 
up just a little bit because next spring
it's<00:05:11.419> going<00:05:11.569> to<00:05:11.630> put<00:05:11.810> on<00:05:11.900> new<00:05:12.080> growth<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:12.680> I

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
it's going to put on new growth and I

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.029 
it's going to put on new growth and I
want<00:05:13.370> all<00:05:13.699> that<00:05:13.940> new<00:05:14.150> growth<00:05:14.449> to<00:05:14.750> be<00:05:14.780> in<00:05:15.229> here

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
want all that new growth to be in here

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.920 
want all that new growth to be in here
so<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.280> gets<00:05:16.430> nice<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.639> full<00:05:16.970> not<00:05:17.599> way<00:05:17.900> out

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
so it gets nice and full not way out

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.450 
so it gets nice and full not way out
here<00:05:18.500> because<00:05:18.560> that's<00:05:18.830> not<00:05:19.039> going<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.220> do<00:05:19.310> me

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
here because that's not going to do me

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.430 
here because that's not going to do me
any<00:05:19.610> good<00:05:19.699> way<00:05:20.060> out<00:05:20.210> there<00:05:20.509> so<00:05:20.720> actually<00:05:21.080> I'm

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
any good way out there so actually I'm

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.839 
any good way out there so actually I'm
just<00:05:21.500> going<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.740> take<00:05:21.889> that<00:05:21.919> tip<00:05:22.370> off<00:05:22.580> right

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
just going to take that tip off right

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.339 
just going to take that tip off right
there<00:05:23.319> same<00:05:24.319> thing<00:05:24.590> with<00:05:24.800> now<00:05:25.009> this<00:05:25.220> plant

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
there same thing with now this plant

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.540 
there same thing with now this plant
this<00:05:27.349> plant<00:05:27.409> should<00:05:27.919> have<00:05:28.039> been<00:05:28.159> pruned<00:05:28.400> a

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
this plant should have been pruned a

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.330 
this plant should have been pruned a
long<00:05:28.729> time<00:05:29.000> ago<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.599> again<00:05:30.349> we<00:05:30.530> got<00:05:30.680> all<00:05:30.949> this

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
long time ago and again we got all this

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.920 
long time ago and again we got all this
is<00:05:31.580> what<00:05:31.789> here<00:05:32.060> enough<00:05:32.240> I<00:05:32.389> don't<00:05:32.449> do<00:05:32.720> anything

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
is what here enough I don't do anything

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.689 
is what here enough I don't do anything
with<00:05:33.229> this<00:05:33.440> I'm<00:05:33.710> going<00:05:34.069> to<00:05:34.159> get<00:05:34.250> more<00:05:34.490> new

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
with this I'm going to get more new

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.730 
with this I'm going to get more new
growth<00:05:34.970> up<00:05:35.210> here<00:05:35.539> and<00:05:35.780> that's<00:05:36.139> not<00:05:36.440> where<00:05:36.680> I

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
growth up here and that's not where I

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.839 
growth up here and that's not where I
want<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:37.219> right<00:05:37.400> now<00:05:37.599> so<00:05:38.599> I'm<00:05:38.750> going<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:38.990> go<00:05:39.849> way

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
want it right now so I'm going to go way

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.430 
want it right now so I'm going to go way
back<00:05:41.150> here<00:05:42.130> one<00:05:43.130> these<00:05:43.400> two<00:05:43.430> branches<00:05:44.030> are

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
back here one these two branches are

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.189 
back here one these two branches are
competing<00:05:45.440> with<00:05:45.469> one<00:05:45.800> another<00:05:49.930> I'm<00:05:50.930> going<00:05:51.139> to

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
competing with one another I'm going to

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.920 
competing with one another I'm going to
take<00:05:51.349> that<00:05:51.530> one<00:05:51.680> out<00:05:51.860> completely<00:05:52.750> just<00:05:53.750> like

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
take that one out completely just like

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.469 
take that one out completely just like
that<00:05:54.259> these<00:05:55.159> are<00:05:55.490> sticking<00:05:55.880> way<00:05:56.030> out<00:05:56.060> in<00:05:56.300> left

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
that these are sticking way out in left

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.790 
that these are sticking way out in left
field<00:05:56.570> so<00:05:56.990> I'm<00:05:57.139> going<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.380> go<00:05:57.729> back<00:05:58.729> here<00:05:58.759> and

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
field so I'm going to go back here and

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.850 
field so I'm going to go back here and
I'm<00:06:00.800> going<00:06:01.009> to<00:06:01.069> go<00:06:01.190> here<00:06:01.639> and<00:06:02.199> then<00:06:03.199> here<00:06:03.710> just

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
I'm going to go here and then here just

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.399 
I'm going to go here and then here just
about<00:06:04.520> like<00:06:04.759> that<00:06:04.789> now<00:06:05.270> I<00:06:05.539> know<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.199> doesn't

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
about like that now I know that doesn't

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.379 
about like that now I know that doesn't
look<00:06:06.590> good<00:06:06.650> now<00:06:06.860> but<00:06:07.400> it's<00:06:07.759> going<00:06:08.000> to<00:06:08.120> that

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
look good now but it's going to that

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.140 
look good now but it's going to that
will<00:06:08.509> develop<00:06:08.750> buds<00:06:09.110> and<00:06:09.349> fill<00:06:09.530> out<00:06:10.150> same

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
will develop buds and fill out same

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.430 
will develop buds and fill out same
thing<00:06:11.389> with<00:06:11.509> this<00:06:11.630> plant<00:06:11.960> look

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
thing with this plant look

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.990 
thing with this plant look
see<00:06:12.710> here's<00:06:12.949> the<00:06:13.009> branches<00:06:13.520> leap<00:06:13.759> gets

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
see here's the branches leap gets

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.430 
see here's the branches leap gets
growing<00:06:14.330> way<00:06:14.509> down<00:06:14.719> I'm<00:06:14.930> just<00:06:15.080> going<00:06:15.199> to<00:06:15.229> take

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
growing way down I'm just going to take

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.860 
growing way down I'm just going to take
that<00:06:15.469> one<00:06:15.830> off<00:06:15.860> because<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.819> want<00:06:17.150> all<00:06:17.449> this<00:06:17.659> up

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
that one off because I want all this up

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.379 
that one off because I want all this up
here<00:06:18.289> now<00:06:18.860> eventually<00:06:19.190> I'll<00:06:19.610> probably<00:06:19.880> remove

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
here now eventually I'll probably remove

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.170 
here now eventually I'll probably remove
these<00:06:20.569> lower<00:06:20.840> branches<00:06:21.110> and<00:06:21.909> well<00:06:22.909> you<00:06:23.090> know

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
these lower branches and well you know

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.309 
these lower branches and well you know
what<00:06:23.330> I<00:06:23.360> think<00:06:23.630> I'm<00:06:23.719> going<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:23.900> get<00:06:24.050> them<00:06:24.199> off

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
what I think I'm going to get them off

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.290 
what I think I'm going to get them off
right<00:06:24.530> now<00:06:24.740> while<00:06:25.009> I<00:06:25.039> got<00:06:25.219> a<00:06:25.250> chance<00:06:25.340> because

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
right now while I got a chance because

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.080 
right now while I got a chance because
I've<00:06:26.509> got<00:06:26.690> plenty<00:06:26.930> of<00:06:27.080> plant<00:06:27.680> up<00:06:27.889> top<00:06:28.159> it's<00:06:28.940> a

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
I've got plenty of plant up top it's a

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.480 
I've got plenty of plant up top it's a
little<00:06:29.330> bit<00:06:29.419> lopsided<00:06:29.630> this<00:06:30.199> way<00:06:30.440> so<00:06:31.370> I'm

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
little bit lopsided this way so I'm

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.100 
little bit lopsided this way so I'm
going<00:06:31.669> to<00:06:31.729> trim<00:06:32.030> that<00:06:32.060> off<00:06:32.240> just<00:06:32.449> about<00:06:32.900> like

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
going to trim that off just about like

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.370 
going to trim that off just about like
that

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
that

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.189 
that
now<00:06:33.830> next<00:06:34.099> spring<00:06:34.599> that<00:06:35.599> plants<00:06:36.020> going<00:06:36.139> to

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
now next spring that plants going to

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.240 
now next spring that plants going to
fill<00:06:36.440> out<00:06:37.180> very<00:06:38.180> nicely<00:06:38.479> and<00:06:39.020> by<00:06:39.830> this<00:06:39.889> time

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
fill out very nicely and by this time

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.459 
fill out very nicely and by this time
next<00:06:40.460> year<00:06:40.669> you<00:06:41.360> won't<00:06:41.539> even<00:06:41.659> recognize<00:06:41.900> it

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469 
next year you won't even recognize it

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.320 
next year you won't even recognize it
but<00:06:42.620> so<00:06:42.710> anyway<00:06:43.070> hopefully<00:06:43.699> that's<00:06:44.060> going<00:06:44.270> to

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
but so anyway hopefully that's going to

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.640 
but so anyway hopefully that's going to
help<00:06:44.659> you<00:06:44.930> too

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
help you too

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.790 
help you too

stand how to train the second Japanese
maple<00:06:49.400> that<00:06:49.430> has<00:06:50.360> a<00:06:50.389> tendency<00:06:50.930> to<00:06:51.139> weep<00:06:51.770> down

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
maple that has a tendency to weep down

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.460 
maple that has a tendency to weep down
and<00:06:52.490> and<00:06:53.120> how<00:06:53.330> to<00:06:53.389> prune<00:06:53.930> them<00:06:54.110> to<00:06:54.259> get<00:06:54.380> them

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
and and how to prune them to get them

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.140 
and and how to prune them to get them
nice<00:06:54.650> and<00:06:54.710> full<00:06:55.130> so<00:06:55.370> they<00:06:55.520> are<00:06:55.580> absolutely

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
nice and full so they are absolutely

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.449 
nice and full so they are absolutely
beautiful
