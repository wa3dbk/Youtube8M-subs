00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.710
 ja To put it briefly, active pitchers are the best to live 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.270
 Well, I think from management capillary 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.920
 Coming home 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.009
 There is also a red blood cell phase 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:23.419
 British Police Agency 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.199
 But I want to go through the western finals through organizational skills 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.199
 Get nutrition 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.850
 We use this 3 equivalent pom 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 With oxygen and nutritional value 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.310
 The last one kilometer but I do not have 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.430
 Main is the best at that time 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.680
 I am in a place to live more with nhk 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 Even if you like and work hard here, the power to live is generated 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 It's like that 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.290
 On 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.290
 Good 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.910
 I understand hp 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.210
 carbon dioxide 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 And it is unnecessary such as ammonia 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.600
 Play this again to return the area and return the capillary 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.010
 You do not need 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.510
 LOL 11 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.140
 Break through carbon dioxide 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 Seems unnecessary 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.320
 It is said that there are 3 chances 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.450
 It is this series of movement 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.550
 With as3 equivalent honor 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.490
 I'm riding a chasing to live 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.270
 And 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.560
 I didn't want to go swimming 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.060
 It passes carbon dioxide grant 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
 Turn this into a cell 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.720
 it's
