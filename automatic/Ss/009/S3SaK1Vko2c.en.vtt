artificial harmonics where I play the

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.980 
artificial harmonics where I play the
core<00:06:19.050> down<00:06:19.260> here<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.980> I<00:06:20.820> find<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:21.420> one<00:06:21.600> octave

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
core down here and I find it one octave

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.500 
core down here and I find it one octave
higher<00:06:22.200> and<00:06:22.860> I<00:06:22.950> put<00:06:23.130> my<00:06:23.280> finger<00:06:23.610> say<00:06:24.000> I've<00:06:24.270> got

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
higher and I put my finger say I've got

higher and I put my finger say I've got
my<00:06:24.600> C<00:06:24.780> chord<00:06:25.110> played<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:25.950> 15th<00:06:26.340> fret<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:27.360> then

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
my C chord played the 15th fret and then

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:35.650 
my C chord played the 15th fret and then
