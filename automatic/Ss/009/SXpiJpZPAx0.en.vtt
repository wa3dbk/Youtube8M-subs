where we were last time we already
caught<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> pokemon<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.480> route<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
caught a pokemon on this route and it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
caught a pokemon on this route and it
wasn't<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.710> much<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.160> use<00:00:44.579> i<00:00:44.730> mean

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
wasn't really that much of use i mean

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.850 
wasn't really that much of use i mean
it's<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.090> level<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.660> ever<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.530> wanted

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it's like level one ever really wanted

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.410 
it's like level one ever really wanted
to<00:00:46.980> i<00:00:47.010> guess<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.370> could<00:00:47.430> level<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.270> little
