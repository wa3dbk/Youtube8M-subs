00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hi, I'm Rosa Maria Espinoza 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.609
 dietitian-nutritionist and responsible 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.859
 technique of wicks in disassembling the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.130
 miracle diets today we dismantle the diet 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.130
 atkins 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.440
 ah 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.300
 ah 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.760
 within the popularly known 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.760
 as ketogenic diets is the 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.439
 doctor atkins diet a diet 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.230
 miracle popularly known at the level 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.600
 global this diet consists of four 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.699
 phases which initially 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.640
 eliminate cereals and tubers 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.530
 they minimize fruits and vegetables and it is allowed 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.650
 free consumption of proteins from 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.670
 of meat, sausage or cold cuts 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.309
 seafood whole yogurts and cheeses 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.800
 as from fats coming from oils 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.890
 butters margarines and mayonnaise is 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.870
 attractive truly being able to lose weight without 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.720
 need to give up what we most 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.160
 like protein and fats now well 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.080
 Some of you have suffered sometime 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.880
 a drop attack will know that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.690
 practically all these foods 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.610
 mentioned are those that we must eliminate 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.130
 while the symptoms subside as well 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.500
 control them later in order 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.600
 to prevent it from happening again 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.950
 Exactly the same if they tell us not to 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.880
 cholesterol levels are found 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.250
 and or high triglycerides 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.560
 is to say that this diet what it does is 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.689
 increase our risk of suffering a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.070
 cardiovascular disease 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.470
 now the increase of these 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.180
 parameters in blood does not hurt and without 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.789
 But the doctor's diet here does not 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.210
 allows you to lose weight but this is 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.210
 true 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.010
 the doctor to whom he argued that the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.880
 Weight gain is due to insulin 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.340
 hormone that allows cells 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.860
 use circulating glucose in blood 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.810
 but with a secondary function of 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.960
 convert the possible excess glucose 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.370
 in fat if this were true italy 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.620
 where we all know that the consumption of 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.390
 pasta is very ingrained would not present 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.330
 an obesity rate almost 5 per 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.800
 lower than the Spanish rate where 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.690
 the consumption of carbohydrates has fallen 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.340
 chopped and yet the intake of 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.070
 proteins and fats has increased 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.230
 considerably and that is the loss of 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.270
 weight produced with the atkins diet in 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.820
 reality comes from the loss of water 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.400
 body water that is mobilized at 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.140
 try to take advantage of the minimum reserve of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.840
 glucose that is found in liver and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.050
 musculature as well as the loss of 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.330
 own muscle mass of which 75% 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.460
 it's practically water 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.500
 and nothing to see as we see with a 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.420
 loss of fatty tissue which is what 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.870
 we really have more if we have an excess 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.870
 of weight 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.900
 also when we eliminate from our 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.340
 daily food the lucid our 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.860
 body must start up 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.000
 mechanisms for obtaining energy 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.190
 coming from fat 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.680
 mechanism that generates side effects 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.260
 in the form of ketone bodies hence the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.689
 name of ketogenic diet 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.430
 these ketone bodies that are acidic to 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.769
 exception of acetone should be 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.150
 transported in blood what implies 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.400
 that the organism starts up 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.620
 compensation mechanisms to avoid 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.079
 alter the blood pH as well 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.849
 mechanisms for its elimination what 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.879
 causes again great mobilization of 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.560
 body water generates kidney overload and 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.340
 that must be eliminated in part through 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.930
 of urine made that is aggravated by 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.250
 excess protein from the diet that 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.640
 It is also eliminated in this way 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.190
 loss of skeletal calcium as well as 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.510
 halitosis since part of the acetone is 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.510
 eliminates through the respiratory tract 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.569
 besides producing a feeling of fatigue 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.420
 difficulty in the ability to 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.180
 concentration possible dizziness pains of 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.620
 head constipation deficits 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.970
 nutritional products derived from 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.030
 restriction of food of origin 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.799
 vegetable all this despite recommending 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.209
 dietary supplements that look for 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.840
 fill the gaps that this diet 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.840
 entails 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.340
 we have seen in this chapter dedicated to 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.500
 the atkins diet that is not only 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.209
 ineffective to lose excess fat 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.790
 body which is what we have left over if 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.500
 we are overweight or obese but we 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.769
 it also has side effects 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.180
 both short, medium and long term 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.880
 undesirable to keep both the weight 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.290
 with bad health we have also seen that 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.570
 belongs to the group of diets 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.820
 ketogenic among which also 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.160
 we highlight other diets known as 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.650
 the diet dukan the montignac method or the 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.060
 mayo clinic diet as well as all 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.699
 those included within 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.350
 hyperprotÃ©icas or proteÃ­nicas of all 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.500
 they will talk in the following 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.500
 chapters
