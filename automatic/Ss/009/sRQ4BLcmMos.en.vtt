to<00:00:37.460> use

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
to use

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.650 
to use
it's<00:00:39.470> beautiful<00:00:40.100> sleek<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:41.089> back<00:00:41.330> I<00:00:41.629> mean

this may not have really good quality
material<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.519> definitely<00:00:44.269> think<00:00:44.360> that<00:00:44.510> have

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
material I definitely think that have

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.819 
material I definitely think that have
you<00:00:44.780> ever<00:00:44.839> dropped<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.440> or<00:00:45.559> anything<00:00:45.680> like

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
that you wouldn't have a hard time

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.270 
that you wouldn't have a hard time
protecting<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.110> back<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.589> it<00:00:48.680> does<00:00:48.800> provide

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
protecting the back and it does provide

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.560 
protecting the back and it does provide
a<00:00:49.460> little<00:00:49.610> bit<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.850> protection<00:00:49.970> on<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.360> front

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570

discoverable<00:03:16.879> and<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.569> actually<00:03:17.900> paired<00:03:18.109> two

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
discoverable and I actually paired two

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.349 
discoverable and I actually paired two
of<00:03:18.470> these<00:03:18.560> cases<00:03:18.950> up<00:03:19.099> today<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.519> paired<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.150> white

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
of these cases up today I paired a white

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.720 
of these cases up today I paired a white
one<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.840> black<00:03:21.049> one<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:22.430> I'm<00:03:22.489> not<00:03:22.670> sure

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
one and a black one so I'm not sure

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.420 
one and a black one so I'm not sure
which<00:03:23.180> one<00:03:23.389> in<00:03:23.480> my<00:03:23.569> menu<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.079> I<00:03:24.349> think<00:03:25.280> it's

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
which one in my menu it is I think it's

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.190 
which one in my menu it is I think it's
the<00:03:25.519> second<00:03:25.879> one<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:26.659> I<00:03:26.690> guess<00:03:26.900> I'm<00:03:26.989> about<00:03:27.109> to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
the second one so I guess I'm about to

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.050 
the second one so I guess I'm about to
find<00:03:27.319> out<00:03:28.129> hopefully<00:03:28.370> it's<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:28.639> second<00:03:28.940> ones

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
find out hopefully it's the second ones

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.280 
find out hopefully it's the second ones

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
somebody else it's just in case two

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.449 
somebody else it's just in case two
people<00:03:57.319> happen<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.769> syncing<00:03:58.129> it<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:58.370> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
people happen to be syncing it at the

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.300 
people happen to be syncing it at the
same<00:03:58.639> time<00:03:58.699> the<00:03:59.209> exact<00:03:59.569> same<00:03:59.780> case<00:04:00.280> what<00:04:01.280> are

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
same time the exact same case what are

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.210 
same time the exact same case what are
the<00:04:01.430> odds<00:04:01.639> but<00:04:01.970> hey<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.180> guess<00:04:02.389> it's<00:04:02.540> possible<00:04:06.220> I

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
the odds but hey I guess it's possible I

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.069 
the odds but hey I guess it's possible I
actually<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.150> make<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.449> discoverable

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
actually have to make this discoverable
