here<00:00:02.399> we<00:00:02.610> have<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.030> Mila<00:00:03.560> km6<00:00:04.560> 386<00:00:06.200> induction

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
here we have the Mila km6 386 induction

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.980 
here we have the Mila km6 386 induction
hob<00:00:07.940> we're<00:00:08.940> pairing<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.330> up<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> cooker

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
hob we're pairing it up with a cooker

hob we're pairing it up with a cooker
hood<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.320> demo<00:00:10.620> today<00:00:11.210> which<00:00:12.210> talks<00:00:12.840> to

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
hood in the demo today which talks to

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.689 
hood in the demo today which talks to
one<00:00:13.110> another<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:14.150> the<00:00:15.150> Mila<00:00:15.450> connectivity

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
one another with the Mila connectivity

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.540 
one another with the Mila connectivity
2.0<00:00:17.699> system<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> we're<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> do<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> little

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
2.0 system so we're going to do a little

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.290 
2.0 system so we're going to do a little
demonstration<00:00:21.170> of<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:23.070> induction<00:00:23.640> works<00:00:23.850> and

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
demonstration of how induction works and

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.679 
demonstration of how induction works and
how<00:00:24.390> connectivity<00:00:25.109> works<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> Aaron<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
how connectivity works so Aaron is the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.759 
how connectivity works so Aaron is the
water<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.439> bowl<00:00:28.890> cold<00:00:30.500> water<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.619> this

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
water in this bowl cold water on this

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.510 
water in this bowl cold water on this
all<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.520> cold<00:00:32.850> right<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> let's<00:00:35.340> fire<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.579> out

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.860 

we<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.610> hear<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.120> come<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
we can hear it just come on and if you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.600 
we can hear it just come on and if you
notice<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> lights<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> cooker<00:00:44.430> hood

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
notice the lights on the cooker hood

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.260 
notice the lights on the cooker hood
have<00:00:45.480> sprung<00:00:45.960> into<00:00:46.200> action<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:47.789> cooker<00:00:48.090> hoods

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
have sprung into action the cooker hoods

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.450 
have sprung into action the cooker hoods
talking<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> hole<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> hope<00:00:49.980> knows<00:00:50.219> it's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
talking to the hole the hope knows it's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
talking to the hole the hope knows it's
been<00:00:50.670> switched<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.739> started<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
been switched on so now it started to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.740 
been switched on so now it started to
work<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:57.390> pan<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.340> starting<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.489> boil

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
work and the pan is starting to boil

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
work and the pan is starting to boil
we're<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.410> real<00:01:01.530> time<00:01:01.680> so

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
we're going to do this in real time so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.070 
we're going to do this in real time so
it<00:01:02.399> might<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> slightly<00:01:03.059> lengthy<00:01:03.539> video<00:01:03.809> for

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
it might be a slightly lengthy video for

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.850 
it might be a slightly lengthy video for
you<00:01:04.199> guys<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:05.880> induction<00:01:06.450> superb<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.619> does

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
you guys but induction superb it does

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.330 
you guys but induction superb it does

disadvantages<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.979> induction<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.850> your

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
disadvantages with induction is your

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.670 
disadvantages with induction is your

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
quick as possible but if you want to

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.110

drop<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.110> power<00:03:50.350> down<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:51.490> can<00:03:51.640> take<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.000> a

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
drop the power down you can take it to a

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.600 
drop the power down you can take it to a

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
very very light simmer you can almost

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.240 
very very light simmer you can almost
use<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:54.880> like<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> ban<00:03:55.360> Murray<00:03:55.690> if<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:56.020> were

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
use it like a ban Murray if you were

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.570 
use it like a ban Murray if you were
melting<00:03:57.250> chocolate<00:03:58.920> now<00:03:59.920> we've<00:04:00.040> slowly<00:04:00.280> but

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
melting chocolate now we've slowly but

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.730 
melting chocolate now we've slowly but
surely<00:04:00.610> coming<00:04:01.210> up<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.570> rolling<00:04:01.960> boil

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.990 

now<00:04:05.740> if<00:04:05.830> this<00:04:05.950> was<00:04:06.160> passed<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.730> was<00:04:06.820> about

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
now if this was passed and it was about

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.970 
now if this was passed and it was about
to<00:04:07.180> boil<00:04:07.390> over<00:04:07.870> Erin<00:04:08.320> can<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.560> just<00:04:08.740> show<00:04:08.860> us

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
to boil over Erin can you just show us

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.520 
to boil over Erin can you just show us
dropping<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.400> down<00:04:09.520> to<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.700> very<00:04:09.910> low<00:04:10.030> simmer

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
dropping it down to a very low simmer

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.910 
dropping it down to a very low simmer
and<00:04:11.530> now<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.650> heat<00:04:11.890> goes<00:04:12.190> straight<00:04:12.610> out<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.910> it

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
and now the heat goes straight out of it

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.320 
and now the heat goes straight out of it
there<00:04:14.920> we<00:04:15.040> go<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:15.400> that's<00:04:15.490> gone<00:04:15.760> straight<00:04:16.060> away

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
there we go so that's gone straight away

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.220 
there we go so that's gone straight away
and<00:04:16.420> then<00:04:16.510> crank<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.930> right<00:04:17.170> up<00:04:17.350> again<00:04:19.230> and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
and then crank it right up again and
