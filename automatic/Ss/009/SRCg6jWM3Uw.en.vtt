00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.020
 The milling process has many 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.080
 go through development steps 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.049
 over the years there was therefore always 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.749
 new methods which as state of 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.269
 the art were 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.689
 only the computing power of today 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.310
 processing machines and their 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.710
 Control in conjunction with the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.660
 appropriate combat software are the 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.720
 reason for a new evolutionary step 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.669
 in the field of cutting that broccoli 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.669
 milling or total performance ktt 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.669
 14 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.020
 But let's start with the differences 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.289
 between the conventional method and 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.629
 the tpc milling in the conventional 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.430
 Milling the cutter penetrates with his 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.350
 complete diameter in the material 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.359
 on 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.670
 while the tooth feed fz the 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.590
 speed of the freezer in feed 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.269
 direction 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.440
 this value has been a fixed one so far 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.440
 constant when milling 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:09.770
 he was equal by the formula fz is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:12.110
 hm root from the expressed by fz 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.930
 sit down together from the intervention 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.390
 wide which is also the envelopes angle 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.360
 describes the diameter of the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.360
 freezers and the Spanish dickel hm 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.439
 these values ​​were dependent on 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.600
 the material to be processed as well as the 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.490
 Editing process defined and 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.920
 remained constant for so long no 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:41.180
 Change of direction therefore also took place 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.830
 the constant advance fz of the freezers 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.290
 very different when tpc milling here 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.630
 calculates the cam software or the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.350
 machine control in every moment the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.970
 formerly constant value new this has one 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.760
 completely new motion pattern of the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.119
 according to tools , we look at that 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.160
 once more accurate 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.770
 So the attack width is now in 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.399
 recalculated every moment and is calculated by the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.170
 Constant becomes a variable at the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.470
 For example, aluminum should be this 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.170
 however, to a maximum of 66 4 degrees or 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.700
 be limited to 0.3 times the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.700
 to achieve optimal results 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.840
 because of the variability of it comes 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.190
 now to the following conversion of the formula 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.680
 this has the consequence that the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.430
 Spannmittel thick h &amp; m from now on the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.650
 Constant is with the help of now 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.260
 constant value of spanish thick 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.959
 So hm calculate and control the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.390
 modern crm systems and controls now 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.519
 the optimal way and guarantee 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.519
 such a maximum efficient processing 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.670
 we consider the optimal 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.950
 Fields of application of the tools in relation 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.799
 on the intervention angle weather and the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.220
 relationship to de adapted to the 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.380
 respective material for the aluminum 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.530
 machining is the optimal intervention 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.290
 angles between 10 and 66 4 degrees 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:18.049
 what an engagement relationship with the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:21.920
 from 0.008 to 0.3 corresponds to the 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.620
 other areas are hard stainless steel 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.690
 machining and the super alloys at 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.280
 the optimal range between 10 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.480
 and 40 is 5 degrees 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.970
 this corresponds to an intervention 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.010
 ratio of 0.008 to 0 12 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.990
 around now the clamping medium thickness at smaller 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.810
 becoming intervening constant 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.810
 to hold up it necessary to raise vf 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.020
 the result of this strategy is that 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.940
 high cutting speeds at full 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.820
 be made possible cutting depth and 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:05.270
 at the same time the tool wear 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:07.340
 this sinks significantly 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.850
 proceed by two yourself 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.290
 mutually overlapping movements 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.970
 rectilinear and elliptical circling 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.549
 this results in numerous benefits 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.400
 like a limited constant and small 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.290
 At mood and high time 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.950
 save volume and lowest cut 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.140
 power at low wear is of 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.350
 beginning of a full processing 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.600
 depth of cut possible that divers ideal 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.590
 Milling is particularly suitable for heavy 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.540
 machined stretcher materials most 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.910
 You can reach the haard 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.860
 machining during the machining of 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.520
 stainless material and at 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.520
 super alloys the customers the hoffmann 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.550
 group are from the tpc cutters and their 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.020
 Advantages convinced by the constant 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.790
 increasing demands on the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.540
 Production this more efficient too 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.460
 shape 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.040
 the requirements also increase 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.560
 every single production process like 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.360
 For example, when valve body important 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.400
 for the production is the shortening 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.380
 the production time the increase of the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.650
 lifetime of every single tool 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.330
 as well as a very high process reliability 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.789
 our direct contact here 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.440
 is the tool management as in 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.720
 tool management have considered us 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.610
 As we meet the requirements of manufacturing 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.370
 meet after longer 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.870
 We are thinking about the tpc cutters 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.580
 the hope and group bumped into 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.370
 connection with this vital pressure 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.590
 devour result of this optimization was 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.690
 We have our production times around 70 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.340
 percent reduced because at the same time 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.340
 ten times stand since these tools 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.000
 optimize yours too 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.349
 production process with the new guarantee 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.349
 tpc tool 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.660
