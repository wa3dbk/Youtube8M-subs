00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.100
 It should be remembered that they have affected 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.440
 but of course why it does not adapt to all the inhabitants of the area 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.699
 Adriana Ozores 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.439
 good if I can not 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.439
 as a novelty 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.839
 normal 4 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.239
 a point of conformism either 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.449
 Conversely 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
 miami July 9 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.270
 You are absolutely right to present two points 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.350
 as we have 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.640
 we all have 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.900
 and logically we are 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.250
 It has not been a good year 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 I always understand why 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.990
 this team is fine with this challenge 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.690
 then we allow experts who think that the resolution 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.450
 I do not know what happened 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.900
 claiming 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.120
 the delivery of the ocean in Rome is passionate 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.800
 benitez is special 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 Iván Alonso crossed the goal of Orozco 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800
 is more than ever the support of its people 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.720
 tournament that will score I think the team 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.710
 the delegates 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.710
 collantes occasions 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.840
 I am amazed armed 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 nothing 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.250
 as for the 24 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.690
 rtve 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.320
 in a certain way it's like after 20 minutes of insults from the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.390
 Feline ancestors 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.520
 so to the players of the tigers team 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.660
 the calm arrived 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.590
 to monterrey airport 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 for the other sports alfredo vázquez villegas 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.059
 you have your best point of view 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.819
 careful because they are approaching the line I'm not on the line it 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.149
 asked what happened if one of the players directly 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.439
 intercepted by fans 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.310
 he was attacked he went ahead by a swipe they think that for example that if 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.219
 was to retire they indicated that to throw but if someone 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.919
 make good passes and take away the benzema solar hand in ago - the player 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.939
 fernando cm per hour declared that we do not eat percent congratulated the 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.729
 players because they were very patient the truth and even marine I 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.579
 He looked at experts because I type the network that teliviv puno 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.619
 i do not know if it comes a push 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:49.149
 for me it is being exaggerated did not arrive or do not sneak saba 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.619
 under the influence of alcohol 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:56.229
 0 you can not do this permínov Abrevaya who understands the annoyance of 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.510
 people because of the situation that the team is going through 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.500
 because the thing and the point of very poor is completely understood that is angry 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.329
 Your team can not 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.519
 Nobody is getting goals, mistakes have been made, not in total. 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.519
 team of memphis efe that they hope that as an amateur I understand 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.430
 there is a limit that seems vital to me and I think we are crossing though attacking a 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.759
 player 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:23.549
 no no no no nothing happens there does not happen sullana act touches the player pulling 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.159
 I'm talking to you that is not a bad thing done a few weeks ago 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.569
 we criticized america castro because 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.679
 at least shouted an amateur asked for security sanz after 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:35.329
 this 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.669
 I honestly would not blame the Civil Guards that they have the security of 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:39.240
 why 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.100
 any new menu well and it will take away what you want and it is in the air 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.280
 nor do we pity you that it is not very clear to read active peoples 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.280
 that by claiming they are all right to kill central is free 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.579
 and we talked about what the match is saying I think that's why I insist you found it 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.619
 if by bad start to dispense is the football team 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.109
 again we can get out of control carefully if you have to have 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.519
 for the hobby of course 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.999
 the player as well said fernando percent was null right 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.419
 he was tolerant 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.559
 but if there is a limit careful with all that 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:19.899
 follow it later also beginning what happens at this time with 

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:20.009
 your
