00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
adaptation maybe the metal arms are on

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.430 
adaptation maybe the metal arms are on
inside<00:00:54.159> of<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.400> skin<00:00:55.019> maybe<00:00:56.019> we'll<00:00:56.199> do<00:00:56.320> it

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
inside of the skin maybe we'll do it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.359 
inside of the skin maybe we'll do it
that<00:00:56.589> way<00:00:56.739> you<00:00:57.040> know<00:00:57.159> who<00:00:57.400> knows<00:00:57.839> yeah<00:00:59.369> you

that<00:04:39.730> thing<00:04:39.970> has<00:04:40.120> been<00:04:40.330> rewritten<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.820> you

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
that thing has been rewritten and you

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.159 
that thing has been rewritten and you
know<00:04:42.970> over<00:04:43.300> some<00:04:43.510> time<00:04:43.780> now<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.320> I<00:04:44.860> think<00:04:45.100> we<00:04:45.280> I

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
know over some time now and I think we I

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.570 
know over some time now and I think we I
didn't<00:04:47.169> want<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.350> do<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.560> second<00:04:48.280> Black

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
and I think so far the ideas with myself

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.870 
and I think so far the ideas with myself
and<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.710> by<00:04:56.710> her<00:04:56.830> demands<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.669> think<00:04:58.570> we<00:04:58.690> will
