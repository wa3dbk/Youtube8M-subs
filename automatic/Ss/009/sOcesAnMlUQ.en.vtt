00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
middle frames you can see that hole

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.210 
middle frames you can see that hole
again<00:04:59.350> also<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.470> can<00:05:00.500> see<00:05:00.890> that<00:05:01.040> there's

probably there to make the phone a
little<00:05:04.760> bit<00:05:05.000> more<00:05:05.150> sturdy<00:05:06.730> then<00:05:07.730> down<00:05:07.940> at<00:05:08.090> the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
little bit more sturdy then down at the
