00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.630
 Hello everyone, Basil Ulyanov and 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.550
 we continue to talk about the system 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.050
 proper nutrition which allows 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.560
 always diligently in great shape 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.599
 always be full of energy health and strength 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.029
 and in this video let's talk to you 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.550
 about how to properly form your 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.770
 a plate that is what food should be 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.780
 what should be more than what should be 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.660
 less to our body 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.670
 received only needed did not exceed 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.829
 some kind of norm and always kept 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.630
 great shape and so let's get out 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.850
 previous videos remember what we are with 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.100
 you talked and we talked about 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.110
 so that they must first build themselves and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.620
 rhythmic power strictly defined 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.770
 clock 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.810
 next we have to determine the size of the portions 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.000
 that is, how much food should we eat 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.530
 every certain time is allowed 8 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.960
 made such a schedule 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.470
 Now let's say we write 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.479
 food intake 8 hours at 1216 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:16.369
 every 4 hours at 20 permissible not 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.340
 through every 8 12 16 12 and 20 let's 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:23.210
 put 2350 a little bit earlier 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.979
 have time to sleep so we determined 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.190
 Meal Schedule 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.850
 determined the number of servings 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:38.690
 portion size how much food should be 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:42.770
 let's say here 400 grams here up to 370 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.530
 grams here let's say 340 grams and so 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.900
 Further and now look what should 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.520
 be your plates some let's 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:56.110
 draw such a small plate and 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.740
 let's divide it into such components 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.740
 probably 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.709
 so look what should be in 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.750
 first in each of your two servings 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.950
 main nutrients on 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.220
 which you should pay more 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.130
 attention is proteins and carbohydrates first 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.930
 let's talk about proteins and big 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:27.040
 part of your plate is about 65 70 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.310
 percent is proteins 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.620
 protein food will explain why but you need 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.900
 understand that protein food no matter how 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.730
 many nutritionists said this is basic 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.140
 the battery we need 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.810
 body in the subsystem 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.750
 proteins are involved in muscle growth about growth 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.180
 hair in nail growth are involved in save 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.880
 skin tightness 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.580
 a huge range of functions that fell 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.470
 perform our body's proteins and their 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.580
 must be the most 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.620
 our diet 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.780
 and the advantage of protein food than 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.750
 is also to besides 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.690
 and a huge potential as a builder for 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.940
 of our body itself such 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.220
 food is not high-calorie if 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.010
 use the product is low fat 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.640
 protein plus protein food when you eat it 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.709
 constantly consume enough 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.230
 quantity that is a large quantity 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.970
 it increases the metabolism of the order of 30 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.060
 percent because protein food on 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.650
 itself is the hardest 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.180
 digestible a and its assimilation 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.560
 the organizer is very big 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.190
 the amount of energy that is when he 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.630
 starts eating protein organizing 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.060
 strengthens your dna and costs faster 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.489
 burned extra sorry 57 percent 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.850
 your plate should fall on 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.420
 protein food that is, if you count from 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.920
 400 to 70 percent 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.400
 it turns out somewhere 200 plus 80 years to 280 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.610
 gram 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:00.000
 from your first serving in the morning should 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.260
 280 grams are new proteins 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.650
 any food that is well recommend 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.989
 squirrels as a rule use squirrels 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.569
 animal origin usually fish 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.209
 every kind of lean meat is chicken 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.790
 turkey breast so on low 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.989
 fatty fish sea foods are eggs and so 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.150
 further the next source is carbohydrates 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.220
 carbohydrates and our main function 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.229
 energy in order to 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.389
 energize our muscles 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.030
 liver work when we perform like this 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.430
 glycogen is not required in such 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.430
 large quantities like proteins therefore their 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:44.770
 should be about 25 and 20-25 percent 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:46.200
 This carbohydrates from carbohydrates recommend 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.310
 use 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.500
 low carbohydrate foods 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.750
 different types of carbohydrate foods this is not 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.590
 cn carbohydrate to various leakage such 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.360
 like a river 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.800
 barley porridge brown rice flour bread 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.510
 wholemeal 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.460
 there are also high natural foods 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.750
 for all sorts of chocolates and their sweets 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.710
 knowledge recommend using 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.930
 use 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.190
 and a low-carb product or neighborhood 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.080
 use low fat proteins here 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.420
 carbohydrate foods so you won't 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.720
 gain weight and will receive 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.890
 just what you need 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.000
 respectively here if you count 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.820
 percent about there from 80 to 100 grams 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.590
 must fall on carbohydrates 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.070
 this is again an example you consider yourself 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.210
 and the remaining five ten percent 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.620
 must account for fat is alive 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.960
 revitalize is also very important for our 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.700
 of the body but simply they are not required 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.790
 such huge quantities as others 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.680
 carbohydrate fats need more careful this 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.780
 high-calorie foods if with them 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.460
 far too much nobody you will clean 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.370
 overweight is the shortest 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.890
 and the most dangerous is to gain excess weight 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.220
 it is because of their fat is not very required 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.260
 many five percent for what but how 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.320
 Rule features such as construction 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.120
 cell membrane building retina 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.510
 eyes have good conduction of nerves 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.460
 channels produce some hormones here 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.800
 same growth hormone 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.390
 testosterone for men fats should 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.160
 very important is required small 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.320
 the amount that I recommend to do 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.450
 fat 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.400
 I recommend them to add your own 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.700
 face in two meals 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.220
 and I recommend adding it in the morning when 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.810
 food is most needed and for example 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.480
 some kind of daytime is firmly the first two 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.000
 Eating is best added either in 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.810
 first third when the body is the most 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.490
 inclined to consume food and put here 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.200
 so embed but why i recommend 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.090
 do not insert every 1 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.240
 reception because it is very difficult to comply 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.980
 fashionable 325 10 percent is very very 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.770
 few recommend you a meal 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.300
 paste just 10 percent off 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.570
 portions i.e. take a little smaller 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.780
 protein for example take 65 percent take 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:03.250
 20 percent carbohydrate and add 10 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:08.030
 percent big pound for example here and 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.890
 here for the rest and during the day 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.750
 let's say and you will still drink 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.030
 for example, there is low fat milk 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.770
 some amount of fat will be in fish 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.990
 which you will have the ball that is 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.890
 quietly the amount of fat anyway 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.750
 will be replenished during the day i 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.000
 I recommend you add yourself 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.180
 fat sources such as nuts 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.370
 such as cheese for example 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.530
 a little bit fatter fish some sort of yes 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.730
 is there any mental ska fat 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.320
 let's say pink salmon and trout and eggs 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.510
 excellent yolk waste fat 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.520
 recommend independently add 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.920
 only two meals in the rest 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.990
 eating all that you have to be 

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.820
 proteins and carbohydrates 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.270
 two basic elements you need 

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:55.760
 now if so distribute your 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.890
 food then you will consider each portion 

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.360
 in such proportions of guns your body will be 

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.490
 always keep yourself in great shape 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.490
 you will have more 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.830
 energy a lot of strength and you have 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.870
 were excellent great figure here's another 

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.820
 such a small lesson from Vasily Ulyanov 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.840
 but on this I have everything see you in 

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.840
 next videos bye
