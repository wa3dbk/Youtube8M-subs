00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
fitness such as strength power balance

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.190 
fitness such as strength power balance
and<00:00:41.100> flexibility<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.060> measure<00:00:42.660> them<00:00:42.900> so<00:00:43.110> an

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and flexibility and measure them so an

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.540 
and flexibility and measure them so an
athlete<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.680> how<00:00:43.800> balanced<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.400> are

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

more<00:00:50.820> balanced<00:00:51.300> you're<00:00:51.810> also<00:00:51.989> less<00:00:52.290> prone<00:00:52.560> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
more balanced you're also less prone to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.120 
more balanced you're also less prone to
injury<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> big<00:00:53.940> injury<00:00:54.300> prevention

ice<00:01:47.729> conditioning<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.810> integrated<00:01:49.380> into

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
ice conditioning was integrated into

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.649 
ice conditioning was integrated into
your<00:01:49.650> training<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:51.030> what's<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> happen

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
your training so what's going to happen

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.570 
your training so what's going to happen
with<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> Stars<00:01:52.080> program<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.560> year<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
with the Stars program this year is the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.120 
with the Stars program this year is the
first<00:01:53.880> three<00:01:54.150> cities<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.720> sign<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.409> 100<00:01:55.950> kids

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
first three cities that sign up 100 kids

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.640 
first three cities that sign up 100 kids
for<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.780> stars<00:01:58.049> testing<00:01:58.500> they're

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
for the for the stars testing they're

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.080 
for the for the stars testing they're
going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.830> get<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> visit<00:01:59.310> from<00:01:59.340> either<00:01:59.790> myself

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
going to get a visit from either myself

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
going to get a visit from either myself
or<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.500> come<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.799> talk

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
or you and we're going to come and talk

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
or you and we're going to come and talk
a<00:02:01.979> little<00:02:02.159> bit<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> program<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> what

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
a little bit about the program and what

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.560 
a little bit about the program and what
we<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.380> means<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.009> us<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:06.479> it's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
we think it means to us and I think it's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
we think it means to us and I think it's
a<00:02:06.630> great<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.290> kids<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.680> gauge<00:02:08.250> what

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
a great way for the kids to gauge what

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.940 
a great way for the kids to gauge what
they're<00:02:09.000> doing<00:02:09.299> on<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.989> ice<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.319> competition

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
they're doing on the ice and competition

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.059 
they're doing on the ice and competition
as<00:02:11.129> well<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.579> office<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.870> example<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:13.620> they're

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
as well as office for example if they're

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.740 
as well as office for example if they're
struggling<00:02:14.340> with<00:02:14.640> some<00:02:14.790> flexibility<00:02:15.420> issues

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
struggling with some flexibility issues

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.380 
struggling with some flexibility issues
maybe<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.200> spiral<00:02:16.470> sequence

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
maybe in a spiral sequence

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.940 
maybe in a spiral sequence
go<00:02:17.480> back<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.870> look<00:02:17.960> at<00:02:18.080> their<00:02:18.230> stars<00:02:18.470> testing

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
go back and look at their stars testing

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.240 
go back and look at their stars testing
and<00:02:19.100> say<00:02:19.250> how<00:02:19.460> is<00:02:19.610> my<00:02:19.760> flexibility<00:02:20.390> and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
and say how is my flexibility and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.500 
and say how is my flexibility and
there's<00:02:22.250> tends<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.910> be<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.030> direct<00:02:23.300> correlation

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
there's tends to be a direct correlation

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.080 
there's tends to be a direct correlation
in<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:24.500> they're<00:02:24.650> doing<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.640> off<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.940> ice

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
in what they're doing on and off the ice

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.880 
in what they're doing on and off the ice
so<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.510> think<00:02:26.780> it's<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.020> great<00:02:27.200> way<00:02:27.500> for<00:02:27.560> them<00:02:27.830> to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
so I think it's a great way for them to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.860 
so I think it's a great way for them to
get<00:02:28.340> involved<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.880> just<00:02:29.120> basically<00:02:29.240> be<00:02:29.630> aware

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
get involved and just basically be aware

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.949 
get involved and just basically be aware
of<00:02:30.130> how<00:02:31.130> they<00:02:31.490> can<00:02:31.670> improve<00:02:31.760> their<00:02:32.000> skating

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
of how they can improve their skating

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.980 
of how they can improve their skating
and<00:02:33.770> actually<00:02:34.280> we<00:02:34.430> have<00:02:34.640> with<00:02:34.820> us<00:02:35.000> two<00:02:35.510> guests

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
and actually we have with us two guests

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.199 
and actually we have with us two guests
