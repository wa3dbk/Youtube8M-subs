00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
the gear faster because the the the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.440 
the gear faster because the the the
files<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:08.020> have<00:04:08.170> right<00:04:08.410> here<00:04:08.440> it's<00:04:08.830> just<00:04:08.920> not<00:04:09.450> it

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
files I have right here it's just not it

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
like ninety degree it's right right here

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.240 
like ninety degree it's right right here
you<00:05:33.270> can<00:05:33.449> see<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:34.560> just<00:05:34.590> make<00:05:34.949> sure<00:05:35.099> because
