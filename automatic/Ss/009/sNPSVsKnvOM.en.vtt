that's<00:03:30.030> why<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.209> never<00:03:30.330> gone<00:03:30.600> about<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.110> that

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
that's why I never gone about it is that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.720 
that's why I never gone about it is that
many<00:03:31.440> people<00:03:31.709> did<00:03:31.950> complain<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.340> i<00:03:32.489> was<00:03:32.610> like

wasn't<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.070> case<00:03:35.160> system<00:03:35.489> for<00:03:35.640> me<00:03:35.730> but<00:03:36.540> it's

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
wasn't a case system for me but it's

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.479 
wasn't a case system for me but it's
because<00:03:36.900> i<00:03:37.019> did<00:03:37.350> not<00:03:37.380> know<00:03:37.590> better<00:03:38.040> at<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
because i did not know better at the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.759 
because i did not know better at the
time<00:03:38.730> if<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.570> knew<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.780> training<00:03:40.410> could<00:03:40.590> go

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
time if I knew that training could go

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.650 
time if I knew that training could go
from<00:03:41.100> what<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.370> was<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.850> what<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.120> now<00:03:42.209> I

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
from what it was to what it is now I

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.009 
from what it was to what it is now I
probably<00:03:43.530> wouldn't<00:03:44.190> want<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.580> now<00:03:44.760> more<00:03:45.090> but

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
probably wouldn't want it now more but
