00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.230
 mirrors Polytech which is not broken on 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.110
 sink decided to fold help corner u drive 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.200
 it is dangerous to raise it in my hand 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.490
 Cables learn here the essence of this with 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.660
 show he fix it right now 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.720
 here he is 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.300
 but the iron fight is that she hike 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.739
 just like the paint and the floor that sit here 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.770
 the puck is already half rotten is not funny 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.680
 pity much visible won those rays 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.410
 which they stick out must go there 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.960
 unbend for a puck 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.309
 I don't know, I'm going to try now 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.690
 pull out or he's there on the mirror 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:57.630
 element can be seen a little bit where the lantern where 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.020
 lantern now let's see 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.020
 butyrina 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.430
 there what is a belt checks need to be 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.780
 somehow try to do it back or I will 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.380
 jam tightly of course flimsy 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.030
 the design is so simple sticky against 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.410
 shitty life just Nikitka then what 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.410
 work centurions 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.940
 so alright now let 's think something 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 the mirror is basically ok but more 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.340
 here is this cant 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.340
 screwed up everything 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.679
 so either I'll eat right now 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.289
 get right here too 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.950
 fixing yourself with screws from below 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.860
 served out 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.609
 it's like a man ride here here 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.740
 duct tape wound straight about it here 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:55.399
 around a few days of cats when 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.740
 startle it to such a machine with electrical tape 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.659
 a life 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.150
 so that he will clean up the flour now 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.670
 shoal 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.970
 so probably best not to fold 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.800
 use and mirror it because 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.540
 I want to decide something liquid nevertheless myself 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.250
 remove all the same element he was here 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.260
 mounted on only two strips 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.820
 double-sided adhesive tape at me too 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.710

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:01.500

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.730
 clients governing what's not there 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.200

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.350
 plan will fix the screw well do 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.590
 there will be a stationary mirror 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.650
 yes the mechanism is shit like everything is possible 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.090
 do unless LIC or cables 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.689
 need to remove and insert a new tube and 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.119
 to grow here about hair 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:41.830
 could do a rivet once she just 

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:46.499
 nut flat nut 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.499
 bottom and top on what to do so at all 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.310
 here the whole barrel angle here is the same 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.120
 here the eyebrow queue fixed no 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:01.340
 it is necessary to insert a deck shit havoc 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.540
 and quit going 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.840

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:14.540
 and 1 is a miracle of snow god put a fence 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.400
 there is one bolt from here 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.860
 this between because everything is twist 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.650
 there is a void in the mirror do not attract 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.100
 to the bottom here so he got out in orange 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.590
 does not get out of there something did not interfere 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.480
 mirror element i therefore this 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.570
 section 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:36.430
 they themselves are the best here 1 and 2 here in 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:41.860
 principle is enough to fix my tight 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.860
