00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.140 
other games I'm actually have jobs lined
up<00:05:29.699> so<00:05:30.699> that<00:05:31.029> I<00:05:31.330> could<00:05:31.509> do<00:05:32.229> that<00:05:32.259> and<00:05:32.830> come<00:05:33.150> play

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
up so that I could do that and come play

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.969 
up so that I could do that and come play
a<00:05:34.240> little<00:05:34.419> bit<00:05:34.599> call<00:05:34.779> do<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:34.990> do<00:05:35.169> this<00:05:35.409> but<00:05:35.740> I

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
a little bit call do you do this but I

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.700 
a little bit call do you do this but I
think<00:05:36.310> for<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.120> most<00:05:37.300> part<00:05:37.419> call<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.960> duty<00:05:38.319> is

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
think for the most part call of duty is

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.399 
think for the most part call of duty is
isn't<00:05:39.520> it<00:05:39.580> like<00:05:39.729> a<00:05:39.759> rut<00:05:40.389> you<00:05:41.050> know<00:05:41.169> I<00:05:41.199> mean

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
isn't it like a rut you know I mean

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.620 
isn't it like a rut you know I mean
there's<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:42.580> know<00:05:42.610> there's<00:05:42.909> only<00:05:43.180> so<00:05:43.509> many
