00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
i've designed with an opening hatch

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.810 
i've designed with an opening hatch
turret<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.260> open<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> hatch<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.490> put

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
turret you can open the hatch and put

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.430 
also going to show this video on the MOC
pages<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.220> can<00:01:43.610> watch<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.450> there<00:01:44.720> as<00:01:45.050> well

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
pages so you can watch it there as well

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.260 
pages so you can watch it there as well
but<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:47.180> love<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:47.930> tank<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:49.130> can't<00:01:49.850> stand<00:01:50.150> a

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
but I love this tank it can't stand a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.750 
but I love this tank it can't stand a
chance<00:01:50.300> now<00:01:50.780> against<00:01:51.320> an<00:01:51.470> m1<00:01:51.890> Abrams<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:52.610> you

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
chance now against an m1 Abrams but you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.280 
chance now against an m1 Abrams but you
know<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:54.650> was<00:01:54.890> good<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.820> destroy<00:01:56.330> Tigers<00:01:56.990> in

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
know it was good to destroy Tigers in

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.400 
know it was good to destroy Tigers in
World<00:01:57.800> War<00:01:57.920> two<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:59.690> think<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.380> should

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
World War two and I think we should

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.520 
World War two and I think we should
honor<00:02:01.240> respectfully<00:02:02.440> well<00:02:05.020> stay<00:02:06.020> tuned<00:02:06.290> for

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
honor respectfully well stay tuned for

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.410 
honor respectfully well stay tuned for
my<00:02:06.680> next<00:02:06.710> video<00:02:07.250> when<00:02:07.460> i'll<00:02:07.580> be<00:02:07.610> designing<00:02:08.239> a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
my next video when i'll be designing a

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.350 
my next video when i'll be designing a
clone<00:02:11.420> recon<00:02:12.260> transport<00:02:13.070> sort<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.489> thing<00:02:13.700> it's

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
clone recon transport sort of thing it's

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.690 
clone recon transport sort of thing it's
kind<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.110> juggernaut<00:02:15.650> but<00:02:16.520> it's

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
kind of like the juggernaut but it's

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.270 
kind of like the juggernaut but it's
more<00:02:16.880> like<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.090> half-track<00:02:17.660> sort<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.110> thing<00:02:18.290> so

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
more like a half-track sort of thing so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.420 
more like a half-track sort of thing so
stay<00:02:19.940> tuned<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.150> that
