game called ambition let's continue it
and<00:01:08.180> what<00:01:09.180> I'll<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.570> start<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and what I'll do is start it from the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.340 
and what I'll do is start it from the
beginning<00:01:11.299> now<00:01:12.299> you've<00:01:12.630> got<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.020> shape<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
beginning now you've got this shape that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
beginning now you've got this shape that
rotates<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.280> three<00:01:14.460> dimensions<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.060> you've

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
rotates in three dimensions and you've

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
rotates in three dimensions and you've
got<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> rope<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.290> tacked<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.369> side

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
got a rope that's tacked on to one side

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
got a rope that's tacked on to one side
of<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.570> idea<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> wrap<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> rope

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
of it and the idea is to wrap the rope

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
of it and the idea is to wrap the rope
around<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.670> block<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.150> wood<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> can

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
around this block of wood and as you can

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.530 
around this block of wood and as you can
see<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.439> either<00:01:22.470> side<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.340> rope<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.360> block

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
see on either side of the rope the block

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
see on either side of the rope the block
gets<00:01:24.720> painted<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.799> that's<00:01:25.979> that's<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.549> goal

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
gets painted so that's that's your goal

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.969 
gets painted so that's that's your goal
is<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> actually<00:01:27.119> paint<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.780> block<00:01:28.140> blue

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
is to actually paint this block blue

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.170 
is to actually paint this block blue
with<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.000> least<00:01:30.360> amount<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.750> rope<00:01:30.990> possible

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
with the least amount of rope possible

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.130 
with the least amount of rope possible
now<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.360> an<00:01:33.509> interesting<00:01:33.630> game<00:01:33.930> I've

interesting fold effect

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.070 
interesting fold effect
in<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.850> game<00:05:09.030> like<00:05:09.360> you're<00:05:09.540> folding<00:05:09.720> over<00:05:09.930> a

ribbon<00:05:10.350> to<00:05:10.440> change<00:05:10.650> direction<00:05:11.000> now<00:05:12.000> notice

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
ribbon to change direction now notice

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.120 
ribbon to change direction now notice
that<00:05:12.360> when<00:05:12.600> you<00:05:12.690> fold<00:05:12.990> on<00:05:13.380> a<00:05:13.680> button<00:05:13.950> it

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
that when you fold on a button it

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.350 
that when you fold on a button it
doesn't<00:05:14.400> really<00:05:14.580> grab<00:05:14.820> the<00:05:15.000> button<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.330> that

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
doesn't really grab the button so that

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.320 
doesn't really grab the button so that
one<00:05:15.600> won't<00:05:15.750> count<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:18.000> there's<00:05:18.210> some

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
one won't count and there's some

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.230 
one won't count and there's some

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
interesting things that also happen that

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.550 
interesting things that also happen that
ribbon<00:05:21.240> gets<00:05:21.480> blocked<00:05:21.780> by<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.110> other<00:05:22.290> one<00:05:22.440> you

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
ribbon gets blocked by the other one you

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.290 
ribbon gets blocked by the other one you
can't<00:05:22.830> go<00:05:22.950> underneath<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.490> except<00:05:23.820> at<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:23.970> 90

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
can't go underneath it except at a 90

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.440 
can't go underneath it except at a 90
degree<00:05:24.540> angle<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:26.340> if<00:05:26.460> I<00:05:26.550> try<00:05:26.730> to<00:05:26.790> go<00:05:26.940> up<00:05:27.060> here

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
degree angle and if I try to go up here

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.360 
degree angle and if I try to go up here
you<00:05:28.230> notice<00:05:28.440> I<00:05:28.500> can't<00:05:28.710> go<00:05:28.800> any<00:05:28.950> forward

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
you notice I can't go any forward

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.159 
you notice I can't go any forward
further<00:05:29.940> forward<00:05:30.450> either<00:05:30.570> when<00:05:30.870> I<00:05:30.900> come

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
further forward either when I come

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.610 
further forward either when I come
across<00:05:31.530> in<00:05:31.740> one<00:05:31.950> of<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.100> folds<00:05:33.350> so<00:05:34.350> there's<00:05:34.560> a

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
across in one of the folds so there's a

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.379 
across in one of the folds so there's a
strategy<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:35.400> this<00:05:35.520> game<00:05:35.820> once<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:36.150> get<00:05:36.300> the

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
strategy to this game once you get the

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.290 
strategy to this game once you get the
hang<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.720> it<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.710> for<00:05:37.800> example<00:05:38.370> it<00:05:38.970> looks<00:05:39.030> like

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
hang of it so for example it looks like

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.659 
hang of it so for example it looks like
I've<00:05:39.419> got<00:05:39.600> to<00:05:39.690> end<00:05:39.810> in<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.139> corner<00:05:40.530> I<00:05:40.710> can't

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
I've got to end in that corner I can't

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.670 
I've got to end in that corner I can't
come<00:05:42.330> at<00:05:42.450> it<00:05:42.480> any<00:05:42.750> other<00:05:42.840> way<00:05:42.990> because<00:05:43.380> it'll

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
come at it any other way because it'll

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.890 
come at it any other way because it'll
be<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:43.800> fold<00:05:44.130> right<00:05:44.460> there<00:05:44.669> so<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.330> know<00:05:45.660> where

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
be a fold right there so I know where

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.860 
be a fold right there so I know where
that<00:05:46.050> one<00:05:46.230> has<00:05:46.410> to<00:05:46.440> end<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:48.000> blue<00:05:48.180> one<00:05:48.419> looks

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
that one has to end the blue one looks

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.960 
that one has to end the blue one looks
like<00:05:49.050> I<00:05:49.230> can<00:05:49.380> go<00:05:49.530> this<00:05:49.680> way<00:05:49.740> or<00:05:52.310> come<00:05:53.310> up<00:05:53.460> from

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
like I can go this way or come up from

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.280 
like I can go this way or come up from
it<00:05:54.090> here<00:05:55.970> now<00:05:56.970> notice<00:05:57.390> the<00:05:57.510> black<00:05:57.690> one<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:57.990> can

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
it here now notice the black one I can

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.190 
it here now notice the black one I can
go<00:05:58.410> underneath<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:59.190> still<00:06:00.060> grab<00:06:00.270> it<00:06:00.450> it's

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
go underneath and still grab it it's

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.989 
go underneath and still grab it it's
been<00:06:01.410> grabbed

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:07.999 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:10.299 

now<00:06:08.899> that<00:06:09.169> will<00:06:09.349> prevent<00:06:09.619> me<00:06:09.799> from<00:06:09.829> getting

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:10.309 
now that will prevent me from getting

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:11.919 
now that will prevent me from getting
the<00:06:10.549> brown<00:06:10.849> ribbon<00:06:11.059> on<00:06:11.239> that<00:06:11.389> button<00:06:11.629> there<00:06:11.899> so

I<00:06:12.169> can't<00:06:12.499> turn<00:06:12.649> there<00:06:13.029> I've<00:06:14.029> got<00:06:14.209> to<00:06:14.299> go<00:06:14.360> like

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:14.569 
I can't turn there I've got to go like

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.379 
I can't turn there I've got to go like
that<00:06:14.689> and<00:06:15.729> that's<00:06:16.729> gonna<00:06:16.939> be<00:06:17.119> a<00:06:17.149> problem<00:06:17.389> there

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
that and that's gonna be a problem there

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:27.580 
that and that's gonna be a problem there
