00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 instead of a shallow leash this situation 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.690
 formed on the Nizhny Novgorod rivers in general 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.490
 and on the Volga in particular not for this 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.360
 passenger navigation was under 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.040
 threat of failure 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.929
 about this we were told who applied to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 wording ship crew representatives 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.340
 navigation should open on May 1st and already 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.039
 now tourist boats must stand 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.170
 Nizhny Novgorod port stocking up provisions 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 first flight however instead of this court 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.070
 stand near the city and balakhny 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.180
 and below can not go down because of too 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.760
 low water 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.349
 in fact we can not now filled 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.239
 weave loaded in general, in principle, enough 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.000
 water is not enough level you store by 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.420
 the water was not enough in the winter we lowered the plug 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.469
 on the water has already passed all the rivers of the shore 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.190
 some so far but little 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.190
 moment 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.239
 as reported by the head of the river movement 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.400
 Ob basin ships Igor Safronov 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.080
 implementation of navigation in the area from 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.870
 Nizhny Novgorod to the city simply 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.550
 impossible experts admit that 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.310
 this level of water can hold out 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.200
 all navigation on April 29 in Moscow 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.140
 A meeting has been scheduled at which 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.220
 try to solve the problem of low water 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.950
 Nizhny Novgorod forecasters hope that 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.610
 a small increase in level will still be 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.900
 in a natural way the increase is now 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.509
 Gorky reservoir due to water 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.450
 which occurs due to melting snow 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.080
 in the forests additional support of course 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.869
 expected in early May there due to 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.509
 unstable weather and short-term 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.190
 of course there must be some rain 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:56.390
 small bait by the way as reported 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.070
 us hydrologists such a record itself 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.369
 low water level has been installed 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.290
 ninety-fourth year but in 2014 in 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.530
 this year the record is broken water level 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.040
 now 30 centimeters lower than it was in 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.040
 ninety-fourth
