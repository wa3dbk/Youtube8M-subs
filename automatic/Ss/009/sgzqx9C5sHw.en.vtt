initially<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.230> college<00:00:25.560> academies<00:00:26.070> took<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
initially the college academies took a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.889 
initially the college academies took a
major<00:00:26.609> portion<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.149> my<00:00:27.269> time<00:00:27.419> because<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.720> had

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:27.899 
major portion of my time because I had

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.319 
major portion of my time because I had
to<00:00:27.930> balance<00:00:28.169> them<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:28.949> later<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.460> when<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.029> got

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
to balance them but later on when I got

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.389 
to balance them but later on when I got
into<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> rigorous<00:00:30.960> preparation<00:00:31.680> process

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
into the rigorous preparation process

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.380 
into the rigorous preparation process
then<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.079> give<00:00:34.260> more<00:00:34.440> time<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
then I had to give more time to the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
then I had to give more time to the
calculation<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.050> balance<00:00:37.409> was<00:00:37.559> almost<00:00:37.890> -

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
calculation and the balance was almost -

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.880 
calculation and the balance was almost -
it<00:00:38.640> didn't<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:38.909> much<00:00:39.089> of<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> problem<00:00:39.739> how<00:00:40.739> did

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it didn't get much of a problem how did

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.509 
it didn't get much of a problem how did
you<00:00:41.010> prepare<00:00:41.370> how<00:00:41.579> many<00:00:41.760> hours<00:00:41.970> did<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.269> study
