00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.110
 our project is called opening the school 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:18.779
 to parents the doors of the most 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.210
 extraordinary but in education 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.189
 priority in the first place we have 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.289
 tried to carry out educational actions 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.699
 within the class but we realized 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.590
 account that there were things that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:38.879
 went beyond the walls of the school and that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:40.350
 was not enough we are the guarantors 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.670
 pedagogical experts we do not 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.170
 do not negotiate on the other hand 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:56.010
 explaining gives meaning to the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:58.559
 coherence to what we do when we put 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.850
 in place learning in class and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.660
 that has taken over at home that there is 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.100
 it allows children to better 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.430
 build and structure their 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.440
 learning 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.190
 the principle of co education as it is 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.680
 written in our literature 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.760
 beautician is something that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 serves one is not used to working 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 with adults we are not trained to 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.560
 that's so it's new blow 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.120
 is reflected here too it has an impact on the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 work on our professional gestures 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.030
 about their team relationship because I 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 think there has to be a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.300
 consistency of the team with respect to these 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 new postures and on the place of 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.420
 establishment and partnership 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.820
 broad sense so have with parents 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 but actors with associations 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.940
 involved in accompanying the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.560
 schooling colleagues learn a 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.810
 new two facets of their profession 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:51.660
 which in my opinion is now part of 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:54.509
 our chandeliers business associating them 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.369
 of aranda actors of the schooling of 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.410
 their children that has an impact it's going 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.140
 reflect in terms of success we did 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.790
 also and we always have parties and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.050
 moments of conviviality the coffee of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.070
 parents is that it's a space that 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.140
 We thought it was important 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.340
 the parents cafe my daughter told me the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.610
 mom today there is the coffee of 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.760
 parents 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.760
 so you 'll go but Italian for 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.320
 over the years all of these of his 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.070
 actions have become a real 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.680
 policy 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.260
 this coherence that we can see it 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.750
 on class times times to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.370
 school berry for students 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.680
 Parents Parents Parents Teachers 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.120
 which is strength and coherence to open the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 class is something not easy 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.900
 but we at first we have 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940
 do that on open studies that we have 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.170
 called open study in observation and 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.420
 some colleagues started to 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.730
 do then after the colleagues of the cp 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.030
 then after all the school agreed to 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.030
 Play the game 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.910
 it's true that it's something that has 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.320
 all his resonance with the sad 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.690
 events that are produced at the beginning of 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.820
 this year we had already mentioned the year 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.709
 last and it comes back to the moment of 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.450
 exceptional departure cafes we had 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.310
 this year the relationship with these 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.900
 technologies to these social networks like 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.480
 a treatise the information here is open it 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.730
 school makes it possible to give back the place to 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.320
 school with a big h at the train station 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.170
 to desecrate this is a dosage 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.940
 complicated and some colleagues who are 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.950
 more refractory or who have had more than 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.660
 reluctance we are afraid of that and I believe 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.090
 that we come to it if we are clear 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.579
 about its goals and what we are putting 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.930
 in place we come to find at this 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.930
 result there that she and the others 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:41.080
 that's what it gives fruits that 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.520
 this is annoying but we reach more 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.040
 60% turnout in elections 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.900
 for three years what for education 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.100
 priority is well above the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.480
 usual averages 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.060
 because all these things are going well 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.760
 things participates in and allow to 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.650
 cultivate that trust on which we 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.920
 can build with this common goal that 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.870
 we have 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.530
 we student success had the 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.660
 success of the child eric open the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.190
 door to the bulbs the parents is 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.690
 not to complain about our children but 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.840
 to talk about our childhoods did 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.840
 dance
