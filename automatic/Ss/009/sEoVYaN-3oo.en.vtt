00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
made with two layers of paper mache

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.390 
made with two layers of paper mache
using<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.019> brand<00:00:13.290> new<00:00:13.469> recipe<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.160> I

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
using a brand new recipe that I

using a brand new recipe that I
developed<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.740> fast-setting<00:00:16.740> paper<00:00:17.220> mache

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
developed for fast-setting paper mache

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.179 
developed for fast-setting paper mache
paste<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.420> only<00:00:18.840> got<00:00:19.080> two<00:00:19.320> layers<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.070> as

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
paste it's only got two layers but as

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.849 
paste it's only got two layers but as
you<00:00:20.340> can<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:20.910> really<00:00:21.300> strong<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.470> nice

over a mass form you can use either a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
over a mass form you can use either a
plastic<00:01:13.500> mass<00:01:14.130> form<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:15.000> a

plastic mass form that you get at a
hobby<00:01:15.270> store<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.650> yourself

hobby store or you can make one yourself
like<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.549> did<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.439> use

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
like I did here and then you use

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.950 
like I did here and then you use
modeling<00:01:20.250> clay<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.060> features<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
modeling clay to make the features I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.830 
modeling clay to make the features I
happen<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.189> super<00:01:23.549> sculpey<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.659> can

finish in one day however I recommend

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.740 
finish in one day however I recommend
that<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.920> take<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.190> bit<00:02:27.430> more<00:02:27.459> time<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.690> only

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
that you take a bit more time not only

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.660 
that you take a bit more time not only
to<00:02:28.989> let<00:02:29.260> everything<00:02:29.530> dry<00:02:29.830> thoroughly<00:02:30.220> but

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
to let everything dry thoroughly but

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.790 
to let everything dry thoroughly but
also<00:02:31.000> because<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.840> gives<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.170> more<00:02:32.380> time<00:02:32.440> to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
also because it gives you more time to

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.650 
also because it gives you more time to
be<00:02:32.950> creative<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.640> get<00:02:34.180> things<00:02:34.390> really

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660
