00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.670
 Good day dear friends 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.769
 many asked us about pumping 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.940
 characters so let's breakdown 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:20.939
 character to play solo or play 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.689
 group in the game arc shuvalov we now 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.560
 there was a wipe on the servers because 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.900
 We discovered a bug of the Upsin we play it 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.290
 everyone has been playing for over 30 hours and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.850
 actually starting to re-configure 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.530
 all from scratch, here are our fellow soldiers and me 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.620
 I play in a group and actually pumping 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.870
 I will be oriented more towards 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.059
 animals what does that mean i mean i don't 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.899
 I shake myself absolutely do not swing myself weight 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.120
 we have from the standard to 100 so I do not 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.910
 I shake my mile damage because in 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 principle orients more likely to 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.729
 a firearm that will be in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.250
 continue to lie on 6 dinosaurs speed 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.560
 myself literally there twice about but cleanly with 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.119
 with the expectation of sometimes needing somewhere 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.640
 fast u jump from dinosaur for 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.549
 some kind of stone main priority i 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.979
 I put on the endurance of his connection even 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.720
 resistance of the mess 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.070
 this figure affects a 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.280
 the definition of weather all sorts of different 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.640
 conditions that is depending on 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.979
 from the situation we have reduced either food well then 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.960
 there is 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.720
 affects food health and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.600
 accordingly adds efficiency here I have 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.049
 pumped a little bit but this is likely 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.689
 I have a little bit of heading hp 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.090
 stamina and i decided that i need oxygen 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.590
 to swim underwater from 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.759
 experience on the last server I will 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.090
 bring up to 300 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.219
 istomin somewhere up to 160 this will allow me 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.240
 be under water long enough 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.330
 time to collect all sorts of different buns here 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.090
 and thanks to great-grandfather from 30 min 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.370
 it's just that the earring is pumped in 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.680
 I could just have a full night without clothes 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.209
 conduct under water and in doing so I survived 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.370
 ate raw meat that is, I had enough 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.530
 at 200, if you 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.849
 focus more on fat gaming 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.170
 most likely you will initially need 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:34.010
 raise a little bit without that more or less 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:39.200
 walk one speed to somewhere 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.410
 it is also possible to escape on your own 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.519
 you will not be missed by all 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.950
 of air 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.410
 but in the game and created all sorts of soups 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.209
 which allow certain articles 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.680
 increase that is this case of us 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.660
 there is a soup that allows us a long time 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.519
 swim is the only thing to do to 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.430
 make this soup need to be confused 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.140
 a little bit so even though I'm 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.629
 I play in a group so I don’t bother 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.190
 decided to shout oxygen to myself 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.370
 you have to aim you have to decide 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.200
 directly by itself that is what 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.690
 indicator for you will be more important you 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.540
 understand the course of action but guys 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.269
 I advise you not to forget about the fort here then 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.639
 there is this show will always influence 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.030
 on your well-being on your game and 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:26.540
 so I advise you not to throw it 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.579
 Next, let's sort the points for pumping yourself 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.950
 skills initially that is for an hour was 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.790
 wipe as you can see i available but many 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.430
 skills and in any case have to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.980
 swing if you play one then it is fire 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.280
 hatchet up the copy initially it is in any 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.319
 case here if you play together then 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.319
 maybe someone will have you download 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.620
 empire yes is it we have a fire in an ax hoarding 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.459
 I think you have to anyway 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.989
 learn although it is possible to do without a spear 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.730
 This flask I think initially, too 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.349
 you will need but again in 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.910
 Depending on the distance from the water 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.569
 there you have the opportunity to go to the water 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.130
 drink or not someone will paint 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.359
 clothes on what I would like to draw 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.900
 Attention when playing in Sau try if 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.970
 Do you want to 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.030
 if you have an urgent need for that 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.850
 teacher 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.280
 if she is not here then what is in the game 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.580
 there are all sorts of artifacts from which 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.020
 there is a different drop each print like how 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.730
 subject and so and recipes 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.850
 that is, in our case, here we are 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.950
 picked up one fact but quickly only 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.919
 appeared yes we had carpentry 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.930
 table 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.940
 installation of a general roughly speaking yes like that 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.070
 there are different kinds and structures then 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.720
 there are walls and easier that is on the past 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.430
 series whether we are not taught in principle 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.139
 metal structures because 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.580
 metal to all designs 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.550
 metal we picked up 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.230
 from precisely artifacts well we call 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.530
 artifacts 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.050
 different color is best coming down from the sky 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.300
 maybe that's such a plan like this 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.610
 they look that is if you play 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.530
 one initially you set which 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.120
 will subside somewhere, that is, initially you 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.530
 you had to pick something up 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.110
 put the bed you need some 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.960
 words do not somehow cover up ie learn 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.000
 straw walls here and then you 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.180
 In principle, you can run through the rays and 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.229
 collect yourself recipe wooden recipes 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.800
 besides the fact that you do not spend points 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:34.630
 on these craft recipes through matched 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.140
 recipes look more like let's say he 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.229
 has great strength 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.840
 more combs give the same clothes 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.780
 such a plan that is originally you 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.850
 you need to decide what you want and in 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.510
 further, that is to try to collect 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.250
 if we play one different kind of different 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.080
 better colors are better broken by different 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.930
 level that is it starting from 5 it 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.840
 the little white ray goes further green it is 15 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:06.400
 blue 25 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:11.979
 violet 35 next goes yellow tapom 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.810
 45 and further I forgot as big 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.789
 I didn’t run much better because 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.889
 we have a principle 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:23.990
 our server came and we often 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:25.910
 have achieved this directly 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.370
 the very form of cents well and the server we 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.699
 finished before we even took 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.630
 new kapu principle all thinned here 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:37.190
 Well, at the moment I have everything 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.970
 what I would like to wish you specifically 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:44.120
 There is a ford here for sure 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.660
 do not forget that you have different 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.810
 kind of 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.539
 recipes that you will need 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.220
 initially in any case learn all 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.639
 the rest you can basically find in 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.039
 rays 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.120
 until new meetings with you was gi-bros 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.120
 bye Bye
