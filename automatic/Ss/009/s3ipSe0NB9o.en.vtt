now and I've been given a good old test
and<00:00:38.129> I've<00:00:38.280> reason<00:00:38.610> why<00:00:38.670> I've<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:38.910> put<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920 
as you can see there it's not really
just<00:01:38.070> called<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> much<00:01:38.640> yes<00:01:39.420> stats<00:01:39.630> got<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
just called that much yes stats got a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.569 
just called that much yes stats got a
bit<00:01:40.229> yellowish<00:01:40.500> around<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> edge<00:01:41.100> parts<00:01:41.460> here

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
bit yellowish around the edge parts here

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.639 
bit yellowish around the edge parts here
and<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.450> guess<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> happen<00:01:43.350> with

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and I guess that's going to happen with

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
and I guess that's going to happen with
most<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.130> them<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.450> bad<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
most of them but it's not as bad as it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480
