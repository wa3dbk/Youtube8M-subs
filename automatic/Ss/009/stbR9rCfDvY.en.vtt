00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.540
 which is the special of a character you 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.430
 that has a moment in the podcast was 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.710

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.770
 end of the program as cloths 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.810
 we recorded our voices to be 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.940
 included in the game and when there is a 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.590
 punch you take beating as you die 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.130
 enamel for me this game does not 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.200
 I played 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.530

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.660
 I have to have my name linked to the 99 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.370
 lives is a podcast that I think that 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.930
 It rewards the lives of many people. 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.660

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.500
 bruno the big hits have them with 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.480

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.570
 of people who like old games 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.360
 have become a type game, I'm 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.960
 In a game, my affection there I speak 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.970
 that 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.440
 very very cool but I never 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.330
 I would believe when I was a kid, it's a 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.509
 something that would never happen to the head 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.880
 game with me I'm not a character from 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.800

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.259
 but if you talk and something else you do not have 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.880

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.530
 made out of the pack with affection 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.030
