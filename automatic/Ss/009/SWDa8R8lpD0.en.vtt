00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
concept basically I just got here is a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.270 
concept basically I just got here is a
misty<00:01:58.040> power<00:01:58.280> source<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.800> could<00:02:04.190> have

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
misty power source and so you could have

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.280 
misty power source and so you could have
any<00:02:04.430> power<00:02:04.760> source<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.120> want<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.480> power<00:02:05.900> I'm

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
any power source you want to power I'm

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.980 
any power source you want to power I'm
afraid<00:02:06.410> motors<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:08.119> just<00:02:08.300> got<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.479> big<00:02:08.750> door

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
afraid motors and I just got a big door

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.260 
afraid motors and I just got a big door
with<00:02:09.350> Kabul<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.399> either<00:02:10.520> side<00:02:10.820> I<00:02:11.030> don't<00:02:11.180> know

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
with Kabul on either side I don't know

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.640 
with Kabul on either side I don't know
that<00:02:11.480> thing's<00:02:11.720> missing<00:02:11.900> button<00:02:13.930> anyway<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
that thing's missing button anyway and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.560 
that thing's missing button anyway and
so<00:02:15.980> whenever<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.550> were<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:17.620> put<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.800> switch

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
so whenever you were to put the switch

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.480 
so whenever you were to put the switch
that<00:02:20.570> would<00:02:20.780> be<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.140> down<00:02:21.470> one<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.370> would

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
that would be the down one and it would

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.460 
that would be the down one and it would
especially<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.270> same<00:02:23.450> about<00:02:23.600> how<00:02:24.110> i<00:02:24.140> did<00:02:24.320> it

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
especially the same about how i did it

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.440 
especially the same about how i did it
before<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.280> don't<00:02:25.490> know<00:02:25.580> if<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.790> guys<00:02:25.910> saw<00:02:25.970> my

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
before I don't know if you guys saw my

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.310 
before I don't know if you guys saw my
home<00:02:27.350> or<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.100> defense<00:02:28.400> tutorial<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:30.170> as

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
home or to defense tutorial but as

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.220 
home or to defense tutorial but as
basically<00:02:30.620> us<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> same<00:02:31.870> concept<00:02:32.870> there<00:02:33.050> you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
basically us the same concept there you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.670 
basically us the same concept there you
have<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> counter<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.460> counts<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.790> three<00:02:34.820> and

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
have a counter that counts to three and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.380 
have a counter that counts to three and
the<00:02:36.680> timer<00:02:36.920> counts<00:02:37.580> basically<00:02:38.060> for<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
the timer counts basically for the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.120 
the timer counts basically for the
council<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:38.870> itself<00:02:39.170> because<00:02:39.590> each<00:02:39.709> tenant<00:02:39.950> I

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
council for itself because each tenant I

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.800 
council for itself because each tenant I
per<00:02:40.190> tix<00:02:40.490> accounts<00:02:41.000> one<00:02:41.150> more<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.570> timer

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
per tix accounts one more on the timer

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.290 
per tix accounts one more on the timer
and<00:02:42.080> whenever<00:02:42.980> this<00:02:43.220> thing<00:02:43.490> pulses<00:02:43.970> did<00:02:44.150> let

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
and whenever this thing pulses did let

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.980 
and whenever this thing pulses did let
it<00:02:44.330> go<00:02:44.540> it'll<00:02:45.490> reset<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:46.700> thing<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.870> I'll

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
it go it'll reset this thing so I'll

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.050 
it go it'll reset this thing so I'll
show<00:02:48.020> your<00:02:48.320> air<00:02:48.400> see<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.490> resets<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.850> timer

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
show your air see it resets the timer

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.760 
show your air see it resets the timer
and<00:02:50.360> then<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.600> timer<00:02:50.810> cake<00:02:51.110> for<00:02:51.260> itself<00:02:51.530> and

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
and then the timer cake for itself and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.110 
and then the timer cake for itself and
then<00:02:52.040> once<00:02:52.250> it's<00:02:52.370> done<00:02:52.489> with<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.700> three<00:02:52.880> ticks

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
then once it's done with the three ticks

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.190 
then once it's done with the three ticks
and<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.410> stops<00:02:55.100> itself<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.880> then<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.989> just

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
and it it stops itself and then you just

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.070 
and it it stops itself and then you just
take<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.590> sense<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.220> into<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:59.080> frame

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
take it sense it it's into the frame

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.470 
take it sense it it's into the frame
motor<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.489> pretty<00:03:01.730> simple<00:03:02.060> bill

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
motor so it's a pretty simple bill

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.540 
motor so it's a pretty simple bill
actually<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.470> didn't<00:03:03.920> take<00:03:04.040> me<00:03:04.160> all<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.370> long

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
actually it didn't take me all that long

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.350 
actually it didn't take me all that long
to<00:03:04.700> make<00:03:05.200> but<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.560> just<00:03:07.550> had<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.760> pretty<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.180> up<00:03:08.300> a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
to make but I just had to pretty it up a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.009 
to make but I just had to pretty it up a

been pointed my seven here with my
completely<00:03:42.650> awesome<00:03:42.920> framed<00:03:43.430> or<00:03:43.640> which<00:03:44.120> is

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
completely awesome framed or which is

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.180 
completely awesome framed or which is
completely<00:03:44.870> invisible<00:03:45.140> by<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.680> way<00:03:45.890> unless

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
completely invisible by the way unless

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.400 
completely invisible by the way unless
you<00:03:46.370> push<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.700> button<00:03:47.019> but<00:03:48.019> could<00:03:48.320> be

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
you push the button but could be

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.240 
you push the button but could be
anywhere<00:03:48.709> by<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.920> way

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
anywhere by the way

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.030 
anywhere by the way
