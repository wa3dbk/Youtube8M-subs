00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
but this is what it looks like right now

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.569 
but this is what it looks like right now
it's<00:01:37.049> been<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.290> about<00:01:37.470> 15-20<00:01:38.130> minutes<00:01:38.400> now

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it's been there about 15-20 minutes now

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.170 
it's been there about 15-20 minutes now
as<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.630> looking<00:01:39.780> pretty<00:01:40.259> good

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
as you can see it's looking pretty good

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.370 
as you can see it's looking pretty good
it's<00:01:42.180> doing<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.659> supposed<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.990> so

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
it's doing what it's supposed to so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.069 
it's doing what it's supposed to so
we'll<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.560> how<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.799> turns<00:01:46.979> out<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.670> may

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
we'll see how it turns out here I may

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.719 
we'll see how it turns out here I may
I'm<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.290> thinking<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.710> gonna<00:01:49.799> take<00:01:50.100> 12

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I'm not thinking it's gonna take 12

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
I'm not thinking it's gonna take 12
hours<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:51.149> thinking<00:01:51.509> probably<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.530> hour

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
hours I'm thinking probably the two hour

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.249 
hours I'm thinking probably the two hour
things<00:01:53.070> gonna<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.460> better<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.090> we'll<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.170> how

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
things gonna be better so we'll see how

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.749 
things gonna be better so we'll see how
that<00:01:55.500> we'll<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.890> how<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> goes<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> end

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that we'll see how that goes at the end

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
that we'll see how that goes at the end
of<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.969> got<00:01:57.149> my<00:01:57.270> dampers<00:01:57.689> closed<00:01:57.960> off<00:01:58.200> just

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
of that got my dampers closed off just

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.260 
of that got my dampers closed off just
to<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> smoke<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.430> there<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:02.090> we'll<00:02:03.090> see

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to get the smoke in there and we'll see

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.270 
to get the smoke in there and we'll see
how<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.509> turns<00:02:03.689> off<00:02:04.110> turns<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.860> by<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> end

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
how that turns off turns out by the end

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.300 
how that turns off turns out by the end
of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> day<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.810> see<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.200> them<00:02:07.469> got

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
of the day as you can see I got them got

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.260 
of the day as you can see I got them got
the<00:02:08.520> temperature<00:02:09.390> gauges<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.259> way<00:02:10.379> down

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270

and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.090 
and
temperature<00:02:14.200> here<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.740> can<00:02:14.920> see<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.960> about

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
temperature here you can see this about

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.190 
temperature here you can see this about
150<00:02:18.100> I'll<00:02:19.030> have<00:02:19.240> one<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.600> inside<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:19.990> do

you can place in the you know in the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.520 
you can place in the you know in the
meat<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.250> then<00:02:27.370> salmon<00:02:27.820> itself<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:29.260> give<00:02:29.440> me

meat and then salmon itself to give me
an<00:02:29.620> idea<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.010> what<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.340> temperature<00:02:30.550> inside

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
an idea of what the temperature inside

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.520 
an idea of what the temperature inside
is<00:02:31.120> gonna<00:02:31.300> be<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.600> I'll<00:02:31.660> use<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.020> later<00:02:32.260> on
