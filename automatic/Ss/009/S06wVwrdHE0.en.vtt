00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
something to see once we print the file

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.309 
something to see once we print the file
um

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
um

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.959 
okay so now that I've so I've been
thought<00:02:21.719> tutorials<00:02:22.340> will<00:02:23.340> be<00:02:23.459> able<00:02:23.579> to<00:02:23.700> use

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
thought tutorials will be able to use

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.069 
thought tutorials will be able to use
the<00:02:24.150> program<00:02:24.689> to<00:02:25.499> see<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:25.980> typed<00:02:26.370> that

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.110 
the program to see that I typed that
okay<00:02:28.079> so<00:02:28.139> to<00:02:28.349> access<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:29.519> keylogger<00:02:30.299> arm

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
okay so to access the keylogger arm

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.670 
okay so to access the keylogger arm
you're<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.299> use<00:02:33.420> terminal<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.409> come<00:02:34.650> up

much memory you have I have three
megabytes<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.879> stuff<00:03:33.120> because<00:03:33.329> i've<00:03:33.449> had<00:03:33.479> this

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
megabytes of stuff because i've had this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.629 
megabytes of stuff because i've had this
program<00:03:34.199> on<00:03:34.379> my<00:03:34.500> computer<00:03:34.530> for<00:03:35.159> a<00:03:35.220> while<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
program on my computer for a while and

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.640 
program on my computer for a while and
then<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.329> just<00:03:36.479> type<00:03:36.689> in<00:03:36.840> print<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:39.650> they'll

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.449 
print everything that's been typed since
you've<00:03:42.930> downloaded<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.560> program<00:03:43.769> unless<00:03:44.280> you

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
you've downloaded the program unless you

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.449 
you've downloaded the program unless you
delete<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.909> but<00:03:45.419> as<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:45.900> see<00:03:46.199> i<00:03:46.459> searched

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
delete it but as you can see i searched

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.629 
delete it but as you can see i searched
for<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.329> tutorials<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.349> as<00:03:50.189> you<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.489> see<00:03:50.519> i

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
for the tutorials and as you can see i

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.089 
for the tutorials and as you can see i
spelled<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.269> wrong<00:03:51.449> but<00:03:51.810> there<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:52.829> right

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
spelled it wrong but there it is right

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.199 
spelled it wrong but there it is right
there<00:03:54.799> so<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:56.099> works<00:03:56.370> if<00:03:56.609> someone<00:03:56.879> goes<00:03:57.000> on

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
there so this works if someone goes on

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.999 
there so this works if someone goes on
your<00:03:57.329> computer<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.840> goes<00:03:58.079> on<00:03:58.229> facebook<00:03:58.859> or

00:03:58.999 --> 00:03:59.009 
your computer and goes on facebook or

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.170 
your computer and goes on facebook or
something<00:03:59.189> you'll<00:03:59.579> be<00:03:59.699> able<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.969> get<00:04:00.090> your

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
something you'll be able to get your

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
past their password and their email so

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.629 
past their password and their email so
that's<00:04:04.169> how<00:04:04.349> you<00:04:04.409> keylogger<00:04:05.280> your<00:04:05.519> own

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639
