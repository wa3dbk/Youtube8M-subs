minutes you'll see Scott paddling it's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.490 
minutes you'll see Scott paddling it's
got<00:01:15.000> weighs<00:01:15.180> 220<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.820> his<00:01:18.060> weight

has<00:01:21.810> only<00:01:22.290> about<00:01:22.500> 20%<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> nose<00:01:23.969> in<00:01:24.119> the

has only about 20% of the nose in the

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.870 
has only about 20% of the nose in the
water<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.719> clearly<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.340> board<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.820> a
