watchtower<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.549> feel<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
watchtower I feel like if you put it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
watchtower I feel like if you put it
here<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.170> perhaps<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> would<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.850> better

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
here or perhaps here it would be better

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
here or perhaps here it would be better
although<00:01:21.390> lean<00:01:22.140> ops<00:01:22.290> drone<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> face

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
although lean ops drone is in the face

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
although lean ops drone is in the face
so<00:01:23.580> he<00:01:23.729> will<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.210> something<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.080> up

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so he will know that something is up

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.510 
so he will know that something is up
because<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> cannot<00:01:25.740> spot<00:01:25.950> any<00:01:26.040> Berenson<00:01:26.430> oh

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
because you cannot spot any Berenson oh

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.609 
because you cannot spot any Berenson oh
there's<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> proxy<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.240> against<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.500> that

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
there's a proxy up against so in that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
know there's a proxy so you may as well

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.710 
know there's a proxy so you may as well
put<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.790> somewhere<00:01:32.939> knows<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.509> soon<00:01:33.600> as

we<00:01:36.479> arc<00:01:36.659> has<00:01:36.869> opted<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.350> hatch<00:01:37.530> first

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
we arc has opted for the hatch first

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
we arc has opted for the hatch first
which<00:01:38.700> puts<00:01:38.880> them<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.540> bad<00:01:39.810> spot

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
which puts them in a bit of a bad spot

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.319 
which puts them in a bit of a bad spot
really<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> drone<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.119> going

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
really that's because the drone is going

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
really that's because the drone is going
back<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.960> try<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.229> check<00:01:43.560> maybe<00:01:44.220> he<00:01:44.399> thinks

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
back in to try and check maybe he thinks

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
back in to try and check maybe he thinks
that<00:01:45.000> boxes<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> shenanigans<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.439> course

I'm<00:02:10.720> wondering<00:02:10.959> why<00:02:11.650> slow<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.950> box<00:02:12.100> this<00:02:12.250> is

I'm wondering why slow the box this is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.010 
I'm wondering why slow the box this is
actually<00:02:12.670> because<00:02:12.910> he<00:02:13.540> has<00:02:13.630> inside<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:13.959> the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
actually because he has inside of the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.180 
actually because he has inside of the
second<00:02:14.319> barracks<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.709> usually<00:02:14.950> when<00:02:15.040> you're

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
doing some very heavy barracks

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.740 
doing some very heavy barracks
aggression<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:18.130> go<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.430> two<00:02:18.580> acts<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.540> looks

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
aggression you go for two acts it looks

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.090 
aggression you go for two acts it looks

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
like he's up to four ones and maybe he's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.670 
like he's up to four ones and maybe he's
just<00:02:21.280> trying<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.580> make<00:02:21.730> lean<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.030> panic<00:02:22.390> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
just trying to make lean on panic and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.620 
just trying to make lean on panic and

get him on tilt and looks like it is

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.900 
get him on tilt and looks like it is
gonna<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:25.810> putting<00:02:25.989> down<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> bunker<00:02:26.910> although

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
gonna be putting down a bunker although

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.820 
gonna be putting down a bunker although
of<00:02:28.030> course<00:02:28.140> alou<00:02:29.140> nuts<00:02:29.350> going<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.590> take<00:02:29.680> that

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
of course alou nuts going to take that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.740 
of course alou nuts going to take that
out<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.250> looks<00:02:30.400> like<00:02:30.520> drones<00:02:31.360> going<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.630> kill

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
out it looks like drones going to kill

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.860 
out it looks like drones going to kill
that<00:02:31.780> before<00:02:32.200> marine<00:02:32.470> even<00:02:32.739> gets<00:02:33.010> there<00:02:33.870> it's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
that before marine even gets there it's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.300 
that before marine even gets there it's
not<00:02:35.080> really<00:02:35.290> going<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.470> over<00:02:35.650> boxer<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.190> I

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
not really going to over boxer and I

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.770 
not really going to over boxer and I
think<00:02:36.489> he's<00:02:36.580> going<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.880> be<00:02:37.239> forced<00:02:37.540> to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
think he's going to have to be forced to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.160 
think he's going to have to be forced to
lift<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.200> his<00:02:38.350> barracks<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.220> go<00:02:39.970> back<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.239> face

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.140 

looks<00:02:44.170> like<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.350> marine<00:02:44.500> dude<00:02:44.650> job<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.190> he

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
looks like the marine dude job and he

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.540 
looks like the marine dude job and he
will<00:02:46.330> ward<00:02:46.569> off<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.720> drone<00:02:47.250> drone<00:02:48.250> getting

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
will ward off the drone drone getting

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.860 
will ward off the drone drone getting
out<00:02:48.640> there<00:02:48.760> with<00:02:48.910> his<00:02:49.000> minerals<00:02:49.360> or<00:02:49.510> returns
