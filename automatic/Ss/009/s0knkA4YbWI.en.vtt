and yeah so you know how like meltdown

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.570 
and yeah so you know how like meltdown
had<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.760> toxic<00:02:55.360> tubes<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.989> spray<00:02:56.769> thing<00:02:57.069> whip

had the toxic tubes and spray thing whip
on<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.959> guy<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.890> like<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:01.080> different

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
on this guy it's like a different

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.750 
on this guy it's like a different
version<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.799> him<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.220> that's<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.420> what<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> think

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
version of him so that's on what I think

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.600 
version of him so that's on what I think
another<00:03:06.760> strange<00:03:07.150> thing<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.750> on<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
another strange thing is on the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.050 
another strange thing is on the
packaging<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.880> says<00:03:10.420> these<00:03:11.370> are<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.760> that

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
