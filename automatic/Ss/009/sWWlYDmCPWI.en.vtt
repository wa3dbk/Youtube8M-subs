00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
name of this video I've already uploaded

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.769 
name of this video I've already uploaded
the<00:00:16.350> first<00:00:16.619> preview<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.150> wasn't<00:00:18.660> quite

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the first preview but that wasn't quite

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.320 
the first preview but that wasn't quite
complete<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:20.070> made<00:00:20.340> some<00:00:20.609> mistakes<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
complete and I made some mistakes in it

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.859 
complete and I made some mistakes in it
so<00:00:21.990> since<00:00:22.980> I've<00:00:23.310> uploaded<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:24.060> preview<00:00:24.600> I've

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
so since I've uploaded that preview I've

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.900 
so since I've uploaded that preview I've
gathered<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.680> more<00:00:25.859> information<00:00:26.099> done<00:00:26.699> some

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
gathered some more information done some

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.849 
gathered some more information done some
research<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:29.390> that's<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.320> much<00:00:31.529> fat

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
research and that's and was so much fat

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.120 
research and that's and was so much fat
I<00:00:32.070> decided<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:33.329> another<00:00:33.690> video<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.350> patch

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
I decided to do another video on patch

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.200 
I decided to do another video on patch
8.5<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.950> see<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.489> German

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
8.5 so right here you see the German

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.260 
8.5 so right here you see the German
tech<00:00:39.420> tree<00:00:39.780> how<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.559> look<00:00:40.590> after<00:00:41.270> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
tech tree how it will look after the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.740 
tech tree how it will look after the
patch<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.820> there'll<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.410> new<00:00:46.410> line<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
patch and there'll be a new line of

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.529 
patch and there'll be a new line of
medium<00:00:48.750> tax<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.739> German<00:00:50.100> actually<00:00:50.550> now<00:00:51.149> my

medium tax in the German actually now my
last<00:00:51.780> preview<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.559> said<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.160> vallejo<00:00:53.550> part<00:00:53.910> 1

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
last preview I said that vallejo part 1

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.049 
last preview I said that vallejo part 1
will<00:00:54.510> probably<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> tier<00:00:55.739> 8<00:00:55.949> premium<00:00:56.789> talk

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
will probably be a tier 8 premium talk

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.610 
will probably be a tier 8 premium talk
but<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.260> won't<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.640> will<00:00:59.910> be<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.390> tier<00:01:01.020> 10<00:01:01.350> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
but it won't be it will be at tier 10 of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.370 
but it won't be it will be at tier 10 of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
going to show you some pictures of these

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.330 
going to show you some pictures of these
three<00:01:25.560> tanks<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.600> quickly<00:01:27.600> introducing

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
three tanks and quickly introducing

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.980 
three tanks and quickly introducing
first<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.759> turn<00:01:30.030> you'll<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.509> able<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
first you turn you'll be able to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
first you turn you'll be able to
research<00:01:31.380> will<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:34.369> Indian<00:01:35.369> partner<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
research will be the Indian partner and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.740 
research will be the Indian partner and
I've<00:01:36.600> listed<00:01:37.560> four<00:01:38.150> characteristics<00:01:39.150> that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
I've listed four characteristics that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.319 
I've listed four characteristics that
Miss<00:01:40.049> tank<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.530> probably<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.090> top

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
Miss tank will probably have in the top

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.170 
Miss tank will probably have in the top
right<00:01:42.630> corner<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.790> looked<00:01:45.060> through

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
right corner so you have looked through

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.160 
right corner so you have looked through
them<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.000> tank<00:01:48.390> looks<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.990> lot

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
them and I think this tank looks a lot

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.149 
them and I think this tank looks a lot
like<00:01:49.590> voleva<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.170> probably<00:01:52.530> perform

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
like voleva so it will probably perform

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.429 
like voleva so it will probably perform
a<00:01:53.340> bit<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.149> mean<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.540> course<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:55.020> think

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
a bit like it I mean of course I think

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.800 
a bit like it I mean of course I think
there's<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> medium<00:01:56.070> tank<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> louver<00:01:57.210> is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
there's a medium tank and the louver is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.469 
there's a medium tank and the louver is
a<00:01:57.869> heavy<00:01:58.290> tank<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.520> tank<00:01:59.820> will<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.270> lot

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
a heavy tank and this tank will be a lot

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.560 
a heavy tank and this tank will be a lot
faster<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:02.189> won't<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:02.909> much<00:02:03.060> armor

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
faster and it won't have as much armor

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.040 
faster and it won't have as much armor
but<00:02:03.750> perhaps<00:02:04.170> forgot

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
but perhaps forgot

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.410 
but perhaps forgot
be<00:02:05.200> kind<00:02:05.410> of<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.590> bit<00:02:05.740> similar<00:02:06.070> or<00:02:06.700> kind<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.270> its

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
be kind of a bit similar or kind of its

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.180 
be kind of a bit similar or kind of its
style<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.170> gameplay<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.620> don't<00:02:08.770> know<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.040> at

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
style of gameplay I don't know but at

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.260 
style of gameplay I don't know but at
least<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.520> looks<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.940> lot<00:02:10.090> like<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.540> mover<00:02:10.869> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
least it looks a lot like the mover so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.690 
least it looks a lot like the mover so
this<00:02:13.270> tank<00:02:13.720> will<00:02:14.080> probably<00:02:14.710> be<00:02:14.980> fitted<00:02:15.460> with

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
this tank will probably be fitted with

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.840 
this tank will probably be fitted with
the<00:02:16.120> gun<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.720> pack<00:02:16.990> but<00:02:17.830> that's<00:02:18.220> not<00:02:18.580> quite

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
the gun of the pack but that's not quite

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.170 
the gun of the pack but that's not quite
sure<00:02:19.000> yet<00:02:22.560> after<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> Indian<00:02:24.130> Panzer<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.940> get

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
sure yet after the Indian Panzer you get

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.600 
sure yet after the Indian Panzer you get
to<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.540> prototype<00:02:26.350> there<00:02:26.770> are<00:02:27.010> rights<00:02:27.280> could

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
to the prototype there are rights could

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.010 
to the prototype there are rights could
be<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:30.340> tank<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:31.000> just<00:02:31.540> more<00:02:31.720> or<00:02:31.840> less<00:02:31.990> a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
be and this tank is just more or less a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.850 
be and this tank is just more or less a
prototype<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.860> Leo<00:02:33.700> part<00:02:34.060> 1<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.410> will<00:02:35.710> have

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
prototype of Leo part 1 so it will have

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.170 
prototype of Leo part 1 so it will have
pretty<00:02:36.370> similar<00:02:36.940> characteristics<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:38.020> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
pretty similar characteristics to the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.540 
pretty similar characteristics to the
characteristics<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.330> Vallejo<00:02:40.630> part<00:02:40.900> 1<00:02:41.550> it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
characteristics of Vallejo part 1 it

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.690 
characteristics of Vallejo part 1 it
will<00:02:42.850> carry<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.300> hundred<00:02:43.870> five<00:02:44.170> no<00:02:44.560> gun<00:02:44.950> which

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
will carry a hundred five no gun which

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.990 
will carry a hundred five no gun which
is<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.570> same<00:02:46.780> as<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.530> gonna<00:02:48.160> fillet<00:02:48.640> o<00:02:48.670> part

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
is the same as the gonna fillet o part

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.360 
is the same as the gonna fillet o part
one<00:02:49.210> and<00:02:49.420> we'll<00:02:49.780> be<00:02:49.900> able<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.230> go<00:02:50.590> sixty<00:02:51.220> two

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
one and we'll be able to go sixty two

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.530 
one and we'll be able to go sixty two
kilometers<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.900> now<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.350> an<00:02:53.500> hour<00:02:54.150> its<00:02:55.150> engine

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
kilometers and now in an hour its engine

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.180 
kilometers and now in an hour its engine
will<00:02:56.350> be<00:02:56.770> 830<00:02:57.640> horsepower<00:02:58.600> strong<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.920> that's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
will be 830 horsepower strong so that's

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.450 
will be 830 horsepower strong so that's
quite<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.610> lot<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:03.810> yeah<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:05.260> tanks<00:03:05.680> probably

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
quite a lot and yeah this tanks probably

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.820 
quite a lot and yeah this tanks probably
not<00:03:06.760> going<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.030> be<00:03:07.090> all<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.630> much<00:03:08.230> different

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
not going to be all that much different

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.080 
not going to be all that much different
from<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.489> Leo<00:03:10.300> part<00:03:10.630> 1<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:12.520> can't<00:03:13.000> be

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
from the Leo part 1 so that can't be

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.699 
from the Leo part 1 so that can't be
pretty<00:03:13.360> good<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:13.900> those<00:03:14.020> of<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.320> who<00:03:14.470> want<00:03:14.620> to

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
pretty good for those of you who want to

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.740 
pretty good for those of you who want to
go<00:03:14.890> down<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.100> line<00:03:15.459> because<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.570> means

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
go down that line because that means

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.170 
go down that line because that means
they<00:03:17.050> won't<00:03:17.380> have<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.830> adapt<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.430> total<00:03:18.970> new

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
they won't have to adapt to total new

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.699 
they won't have to adapt to total new
private<00:03:19.870> park<00:03:20.670> after<00:03:21.670> they<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.410> come<00:03:23.410> from

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
private park after they and come from

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.690 
private park after they and come from
tier<00:03:23.950> 9<00:03:24.160> 22<00:03:24.640> attack<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:26.230> then<00:03:26.620> finally<00:03:27.220> at

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
tier 9 22 attack and then finally at

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.080 
tier 9 22 attack and then finally at
tier<00:03:27.970> 10<00:03:28.270> we've<00:03:28.630> got<00:03:28.930> for<00:03:29.170> Leo<00:03:29.350> part<00:03:29.739> 1<00:03:30.090> i've

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
tier 10 we've got for Leo part 1 i've

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.630 
tier 10 we've got for Leo part 1 i've
said<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.690> few<00:03:32.050> things<00:03:32.110> about<00:03:32.560> vallejo<00:03:33.040> pad<00:03:33.370> one

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
said a few things about vallejo pad one

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.240 
said a few things about vallejo pad one
already<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.360> my<00:03:34.510> previous<00:03:35.050> preview<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:36.010> patch

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
already in my previous preview of patch

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.830 
already in my previous preview of patch
8.5<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:37.989> course<00:03:38.260> I've<00:03:38.530> been<00:03:38.920> researching

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
8.5 but of course I've been researching

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.770 
8.5 but of course I've been researching
especially<00:03:40.840> on<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.320> tank<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.790> found<00:03:43.330> some

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
especially on this tank so I found some

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.229 
especially on this tank so I found some
new<00:03:44.080> information<00:03:44.500> especially<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.910> lot<00:03:46.180> of

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
new information especially a lot of

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.020 
new information especially a lot of
information<00:03:46.810> about<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.200> starts<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.890> lot<00:03:48.880> of

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
information about it starts a lot of

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.800 
information about it starts a lot of
that<00:03:49.209> information<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:51.209> posted<00:03:52.209> on<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.600> right

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
that information I posted on the right

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.680 
that information I posted on the right
side<00:03:53.200> of<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:54.489> screen<00:03:54.670> as<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.270> can<00:03:55.360> see

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
side of the screen as you can see

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.619 
side of the screen as you can see
but<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:58.379> isn't<00:03:58.650> all<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.280> there<00:04:00.030> are<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.269> lot

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
but that isn't all so there are a lot

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.650 
but that isn't all so there are a lot
more<00:04:00.660> starts<00:04:01.500> listed<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.700> description<00:04:02.819> so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
more starts listed in the description so

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.660 
more starts listed in the description so
make<00:04:04.140> sure<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.410> check<00:04:04.620> them<00:04:05.069> out<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.489> you're

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
make sure to check them out if you're

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.100 
make sure to check them out if you're
interested<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:07.610> yeah<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:09.060> tank<00:04:09.450> will<00:04:09.810> be

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
interested and yeah this tank will be

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.300 
interested and yeah this tank will be
very<00:04:10.769> maneuverable<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:11.879> will<00:04:12.209> be<00:04:12.420> very<00:04:12.450> fast

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
very maneuverable it will be very fast

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.280 
very maneuverable it will be very fast
but<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.519> will<00:04:14.819> be<00:04:14.849> likely<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.720> would<00:04:16.079> very

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
but it will be likely I would very

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.069 
but it will be likely I would very
likely<00:04:16.410> either<00:04:17.030> its<00:04:18.030> guns<00:04:18.419> going<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:18.989> be

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
likely either its guns going to be

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.990 
likely either its guns going to be
really<00:04:19.380> good<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.979> alpha<00:04:20.340> damage<00:04:20.489> won't<00:04:20.850> be

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
really good the alpha damage won't be

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.150 
really good the alpha damage won't be
that<00:04:21.180> good<00:04:21.389> but<00:04:21.900> for<00:04:22.169> penetration<00:04:22.710> will<00:04:23.010> be

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
that good but for penetration will be

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.790 
that good but for penetration will be
good<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:24.180> accuracy<00:04:24.630> will<00:04:25.229> be<00:04:25.350> really

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
good and the accuracy will be really

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.440 
good and the accuracy will be really
good<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.669> going<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.880> be<00:04:26.970> one<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.300> most

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
good it's going to be one of the most

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.170 
good it's going to be one of the most
accurate<00:04:27.780> guns<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.530> games<00:04:28.740> with<00:04:28.979> 0.3<00:04:29.940> no

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
accurate guns in the games with 0.3 no

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.310 
accurate guns in the games with 0.3 no
accuracy<00:04:31.080> that's<00:04:31.950> really<00:04:32.310> good<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.900> will

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
accuracy that's really good and it will

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.530 
accuracy that's really good and it will
be<00:04:34.590> very<00:04:34.770> accurate<00:04:35.040> on<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.550> move<00:04:35.729> as<00:04:36.000> well<00:04:36.180> so

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
be very accurate on the move as well so

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.719 
be very accurate on the move as well so
the<00:04:36.690> gun<00:04:36.870> stabilization<00:04:37.770> will<00:04:38.010> be<00:04:38.190> very<00:04:38.430> good

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
the gun stabilization will be very good

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.550 
the gun stabilization will be very good
and<00:04:39.229> this<00:04:40.229> so<00:04:40.650> that<00:04:40.830> will<00:04:41.010> make<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.370> time<00:04:41.639> to

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
and this so that will make this time to

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.650 
and this so that will make this time to
sniping<00:04:43.560> town<00:04:43.830> as<00:04:44.100> well<00:04:44.280> as<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.610> rolling<00:04:45.360> cock

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
sniping town as well as a rolling cock

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.530 
sniping town as well as a rolling cock
so<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.710> guess<00:04:47.490> gonna<00:04:47.760> take<00:04:48.030> quite<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.300> while<00:04:48.389> to

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
so I guess gonna take quite a while to

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.210 
so I guess gonna take quite a while to
figure<00:04:48.900> out<00:04:49.139> how<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.500> play<00:04:49.740> this<00:04:49.860> town

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
and on the test server I'm definitely

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.590 
and on the test server I'm definitely
gonna<00:05:00.960> do<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.410> review<00:05:01.950> on<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:02.310> tank<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:03.389> watch

a<00:05:12.750> Leo<00:05:13.680> pad<00:05:14.010> one<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:15.150> garage<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:18.840> thing

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
a Leo pad one in the garage I the thing

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.750 
a Leo pad one in the garage I the thing
that<00:05:19.200> disappoints<00:05:19.710> me<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.919> bit<00:05:20.070> about<00:05:20.190> this

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
that disappoints me a bit about this

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.990 
that disappoints me a bit about this
picture<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.479> that<00:05:21.720> Filet<00:05:22.200> O<00:05:22.229> part<00:05:22.620> 1<00:05:23.070> is<00:05:23.340> great

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
picture is that Filet O part 1 is great

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.990 
picture is that Filet O part 1 is great
on<00:05:24.419> it<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.930> if<00:05:25.740> you<00:05:25.889> look<00:05:26.070> like<00:05:26.220> real<00:05:26.430> pictures

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
on it and if you look like real pictures

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.750 
on it and if you look like real pictures
it's<00:05:27.360> never<00:05:27.870> grey<00:05:28.320> it's<00:05:28.590> always<00:05:28.830> green<00:05:29.100> so<00:05:29.729> I

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
it's never grey it's always green so I

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.240 
it's never grey it's always green so I
think<00:05:29.880> that's<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.389> bit<00:05:30.539> of<00:05:30.660> a<00:05:30.750> shame<00:05:30.990> but<00:05:31.289> I<00:05:31.590> mean

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
think that's a bit of a shame but I mean

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.879 
think that's a bit of a shame but I mean
it's<00:05:33.210> not<00:05:33.360> really<00:05:33.660> about<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.870> color<00:05:34.260> as<00:05:34.500> its

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
it's not really about the color as its

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.250 
it's not really about the color as its
adult<00:05:35.220> attack<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.450> tax<00:05:36.660> probably<00:05:37.110> going

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260
