00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.420
 Here I want to introduce a playlist about Business English 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.480
 namely by 20 videos produced by activists 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.860
 and someone in Danzig their shed farmer soon will UPC has filed 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.960
 I summarized these 20 videos here 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.119
 because they 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.630
 but very helpful we know that the english language is in 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.230
 Business or event conferences 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.690
 more often is chosen if defender does not represent the same 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.260
 speak language 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.730
 and then that's enough solver Faroe Islands all just 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.710
 to deal with English 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.470
 meanwhile one has still good previous knowledge from the school or 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.850
 Study time you can fall back on maybe you had that too 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.200
 Happiness that one 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.889
 a year abroad 

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:53.039
 had or just spent a semester abroad who completed the study 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.750
 but one wonders that is enough not to embarrass yourself 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.150
 this source is the poles listen to yourself 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.460
 he does not regret that for too long 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.750
 and then when one finds all the words all terms from everyday business 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.229
 are known then you can sit back and say well that's enough 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.800
 was probably out 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.729
 White 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.810
 if it is not so 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.360
 then there are quite a few of the learning offered and I have one here 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.040

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 one and the weather with the sound of a member Beckers 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.740

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.660
 you can then under 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.880
 Problems communicate with others and then do not draw 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.370
 because of the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.480
 Prechtl pronunciation like the sea often these days 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.320
 happens 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.479
 These videos are about doing business in the business like you do in everyday business 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.040

 the fifteenth hers 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199

 This is pushing for the big shoes 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.989
 now the process was developed to catch up 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.989
 Memory becomes more restrained therefore 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.949
 could do this 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.289
 this short excerpt should be enough to give an impression 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.059
