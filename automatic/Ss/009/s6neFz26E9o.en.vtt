want to pay attention to we found that

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.260 
want to pay attention to we found that
the<00:01:57.079> factory<00:01:57.439> systems<00:01:57.860> can<00:01:58.039> vary<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.880> little

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
the factory systems can vary a little

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.240 
the factory systems can vary a little
bit<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.720> height<00:01:59.899> of<00:02:00.020> these<00:02:00.140> pipes<00:02:00.500> from

the left side to the right side with the
new<00:02:03.679> flowmaster<00:02:04.220> system<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:04.670> important

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
new flowmaster system it's important

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.330 
new flowmaster system it's important
that<00:02:05.090> they<00:02:05.270> be<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.539> same<00:02:05.720> height<00:02:06.099> so<00:02:07.099> you<00:02:07.189> may

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
that they be the same height so you may

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.589 
that they be the same height so you may
have<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:07.640> do<00:02:08.019> these<00:02:09.019> little<00:02:09.380> muscle<00:02:09.709> there<00:02:10.599> the

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
have to do these little muscle there the

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.559 
have to do these little muscle there the
bending<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.670> adjust<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> height<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.060> get<00:02:14.209> in

another way to keep in mind actually
before<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.710> tighten<00:02:50.010> these<00:02:50.190> clamps<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:51.180> pay

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
before you tighten these clamps is pay

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.350 
before you tighten these clamps is pay
attention<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.130> crossmember<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:54.180> runs

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
attention to the crossmember the runs

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.760 
attention to the crossmember the runs
beneath<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.720> exhaust<00:02:55.020> system<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.440> forward

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
beneath the exhaust system up forward

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.770 
beneath the exhaust system up forward
make<00:02:56.760> sure<00:02:56.910> there's<00:02:57.120> adequate<00:02:57.360> clearance

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
make sure there's adequate clearance

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.830 
make sure there's adequate clearance
there<00:02:58.190> helps<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.370> expand<00:02:59.760> support<00:03:00.570> the

there helps to have expand support the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.830 
there helps to have expand support the
system<00:03:01.550> put<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> little<00:03:02.730> tension<00:03:02.850> on<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.180> before

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
system put a little tension on it before

system put a little tension on it before
you<00:03:04.020> tighten<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:05.100> go<00:03:05.220> ahead<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.400> slide<00:03:05.640> it

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
you tighten up so go ahead and slide it

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.880 
you tighten up so go ahead and slide it
up<00:03:05.990> onto<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.080> back<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.320> it

muffler outlet pipes get them on all the
way<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:14.100> bit<00:03:14.280> clamp<00:03:14.580> on<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.930> they<00:03:16.020> can<00:03:16.200> be

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
way it's a bit clamp on so they can be

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.020 
way it's a bit clamp on so they can be
