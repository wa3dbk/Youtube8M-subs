00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 minimum 50 person you asked me 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.450
 dragon but common weights of the dragon clips 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.620
 but what do you think of the crif aragon but what 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.630
 do you think of the clips 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 my answer is very simple 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.160
 yet another incorrect archetype 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.160
 in short, there is little to say about cliff I think 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.750
 be one of the most wrong decks that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.480
 have never come out in recent months 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.210
 because we say owns for the moment 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.570
 almost everything and more in the future have 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.450
 also announced new media 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.460
 these summed up yes yes I know it is already there 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.390
 people who say hey dragon but I fight 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.149
 clip oct 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.390
 so-so while i think of other i 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.460
 balls because if cliff starts well if 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.550
 you are able to beat the killer 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.610
 then you are really good but this 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.789
 I don't want video 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.620
 I could say turn to analyze clift 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.090
 I honestly don't care 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.660
 absolutely a fuck because I think that 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.090
 let it be a boulder that tells me nothing 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.100
 because anyway a bunch like that doesn't 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.060
 he says nothing and only tells me boulder 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 just incorrect and what to say 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.250
 I tell you already what number I will mount as 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.770
 I do with everyone but city 1 I tend 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.900
 always mount me 22 because I like them 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.720
 more sincerely because I think of the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.270
 fun I don't think about winning while 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.850
 here many people think about winning 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.060
 rather than fun and I'll tell you 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.619
 a thing yu gi oh was born to have fun 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.540
 he was not born to win 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.880
 the victory was introduced later 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.799
 when they started playing tournaments 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.909
 regional national cs European and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.799
 nice company 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.380
 but I was born to have fun is not 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.200
 born to win later they did it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.180
 become the classic petu game in a 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.969
 game in which those who pay to make themselves 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.979
 most powerful deck wins is not always 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.659
 so but in 90 percent of the cases it is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.880
 today, however, he wants to end up 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.790
 another type of speech or the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.619
 inconsistent people because now I go to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.899
 talk about inconsistent people 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.060
 naming kylie forth very simple 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.520
 because there have been people and they are 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.590
 still people who have had the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.260
 dare to say that clifford is one 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.290
 shit they had the courage they were 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.050
 shameless saying the clip is a boulder of the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.440
 hell I will never vote but fuck you 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.099
 of that fucker over there and then barely 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.739
 who could be fit the consistency of 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.230
 these people is zero 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.450
 but the thing that bothers me most is the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.450
 asshole because these people 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.430
 they are fucking with us less 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.129
 say on youtube to make audience for 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.489
 making views to the forum makes me 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:57.060
 It sucks that funds Crifo here to there and then 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.980
 when it comes out of the cliff to win everyone though 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.569
 they mount it but sorry but where is the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.659
 your dignity 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.700
 no no because if you tell me a week 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:09.330
 first to those who suck and a week 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.980
 afterwards tell those who perhaps wonder here 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.480
 inside there is something that does not work for 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.739
 the right way 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.690
 and here and here I address many people 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.720
 many people from the Italian community e 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.610
 so many people from other communities too 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.500
 however I don't name anyone 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.230
 because you can rest assured that 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.349
 in a few days there will be a new one 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.659
 youtube that will put on one of the profiling 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.810
 the clips just to make thousands of 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.730
 visual and do not think maybe he did and 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.739
 consistency do not think about the content 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.690
 of their own video that they are 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.120
 making an electro file of a boulder that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.569
 they know very well that it will ruin in 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.280
 meta because cliff is doing top e 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.959
 clip gentlemen is doing top 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.950
 I'm not sure if you are black discount 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:02.420
 but clift st will make top so it will be a 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.099
 boulder is therefore and will be a powerful madman 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.470
 not like some people who called it 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.049
 to a beatable the balls is 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.620
 beatable yes but it is a powerful boulder 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.120
 it seems reincarnation 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.229
 in another aspect of the element 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.060
 attention dragons and people 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:23.360
 inconsistent as with the dragons element 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.979
 first all behind to say to and it is not that 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.090
 with hazy fo sucks sucks 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:32.120
 then in order to win the all is fine 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.860
 puts 3 with the cock but it takes a nice one 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.810
 consistency and above all we need one 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.900
 beautiful fortitude because sincerely 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.540
 when I go to say with the with 1,000 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.240
 2,000 and 3,000 people to whom I suck 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.940
 and after and after an estimate we have cliff 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.400
 it takes a nice coherence e 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.300
 above all, we need a force 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.760
 so much courage 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.699
 I have it I admit these people 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.760
 they had courage for me to be 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.979
 in them I would be ashamed as I was in 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.500
 they would be ashamed as a thief because 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:10.190
 it takes courage to say one 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.360
 week before a cliff comes to me 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.280
 only the way to think about nausea and 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.979
 week after the row mountains to go 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.349
 to regional and national premises and to 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.690
 then win and then try to win 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.280
 because who is contending with 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.820
 jade all 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.710
 and how the fuck is he called and bari gabs though 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.030
 I think those who haze them on to 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.639
 all for the moment if he starts well and if 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.320
 killer drops you 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.630
 the history of history and it becomes a lot 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.120
 it lasts only to talk about him 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:52.280
 supports very well skilled ray ed 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.039
 efficient excused me the term 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.919
 this ass face to tell the cas 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.050
 ski lift sucks but I do, however , mount it 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.360
 because I want to contribute to 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.080
 defeat of this game and therefore chance 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.560
 less a lot because so-so because I cheer 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.380
 I like it and to win to win it 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.690
 I have to mount and from here the speech I have 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.560
 wrong because I met him always will 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.870
 get out of worse 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.370
 he did it in the past and he is doing it 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.860
 It was a moment and I wouldn't do a 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.860
 future you can rest assured and until 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.490
 there will be people who will go anyway 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.040
 against will go against common sense 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.650
 saying no cas this is incorrect 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.670
 I'm not riding it, but here it is 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.800
 people who say no kat 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.070
 this is an incorrect act must be 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.890
 first mounted I have to note for 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.440
 first and that is where there is unfair that 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.690
 logic gets fucked because it 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.820
 you know very well that this step is a 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.580
 incorrect master that will lead to 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.000
 game to get worse 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.340
 to make matters worse and whistles are agent 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.880
 that this will be mounted incorrectly 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.470
 game will go more and more towards the bottom 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.810
 and you have not yet figured you 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.530
 now you the people who have assembled 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.390
 griffins don't yet understand to me a 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.570
 it still suits me if one says as 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.720
 however, built by roberto strong boulder 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:21.210
 But you have to tell from the first moment until fi 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.640
 at the last you can't say first with bass 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.890
 that sucks and then later we say that 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.610
 I changed my mind is no 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:32.820
 cassano 6 in front of 1,000 2,000 and 3,000 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.920
 people at a deputation cannot say 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.020
 a week before that sucks and one 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.250
 week after the row mountains 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.470
 honestly it seems to me a speech 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.910
 allows this to be made with little sense 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.340
 boys who are dragons are me 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.200
 left a beautiful like sign up 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.850
 below in the comments with think of it 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.090
 about the inconsistency of people 

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.080
 about clifton wrong mark but i am 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.640
 correct 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.500
 I hope that nobody will write to me that it is a 

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.440
 correct boulder because I sincerely 

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.650
 I would take enough fear and limit vi 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.650
 greeting
