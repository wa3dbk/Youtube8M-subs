the 14 inch DME and you can see that

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.740 
the 14 inch DME and you can see that
it's<00:01:42.680> of<00:01:42.890> course<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.490> lot<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:44.119> lot<00:01:44.479> thinner

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
it's of course a lot a lot thinner

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.890 
it's of course a lot a lot thinner
actually<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:45.850> but<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> ports<00:01:47.270> are<00:01:47.390> almost

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
actually and but the ports are almost
