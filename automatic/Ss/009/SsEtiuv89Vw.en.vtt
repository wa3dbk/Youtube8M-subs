00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and it looks like this because it hasn't

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.060 
and it looks like this because it hasn't
been<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.660> ponytail<00:00:28.019> for<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.740> long<00:00:29.039> time

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
sure it's on the lowest heat possible
and<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.329> you're<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.780> separate<00:00:37.110> her

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and then you're going to separate her

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.080 
and then you're going to separate her

section just brush it and then take a
small<00:00:47.219> piece<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.210> want<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
small piece and you just want to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
small piece and you just want to
straighten<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> few<00:00:49.860> seconds<00:00:50.309> because

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
straighten it for a few seconds because

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.410 
straighten it for a few seconds because
you<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.090> want<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.570> her<00:00:51.750> hair<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:53.210> want<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you don't want to in her hair I want to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.569 
you don't want to in her hair I want to
straighten<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.140> part<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.800> Cindy's<00:00:56.280> hair

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
straighten this part of Cindy's hair

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.819 
straighten this part of Cindy's hair
because<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.329> hair<00:00:57.480> time<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.870> made<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.620> bit

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
because the hair time you made it a bit

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.560 
because the hair time you made it a bit
wavy<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.699> you're<00:00:59.879> having<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.359> same

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
wavy so if you're having the same

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
wavy so if you're having the same
problem<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.440> should<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.770> focus<00:01:02.010> on

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
problem and you should just focus on

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.340 
problem and you should just focus on
straightening<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.090> part<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> forget<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
straightening this part and forget the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.870 
straightening this part and forget the
rest<00:01:04.530> because<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.489> don't<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
rest because you really don't want to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:17.510 
rest because you really don't want to
run<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.210> doll's<00:01:06.450> hair<00:01:15.650> this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> part

of<00:01:17.700> her<00:01:17.880> hair<00:01:18.090> looks<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:20.689> don't

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
of her hair looks like right now I don't

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
of her hair looks like right now I don't
know<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.320> tell<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
know if you can tell this or not but it

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.340 
know if you can tell this or not but it
looks<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.880> much<00:01:24.060> better<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.140> want

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
looks so much better now you just want

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.020 
looks so much better now you just want
to<00:01:25.470> take<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> clip<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.369> her<00:01:26.490> hair<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
to take the clip out of her hair and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
to take the clip out of her hair and
just<00:01:27.659> keep<00:01:27.900> sectioning<00:01:28.560> her<00:01:28.710> hair<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
just keep sectioning her hair and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.219 
just keep sectioning her hair and
straightening<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.990> basically

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
straightening it and that's basically

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
straightening it and that's basically
how<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:32.970> there's

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
how you do it I don't know if there's

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.990 
how you do it I don't know if there's
another<00:01:33.840> way<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:34.890> how<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
another way to do it that's how I do it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
another way to do it that's how I do it
and<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.630> looks<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.079> fine<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.829> sectioning

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and it looks just fine I'm sectioning

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
and it looks just fine I'm sectioning
her<00:01:38.549> hair<00:01:38.759> before<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.360> straightening<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
her hair before it's straightening it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
her hair before it's straightening it
makes<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.500> lot<00:01:40.710> easier<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.579> why<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.850> do

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
makes it a lot easier so that's why I do

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:14.119 
makes it a lot easier so that's why I do
that

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.040 

so<00:02:15.129> I'm<00:02:15.489> done<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:16.959> it

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
so I'm done now and this is what it

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.199 
so I'm done now and this is what it
looks<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.800> looks<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.430> much<00:02:21.459> better<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
looks like it looks so much better and

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.150 
looks like it looks so much better and
it<00:02:22.450> didn't<00:02:22.780> get<00:02:22.959> ruined<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.500> that's<00:02:23.890> great

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
it didn't get ruined so that's great

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.589 
it didn't get ruined so that's great
