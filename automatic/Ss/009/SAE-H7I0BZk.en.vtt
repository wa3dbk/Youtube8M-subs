00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.770 
very smart but yeah
this<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:37.050> found<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.140> really<00:02:38.440> nice

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
this is it I found a really nice

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.819 
this is it I found a really nice
aluminum<00:02:43.050> radiator<00:02:44.050> but<00:02:44.290> they're<00:02:44.530> way

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
aluminum radiator but they're way

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:59.410 
aluminum radiator but they're way
expensive

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.860 

a<00:02:59.530> little<00:03:00.530> motor

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.800 

Jason

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.280 

yeah

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
yeah

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.210 
yeah
I<00:03:16.379> like<00:03:17.010> it

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:34.500 

take<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.820> little<00:03:21.150> more<00:03:21.270> work

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.120 

sounds<00:03:35.110> alright<00:03:35.230> other<00:03:35.709> than<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> little

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
sounds alright other than that a little

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.910 
sounds alright other than that a little
loud<00:03:36.400> lifter<00:03:37.020> pretty<00:03:38.020> notorious<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:38.770> loud

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
loud lifter pretty notorious for loud

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.890 
loud lifter pretty notorious for loud
lifters<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.670> that's<00:03:40.030> easy<00:03:40.239> effects<00:03:40.660> I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
lifters and that's easy effects I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.390 
lifters and that's easy effects I
should've<00:03:41.319> did<00:03:41.440> when<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.680> had<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:41.950> valve<00:03:42.160> cover

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
should've did when I had the valve cover

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.350 
should've did when I had the valve cover
off<00:03:42.489> but<00:03:42.880> I<00:03:42.910> didn't<00:03:43.180> have<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.330> feeler<00:03:43.599> gauge

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
off but I didn't have a feeler gauge

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.880 
off but I didn't have a feeler gauge
it's<00:03:46.360> easier<00:03:46.660> being<00:03:47.170> had<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.470> valve<00:03:47.650> cover

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
it's easier being had the valve cover

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.920 
it's easier being had the valve cover
off<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.340> four<00:03:48.640> minutes<00:03:48.970> it's<00:03:49.510> not<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> big

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
off in like four minutes it's not a big

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:05.360 
off in like four minutes it's not a big
deal<00:03:55.110> takes<00:03:56.110> out<00:03:56.290> quite<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.560> bit<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.890> exhaust

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.680 

I'm<00:04:06.370> off<00:04:06.520> I<00:04:06.640> mentioned<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.060> have<00:04:07.210> my<00:04:07.390> dozen

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
I'm off I mentioned I have my dozen

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.350 
I'm off I mentioned I have my dozen
interior<00:04:08.220> are<00:04:09.220> doing<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.730> insert<00:04:10.000> we'll<00:04:10.180> put

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
interior are doing the insert we'll put

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.040 
interior are doing the insert we'll put
it<00:04:10.420> that<00:04:10.450> way<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:11.590> camo<00:04:11.920> pretty<00:04:12.700> easy<00:04:12.990> kind<00:04:13.990> of

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
it that way in camo pretty easy kind of

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.210 
it that way in camo pretty easy kind of
fun<00:04:14.260> makes<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.650> look<00:04:14.740> better

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
fun makes it look better

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.340 
fun makes it look better
I<00:04:15.250> got<00:04:15.910> seat<00:04:16.120> covers<00:04:16.480> I've<00:04:16.660> got<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.930> factory

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
I got seat covers I've got the factory

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.490 
I got seat covers I've got the factory
turbo<00:04:17.880> seats<00:04:18.880> which<00:04:19.090> are<00:04:19.209> really<00:04:19.390> sweet<00:04:19.780> and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
turbo seats which are really sweet and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.140 
turbo seats which are really sweet and
I'm<00:04:20.650> gonna<00:04:20.769> have<00:04:20.950> those<00:04:21.130> redone<00:04:21.549> too<00:04:21.760> but<00:04:22.000> like

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
I'm gonna have those redone too but like

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.320 
I'm gonna have those redone too but like
I<00:04:22.210> said<00:04:22.420> down<00:04:23.230> the<00:04:23.440> road<00:04:23.590> I'll<00:04:23.710> not<00:04:24.120> get<00:04:25.120> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
I said down the road I'll not get the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.840 
I said down the road I'll not get the
running<00:04:25.960> part<00:04:26.560> of<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.860> all<00:04:27.010> dialed<00:04:27.250> in<00:04:27.460> first

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
running part of it all dialed in first

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.970 
running part of it all dialed in first
you<00:04:28.120> know<00:04:30.690> just<00:04:31.690> put<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.840> simple<00:04:32.110> stereo<00:04:32.590> on<00:04:32.740> out

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
you know just put a simple stereo on out

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.940 
you know just put a simple stereo on out
I<00:04:33.010> just<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.430> them<00:04:33.550> for<00:04:33.700> some<00:04:33.880> USB<00:04:34.770> that's<00:04:35.770> all

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
I just like them for some USB that's all

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.659 
I just like them for some USB that's all
I<00:04:35.980> needed

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
I needed

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:46.469 
I needed
a<00:04:38.190> lot<00:04:39.190> easier<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.610> putting<00:04:39.850> discs<00:04:40.210> in<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.360> No

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.730 

the<00:04:47.349> gauge<00:04:47.620> -<00:04:48.150> it's<00:04:49.150> not<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:49.689> great<00:04:50.020> gauge<00:04:50.319> but

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
the gauge - it's not a great gauge but

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.510 
the gauge - it's not a great gauge but
it<00:04:51.009> does<00:04:51.189> the<00:04:51.370> trick

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.619 

probably<00:04:54.520> not<00:04:54.639> for<00:04:54.699> the<00:04:54.819> gauge<00:04:54.999> cluster<00:04:55.029> I'd

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
probably not for the gauge cluster I'd

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.700 
probably not for the gauge cluster I'd
like<00:04:55.779> to<00:04:55.900> do<00:04:56.020> an<00:04:56.139> exhaust<00:04:57.509> manifold<00:04:58.710> basically

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
like to do an exhaust manifold basically

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.850 
like to do an exhaust manifold basically
uh<00:04:59.740> they've<00:05:00.729> got<00:05:00.759> a

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.800 

a<00:05:03.949> gauge<00:05:04.430> for<00:05:04.669> that<00:05:04.849> sir<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.300> keep<00:05:05.539> an<00:05:05.689> eye<00:05:05.780> on

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
a gauge for that sir you keep an eye on

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.469 
a gauge for that sir you keep an eye on
how<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.189> exhaust<00:05:07.189> is<00:05:07.460> getting<00:05:07.729> it's<00:05:07.939> smoking

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
how the exhaust is getting it's smoking

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:22.260 
how the exhaust is getting it's smoking
hot

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:40.930 

pretty<00:05:22.840> fun<00:05:23.050> truck<00:05:23.350> though

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.090 

a<00:05:41.050> manifold

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.830 

I'm<00:05:46.580> going<00:05:46.730> to<00:05:46.790> build<00:05:47.000> a

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
I'm going to build a

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.800 
I'm going to build a
piece<00:05:49.350> of<00:05:49.380> aluminum<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.100> go<00:05:50.370> over<00:05:50.790> the<00:05:51.060> crafty

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
piece of aluminum to go over the crafty

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.470 
piece of aluminum to go over the crafty
look<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.250> manifold<00:05:53.250> there<00:05:53.460> I'll<00:05:53.940> act<00:05:54.270> as<00:05:54.420> a

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
look and manifold there I'll act as a

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.080 
look and manifold there I'll act as a
heat<00:05:54.780> shield<00:05:55.050> is<00:05:55.380> don't<00:05:56.220> hit<00:05:56.400> her<00:05:56.670> hand<00:05:56.820> and

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
heat shield is don't hit her hand and

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.159 
heat shield is don't hit her hand and
it'll<00:05:57.630> hide<00:05:57.870> it

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
it'll hide it

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.339 
it'll hide it
I<00:05:59.340> can't<00:06:00.340> find<00:06:00.460> a<00:06:00.580> header<00:06:00.729> for<00:06:00.999> this<00:06:01.090> thing

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
I can't find a header for this thing

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:07.670 
I can't find a header for this thing
look<00:06:02.349> and<00:06:02.620> look<00:06:04.050> doing<00:06:05.050> aluminum<00:06:06.150> radiator<00:06:07.150> -

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
look and look doing aluminum radiator -

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.300
