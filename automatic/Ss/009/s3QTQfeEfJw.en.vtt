00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.199
 Let's now move on to the steppe. 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.090
 explain how the story works is stable 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 and he has to stay with respect 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 closed mixer 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:35.730
 at the beginning and the disk the record has to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.110
 be right in the beginning of it to the track 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.320
 to withdraw 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 so let's just go that this movement is the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.590
 moment you have to do taking the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.410
 disc forward and back to back 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.500
 being that the mayor has to go and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:02.510
 back together like it was a pat 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:06.119
 nuno cruz feira together opens and closes together 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.909
 only it has a great detail so you 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 not come back together totally because 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.240
 come back together you have 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.250
 the burr of the revolution and the intention is not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.040
 to get back burr ever 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.840
 so you're going to play close 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.170
 much faster than the mirror and then 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.189
 will pull the vinyl back and played 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 closed the mayor and pulled of it threw 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.490
 closed with those made per show the disc is 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.689
 that when you make a move a 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.729
 A little faster you can not 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.729
 to realize but in practice it works 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.740
 this story will then practice the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.340
 stadium with a bit and remember that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.740
 always is to exercise be in case you train 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.750
 and not going out, continues to insist that a 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.259
 When will you wake up the next day? 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.259
 thing is happening 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:42.120
 the ideb
