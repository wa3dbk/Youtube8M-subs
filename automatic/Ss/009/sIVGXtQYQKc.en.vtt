in the pouch once again I'm going to

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.100 
in the pouch once again I'm going to
start<00:01:06.040> kind<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.400> with<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.700> center<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.630> work

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
start kind of with the center and work

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.030 
start kind of with the center and work
my<00:01:08.290> way<00:01:08.320> out<00:01:08.680> now<00:01:09.010> that<00:01:09.640> I've<00:01:09.730> got<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:09.940> started

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
my way out now that I've got it started

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.900 
my way out now that I've got it started
it's<00:01:12.040> kind<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.250> hard<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.460> get<00:01:12.550> these<00:01:12.700> little

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
it's kind of hard to get these little

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.240 
it's kind of hard to get these little
tie<00:01:13.150> wraps<00:01:13.420> up<00:01:13.660> underneath<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.290> big<00:01:14.470> one<00:01:14.620> but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
tie wraps up underneath the big one but

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.190 
tie wraps up underneath the big one but
at<00:01:15.400> these<00:01:15.520> junction<00:01:16.090> points<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.840> can<00:01:17.020> usually

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
at these junction points you can usually

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.220 
at these junction points you can usually
find<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.680> good<00:01:17.830> spot<00:01:21.960> sometimes<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.050> need<00:01:23.170> to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
find a good spot sometimes you need to

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.860 
find a good spot sometimes you need to
twist<00:01:23.620> this<00:01:23.830> wire<00:01:24.160> to<00:01:24.970> get<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.300> bulb<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.720> lay

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
twist this wire to get that bulb to lay

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.960 
twist this wire to get that bulb to lay
flat<00:01:26.230> and<00:01:26.560> that's<00:01:27.190> always<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.610> case<00:01:27.790> even

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
flat and that's always the case even

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.940 
flat and that's always the case even
when<00:01:28.210> you're<00:01:28.330> putting<00:01:28.540> bulbs<00:01:28.840> on<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:28.990> house<00:01:29.200> you

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
when you're putting bulbs on a house you

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.590 
when you're putting bulbs on a house you
don't<00:01:29.980> want<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.340> pull<00:01:30.520> down<00:01:30.550> too<00:01:31.210> much<00:01:31.390> on

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
don't want to pull down too much on

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.660 
don't want to pull down too much on
these<00:01:31.780> because<00:01:32.140> then<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.440> pulls<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.250> anchors

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
these because then it pulls the anchors

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.350 
these because then it pulls the anchors
down<00:01:34.020> remember<00:01:35.020> they're<00:01:35.290> just<00:01:35.970> friction<00:01:36.970> tied

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
down remember they're just friction tied

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.390 
down remember they're just friction tied
up<00:01:37.510> against<00:01:37.840> here<00:01:38.020> they're<00:01:38.170> not<00:01:38.200> anchored<00:01:38.740> to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
up against here they're not anchored to

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.090 
up against here they're not anchored to
the<00:01:39.550> actual<00:01:39.850> column<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.750> see<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.710> can<00:01:41.860> you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
the actual column and see you can you

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.520 
the actual column and see you can you
can<00:01:42.250> slide<00:01:42.910> these<00:01:43.060> back<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.480> forth<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:44.350> get

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
can slide these back and forth to get

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.140 
can slide these back and forth to get
them<00:01:44.650> lined<00:01:45.130> up<00:01:45.310> how<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.550> need<00:01:45.790> them<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:46.030> be

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
them lined up how you need them to be

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.810 
them lined up how you need them to be
lined<00:01:46.360> up<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:48.100> see<00:01:48.250> right<00:01:48.430> now<00:01:48.490> this

is turning out real good these these top
five<00:01:51.940> white<00:01:52.300> bulbs<00:01:52.750> are<00:01:52.960> all<00:01:53.800> in<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:54.100> nice

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
five white bulbs are all in a nice

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.700 
five white bulbs are all in a nice
spiral<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:54.970> as<00:01:55.510> long<00:01:55.720> as<00:01:55.750> these<00:01:56.020> top<00:01:56.350> ones<00:01:56.590> are

spiral and as long as these top ones are

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
in a nice spiral all these others will

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.240 
in a nice spiral all these others will
line<00:01:58.420> up<00:01:58.570> perfectly<00:01:58.750> as<00:01:59.110> well<00:01:59.320> but<00:02:00.040> it's<00:02:00.190> just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
line up perfectly as well but it's just

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.800 
line up perfectly as well but it's just
a<00:02:00.460> matter<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.730> getting<00:02:01.000> them<00:02:01.270> spun<00:02:01.660> around

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
a matter of getting them spun around

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.450 
a matter of getting them spun around
properly<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:02.650> that<00:02:02.770> they're<00:02:02.920> all<00:02:03.010> laying<00:02:03.280> in

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
properly so that they're all laying in

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.220 
properly so that they're all laying in
the<00:02:03.550> same<00:02:03.730> direction<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.660> I'm<00:02:04.780> just<00:02:04.960> working

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
the same direction so I'm just working

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.200 
the same direction so I'm just working
my<00:02:05.260> way<00:02:05.380> down<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.700> know<00:02:06.820> once<00:02:07.060> you're<00:02:07.180> on

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
my way down and you know once you're on

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.969 
my way down and you know once you're on
the<00:02:07.450> ground<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.900> looking<00:02:08.140> up<00:02:08.289> it's<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.830> good

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
the ground and looking up it's a good

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.349 
the ground and looking up it's a good
opportunity<00:02:09.249> for<00:02:09.579> you<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.849> sort<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.090> wiggle

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.359 
opportunity for you to sort of wiggle

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:11.699 
opportunity for you to sort of wiggle
these<00:02:10.479> back<00:02:10.689> and<00:02:10.869> forth<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.290> make<00:02:11.349> sure<00:02:11.560> that

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
these back and forth and make sure that

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.489 
these back and forth and make sure that
they're<00:02:11.890> all<00:02:12.249> in<00:02:12.519> a<00:02:12.609> line<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.079> long<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.290> the

they're all in a line and as long as the

will also be more or less in a line you
can<00:02:18.459> also<00:02:18.580> see<00:02:18.910> them<00:02:19.060> pretty<00:02:19.330> much<00:02:19.420> going<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:20.620> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
can also see them pretty much going a a

anchor tie wrap between each color

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.550 
anchor tie wrap between each color
because<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:25.870> what's<00:02:26.080> going<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.290> give<00:02:26.440> me

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
because that's what's going to give me

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.270 
because that's what's going to give me
my<00:02:26.709> most<00:02:26.920> consistent<00:02:28.590> look<00:02:29.590> as<00:02:29.920> far<00:02:30.190> as

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
my most consistent look as far as

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.190 
my most consistent look as far as
keeping<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.700> even<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.810> know<00:02:31.900> straight<00:02:32.170> up

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
keeping it even and you know straight up

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.930 
keeping it even and you know straight up
and<00:02:32.440> down<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.010> spiral<00:02:33.459> keeping<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
and down and the spiral keeping the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.120 
and down and the spiral keeping the
spiral<00:02:34.330> going<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.780> also<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.650> makes<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:35.860> easier

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
spiral going and also it makes it easier

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.339 
spiral going and also it makes it easier
to<00:02:36.250> keep<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.519> bulbs<00:02:36.819> laying<00:02:37.239> over<00:02:37.510> when<00:02:38.230> you

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
to keep the bulbs laying over when you

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.990 
to keep the bulbs laying over when you
have<00:02:38.380> an<00:02:38.620> anchor<00:02:38.890> point<00:02:38.920> directly<00:02:39.610> above<00:02:39.849> and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
have an anchor point directly above and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.870 
have an anchor point directly above and
directly<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.390> blow<00:02:40.840> each<00:02:41.140> socket<00:02:41.730> because<00:02:42.730> then

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
directly a blow each socket because then

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.479 
directly a blow each socket because then
you<00:02:42.970> can<00:02:43.120> twist<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.510> wire<00:02:43.720> as<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.860> need<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.280> in

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
you can twist the wire as you need to in

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.250 
you can twist the wire as you need to in
order<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.790> make<00:02:46.000> sure<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.269> bulb<00:02:46.660> lays<00:02:46.930> flat

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
order to make sure that bulb lays flat

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.920 
order to make sure that bulb lays flat
and<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:48.040> want<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> bulbs<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:49.269> be<00:02:49.390> laying<00:02:49.599> flat

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
and you want the bulbs to be laying flat

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.039 
and you want the bulbs to be laying flat
so<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.950> nice<00:02:51.099> clean<00:02:52.049> professional

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
so that it's a nice clean professional

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.080 
so that it's a nice clean professional
look<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:53.920> it's<00:02:54.069> also<00:02:54.190> very<00:02:54.340> helpful<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:55.000> make

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
look so it's also very helpful to make

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.910 
look so it's also very helpful to make
sure<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.450> these<00:02:55.780> junctions<00:02:56.260> as<00:02:56.500> much<00:02:56.680> as<00:02:56.829> you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
sure that these junctions as much as you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.830 
sure that these junctions as much as you
can<00:02:57.160> make<00:02:57.370> them<00:02:57.489> wind<00:02:57.730> up<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.120> back<00:02:58.420> where

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
can make them wind up on the back where

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.170 
can make them wind up on the back where
you<00:02:58.959> don't<00:02:59.200> put<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.739> bulbs<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.610> bulb<00:03:00.849> strands

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
you don't put the bulbs the bulb strands

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.640 
you don't put the bulbs the bulb strands
are<00:03:01.360> pretty<00:03:01.540> much<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.170> sites<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
are pretty much just on the sites in the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.550 
are pretty much just on the sites in the
front<00:03:02.920> at<00:03:03.849> least<00:03:04.120> in<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.360> way<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.750> do<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:05.110> you

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
front at least in the way I do it you

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.110 
front at least in the way I do it you
can<00:03:05.739> make<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.190> where<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.519> bulb<00:03:06.700> strands

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
can make it to where the bulb strands

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.270 
can make it to where the bulb strands
wrap<00:03:07.480> all<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> way<00:03:07.810> around<00:03:07.900> evenly<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:09.099> it's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
wrap all the way around evenly but it's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.930 
wrap all the way around evenly but it's
a<00:03:09.340> much<00:03:09.519> more<00:03:10.590> complicated<00:03:11.590> way<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.519> do<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.849> you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
a much more complicated way to do it you

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.160 
a much more complicated way to do it you
have<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.150> be<00:03:13.239> very<00:03:13.360> precise<00:03:13.780> because<00:03:13.959> they

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
have to be very precise because they

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.759 
have to be very precise because they
have<00:03:14.349> to<00:03:14.500> meet<00:03:14.739> up<00:03:14.920> 360<00:03:15.910> degrees<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.620> do

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
have to meet up 360 degrees what I do

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.590 
have to meet up 360 degrees what I do

just make sure that from the street view
it<00:03:22.269> looks<00:03:22.600> as<00:03:22.840> though<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.859> bulbs<00:03:24.160> wrap<00:03:24.310> all

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
it looks as though the bulbs wrap all

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.920 
it looks as though the bulbs wrap all
the<00:03:24.609> way<00:03:24.639> around<00:03:25.030> even<00:03:25.209> though<00:03:25.540> they<00:03:25.690> really

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the way around even though they really

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.930 
the way around even though they really
don't<00:03:26.109> they<00:03:26.319> really<00:03:26.500> wrap<00:03:26.769> about<00:03:27.040> 3/4<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.790> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
don't they really wrap about 3/4 of the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.729 
don't they really wrap about 3/4 of the
way<00:03:28.090> around<00:03:28.209> with<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.109> back<00:03:29.290> being<00:03:29.980> blank

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
way around with the back being blank

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.039 
way around with the back being blank
once<00:03:32.739> again<00:03:33.010> though<00:03:33.220> these<00:03:33.750> junctions<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:34.959> the

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
once again though these junctions of the

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.599 
once again though these junctions of the
tie<00:03:35.230> wrap<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.680> try<00:03:35.829> to<00:03:35.889> make<00:03:36.069> sure<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.340> where

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
tie wrap I try to make sure that where

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.090 
tie wrap I try to make sure that where
they<00:03:36.700> don't<00:03:36.910> land<00:03:37.090> right<00:03:37.450> where<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.630> cable<00:03:38.109> goes

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
they don't land right where a cable goes

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.710 
they don't land right where a cable goes
because<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:39.880> know<00:03:40.000> you've<00:03:40.150> got<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.269> tie<00:03:40.510> wrap

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
because you know you've got a tie wrap

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.080 
because you know you've got a tie wrap
this<00:03:40.900> cable<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:41.530> anchor<00:03:42.519> tie<00:03:42.700> wrap<00:03:42.880> and

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
this cable to this anchor tie wrap and

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.729 
this cable to this anchor tie wrap and
that<00:03:43.120> just<00:03:43.420> get<00:03:43.569> in<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.690> way<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.440> try<00:03:44.680> to

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
that just get in the way so you try to

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.710 
that just get in the way so you try to
make<00:03:44.889> sure<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.220> these<00:03:45.819> junctions<00:03:46.269> here<00:03:46.359> fall

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
make sure that these junctions here fall

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.170 
make sure that these junctions here fall
in<00:03:46.959> between<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.920> strands<00:03:48.310> somewhere<00:03:49.060> in

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
in between the strands somewhere in

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.539 
in between the strands somewhere in
between<00:03:49.299> there<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.500> we<00:03:50.769> are<00:03:50.920> now<00:03:51.100> done<00:03:51.160> we

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
between there and so we are now done we

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.039 
between there and so we are now done we
just<00:03:51.579> basically<00:03:52.120> did<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.480> same<00:03:52.720> thing<00:03:52.930> when

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
just basically did the same thing when

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.720 
just basically did the same thing when
it<00:03:53.139> up<00:03:53.260> there<00:03:53.410> we<00:03:53.859> just<00:03:54.069> kept<00:03:54.250> doing<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.639> all

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
it up there we just kept doing it all

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.150 
it up there we just kept doing it all
the<00:03:54.850> way<00:03:54.970> down<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:56.410> think<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.920> kind<00:03:57.100> of

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
the way down and I think you can kind of

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.490 
the way down and I think you can kind of
see<00:03:57.340> here<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.700> red<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.720> white<00:03:58.750> how

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
see here the red and the white how

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.259 
see here the red and the white how
they're<00:03:59.680> laying<00:03:59.829> out<00:04:00.099> I<00:04:00.370> actually<00:04:00.819> end<00:04:01.150> up

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
they're laying out I actually end up

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.910 
they're laying out I actually end up
with<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> lot<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:01.900> sort<00:04:02.109> of<00:04:02.260> extra<00:04:02.709> stuff

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
with a lot of this sort of extra stuff

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.520 
with a lot of this sort of extra stuff
here<00:04:03.599> you<00:04:04.599> know<00:04:04.720> one<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:04.959> these<00:04:05.109> days<00:04:05.349> I'll

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
here you know one of these days I'll

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.020 
here you know one of these days I'll
probably<00:04:05.829> trim<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.160> back<00:04:06.190> but<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:06.549> just<00:04:06.760> like<00:04:06.880> to

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
probably trim it back but I just like to

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.360 
probably trim it back but I just like to
make<00:04:07.180> sure<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.329> have<00:04:07.569> plenty<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.930> extra<00:04:08.109> in<00:04:09.069> case

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
make sure I have plenty of extra in case

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.030 
make sure I have plenty of extra in case
the<00:04:09.970> second<00:04:10.359> time<00:04:10.540> around<00:04:10.569> like<00:04:11.560> maybe<00:04:11.769> next

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
the second time around like maybe next

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.949 
the second time around like maybe next
year<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.400> might<00:04:12.700> start<00:04:13.090> at<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.329> different<00:04:13.660> point

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
year I might start at a different point

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.000 
year I might start at a different point
up<00:04:14.380> high<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:16.150> might<00:04:16.479> end<00:04:16.630> up<00:04:16.750> feeling<00:04:17.739> like

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
up high and I might end up feeling like

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.440 
up high and I might end up feeling like
I<00:04:18.099> wish<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.370> had<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.609> little<00:04:18.789> bit<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.060> extra<00:04:19.269> to

I wish I had a little bit of extra to

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.599 
I wish I had a little bit of extra to
put<00:04:19.479> another<00:04:19.840> bulb<00:04:20.139> on<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.349> end<00:04:20.620> or<00:04:20.889> something

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609
