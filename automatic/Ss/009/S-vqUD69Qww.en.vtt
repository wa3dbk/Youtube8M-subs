00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.100
 hello today I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.670
 some coffee cupcakes 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:16.220
 orange what they will need is going to be 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.220
 a bowl to mix the ingredients 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:27.300
 here we are going to put four large eggs 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.300
 and a good size like the one I have here 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.920
 and since we have the eggs we are going to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.920
 put orange juice 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.720
 like the one I have here 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.950
 and we are going to put 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.489
 two tablespoons of butter 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.800
 one 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.549
 two 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.549
 ok now let's put 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.500
 two and a half glasses of milk 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.500
 you want to see 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130
 two 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.220
 half glass and that's it 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.400
 and apart we're going to throw half a glass 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.400
 of 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.710
 vanilla extract 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.590
 and we created our vanilla extract 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.900
 and now let's mix the ingredients 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.970
 Now let's do what are the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.370
 solids to lay a bowl more or less 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.230
 a little bit bigger than the other one because 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.050
 they are more ingredients and today we are going to 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.120
 pour the liquids let's put four 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.120
 cups of flour 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.110
 one 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.799
 two 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.260
 3 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.510
 and finally 4 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:35.310
 and we add our four cups of 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.230
 flour now let's add two 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.230
 teaspoons of salt 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.140
 they can also add clues and if not 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.140
 They have clean spoons 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.270
 seen in our tracks now we're going to 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.270
 add a cup of coffee 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.250
 like the one I have and what 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.310
 and then we are going to add a 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.310
 cup of sugar 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.650
 a small house 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:30.270
 if you want, you can add more 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.270
 this salt I'm going to take a little 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.970
 next we are going to add 2 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.970
 Spoons of baking powder 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.500
 n 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:55.780
 well now let's integrate all these 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.780
 solids with our little stick 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.590
 and it's almost gone 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.669
 well now let's integrate the 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:21.270
 liquids with solids and for that 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:24.080
 We are going to pour the liquid mixture to 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.080
 the solids 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.159
 and now we will mix all these 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.159
 ingredients 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:05.130
 good since I came in 3 integrate all 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.650
 the ingredients we are going to put them in the 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:12.290
 chapters packaging 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.290
 Well, I already went ahead and I already explained it 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:19.260
 well you already have the mixture and 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.430
 I recommend you not fill both 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.110
 because they can cause them a 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.000
 hiccups 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:33.210
 well let's put them in the oven to 360 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.509
 degrees for 20 minutes 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:40.190
 for the decoration they will need bitumen 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:45.319
 I'm going to use vanilla and chocolate 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.319
 I made two for my friend Jane until here 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:52.929
 and how to decorate your 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:59.330
 there are 5 or bÃ©thune they are going to put in a 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:04.750
 bag and they're going to cut a cock and 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.750
 now let's put a little bit 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.830
 what you want and now we go with 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.830
 the next 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:23.389
 good now james let's try I chose 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.389
 one 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.830
 I'm going to try them first 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:48.689
 good as with the see here is the 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.349
 result and they are very rich 

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:51.349
 for her 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:10.990
