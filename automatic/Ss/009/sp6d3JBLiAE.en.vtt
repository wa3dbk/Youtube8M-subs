00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:04.164
[Mitt Romney] As you might imagine, I disagree with the Supreme Court's decision

00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:06.279
and I agree with the dissent.

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:10.646
What the court did not do at its last day in session,

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:15.462
I will do on my first day if elected President of the United States:

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:19.764
and that is, I will act to repeal Obamacare.

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:23.644
Let's make clear that we understand what the Court did and did not do.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.213
What the Court did today was say that Obamacare does not violate the Constitution.

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:35.441
What they did not do was say that Obamacare is good law or that it's good policy.

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:40.213
Obamacare was bad policy yesterday, it's bad policy today.

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:45.029
Obamacare was bad law yesterday, it's bad law today.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.221
Let me tell you why I say that.

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:54.694
Obamacare raises taxes on the American people by approximately 500 billion dollars.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:02.394
Obamacare cuts Medicare, cuts Medicare, by approximately 500 billion dollars.

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:05.461
And even with those cuts, and tax increases,

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:10.161
Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:13.945
and pushes those obligations on the coming generations.

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:18.250
Obamacare also means that for up to 20 million Americans,

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:20.253
they will lose the insurance they currently have,

00:01:20.253 --> 00:01:23.694
the insurance that they like and they want to keep.

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:27.128
Obamacare is a job-killer.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:31.697
Businesses across the country have been asked what the impact is of Obamacare.

00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:34.712
Three quarters of those surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:38.838
said Obamacare makes it less likely for them to hire people.

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:41.345
And perhaps most troubling of all,

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:45.914
Obamacare puts the Federal Government between you and your doctor.

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:51.343
For all those reasons, it's important for us to repeal and replace Obamacare.

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:54.097
What are some of the things that we'll keep in place

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:57.945
and must be in place in a reform, a real reform of the health care system?

00:01:57.945 --> 00:02:02.743
One: we have to make sure that people who want to keep their current insurance

00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:04.028
will be able to do so.

00:02:04.074 --> 00:02:08.989
Having 20 million people, up to that number of people, lose the insurance they want

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.889
is simply unacceptable.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.297
Number Two: got to make sure that those people who have pre-existing conditions

00:02:15.297 --> 00:02:19.504
know that they will be able to be insured and they will not lose their insurance.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.663
We also have to assure that we do our very best to help each State

00:02:23.663 --> 00:02:28.885
in their effort to assure that every Amarican has access to affordable health care.

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:32.961
And something that Obamacare does not do, that must be done in real reform

00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:37.512
is helping lower the cost of health care and health insurance.

00:02:37.512 --> 00:02:41.530
It's becoming prohibitively expensive.

00:02:42.914 --> 00:02:46.430
And so, this is now a time for the American people to make a choice.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:51.599
You can choose whether you want to have a larger and larger government,

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.961
more intrusive in your lives, separating you and your doctor,

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:58.276
whether you are comfortable with more deficits, higher debt

00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:00.237
that we pass on to coming generations,

00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:02.958
whether you are willing to have the government put in place a plan

00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.269
that potentially causes you to lose the insurance that you like,

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.994
or whether instead you want to return to a time

00:03:08.994 --> 00:03:11.795
when the American people will have their own choice in health care,

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:16.005
where consumers will be able to make their choices as to what kind of health care they want.

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:18.529
This is a time of choice for the American people.

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.229
Our mission is clear.

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:24.829
If we want to get rid of Obamacare, we're gonna have to replace President Obama.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.594
My mission is to make sure we do exactly that,

00:03:27.594 --> 00:03:31.109
that we return to the American people the privilege they've always had

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.841
to live their lives in the way they feel most appropriate,

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:38.260
where we don't pass on to coming generations massive deficits and debt,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.122
where we don't have a setting where jobs are lost.

00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:45.991
If we want good jobs and a bright economic future for ourselves and for our kids,

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:48.446
we must replace Obamacare.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:53.224
That is my mission, that is our work, and I'm asking the people of America to join me.

00:03:53.224 --> 00:03:56.655
If you don't want the course that President Obama has put us on,

00:03:56.655 --> 00:04:00.841
if you want instead a course that the Founders envisioned, then join me in this effort.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:05.524
Help us. Help us defeat Obamacare, help us defeat the liberal agenda

00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:08.257
that makes government too big, too intrusive,

00:04:08.257 --> 00:04:10.803
and that's killing jobs across this great country.

00:04:10.803 --> 00:04:12.511
Thank you so much.
