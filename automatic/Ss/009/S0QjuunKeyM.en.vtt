00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:09.190
 he who is where he wants to come back and good 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.870
 Boyfriend and I came to Veracruz to spend 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.660
 father's day and when I got to my 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.360
 home I found that two had arrived 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.490
 publisher packages and one that comes 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.710
 from amazon I really do not have the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.570
 mentality that is the amazon because I 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.580
 I did not ask for anything then when I saw it 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.310
 I was very excited because I really do not 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.630
 I asked him then I do not know what or who 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.060
 he sent it or how do I get to my house 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.070
 so then let's start 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.300
 with this man zinc the first I go 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.700
 to open obviously is the amazon 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.899
 because it 's the one I'm most curious about 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.899
 know what it is 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.050
 slu single the calling in the second 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.370
 book the side or biology logy as 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.230
 tell me to fuck and I want to believe that I 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.450
 He sent the same person we see the eye 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.920
 because when it came to me with clézio 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.410
 I had not bought it but instead I 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.870
 gave away a person who watches the videos and 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.570
 I want to believe it 's the same today I'm going 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.340
 to see if a message and they are assembling the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.650
 person that I thought is vladimir 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.410
 rodríguez thank you very much vladimir for 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.729
 I really like hop but I do have a lot 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.440
 because if you know how it is the same 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.869
 youth book but from the point of 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.070
 view of the truth I thank you very much 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.170
 It thrills me a lot because you're 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.080
 helping me to fulfill my mind of reading 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.990
 several books of queens hubert this year 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.090
 next package comes from house painting 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.100
 they came to me I think they are two booklets 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.790
 and this one I have more or less idea of what 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.619
 is to do let's open it the first 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.200
 book that we can bring you signed 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.410
 is the cemetery book 2 that's the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.909
 graphic novel of new game I have not read 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.050
 the first but I have it in my house 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.630
 so 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.630
 the arms marathon I do not know how many are going to 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.940
 be but if the next book that you 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.120
 I have to show is the final choice 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.400
 of Jennifer or the third book in the 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.140
 trilogy of weavers of destiny of 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.670
 I'm really excited that I've 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.460
 arrived because I liked many 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.500
 followers of destinies the second book 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.390
 that between two worlds I think it's not me 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.640
 He convinced me a lot but he gave me many 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.620
 thanks to see how I was going to finish 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.570
 then many times there are improvements 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.280
 for having sent them the conclusion and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.110
 send me the second part of the book 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.850
 from the cemetery to finally I have a 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.610
 sending of Felix that if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.710
 comes from the great ocean publisher 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.200
 crossing just just finished 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.480
 the two books that send me and I'm very 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.420
 curious to know that other books have 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.790
 counted right now 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.890
 horde of aguirre I think this is the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.170
 third book of the trilogy is not 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.450
 I knew a trilogy but I hope that I 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.959
 have given the first two the tooth the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.270
 book that came out here is refuge from 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.880
 I'll say that I also think it's the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.330
 second because according to me the first one 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.200
 call enclave then we get along 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.760
 at least three times in the key of aguirre 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.440
 they have sent me the complete trilogy 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.450
 Thank you very much, making a great journey 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.150
 for having sent me the trilogy 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.200
 I really had time that called me the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.209
 attention read I have not heard things nor 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.959

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.850
 small reviews that have not been like 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.610
 who is super good or is super bad 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.950

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.260

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.840

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.910

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.290
