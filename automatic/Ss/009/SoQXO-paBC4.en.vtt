of<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.220> harbor<00:00:05.790> freight<00:00:06.120> blast<00:00:06.990> cabinet<00:00:07.500> when

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
of the harbor freight blast cabinet when

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.410 
of the harbor freight blast cabinet when
I<00:00:08.099> was<00:00:08.220> looking<00:00:08.370> at<00:00:08.519> buying<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.000> there<00:00:09.150> wasn't

I was looking at buying one there wasn't

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.820 
I was looking at buying one there wasn't
a<00:00:09.480> whole<00:00:09.599> lot<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.780> reviews<00:00:10.230> there<00:00:10.500> were<00:00:10.620> not<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
a whole lot of reviews there were not a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.820 
a whole lot of reviews there were not a
whole<00:00:10.980> lot<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.190> reviews<00:00:12.290> that<00:00:13.290> really<00:00:13.650> said

whole lot of reviews that really said

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.350 
whole lot of reviews that really said
anything<00:00:13.860> about<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.429> cabinet<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> thought

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
anything about the cabinet so I thought

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.859 
anything about the cabinet so I thought
once<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.900> got<00:00:16.049> mine<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:17.449> I'd<00:00:18.449> share<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> little

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
once I got mine going I'd share a little

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.359 
once I got mine going I'd share a little
bit<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.380> basically<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:22.320> cabinet<00:00:22.830> gets

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
bit about it basically this cabinet gets

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.740 
bit about it basically this cabinet gets
a<00:00:23.460> lot<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> good<00:00:23.820> reviews<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.330> gets<00:00:24.600> some

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
a lot of good reviews and gets some

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.300 
a lot of good reviews and gets some
fairly<00:00:25.410> bad<00:00:25.680> reviews

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
fairly bad reviews

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
fairly bad reviews
I<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.760> first<00:00:26.939> before<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.449> buy<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.779> need

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
I think first before you buy it you need

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.070 
I think first before you buy it you need
to<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.230> you're<00:00:28.380> buying<00:00:28.670> it<00:00:29.670> comes<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to know what you're buying it comes in a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.910 
to know what you're buying it comes in a
box<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.710> got<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.949> put<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.160> together<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.700> it

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
box you got to put it together and it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.870 
box you got to put it together and it
unfortunately<00:00:34.920> Harbor<00:00:35.160> Freight<00:00:35.309> does<00:00:35.610> have

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
unfortunately Harbor Freight does have

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.450 
unfortunately Harbor Freight does have
some<00:00:36.120> cheap<00:00:36.329> equipment<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.950> came<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:38.309> to

part<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:53.880> something<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.780> works<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.470> not

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
part or something it works but it's not

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.160 
part or something it works but it's not
that<00:01:55.770> great<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> swapped<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> then

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that great so I swapped to that and then

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.639 
that great so I swapped to that and then
if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.860> look<00:02:00.079> see<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.439> see<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
if you look see that you can see the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.289 
if you look see that you can see the
black<00:02:01.860> caulk<00:02:02.719> I'm<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> edges<00:02:04.350> there<00:02:05.299> what

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
black caulk I'm on the edges there what

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.369 
black caulk I'm on the edges there what
I<00:02:06.329> did<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.920> see<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:10.229> can

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
I did was you can see it there you can

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.050 
I did was you can see it there you can
see<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:10.739> over<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.370> did<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:11.910> see

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
see it all over what I did you can see

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.420 
see it all over what I did you can see
it<00:02:12.150> down<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.390> here

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
it down in here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.890 
it down in here
what<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.460> did<00:02:14.700> was<00:02:14.910> when<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> built<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.420> thing<00:02:15.660> I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
what I did was when I built this thing I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.680 
what I did was when I built this thing I
made<00:02:16.080> sure<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.440> anywhere<00:02:16.830> seems<00:02:17.690> overlapped

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
made sure that anywhere seems overlapped

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.880 
made sure that anywhere seems overlapped
I<00:02:19.730> put<00:02:20.730> some<00:02:20.880> caulk<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:22.620> black

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
I put some caulk on it just black

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.980 
I put some caulk on it just black
silicone<00:02:25.130> good-good<00:02:26.130> caulk<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:27.570> say<00:02:27.810> then

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
silicone good-good caulk and say then

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.010 
silicone good-good caulk and say then
wipe<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.380> off<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:28.920> um<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.570> covered

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
wipe it all off but um so I covered

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.480 
wipe it all off but um so I covered
every<00:02:31.950> seam<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:33.060> caulk<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.310> where

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
every seam with caulk and this is where

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.930 
every seam with caulk and this is where
the<00:02:35.670> old<00:02:35.850> light<00:02:36.600> panel<00:02:37.440> was<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:38.100> guess<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.790> could

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the old light panel was I guess I could

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.280 
the old light panel was I guess I could
have<00:02:39.030> put<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.300> here<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.750> wanted<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.110> up

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
have put this here but I wanted it up

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.800 
have put this here but I wanted it up
there<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.940> made<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> little<00:02:42.420> cover<00:02:42.600> and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
there so it made a little cover and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.150 
there so it made a little cover and
riveted<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.290> cocked<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:43.920> rivet<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:46.160> so

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
riveted and cocked it and rivet it in so

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.640 
riveted and cocked it and rivet it in so
I<00:02:47.190> did<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.910> then<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> final<00:02:49.200> final

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
I did that and then I the final final

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.020 
I did that and then I the final final
thing<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.920> I've<00:02:50.010> done<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.640> I'm<00:02:50.880> not

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
figure out I'd like to get a smaller

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.660 
figure out I'd like to get a smaller
shop<00:03:12.900> back<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.710> get<00:03:13.920> this<00:03:14.040> thing<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.550> that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
shop back and get this thing so that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.060 
shop back and get this thing so that
it's<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.910> little<00:03:15.030> more<00:03:15.270> compact<00:03:15.890> but<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:16.920> just

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
it's a little more compact but I just

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.240 
it's a little more compact but I just
took<00:03:17.190> what<00:03:17.370> hoses<00:03:17.700> I've<00:03:17.850> got<00:03:18.060> some<00:03:18.510> PVC<00:03:18.770> and<00:03:19.770> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
took what hoses I've got some PVC and I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.060 
took what hoses I've got some PVC and I
throw<00:03:20.430> together<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:21.000> quick<00:03:21.780> quick<00:03:22.560> setup<00:03:22.890> there

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.720 
throw together a quick quick setup there
so<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.430> what<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.210> so<00:03:24.420> far<00:03:24.710> I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
so that's what that is but so far I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.430

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
that I'm building actually I'm working

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.290 
that I'm building actually I'm working
on<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:53.100> already<00:03:53.250> built<00:03:53.490> I'm<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.850> modifying

sandblasting I don't know if it'd be
what<00:05:08.370> you're<00:05:08.520> looking<00:05:08.550> for<00:05:09.080> but<00:05:10.080> if<00:05:10.200> you're

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
what you're looking for but if you're

just<00:05:11.270> hobbyist<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:13.040> think<00:05:14.040> it'd<00:05:14.160> probably<00:05:14.280> be

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
just hobbyist I think it'd probably be

just hobbyist I think it'd probably be
perfect<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.570> has<00:05:15.810> been<00:05:16.080> for<00:05:16.320> me
