00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you know one of the the things with the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.140 
you know one of the the things with the
NXT<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.760> an

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
NXT is it's an

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.819 
NXT is it's an
main<00:02:34.239> D<00:02:34.390> inch<00:02:34.540> beam<00:02:34.810> which<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.379> today's

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
main D inch beam which in today's

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.920 
main D inch beam which in today's
inboard<00:02:36.640> world<00:02:36.879> seems<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.299> little<00:02:37.420> bit<00:02:37.659> narrow

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
inboard world seems a little bit narrow

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.960 
inboard world seems a little bit narrow
but<00:02:38.019> we<00:02:38.349> wanted<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.739> be<00:02:38.860> able<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.159> actually<00:02:39.730> put

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
but we wanted to be able to actually put

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.170 
but we wanted to be able to actually put
these<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.360> containers<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.049> ship<00:02:41.560> them<00:02:41.739> abroad

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
these in containers and ship them abroad

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.699 
these in containers and ship them abroad
so<00:02:43.180> when<00:02:43.360> we<00:02:43.480> did<00:02:43.689> that<00:02:43.720> we<00:02:43.900> narrowed<00:02:44.409> up<00:02:44.530> our

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
so when we did that we narrowed up our

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.339 
so when we did that we narrowed up our
gunnels<00:02:45.099> use<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.489> capped<00:02:46.140> technology<00:02:47.140> that

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
gunnels use the capped technology that

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.440 
gunnels use the capped technology that
actually<00:02:47.680> gives<00:02:48.010> us<00:02:48.129> more<00:02:48.370> strength<00:02:48.700> but<00:02:49.360> it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
actually gives us more strength but it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.899 
actually gives us more strength but it
gives<00:02:49.599> us<00:02:49.720> more<00:02:49.900> interior<00:02:50.170> space<00:02:50.349> so<00:02:50.859> vinyl<00:02:51.760> to

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
gives us more interior space so vinyl to

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.610 
gives us more interior space so vinyl to
vinyl<00:02:52.299> I've<00:02:52.420> got<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.750> same<00:02:52.930> interior<00:02:53.260> space

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
vinyl I've got the same interior space

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.399 
vinyl I've got the same interior space
as<00:02:53.829> a<00:02:53.859> hundred<00:02:54.220> inch<00:02:54.370> beam<00:02:54.609> boat<00:02:55.109> when<00:02:56.109> we<00:02:56.200> come

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
as a hundred inch beam boat when we come

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.589

the nice rotating board racks and we
wanted<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.799> tower<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.159> was<00:03:03.400> easily

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
wanted to have a tower that was easily

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.300 
wanted to have a tower that was easily
collapsible<00:03:04.629> because<00:03:05.019> we<00:03:05.200> know<00:03:05.409> our<00:03:05.439> consumer

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
collapsible because we know our consumer

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.059

at<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:07.090> price<00:03:07.690> point<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:08.139> likely<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.920> to

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
at this price point is likely going to

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.069 
at this price point is likely going to
put<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.670> garage<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.720> will<00:03:10.900> fit

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
put this in the garage so this will fit

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.559 
put this in the garage so this will fit
in<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.290> 7-foot<00:03:11.739> garage<00:03:12.010> on<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.609> trailer<00:03:13.030> the

in a 7-foot garage on the trailer the

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.660 
in a 7-foot garage on the trailer the
tower<00:03:13.780> folds<00:03:14.200> back<00:03:14.409> not<00:03:14.889> in<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.280> driver<00:03:15.549> seat

tower folds back not in the driver seat

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.240 
tower folds back not in the driver seat
it<00:03:16.359> makes<00:03:16.599> it<00:03:16.690> really<00:03:16.870> easy<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.379> get<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:18.010> and
