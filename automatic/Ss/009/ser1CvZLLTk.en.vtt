that got me thinking there have got to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
that got me thinking there have got to
be<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:08.159> cheaper<00:01:08.670> alternatives<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
be some cheaper alternatives that you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.070 
be some cheaper alternatives that you
can<00:01:09.869> use<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.409> place<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.420> $30<00:01:12.420> piece<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
can use in place of this $30 piece of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560 
can use in place of this $30 piece of
rubber<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> searched<00:01:14.670> high<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.060> low

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
rubber and so I searched high and low

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.010 
rubber and so I searched high and low
far<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.950> wide<00:01:17.190> to<00:01:17.490> find<00:01:18.030> some<00:01:18.420> comparable

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
far and wide to find some comparable

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.600

dupes<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.070> place<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
dupes that you can use in place of the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
dupes that you can use in place of the
Sigma<00:01:20.939> brush<00:01:21.180> map<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.689> work<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.710> well

this<00:04:11.470> mat<00:04:12.069> my<00:04:12.639> only<00:04:12.910> negative<00:04:13.120> for<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:13.569> mat

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.629 
this mat my only negative for this mat
is<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:14.139> it<00:04:14.230> does<00:04:14.410> tend<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:14.889> move<00:04:15.069> around<00:04:15.220> the

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
is that it does tend to move around the

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.190 
is that it does tend to move around the
sink<00:04:15.910> while<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.239> are<00:04:16.359> washing<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.840> brushes

sink while you are washing the brushes
but<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.829> can<00:04:18.039> very<00:04:18.250> easily<00:04:18.340> fix<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.209> if<00:04:19.359> you

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
but you can very easily fix that if you

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.810 
but you can very easily fix that if you
wanted<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.900> add<00:04:20.019> some<00:04:20.320> suction<00:04:20.739> cups<00:04:21.010> onto<00:04:21.700> the
