00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hi everyone and welcome to the tutorials 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 in this new format I give you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.990
 some tips and tricks for 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.000
 realize your photos and for this first 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.150
 episode I will tell you about the pictures 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.150
 by night 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.610
 as I already said in another 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.710
 video when we make a photo it takes 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.529
 the light but how to do when we 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.150
 does not have enough or not enough to compensate 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.360
 we will play on the three settings of 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.210
 based 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.830
 it will therefore increase openness but 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.660
 in this case it is the goal that will 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.820
 limit and we can play on the 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.830
 sensitivity but here it will be necessary to take 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.710
 account the performance of the case there 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.360
 so remains the speed for this first 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.370
 turn so we'll focus on the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.760
 decrease in speed and make the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 long break 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.879
 ideally you need a crepe maker and 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.920
 a remote control you will see that if 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.170
 you have neither of you 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.110
 give some combinations do not forget 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.869
 not to take a flashlight 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.729
 why a tripod simply because 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.290
 as I already wanted ten from the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.119
 thirtieth of a second even though you have 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.320
 the best destabilization you 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.619
 can not do photos 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 net 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.940
 if you do not have a tripod already it is going 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.590
 must quickly remedy this problem 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 and to replace it you can 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.090
 use any medium 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.710
 a wall a bench and it is in this case there 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.759
 to be able to stabilize your device 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.229
 what can be useful 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.690
 it's called a hot water bottle 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.729
 dry it looks like these it's 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.200
 a cloth bag filled with kernels of 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.570
 cherries you find this on the internet 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.069
 for a dozen euros or if you 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.729
 know how to sew and that you like kernels of 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.140
 cherries why a remote for 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.720
 avoid vibrations due to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.310
 trigger and yes even if you have 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.929
 a very good tripod it may be that you 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.500
 make a few vibrations at the time of 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.720
 release 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.220
 to avoid this it is necessary to use a 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.850
 remote control you do not have 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.920
 remote control 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.469
 do not panic use your 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.299
 self-timer set the ten seconds 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.860
 and trigger normally during 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.899
 ten seconds of self-timer the case 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.850
 will have plenty of time to stabilize but 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.709
 the remote control also has another interest 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.720
 most cases are limited to 30 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.430
 seconds without a remote control with it 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.790
 you will be able to take a lot of breaks 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.790
 longer 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.280
 how to choose the spot of their photos 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.720
 that's a good question it depends on 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.060
 what you want to do but all 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.099
 places have their charm playing with the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.409
 lights of the city the stars where the 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.180
 moon moving vehicles ago 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.470
 tons of possibilities in photo of 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.620
 let him free rein to your 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.620
 imagination 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.629
 once you have found your spot 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.890
 know your device in hand and 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.170
 look for the right framing 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.939
 this is where the tripod is your ally 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.819
 when to use another medium 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.799
 you are necessarily more limited once 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.780
 the ideal framing find position 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.370
 your tripod fix your case on 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.370
 and adjust your framing 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.549
 there we enter the heart of the subject 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.349
 connect your remote if you 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.359
 have one or else adjust your shift 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.940
 Atr on 10 seconds is better 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:18.750
 then with the selection wheel 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.480
 modes set to before and finally put 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.400
 the sensitivity on 100 iso see 56 your 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.310
 father's case but why priority to 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.930
 opening simply because 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.389
 in our case the speed is not a 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.129
 problem so let's focus on the 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.170
 choice of depth of field and 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.720
 why 100 iso beat for the same 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.670
 reason speed we do not care so we 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.590
 limit the maximum grain in the photo 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.139
 by choosing the most sensitive 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.609
 weak of the case I will give you my 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.659
 technique for a problem that happens 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.480
 often night photos 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.889
 the focus indeed in the dark 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.660
 it's very complicated for the auto focus 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.370
 to make a focus is in mode 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.139
 manual it is not necessarily obvious 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.299
 no longer bring you the famous 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.250
 flashlight illuminate the area where you 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.870
 want to do the tuning support a 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.049
 nikos on the triggers that 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.790
 the autofocus way work then switch 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.560
 your focus in focus mode 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.840
 manual and do not touch anything the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.480
 focus is made think also to 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.400
 enable corruption yes long exfo if 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.260
 your case to this function this 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.359
 allows to correct any defects 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.729
 due to the damaged pixels of your sensor 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.740
 the case will then take a second 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.510
 photo ec shutter fermi then the 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.090
 compare with the first to correct 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.050
 the pixels hot or dead once all 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.000
 the settings made 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.919
 choose your opening then 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.460
 trigger and finally admire your 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.349
 job 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.820
 if you find that the photo is not 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.620
 correctly exposed 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.539
 look at what speed to calculate your 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.100
 case then switch to manual mode 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.320
 to increase the swell has decreased 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.640
 your envy that's it you know everything 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.630
 now i will comment 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.280
 some of my photos for 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.770
 start here is a picture of a sky 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.810
 starry a full moon day price on 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.930
 tripods with an opening of f waves 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.470
 the sensitivity to 100 and a break of 30 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.840
 seconds 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.820
 as you can see the full moon 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.260
 generates a lot of light and gives 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.690
 the impression that the photo was not 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.150
 taking luz we see some stars 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.160
 but only the brightest ones for 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.020
 succeed a beautiful sky is glued it does not 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.130
 need no moon and have a minimum of 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.890
 parasitic lights 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.270
 a small remark to have this effect 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.250
 canvases on bright spots 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.540
 just choose a small 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.860
 opening for this one I'm having fun with 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.710
 the movements of the headlights of cars 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.600
 and the tram I chose an opening to 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.760
 f10 so that the bright spots face 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.630
 of stars and that my depth of 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.210
 field be growling 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.890
 with 100 iso for the sensitivity and the 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.300
 case to calculate 13 seconds for the 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.950
 speed to be able to realize this sky 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.350
 starry I waited for the new moon 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.420
 we see that the lights of the village is 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.370
 clear the trees and make an orange halo 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.870
 and in the sky I wanted to wait until 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.950
 the lights are off but the weather 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.050
 otherwise 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.160
 we notice the movement of the 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.690
 earth compared to the stars 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.700
 she began drawing arcs 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.830
 circles and for that I realized a 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.230
 seventeen minute break with a 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.770
 opening at f 2.8 and sensitivity to 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.770
 100 iso 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.530
 I hope all my advice 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.050
 will help for your next pictures of 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.840
 night do not hesitate to share your 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.120
 creations in comments on youtube or 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.790
 on facebook or ask your questions 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.500
 will answer with pleasure I wanted you 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.060
 thank for your support you are 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.950
 more and more people to follow me on 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.700
 youtube and frankly I was not hoping 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.430
 so 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.020
 really thank you very much I wanted 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.700
 also apologize for the delay of 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.380
 this video that was to be published for 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.120
 the end of January 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.650
 I had a lot of work and in the 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.680
 moments when I could write 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.910
 but a great lack of inspiration 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.860
 promised I will try wallon farm the 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.870
 next time as usual if you 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.490
 liked to share this video on all 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.880
 social networks and put an inch 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.020
 in the air and if you did not like 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.610
 share anyway loved you are when 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.680
 even a thumbs up - kick off 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.060
 I do not like that you can click a 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.830
 little bit everywhere to follow me on 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.180
 facebook instagram or twitter or 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.130
 eventually go for a ride on 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.530
 the page of the video library of Alexandria 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.000
 you can also click here for yourself 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.220
 subscribe to my youtube channel 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.050
 in the meantime I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.460
 I hope you have learned something 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.460
 thing 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.460
 Hi
