headstand<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.480> go<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.630> wrap<00:03:30.780> your<00:03:30.930> feet

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
headstand then you go to wrap your feet

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.530 
headstand then you go to wrap your feet
around<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.680> band<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.280> it'll<00:03:32.849> take<00:03:33.060> away<00:03:33.329> a

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
around the band and it'll take away a

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.949 
around the band and it'll take away a
little<00:03:33.870> bit<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.170> load<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:36.720> give<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.930> a

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
little bit of that load it give you a

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.720 
little bit of that load it give you a
little<00:03:37.200> bit<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.319> assistance<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.190> way<00:03:38.310> up

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
little bit of assistance on the way up

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.100 
little bit of assistance on the way up
all<00:03:39.569> right<00:03:39.750> very<00:03:39.870> nice<00:03:41.090> obviously<00:03:42.090> these<00:03:43.049> are

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
all right very nice obviously these are

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.250 
all right very nice obviously these are
kind<00:03:43.349> of<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.560> mid-sized<00:03:44.280> band<00:03:44.870> if<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.019> want

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
kind of a mid-sized band if you want

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.960 
kind of a mid-sized band if you want
once<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.709> use<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:46.950> bigger<00:03:47.310> band<00:03:47.579> or<00:03:47.790> if<00:03:47.880> you

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
once you use a bigger band or if you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.610 
once you use a bigger band or if you
need<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.209> use<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.329> bigger<00:03:48.569> band<00:03:48.780> that's<00:03:49.019> totally

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
need to use a bigger band that's totally

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.910 
need to use a bigger band that's totally
cool<00:03:49.970> usually<00:03:50.970> I'll<00:03:51.060> keep<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:51.450> band<00:03:51.920> it's

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
cool usually I'll keep this band it's

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.349 
cool usually I'll keep this band it's
pretty<00:03:53.190> much<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.459> same<00:03:53.489> since<00:03:54.000> most<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.269> the

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
pretty much the same since most of the

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.849 
pretty much the same since most of the
stretch<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.690> coming<00:03:54.930> out<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.139> top<00:03:55.319> band<00:03:55.590> and

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
stretch is coming out of top band and

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.559 
stretch is coming out of top band and
I'll<00:03:56.190> change<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.609> size<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.940> top<00:03:57.120> band<00:03:57.359> so

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
I'll change the size of the top band so

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.059 
I'll change the size of the top band so
if<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:57.959> need<00:03:58.139> a<00:03:58.170> bigger<00:03:58.410> band<00:03:58.620> like<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.799> green

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
if you need a bigger band like a green

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.400 
if you need a bigger band like a green
band<00:03:59.310> or<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.519> smaller<00:03:59.850> band<00:04:00.120> like<00:04:01.019> like<00:04:01.380> a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
band or a smaller band like like a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.680 
band or a smaller band like like a
smaller<00:04:01.709> black<00:04:01.950> band<00:04:02.220> or<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.400> red<00:04:02.609> band<00:04:02.880> then

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
smaller black band or a red band then

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.020 
smaller black band or a red band then
you<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:03.959> work<00:04:04.530> your<00:04:04.709> way<00:04:04.769> towards<00:04:05.370> no<00:04:05.730> band<00:04:05.940> at

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
you can work your way towards no band at

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.490 
you can work your way towards no band at
all<00:04:06.090> by<00:04:06.269> making<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.630> band<00:04:06.810> smaller<00:04:07.170> smaller

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
all by making the band smaller smaller

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.009 
all by making the band smaller smaller
smaller<00:04:07.590> each<00:04:08.010> time<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.510> last<00:04:09.690> thing<00:04:09.900> we

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
smaller each time and the last thing we

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.440 
smaller each time and the last thing we
want<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.230> talk<00:04:10.319> about<00:04:10.380> for<00:04:10.709> scaling<00:04:11.250> if<00:04:12.209> you're

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
want to talk about for scaling if you're

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.970 
want to talk about for scaling if you're
in<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.690> competition<00:04:12.900> where<00:04:13.739> you're<00:04:13.859> not

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
in a competition where you're not

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.080 
in a competition where you're not
allowed<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.250> scale<00:04:14.609> then<00:04:14.819> you're<00:04:14.910> probably

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
allowed to scale then you're probably

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.969 
allowed to scale then you're probably
allowed<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.780> Kip<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.500> when<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.650> talk<00:04:16.799> about

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
allowed to Kip so when I talk about

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.860 
allowed to Kip so when I talk about
keeping<00:04:17.160> going<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.880> demo<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.299> keeping<00:04:18.570> a

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
keeping going just demo of keeping a

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.909 
keeping going just demo of keeping a
kipping<00:04:19.350> handstand<00:04:19.680> person<00:04:20.010> please<00:04:21.919> there

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
kipping handstand person please there

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.080 
kipping handstand person please there
you<00:04:23.039> go<00:04:23.750> alright<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.430> absolutely<00:04:26.430> just<00:04:26.639> showed

you go alright so absolutely just showed

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.700 
you go alright so absolutely just showed
a<00:04:27.120> kipping<00:04:27.539> handstand<00:04:27.810> push<00:04:28.050> up<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.289> that's<00:04:28.440> a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
a kipping handstand push up and that's a

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.190 
a kipping handstand push up and that's a
good<00:04:29.099> variation<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.880> do<00:04:30.060> if<00:04:30.330> you're<00:04:30.570> very

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
good variation to do if you're very

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.629 
good variation to do if you're very
experienced<00:04:31.770> because<00:04:31.919> actually<00:04:32.340> probably

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
experienced because actually probably

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.010 
experienced because actually probably
the<00:04:32.789> fastest<00:04:33.300> way<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.479> do<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:33.690> kipping

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
the fastest way to do a kipping

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.960 
the fastest way to do a kipping
handstand<00:04:34.289> push<00:04:34.530> up<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.860> she's<00:04:35.400> very<00:04:35.580> strong

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
handstand push up a she's very strong

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.480 
handstand push up a she's very strong
and<00:04:36.180> at<00:04:36.510> handstand<00:04:37.139> push<00:04:37.320> ups<00:04:37.500> so<00:04:37.710> she<00:04:38.370> was

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
and at handstand push ups so she was

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.670 
and at handstand push ups so she was
doing<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.789> fast<00:04:39.000> version<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:40.289> version

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
doing the fast version that version

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.120 
doing the fast version that version
looks<00:04:40.860> like<00:04:41.010> this<00:04:41.190> again<00:04:42.830> she's<00:04:43.830> on<00:04:43.979> the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
looks like this again she's on the

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.650 
looks like this again she's on the
ground<00:04:44.220> she<00:04:44.849> brings<00:04:45.030> her<00:04:45.120> heels<00:04:45.330> right<00:04:45.510> down

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
ground she brings her heels right down

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.160 
ground she brings her heels right down
to<00:04:45.780> her<00:04:45.840> butt<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.320> then<00:04:46.740> kicks<00:04:46.979> out

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
to her butt and then kicks out

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.870 
to her butt and then kicks out
so<00:04:49.170> that's<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.590> fast<00:04:49.800> version<00:04:50.040> but<00:04:50.520> she<00:04:50.700> wants

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
so that's the fast version but she wants

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.430 
so that's the fast version but she wants
a<00:04:50.940> more<00:04:51.210> powerful<00:04:51.420> version<00:04:51.720> than<00:04:52.110> she<00:04:52.320> will

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
a more powerful version than she will

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.960 
a more powerful version than she will
keep<00:04:52.560> her<00:04:52.620> butt<00:04:52.860> against<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.190> wall<00:04:53.370> she<00:04:53.820> bring

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
keep her butt against the wall she bring

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.890 
keep her butt against the wall she bring
her<00:04:54.030> knees<00:04:54.120> all<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.420> way<00:04:54.510> out<00:04:54.660> in<00:04:54.720> front<00:04:54.840> of

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
her knees all the way out in front of

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.840 
her knees all the way out in front of
her<00:04:54.990> chest<00:04:55.260> man<00:04:55.830> should<00:04:56.070> get<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.280> little<00:04:56.460> more<00:04:56.580> a

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
her chest man should get a little more a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.670 
her chest man should get a little more a
little<00:04:56.910> more<00:04:57.270> drive<00:04:57.660> out<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.350> her<00:04:58.440> legs

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
little more drive out of her legs

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.010 
little more drive out of her legs
because<00:04:58.920> she's<00:04:59.700> getting<00:04:59.790> more<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.600> bend

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.930 

more<00:05:04.020> benefit<00:05:04.530> so<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.700> see<00:05:05.820> the

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
more benefit so you can see the

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.480 
more benefit so you can see the
difference<00:05:06.240> there<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.950> first<00:05:08.190> one<00:05:08.340> looks

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
difference there the first one looks

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.400 
difference there the first one looks
like<00:05:08.550> this<00:05:08.820> where<00:05:09.060> she<00:05:09.180> was<00:05:09.300> overhead<00:05:09.690> her

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
like this where she was overhead her

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.500 
like this where she was overhead her
heels<00:05:10.740> are<00:05:11.370> coming<00:05:11.700> about<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.060> her<00:05:12.150> butt<00:05:12.360> like

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
heels are coming about to her butt like

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.850 
heels are coming about to her butt like
this<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.930> then<00:05:13.020> she<00:05:13.140> was<00:05:13.260> kicking<00:05:13.590> out<00:05:13.740> and

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
this and then she was kicking out and

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.410 
this and then she was kicking out and
getting<00:05:13.980> a<00:05:14.100> little<00:05:14.220> bit<00:05:14.430> of<00:05:14.490> force<00:05:14.730> on<00:05:14.940> the

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
getting a little bit of force on the

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.910 
getting a little bit of force on the
second<00:05:15.750> one<00:05:15.870> instead<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.110> just<00:05:16.200> coming<00:05:16.410> here

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
second one instead of just coming here

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.700 
second one instead of just coming here
she<00:05:17.490> was<00:05:17.640> bending<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.210> getting<00:05:18.540> her<00:05:18.720> her<00:05:19.440> knee

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
she was bending and getting her her knee

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.200 
she was bending and getting her her knee
up<00:05:19.860> nice<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:20.070> high<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:20.610> then<00:05:20.820> really

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
up nice and high and then really

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.150 
up nice and high and then really
exploding<00:05:21.930> out<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.260> position<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:23.040> she

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
exploding out of that position and she

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.340 
exploding out of that position and she
gets<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.370> lot<00:05:23.490> more<00:05:23.520> power<00:05:23.910> like<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:24.450> I<00:05:24.690> can<00:05:25.230> do

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
gets a lot more power like that I can do

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.740 
gets a lot more power like that I can do
these<00:05:25.560> really<00:05:26.160> fast<00:05:26.400> but<00:05:27.120> I<00:05:27.180> get<00:05:27.330> more<00:05:27.480> power

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
these really fast but I get more power

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.090 
these really fast but I get more power
out<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:27.930> these<00:05:28.140> so<00:05:28.380> if<00:05:28.440> you're<00:05:28.560> very<00:05:28.710> tired

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
out of these so if you're very tired

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.710 
out of these so if you're very tired
that<00:05:29.640> might<00:05:29.760> be<00:05:29.880> a<00:05:29.910> better<00:05:30.090> variation<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.600> go

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
that might be a better variation to go

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.050 
that might be a better variation to go
to<00:05:30.780> but<00:05:31.470> if<00:05:31.560> you<00:05:31.620> only<00:05:31.740> have<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:32.010> do<00:05:32.160> five<00:05:32.850> in<00:05:32.880> a

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
to but if you only have to do five in a

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.910 
to but if you only have to do five in a
row<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.450> that's<00:05:33.930> an<00:05:34.020> easy<00:05:34.260> movement<00:05:34.620> for<00:05:34.800> you

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
row and that's an easy movement for you

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.900 
row and that's an easy movement for you
if<00:05:35.760> you<00:05:35.940> don't<00:05:36.450> want<00:05:36.630> to<00:05:36.720> do<00:05:37.250> strict<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.490> you

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
if you don't want to do strict and you

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.150 
if you don't want to do strict and you
want<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.180> Kip<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.840> that<00:05:40.080> heal<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:40.980> butt

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
want to Kip and that heal the butt

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.380 
want to Kip and that heal the butt
version<00:05:41.490> is<00:05:41.580> probably<00:05:41.850> the<00:05:41.940> fastest<00:05:42.240> way<00:05:42.360> to

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
version is probably the fastest way to

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.800 
version is probably the fastest way to
do<00:05:42.750> those<00:05:42.960> Kip's<00:05:44.420> got<00:05:45.420> anything<00:05:45.540> I<00:05:45.630> want<00:05:45.750> to

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
do those Kip's got anything I want to

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.840 
do those Kip's got anything I want to
add<00:05:46.430> that's<00:05:47.430> it

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
add that's it

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.410 
add that's it
all<00:05:48.420> right<00:05:48.600> see<00:05:49.200> them<00:05:49.320> all
