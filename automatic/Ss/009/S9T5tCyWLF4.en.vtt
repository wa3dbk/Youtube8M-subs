00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
they actually light up or if there's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.760 
they actually light up or if there's
just<00:00:47.340> standard<00:00:47.789> toys<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.530> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
just standard toys and then they have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250

ones

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
ones
it's<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.370> neat<00:00:53.579> gimmick<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.180> I'd<00:00:54.329> rather<00:00:54.629> just

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it's a neat gimmick but I'd rather just

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.689 
it's a neat gimmick but I'd rather just
have<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.230> regular<00:00:55.559> toy<00:00:55.949> rather<00:00:56.309> than<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
have a regular toy rather than the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.209 
have a regular toy rather than the
light-up<00:00:57.109> gimmick<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.100> know

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
light-up gimmick because you know

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.590 
light-up gimmick because you know
articulations<00:00:59.820> better<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> toy

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
articulations better when the toy

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.549 
articulations better when the toy
doesn't<00:01:00.809> light<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.859> anyway<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.460> are

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
doesn't light up so anyway here they are

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.010 
doesn't light up so anyway here they are
these<00:01:04.559> robots<00:01:05.090> actually<00:01:06.090> every<00:01:06.420> single<00:01:06.450> robot

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.670 
just it's a hole just solid piece no
lines<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.520> I'm<00:03:39.209> not<00:03:39.510> sure<00:03:39.570> but<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.320> does

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
lines so it I'm not sure but it does

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.490 
lines so it I'm not sure but it does
seem<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.160> me<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:42.140> there<00:03:43.140> are<00:03:43.200> two<00:03:43.320> different

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
seem to me that there are two different

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.770 
seem to me that there are two different
toys<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.220> think<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.850> arms<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.330> weights<00:03:45.480> are

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
toys I think the arms and weights are

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.479 
toys I think the arms and weights are
exact<00:03:46.020> sorry<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.709> arms<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.100> legs<00:03:47.280> are

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
exact sorry the arms and legs are

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.330 
exact sorry the arms and legs are
exactly<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.090> same<00:03:48.330> they<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:49.220> rebuilt<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
exactly the same they just rebuilt the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.070 
exactly the same they just rebuilt the
body<00:03:50.550> one<00:03:50.910> with<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.300> lights<00:03:51.510> up<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.900> one

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
body one with the lights up and one

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.580 
body one with the lights up and one
doesn't

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
doesn't

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.070 
doesn't
so<00:03:53.489> if<00:03:53.760> there<00:03:53.940> are<00:03:54.000> two<00:03:54.120> different<00:03:54.390> robots<00:03:54.690> I'm

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
so if there are two different robots I'm

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.180 
so if there are two different robots I'm
just<00:03:55.350> gonna<00:03:55.530> stick<00:03:55.650> with<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.890> ones<00:03:56.010> that

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
just gonna stick with the ones that

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.890 
just gonna stick with the ones that
aren't<00:03:56.370> lit<00:03:56.610> up<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:57.090> think<00:03:57.450> they<00:03:57.540> look<00:03:57.690> better

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
aren't lit up I think they look better

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.479 
aren't lit up I think they look better
as<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.440> see<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.800> guy's<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.310> lines

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
as you can see this guy's that the lines

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.310 
as you can see this guy's that the lines
in<00:03:59.640> it's<00:03:59.730> just<00:03:59.910> all<00:04:00.060> this<00:04:00.180> right<00:04:00.390> doesn't<00:04:00.630> so

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
in it's just all this right doesn't so

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.890 
in it's just all this right doesn't so
there's<00:04:01.560> more<00:04:01.709> detail<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:02.310> him<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:03.360> imagine

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
there's more detail in him and I imagine

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.600 
there's more detail in him and I imagine
the<00:04:04.050> light-up<00:04:04.230> ones<00:04:04.530> are<00:04:04.709> gonna<00:04:04.800> cost<00:04:05.070> more<00:04:05.370> I

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the light-up ones are gonna cost more I

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.790 
the light-up ones are gonna cost more I
really<00:04:05.910> have<00:04:06.060> no<00:04:06.300> use<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:06.660> light-up<00:04:07.110> gimmicks

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800
