00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.719
 so people I have something prepared and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.910
 Although you have also asked me face 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.809
 steam bath yes that runs off like that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 does it work 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.170
 what am I doing that prepares that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.539
 is it good 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.029
 I'll make you a face right now 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.560
 so not out but me but I show 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.830
 you how that works what you do 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.660
 got to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.740
 you really need one next time 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.210
 big pot and pretty much water i 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.529
 would say this big pot 4 have 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.640
 I now half filled with water 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.170
 and you have to boil it up now 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.540
 best still the lid I need 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.450
 I will not go where the lid is anyway 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.480
 best leave lid boil it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.480
 and then we'll see you again soon 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:58.260
 so people are now boiling water 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.780
 we enter this boiling water 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 a handful of camel flowers so pure 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:14.400
 about the amount of chamomile flowers 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:21.300
 just give it in so perfect the fun 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.330
 cooks again and it starts 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.330
 continue 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.970
 so I forget that people too 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.530
 you have to mention the whole ten 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.700
 minutes after he left the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.390
 camellias bloom pure could have done 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 make out the one and the pot of 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.670
 herd company in all cases that is allowed 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.270
 Do not cook when the suit blooms in it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.330
 are very important to be great 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 so that the top solution sit quietly 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.369
 you can do a little wooden board 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.729
 down is pretty hot I need it 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.959
 still a mantra a relatively large cloth 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.709
 and then the consequences of it 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:09.780
 it is on the top word effect makes 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:17.209
 the pot on the head police and that 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.910
 do you even have the heat remains yes 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.300
 just like that now for five minutes 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.300
 so 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.640
 so five minutes please really hot and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.850
 hoffer really good 45 minutes please 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.350
 simply times keep the face so pure 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.180
 that's really good against everything 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.460
 acne especially against mixa 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.660
 The skin becomes really nice smooth 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.970
 before that and yes it is something really good 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.620
 I do not do it myself 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.400
 all too often maybe one-two 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.620
 there must be weeks in the face of it 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.660
 really and I 'm already right 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.640
 Crisis in the key today was that too 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.760
 mega hammer 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.150
 It is handy but this grace period 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.290
 face so it really does not like it 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.010
 Just try it and the world now 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.440
 see that even then money is right 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.030
 after which favorite should have finished 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.390
 Rinse your face with cold water 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.270
 that is very important , too 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.950
 It would be extremely exciting as well 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.920
 the five minutes just said the head 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.470
 so purity not to over the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.269
 passeig already 34 inches away 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.110
 and yes, the same material until I 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.110
 I'm done then it goes on 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:53.299
 so people now again ten minutes five 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.709
 until ten is done with it 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.110
 probably be pretty red now 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.280
 of course 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.040
 and now the face with cold water 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.799
 wash it off and when I'm done I am 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.420
 really right yes tobias witte 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.910
 literally mowed face boy 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.750
 have now extremely sharp anyway 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.250
 angle and yes until the next video 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.760
 SchÃ¤rding does not mean too 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.760
 suffice
