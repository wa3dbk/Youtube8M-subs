00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that's it's not so bad but yeah we've

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.619 
that's it's not so bad but yeah we've
been<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> few<00:00:44.940> times

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
been out a few times

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.689 
been out a few times

nothing as dangerous as that though yeah

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.860 
nothing as dangerous as that though yeah
I<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.239> those<00:00:54.390> things<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.809> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
I think it's one of those things are you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.639 
I think it's one of those things are you
know<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.110> something<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.500> happens

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
know when something like that happens

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.709 
know when something like that happens
then<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.640> he's<00:00:56.730> gonna<00:00:56.879> mellow<00:00:57.180> he<00:00:57.449> kind

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
then you think he's gonna mellow he kind

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.029 
then you think he's gonna mellow he kind
of<00:00:57.870> goes<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> other<00:00:58.379> way<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.620> he<00:00:58.859> doesn't

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
of goes the other way because he doesn't

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.830 
of goes the other way because he doesn't
want<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> he's<00:00:59.850> seen<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> softer<00:01:00.539> he<00:01:00.600> doesn't
