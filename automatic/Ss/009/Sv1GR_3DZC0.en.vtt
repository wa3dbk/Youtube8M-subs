00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.450 

all<00:00:05.960> right<00:00:06.080> so<00:00:06.229> when<00:00:06.350> you<00:00:06.439> pop<00:00:06.590> in<00:00:06.740> a<00:00:06.800> ps2<00:00:07.250> disc

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
all right so when you pop in a ps2 disc

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.980 
all right so when you pop in a ps2 disc
the<00:00:07.729> system<00:00:08.059> will<00:00:08.180> ask<00:00:08.330> you<00:00:08.540> to<00:00:08.570> create<00:00:08.900> an

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
the system will ask you to create an

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.660 
the system will ask you to create an
internal<00:00:09.440> memory<00:00:09.800> card<00:00:10.099> on<00:00:10.190> the<00:00:10.250> hard<00:00:10.429> disk

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
internal memory card on the hard disk

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.530 
internal memory card on the hard disk
which<00:00:10.849> I<00:00:10.940> guess<00:00:11.030> is<00:00:11.150> some<00:00:11.269> kind<00:00:11.450> of<00:00:11.480> virtual

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
which I guess is some kind of virtual

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.279 
which I guess is some kind of virtual
aided<00:00:12.790> virtualized<00:00:13.790> ps1<00:00:14.570> ps2<00:00:14.780> memory<00:00:15.500> card<00:00:17.289> so

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
aided virtualized ps1 ps2 memory card so

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:29.200 
aided virtualized ps1 ps2 memory card so
you<00:00:18.349> hit<00:00:18.560> yes<00:00:18.859> to<00:00:19.070> create<00:00:19.250> it<00:00:19.400> now<00:00:27.999> to<00:00:28.999> create

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
you hit yes to create it now to create

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.639 
you hit yes to create it now to create
an<00:00:29.329> internal<00:00:29.569> memory<00:00:29.869> card<00:00:30.109> from<00:00:30.380> new

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
an internal memory card from new

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.019 
an internal memory card from new
internal<00:00:31.099> memory<00:00:31.339> card<00:00:31.579> on<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:31.730> next<00:00:31.909> screen

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
internal memory card on the next screen

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:42.319 
internal memory card on the next screen
and<00:00:32.540> then<00:00:32.689> start<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.170> game<00:00:33.350> okay

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.990
