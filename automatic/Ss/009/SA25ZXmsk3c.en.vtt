00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.490

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.310
 material 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.730
 rough to the touch on which as 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.970
 manufacturer claims 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.610
 bacteria do not survive antibacterial 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.700

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:42.430
 material not seen antibacterial 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.540
 Here in Zade on the packaging here is bad 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:54.130
 the phone focuses too much 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:56.440
 written on the knife itself on is it available 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.740
 also inscriptions that it is high carbon 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:05.820
 tramontina steel 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:09.370
 ns icon also that pleased me 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:19.930
 blades written here it is not visible on 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:24.670
 camera made in brazil it's good that 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:28.060
 I can still say about them my feelings knife 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.460
 done well here 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.730
 the only thing that again is not visible on 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.500
 the camera has small snippets but it 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.510
 trifle handy comfortable pleasant and and 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.470
 wetting on the hand does not slip 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:49.840
 but there is no structure so nice 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:54.480
 the roughness of the blade is shaped like that 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:58.930
 called triple wedge butt descents 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.580
 what I like about kitchen knives 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.520
 I think this is the most optimal form 2 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.510
 Liza 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:14.250
 butt structure is so interesting 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:21.660
 there is a picture of hoar frost covered 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.660
 chubby knife for kitchen knives 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:35.279
 Well, now about the price, then I took these 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:40.749
 two small vegetable knives cost it 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:41.580
 85 rubles average knife with marking 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.819
 drops 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.520
 086 did not go somewhere around 145 and 35 45 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.469
 rubles and a big one this knife 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.580
 twenty centimeter blade with 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:57.580
 marking 088 cost me somewhere 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.169
 230 250 rubles now just can not 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:05.139
 say in general it is not the most expensive 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.449
 knives do not compare and the Japanese or 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.439
 some american knives from 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:15.149
 Damascus steel 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:18.729
 the prices are quite reasonable therefore 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:22.240
 making a conclusion I can say that knives are for me 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:26.189
 generally liked the content and 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:31.289
 pleasant to the touch 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:37.809
 cut any scar out of the box what is called 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:40.629
 in quotes paper is good the only thing 

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:41.189
 This one is a little bit worse. 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:48.039
 two 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:51.909
 easily cut a sheet of paper all this can not 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:53.069
 not happy and i can recommend these 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:58.800
