layout<00:00:49.999> of<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.389> changes<00:00:51.010> notice<00:00:52.010> that<00:00:52.339> some

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
layout of the changes notice that some

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:54.430 
layout of the changes notice that some
of<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.850> chords<00:00:53.120> are<00:00:53.329> two<00:00:53.539> bars<00:00:53.780> in<00:00:53.899> duration

others are one bar and some are only two
beats<00:00:58.120> we'll<00:00:59.120> need<00:00:59.359> to<00:00:59.510> tailor<00:00:59.719> the<00:01:00.019> pattern

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379

to<00:01:00.589> fit<00:01:00.799> each<00:01:01.039> change<00:01:02.139> since<00:01:03.139> we'll<00:01:03.350> be

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
to fit each change since we'll be

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:04.719 
to fit each change since we'll be
playing<00:01:03.709> the<00:01:03.889> patterns<00:01:04.280> in<00:01:04.519> eighth<00:01:04.699> notes
