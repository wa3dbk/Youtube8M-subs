there and yeah and the inside the body

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.309 
there and yeah and the inside the body
itself<00:01:53.829> most<00:01:54.829> likely<00:01:55.069> it's<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.549> reissue<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:56.319> all

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
itself most likely it's a reissue of all

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.339 
itself most likely it's a reissue of all
the<00:01:57.560> thugs<00:01:57.859> and<00:01:58.189> Joker<00:01:58.819> and<00:01:59.209> all<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.229> other

people and I'm not quite sure about the
pants<00:02:05.119> most<00:02:05.479> likely<00:02:05.719> it's<00:02:06.079> another<00:02:06.950> reissue

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080

front portion on to it and we'll take a
look<00:03:52.670> one<00:03:53.670> not<00:03:54.200> there's<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.409> dancing<00:03:55.829> huh<00:03:55.980> I

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.399 

actually<00:03:59.609> like<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.359> broken<00:04:00.810> one<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.019> little

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
actually like the broken one a little

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.429 
actually like the broken one a little
bit<00:04:01.530> more<00:04:01.769> even<00:04:02.579> though<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:02.939> one<00:04:03.120> this

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
bit more even though this one this

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.209 
bit more even though this one this
plastic<00:04:04.439> and<00:04:05.269> this<00:04:06.269> looks<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.780> glass<00:04:07.219> this

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:08.219 
plastic and this looks to be glass this

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:10.220 
plastic and this looks to be glass this
is<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.400> magnifying<00:04:08.969> glass<00:04:09.060> piece<00:04:09.569> looks<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.079> be

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
is a magnifying glass piece looks to be

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.660 
is a magnifying glass piece looks to be
made<00:04:10.829> out<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:10.980> glass<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.579> guess<00:04:12.569> that<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:13.019> is<00:04:13.170> for

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
made out of glass I guess that it is for

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.310 
made out of glass I guess that it is for
projecting<00:04:14.670> projects<00:04:15.659> a<00:04:15.780> little<00:04:16.019> bit<00:04:16.109> better

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
projecting projects a little bit better

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.930 
projecting projects a little bit better
since<00:04:17.160> this<00:04:17.340> class<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.509> a<00:04:18.720> more<00:04:19.380> of<00:04:19.470> a

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
since this class and it's a more of a

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.350 
since this class and it's a more of a
magnifying<00:04:21.740> magnifying<00:04:22.740> lens<00:04:23.009> so<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.940> helps

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
magnifying magnifying lens so it helps

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.629 
magnifying magnifying lens so it helps
project<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.440> signal<00:04:25.800> out<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:26.160> little<00:04:26.340> bit<00:04:26.460> better

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
project a signal out a little bit better

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.960 
project a signal out a little bit better
so<00:04:27.479> there<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.930> have<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:28.680> there's<00:04:29.580> John

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
so there you have it and there's John

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.040 
so there you have it and there's John
Blake<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.900> bat<00:04:31.080> signal<00:04:32.180> so<00:04:33.180> far<00:04:33.419> I'm

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
Blake and the bat signal so far I'm

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.870 
Blake and the bat signal so far I'm
still<00:04:34.349> missing<00:04:34.500> one<00:04:34.740> piece<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.580> would

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
still missing one piece and that would

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.870 
still missing one piece and that would
be<00:04:35.910> a<00:04:36.060> raja<00:04:36.870> raja<00:04:37.590> al<00:04:37.830> Ghul's<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.919> back<00:04:41.669> piece

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
be a raja raja al Ghul's the back piece
