the<00:02:04.770> bush<00:02:04.920> where<00:02:05.159> those<00:02:05.280> fifty-fifty<00:02:05.909> chance

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
the bush where those fifty-fifty chance

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.949 
the bush where those fifty-fifty chance
ran<00:02:06.719> straight<00:02:07.020> down<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> road<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.920> me<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.959> it
