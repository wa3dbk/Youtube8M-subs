00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.440
 Thank you for your care. 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.440

 Singing: Wang Caihua 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.511
 Set aside the dark clouds along the road 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.981
 Let this stupid bird slowly fly slowly 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.461
 You have more for me in your hands. 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.651
 Is my heart forever thank you 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.081
 Because someone is willing to give me so much 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.771
 It hurts me so deep 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.241
 I am sure I should be a 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.681
 a person worthy of love 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.001
 Thank you for being the wind under my wings. 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.681
 Escort me to fly to the sky I want 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.321
 I really can’t think of what to return. 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.291
 Had to say 10,000 times thank you for your care 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.621
 Thank you for making me a bridge over the water. 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.701
 Let me walk with a dream, don't be afraid to fall 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.451
 I own all of you. 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.231
 No need else 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.191
 Blocked the cold arrows from each shot 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.031
 No one is allowed to be bad to me 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.241
 However, when I messed up 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.821
 But only comforted, can’t blame 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.441
 Because someone is willing to give me so much 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.221
 It hurts me so deep 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.451
 I am sure I should be a 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.061
 a person worthy of love 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.191
 Thank you for being the wind under my wings. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.921
 Escort me to fly to the sky I want 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.821
 I really can’t think of what to return. 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.891
 Had to say 10,000 times thank you for your care 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.161
 Thank you for making me a bridge over the water. 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.071
 Let me walk with a dream, don't be afraid to fall 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.341
 I own all of you. 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.791
 No need else 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.001
 I am afraid that you will be lonely if you are gone. 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.801
 So I won't go 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.281
 If there is no you, what am I saying? 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.501
 Nothing 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.181
 Thank you for being the wind under my wings. 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.861
 Escort me to fly to the sky I want 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.941
 I really can’t think of what to return. 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.771
 Had to say 10,000 times thank you for your care 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.451
 Thank you for making me a bridge over the water. 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.121

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.181
 I own all of you. 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.221
 No need else
