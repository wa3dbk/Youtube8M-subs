00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.500 

okay<00:00:01.920> we<00:00:02.070> have<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.340> Arduino<00:00:02.909> just<00:00:03.270> on<00:00:03.419> it

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay we have the Arduino just on it

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.250 
okay we have the Arduino just on it
rangefinder<00:00:04.259> sensor<00:00:06.020> here's<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:08.360> sketch

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
rangefinder sensor here's the sketch

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.660 
rangefinder sensor here's the sketch
we've<00:00:11.830> got<00:00:12.040> a<00:00:12.280> and<00:00:13.180> echo<00:00:13.570> pin<00:00:14.490> these<00:00:15.490> are

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
we've got a and echo pin these are

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.000 
we've got a and echo pin these are
connected<00:00:16.420> to<00:00:16.600> these<00:00:16.750> two<00:00:17.290> are<00:00:17.440> connected<00:00:17.619> to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
connected to these two are connected to

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
connected to these two are connected to
the<00:00:18.190> sensor

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.180 

we've<00:00:22.590> got

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
we've got

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.330 
we've got
they<00:00:24.880> have<00:00:25.090> all<00:00:25.270> been<00:00:25.540> set<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:26.080> vote<00:00:26.260> value<00:00:27.190> of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
they have all been set the vote value of

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.160 
they have all been set the vote value of
zero<00:00:28.110> and<00:00:29.110> the<00:00:29.680> polls-time<00:00:30.030> certain<00:00:31.030> zero<00:00:31.390> and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.170 
zero and the polls-time certain zero and

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.860 
zero and the polls-time certain zero and
we<00:00:32.290> set<00:00:32.560> in<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:33.250> init<00:00:33.550> pin<00:00:33.820> which<00:00:34.450> sends<00:00:34.810> an

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
we set in the init pin which sends an

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.220 
we set in the init pin which sends an
ultrasonic<00:00:35.290> pitch<00:00:36.010> as<00:00:37.000> an<00:00:37.210> output<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:37.870> then

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
ultrasonic pitch as an output and then

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.110 
ultrasonic pitch as an output and then
the<00:00:38.350> echo<00:00:38.560> pretty<00:00:38.830> much<00:00:38.920> listens<00:00:39.340> for<00:00:39.400> it<00:00:39.610> as

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
the echo pretty much listens for it as

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.610 
the echo pretty much listens for it as
an<00:00:40.360> input<00:00:41.190> set<00:00:42.190> on<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.370> board<00:00:42.580> rate<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:44.110> then

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
an input set on the board rate and then

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.290 
an input set on the board rate and then
within<00:00:44.800> this<00:00:44.950> loop<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:47.260> send<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.650> pitch<00:00:48.300> from

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
within this loop we send a pitch from

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.990 
within this loop we send a pitch from
the<00:00:49.450> inner<00:00:49.629> pin

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.350 

for<00:00:52.570> one<00:00:52.930> hundredth<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.440> second<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.210> they

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
for one hundredth of a second and they

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.200 
for one hundredth of a second and they
were<00:00:55.450> turning<00:00:55.780> off<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.790> echo<00:00:57.790> pin<00:00:58.030> then

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
were turning off the echo pin then

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.960 
were turning off the echo pin then
listens<00:00:58.750> for<00:00:58.810> it<00:00:59.489> divides<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:00.760> time<00:01:01.059> by<00:01:01.300> 58

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
listens for it divides that time by 58

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.610 
listens for it divides that time by 58
which<00:01:03.970> becomes<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.420> distance<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.110> distance<00:01:05.140> is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
which becomes a distance the distance is

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.440 
which becomes a distance the distance is
reported<00:01:06.190> within<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:07.260> serial<00:01:08.260> monitor<00:01:09.450> delay

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
reported within the serial monitor delay

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.820 
reported within the serial monitor delay
for<00:01:10.750> tenth<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.140> second<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.710> then<00:01:12.030> repeated

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
for tenth of a second and then repeated

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.870 
for tenth of a second and then repeated
so<00:01:14.830> if<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:15.010> show<00:01:15.250> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 

there's<00:01:18.509> an<00:01:18.659> ultrasonic<00:01:19.079> sensor<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.890> Ivan

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
there's an ultrasonic sensor that Ivan

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
there's an ultrasonic sensor that Ivan
plugged<00:01:20.430> in

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.820 

and<00:01:25.079> he's<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.680> have

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.520 

the<00:01:34.340> help<00:01:34.580> in<00:01:34.850> which<00:01:35.720> you<00:01:35.900> can<00:01:35.930> see<00:01:36.080> on<00:01:36.290> this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the help in which you can see on this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530 
the help in which you can see on this
one

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.060 

if<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.230> plug<00:01:40.440> it<00:01:40.560> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.450 

so<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.940> power

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.109 

but<00:01:50.090> in<00:01:50.270> two<00:01:50.440> pins<00:01:51.440> 2<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.190> 3<00:01:54.549> so<00:01:55.549> then<00:01:55.700> if<00:01:55.820> i<00:01:55.940> run

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
but in two pins 2 and 3 so then if i run

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:05.190 
but in two pins 2 and 3 so then if i run
this

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.270 

and<00:02:05.740> open<00:02:06.039> up<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.250> sterile

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and open up the sterile

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.590 
and open up the sterile
monitor

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.730 

my<00:02:12.050> final<00:02:12.320> move<00:02:12.380> my<00:02:12.560> hand<00:02:12.770> towards<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.610> sensor

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.680 

the<00:02:19.250> value<00:02:19.460> changes<00:02:20.090> down<00:02:20.750> if<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.560> move<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.920> away

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.680 

it<00:02:24.870> makes<00:02:25.110> up

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:41.430 

and<00:02:31.230> also<00:02:31.380> if<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.860> put<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.450> cup

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.500 

it's<00:02:42.010> reporting<00:02:42.460> a<00:02:42.520> difference<00:02:42.910> in<00:02:43.090> San<00:02:43.330> move

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
it's reporting a difference in San move

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:52.890 
it's reporting a difference in San move
the<00:02:43.720> cup<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:49.060> only<00:02:49.300> how<00:02:49.570> far<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.440> sensor
