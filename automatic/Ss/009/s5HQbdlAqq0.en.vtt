tripod<00:03:57.210> as<00:03:57.360> well<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:59.330> don't<00:04:00.330> really<00:04:00.540> know<00:04:00.750> I

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
tripod as well I don't really know I

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.990 
tripod as well I don't really know I
could<00:04:01.050> compare<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.890> it's<00:04:02.130> got<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> really

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
could compare it to it's got a really

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.310 
could compare it to it's got a really
good<00:04:03.240> weight<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.050> it's<00:04:04.200> definitely

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
good weight on it so it's definitely

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.410 
good weight on it so it's definitely
metal<00:04:04.890> underneath<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.820> feels<00:04:06.150> like<00:04:06.270> some

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
metal underneath it it feels like some

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.460 
metal underneath it it feels like some
type<00:04:06.570> of<00:04:06.600> plastic<00:04:07.140> on<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.350> outside<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:09.470> yeah

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
type of plastic on the outside so yeah

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.880 
type of plastic on the outside so yeah
as<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:10.830> as<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.280> said<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.670> first<00:04:11.850> bit<00:04:12.890> these

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
as I as I said in the first bit these

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.700 
as I as I said in the first bit these
are<00:04:14.040> going<00:04:14.280> for<00:04:14.610> roughly<00:04:15.030> around<00:04:15.240> 50<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.320> 80

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
pay for this I paid 20 pounds the reason

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.680 
pay for this I paid 20 pounds the reason
being<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:32.760> there's<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.090> tiny<00:04:33.390> bit<00:04:33.540> of

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
being is that there's a tiny bit of

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.670 
being is that there's a tiny bit of
damage<00:04:33.960> on<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.610> can<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.640> spot<00:04:36.000> where<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.330> is<00:04:36.680> no

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
damage on it can you spot where it is no

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.510 
damage on it can you spot where it is no
it's<00:04:37.830> not<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.190> green<00:04:38.400> thing

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.860 

it's<00:04:42.120> here<00:04:43.520> there's<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.580> tiny<00:04:44.910> bit<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.300> plastic

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
it's here there's a tiny bit of plastic

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.740 
it's here there's a tiny bit of plastic
that's<00:04:46.259> been<00:04:46.650> broken<00:04:47.039> off<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.310> hammer

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
that's been broken off the hammer

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.730 
that's been broken off the hammer
apparently<00:04:48.750> this<00:04:48.930> is<00:04:49.080> what<00:04:49.229> it<00:04:49.349> was<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:49.560> when

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
apparently this is what it was like when

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.400 
apparently this is what it was like when
the<00:04:49.860> seller<00:04:50.130> got<00:04:50.669> it<00:04:50.880> originally<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.599> because

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
the seller got it originally and because

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.040 
the seller got it originally and because
of<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.560> one<00:04:52.889> reason<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:54.180> many<00:04:54.240> people<00:04:54.389> pass

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
of that one reason so many people pass

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.999 
of that one reason so many people pass
this<00:04:55.259> up<00:04:56.270> 20<00:04:57.270> pounds<00:04:57.690> for<00:04:57.840> this<00:04:58.020> when<00:04:58.889> you

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
this up 20 pounds for this when you

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.370 
this up 20 pounds for this when you
consider<00:04:59.099> that<00:04:59.599> it's<00:05:00.599> going<00:05:00.930> for<00:05:01.080> twice<00:05:01.349> as

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
consider that it's going for twice as

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.710 
consider that it's going for twice as
much<00:05:01.740> as<00:05:02.009> the<00:05:02.160> game<00:05:02.400> alone<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:03.150> eBay<00:05:03.479> at<00:05:03.630> the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
much as the game alone on eBay at the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.339 
much as the game alone on eBay at the
moment<00:05:05.419> I'm<00:05:06.419> slightly<00:05:06.660> disappointed<00:05:06.870> that

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
moment I'm slightly disappointed that

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.510 
moment I'm slightly disappointed that
the<00:05:07.500> actual<00:05:07.830> trigger

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
the actual trigger

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.390 
the actual trigger
there<00:05:08.789> isn't<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:09.090> trigger<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.650> think<00:05:11.190> if<00:05:11.280> you

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
there isn't a trigger but I think if you

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.680 
there isn't a trigger but I think if you
want<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.639> so<00:05:11.759> you<00:05:11.789> could<00:05:12.030> mod<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.360> so<00:05:12.509> you<00:05:12.569> could

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
want it so you could mod it so you could

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.480 
want it so you could mod it so you could
put<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.900> little<00:05:13.050> toy<00:05:13.259> trigger<00:05:13.710> on<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.400> would

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
put a little toy trigger on that would

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.809 
put a little toy trigger on that would
be<00:05:14.610> really<00:05:14.909> fun<00:05:15.150> but<00:05:16.130> otherwise<00:05:17.130> this<00:05:17.610> is

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
be really fun but otherwise this is

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.240 
be really fun but otherwise this is
absolutely<00:05:18.419> beautiful<00:05:19.110> if<00:05:19.319> you<00:05:19.470> can<00:05:19.800> find<00:05:20.069> a
