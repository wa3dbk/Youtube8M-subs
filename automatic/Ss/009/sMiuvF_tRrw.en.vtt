00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
for those of you guys that are really

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.479 
for those of you guys that are really
really<00:00:37.559> sharp<00:00:37.890> you'll<00:00:38.100> notice<00:00:38.340> some

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
really sharp you'll notice some

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.490 
really sharp you'll notice some
differences<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.420> actual<00:00:39.809> shoe<00:00:40.079> itself

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
differences in the actual shoe itself

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.130 
differences in the actual shoe itself
versus<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> standard<00:00:41.520> pair<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.420> DZ<00:00:42.809> rose<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
versus a standard pair of a DZ rose and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.200 
versus a standard pair of a DZ rose and
that's<00:00:43.530> because<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.670> women's

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that's because this is the women's

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.889 
that's because this is the women's
variation<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> f50<00:00:46.950> adizero<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.700> 2014

pattern and when I saw this I asked

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.350 
pattern and when I saw this I asked
myself<00:01:27.509> why<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.290> why<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:29.070> adidas<00:01:29.759> put

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
myself why is that why would adidas put

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.350 
myself why is that why would adidas put
the<00:01:30.780> latest<00:01:31.110> sprint<00:01:31.409> frame<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.970> latest

the latest sprint frame on the latest
womens<00:01:33.750> adizero<00:01:34.200> simply<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.520> uppers

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
womens adizero simply because the uppers

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.520 
womens adizero simply because the uppers
exactly<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> same<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.960> rest<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.320> shoes

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
exactly the same the rest of the shoes

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.120 
exactly the same the rest of the shoes
the<00:01:37.680> same

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the same

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.620 
the same
why<00:01:38.520> wouldn't<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.850> use<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> same<00:01:39.270> sprint

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
why wouldn't they use the same sprint

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.700 
why wouldn't they use the same sprint
frame<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> did<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.439> bit<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
frame so I did a little bit of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100 
frame so I did a little bit of
Investigation<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:42.329> surprised<00:01:42.810> by<00:01:43.079> what

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
Investigation and was surprised by what

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.609 
Investigation and was surprised by what
I<00:01:43.409> found<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.939> order<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.750> figure<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.380> why

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I found now in order to figure out why

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.319 
I found now in order to figure out why
they<00:01:46.890> didn't<00:01:47.189> use<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.340> same<00:01:47.640> sprint<00:01:47.939> frame<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
they didn't use the same sprint frame I

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.770 
they didn't use the same sprint frame I
took<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> look<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> youth<00:01:49.439> f50<00:01:50.009> adizero<00:01:50.189> for

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
took a look at the youth f50 adizero for

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.539 
took a look at the youth f50 adizero for
2014<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.350> has<00:01:52.710> undergone<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.340> major

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
2014 and that has undergone some major

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
2014 and that has undergone some major
changes<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.720> actually<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
changes as well this is actually it the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.490 
changes as well this is actually it the
Youth<00:01:55.920> f50<00:01:56.549> adizero<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.899> no

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
Youth f50 adizero and as you can see no

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
Youth f50 adizero and as you can see no
sprint<00:01:58.829> frame<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.219> all<00:01:59.369> they<00:01:59.549> used<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
sprint frame at all they used to have a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.999 
sprint frame at all they used to have a
sprint<00:02:00.600> frame<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.500> what<00:02:01.770> did<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:01.950> do

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
sprint frame what what did they do

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.700 
sprint frame what what did they do
instead<00:02:02.520> they<00:02:02.939> used<00:02:03.240> basically<00:02:03.840> an<00:02:04.170> F<00:02:04.350> 30

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
instead they used basically an F 30

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.069 
instead they used basically an F 30
bottom<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:06.119> quality<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.719> shoe<00:02:06.930> in

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
bottom and the quality of this shoe in

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
bottom and the quality of this shoe in
my<00:02:07.229> opinion<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.829> not<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.610> good<00:02:08.789> at<00:02:08.910> all

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
my opinion is just not very good at all

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
my opinion is just not very good at all
again<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.720> essentially<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> equivalent<00:02:10.530> of

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
again it's essentially the equivalent of

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.000 
again it's essentially the equivalent of
an<00:02:11.099> adidas<00:02:11.430> F<00:02:11.580> 30<00:02:11.900> with

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
an adidas F 30 with

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.710 
an adidas F 30 with
the<00:02:13.099> higher-quality<00:02:13.569> hybrid<00:02:14.569> touch

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
the higher-quality hybrid touch

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.300 
the higher-quality hybrid touch
synthetic<00:02:15.319> upper<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.799> for<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.040> most<00:02:16.189> part

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
synthetic upper so for the most part

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.220 
synthetic upper so for the most part
what<00:02:17.000> you're<00:02:17.120> getting<00:02:17.420> here<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:17.659> a<00:02:17.840> glorified

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
what you're getting here is a glorified

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.949 
what you're getting here is a glorified
F<00:02:18.739> 30<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.159> better<00:02:19.430> quality<00:02:19.760> F<00:02:20.150> 30<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.659> you<00:02:20.780> will

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
F 30 a better quality F 30 if you will

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.380 
F 30 a better quality F 30 if you will
it<00:02:21.769> does<00:02:21.920> have<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.280> new<00:02:22.430> stud<00:02:22.670> pattern<00:02:22.819> but

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it does have that new stud pattern but

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.240 
it does have that new stud pattern but
of<00:02:23.480> course<00:02:23.720> no<00:02:23.930> sprint<00:02:24.230> frame<00:02:24.470> meaning<00:02:25.010> that

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
of course no sprint frame meaning that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.619 
of course no sprint frame meaning that
it's<00:02:25.400> not<00:02:25.519> very<00:02:25.760> lightweight<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.450> not

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
it's not very lightweight it's not

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.929 
it's not very lightweight it's not
particularly<00:02:27.379> flexible<00:02:28.189> and<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.730> kind<00:02:28.909> of

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
particularly flexible and it kind of

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.699 
particularly flexible and it kind of
defeats<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.360> purpose<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.079> whole<00:02:30.200> IDC<00:02:30.650> row

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
defeats the purpose of the whole IDC row

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.710 
defeats the purpose of the whole IDC row
concept<00:02:31.280> simply<00:02:31.519> because<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:32.239> doesn't<00:02:32.599> have

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
concept simply because it doesn't have

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.839 
concept simply because it doesn't have
that<00:02:32.750> ultra<00:02:33.349> lightweight<00:02:33.560> construction<00:02:34.010> so

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
that ultra lightweight construction so

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.550 
that ultra lightweight construction so
then<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.030> thought<00:02:35.299> why<00:02:35.870> wouldn't<00:02:36.170> they<00:02:36.290> put<00:02:36.530> a

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
then I thought why wouldn't they put a

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.069 
then I thought why wouldn't they put a
new<00:02:36.890> sprint<00:02:37.220> frame<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.909> adizero<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.810> why

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
new sprint frame on this adizero and why

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.360 
new sprint frame on this adizero and why
wouldn't<00:02:39.349> they<00:02:39.409> put<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> new<00:02:39.769> sprint<00:02:39.980> frame<00:02:40.190> on

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
wouldn't they put a new sprint frame on

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.910 
wouldn't they put a new sprint frame on
that<00:02:40.400> adizero<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.690> then<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.959> came<00:02:42.109> to<00:02:42.319> me<00:02:42.349> they

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
that adizero and then it came to me they

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.740 
that adizero and then it came to me they
only<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.519> on<00:02:43.609> the<00:02:43.730> men's<00:02:43.909> sizes<00:02:44.420> because

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
only have it on the men's sizes because

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.599 
only have it on the men's sizes because
that's<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.079> only<00:02:45.260> tools<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:46.099> they<00:02:46.220> made<00:02:46.430> to

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
that's the only tools that they made to

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.640 
that's the only tools that they made to
actually<00:02:47.000> mass-produce<00:02:47.450> these<00:02:47.810> things<00:02:48.109> you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
actually mass-produce these things you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.920 
actually mass-produce these things you
have<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.890> think<00:02:49.129> of<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.609> sprint<00:02:50.209> frame<00:02:50.510> or<00:02:50.750> this

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
have to think of a sprint frame or this

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.899 
have to think of a sprint frame or this
piece<00:02:51.200> as<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> mold<00:02:52.310> they<00:02:52.489> have<00:02:52.639> to<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:52.879> a

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
piece as a mold they have to have a

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.210 
piece as a mold they have to have a
machine<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.629> build<00:02:53.750> these<00:02:53.959> multiple<00:02:54.769> machines

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
machine to build these multiple machines

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.280 
machine to build these multiple machines
left<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:55.790> right<00:02:56.000> for<00:02:56.329> every<00:02:56.720> single<00:02:56.959> size

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
left and right for every single size

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.960 
left and right for every single size
like<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.069> said<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.370> order<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.730> mass-produce

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
like I said in order to mass-produce

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.240 
like I said in order to mass-produce
these<00:02:59.569> things<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.170> simply<00:03:00.680> because<00:03:00.950> they're

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
these things and simply because they're

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
these things and simply because they're
only<00:03:01.489> doing<00:03:01.730> men's<00:03:01.970> sizes<00:03:02.239> they<00:03:02.930> decide<00:03:03.230> that

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
only doing men's sizes they decide that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.470 
only doing men's sizes they decide that
it's<00:03:03.739> probably<00:03:04.040> not<00:03:04.190> worth<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.579> for<00:03:04.639> them<00:03:04.849> to

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
it's probably not worth it for them to

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.229 
it's probably not worth it for them to
retool<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.560> smaller<00:03:06.889> sizes<00:03:07.280> for<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.849> women's

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
retool the smaller sizes for the women's

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.539 
retool the smaller sizes for the women's
colorways<00:03:08.750> as<00:03:09.049> well<00:03:09.319> as<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.739> youth<00:03:09.980> colorways

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
colorways as well as the youth colorways

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.140 
colorways as well as the youth colorways
so<00:03:11.060> instead<00:03:11.420> they<00:03:11.930> just<00:03:12.170> decided<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.739> go<00:03:13.519> for<00:03:13.549> a

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
so instead they just decided to go for a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.180 
so instead they just decided to go for a
standard<00:03:15.019> sprint<00:03:15.530> frame<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.950> one<00:03:16.069> they

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
standard sprint frame the one they

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.069 
standard sprint frame the one they
already<00:03:16.459> had<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.819> tools<00:03:17.030> for<00:03:17.389> because<00:03:17.900> if<00:03:17.989> you

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
already had the tools for because if you

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.550 
already had the tools for because if you
look<00:03:18.260> at<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.590> older<00:03:19.040> version<00:03:19.549> of<00:03:19.699> the<00:03:20.560> youth

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
look at the older version of the youth

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.309 
look at the older version of the youth
f50<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.400> had<00:03:22.639> a<00:03:22.669> sprint<00:03:23.030> frame<00:03:23.299> exactly<00:03:23.750> like

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
f50 it had a sprint frame exactly like

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.420 
f50 it had a sprint frame exactly like
what<00:03:24.470> you're<00:03:24.590> gonna<00:03:24.680> find<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.340> was

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
what you're gonna find here it was

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.390 
what you're gonna find here it was
essentially<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.940> shrunk<00:03:26.269> down<00:03:26.449> version<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:27.139> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
essentially a shrunk down version of the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.619 
essentially a shrunk down version of the
standard<00:03:28.400> men's<00:03:28.879> adizero

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
standard men's adizero

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.599 
standard men's adizero
so<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.470> really<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.769> explanation<00:03:31.430> as<00:03:31.579> to

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
so that is really the explanation as to

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.180 
so that is really the explanation as to
why<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:32.780> particular<00:03:33.049> adizero<00:03:33.739> does<00:03:33.980> not

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
why this particular adizero does not

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.939 
why this particular adizero does not
have<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.639> new<00:03:34.790> sprint<00:03:35.090> frame<00:03:35.359> as<00:03:36.319> opposed<00:03:36.769> to

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
have the new sprint frame as opposed to

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.319 
have the new sprint frame as opposed to
the<00:03:37.040> older<00:03:37.340> women's<00:03:37.639> ones<00:03:37.849> which<00:03:38.000> obviously

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
the older women's ones which obviously

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.659 
the older women's ones which obviously
had<00:03:38.599> the<00:03:38.720> current<00:03:38.989> one<00:03:39.230> adidas<00:03:39.829> simply<00:03:40.310> didn't

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
had the current one adidas simply didn't

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.180 
had the current one adidas simply didn't
want<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.060> build<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.900> machines<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.620> actually

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
want to build the machines to actually

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.770 
want to build the machines to actually
mass-produce<00:03:43.639> of<00:03:43.970> things<00:03:44.150> with<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.629> new

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
mass-produce of things with the new

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.240 
mass-produce of things with the new
sprint<00:03:45.079> frames<00:03:45.349> they<00:03:45.500> don't<00:03:45.680> have<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:46.040> tool

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
sprint frames they don't have the tool

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.659 
sprint frames they don't have the tool
to<00:03:47.239> actually<00:03:47.449> make<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.590> sprint<00:03:48.859> frame<00:03:49.129> in<00:03:49.400> a

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
to actually make this sprint frame in a

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.430 
to actually make this sprint frame in a
smaller<00:03:49.970> size<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:50.359> that<00:03:50.599> is<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.079> reasoning

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
smaller size so that is the reasoning

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.170 
smaller size so that is the reasoning
that<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.620> came<00:03:51.769> up<00:03:52.010> with<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.609> thought<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.090> was

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
that I came up with I thought it was

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.909 
that I came up with I thought it was
kind<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.629> an<00:03:53.750> interesting<00:03:54.079> thing<00:03:54.620> and

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
kind of an interesting thing and

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.849 
kind of an interesting thing and
obviously<00:03:55.459> adidas<00:03:55.819> isn't<00:03:56.209> really

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
obviously adidas isn't really

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.899 
obviously adidas isn't really
concentrating<00:03:57.859> too<00:03:57.980> hard<00:03:58.220> on<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.549> actual

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
concentrating too hard on the actual

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.369 
concentrating too hard on the actual
performance<00:03:59.090> characteristics<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:00.260> their

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
performance characteristics of their

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.349 
performance characteristics of their
women's<00:04:00.769> line<00:04:00.949> as<00:04:01.190> well<00:04:01.400> as<00:04:01.639> their<00:04:01.879> youth<00:04:02.090> line

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
women's line as well as their youth line

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.140 
women's line as well as their youth line
it's<00:04:02.900> something<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.409> they<00:04:03.760> obviously<00:04:04.760> don't

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
it's something that they obviously don't

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.030 
it's something that they obviously don't
seem<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.569> care<00:04:05.840> as<00:04:06.049> much<00:04:06.079> about<00:04:06.560> as<00:04:06.739> far<00:04:06.919> as

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
seem to care as much about as far as

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.770 
seem to care as much about as far as
updates<00:04:07.459> go<00:04:07.699> nonetheless<00:04:08.239> you're<00:04:08.629> still

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
updates go nonetheless you're still

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.089 
updates go nonetheless you're still
getting<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:09.079> high<00:04:09.199> quality<00:04:09.229> shoe<00:04:09.799> year<00:04:09.979> and<00:04:10.069> I

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
getting a high quality shoe year and I

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.469 
getting a high quality shoe year and I
thought<00:04:10.220> this<00:04:10.370> was<00:04:10.489> an<00:04:10.639> interesting<00:04:10.879> option

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:11.479 
thought this was an interesting option

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.149 
thought this was an interesting option
to<00:04:11.569> show<00:04:11.780> especially<00:04:12.290> for<00:04:12.680> people<00:04:12.979> who

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
to show especially for people who

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.699 
to show especially for people who
perhaps<00:04:13.970> like<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.540> new<00:04:14.690> adizero<00:04:15.139> design<00:04:15.530> and

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
perhaps like the new adizero design and

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.050 
perhaps like the new adizero design and
the<00:04:15.769> upper<00:04:16.039> is<00:04:16.070> much<00:04:16.459> better<00:04:16.729> than<00:04:16.940> the

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
the upper is much better than the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.089 
the upper is much better than the
previous<00:04:17.419> model<00:04:17.780> in<00:04:17.870> my<00:04:18.019> opinion<00:04:18.049> but<00:04:18.919> maybe

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
previous model in my opinion but maybe

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.800 
previous model in my opinion but maybe
you<00:04:19.280> like<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.549> older<00:04:20.030> stud<00:04:20.269> pattern<00:04:20.479> maybe

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
you like the older stud pattern maybe

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.180 
you like the older stud pattern maybe
you<00:04:20.959> like<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.260> older<00:04:21.530> spring<00:04:21.769> frame<00:04:21.979> a<00:04:22.010> little

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
you like the older spring frame a little

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.310 
you like the older spring frame a little
bit<00:04:22.400> better<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:23.120> women's<00:04:23.599> f50<00:04:24.139> adizero

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
bit better this women's f50 adizero

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.770 
bit better this women's f50 adizero
would<00:04:24.830> definitely<00:04:25.219> be<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.370> very<00:04:25.610> solid<00:04:25.849> option

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
would definitely be a very solid option

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.910 
would definitely be a very solid option
I<00:04:26.810> think<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.050> colorway<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.560> pretty<00:04:27.770> good

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
I think the colorway is pretty good

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.890 
I think the colorway is pretty good
looking<00:04:28.070> again<00:04:28.490> it's<00:04:28.639> Samba<00:04:29.000> blue<00:04:29.210> with<00:04:29.720> what

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
looking again it's Samba blue with what

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.110 
looking again it's Samba blue with what
they<00:04:30.020> call<00:04:30.260> glow<00:04:31.100> orange<00:04:31.550> it's<00:04:31.760> kind<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.000> an

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
they call glow orange it's kind of an

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.610 
they call glow orange it's kind of an
interesting<00:04:32.360> shade<00:04:32.810> of<00:04:32.960> orange<00:04:33.050> almost<00:04:33.500> like

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
interesting shade of orange almost like

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.170 
interesting shade of orange almost like
a<00:04:33.710> peach<00:04:33.920> color<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.700> then<00:04:34.790> you<00:04:34.850> have<00:04:35.000> this

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
a peach color and then you have this

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.600 
a peach color and then you have this
very<00:04:35.480> kind<00:04:35.840> of<00:04:35.990> subtle<00:04:36.350> purple<00:04:36.770> accent<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.400> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
very kind of subtle purple accent in the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.060 
very kind of subtle purple accent in the
kind<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.270> outline<00:04:38.720> there<00:04:38.960> of<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.410> adidas

kind of outline there of the adidas

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
stripes you haven't that 50 logo there

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.680

goes there are some other differences

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.879 
goes there are some other differences
apart<00:04:53.389> from<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.750> Sprint<00:04:54.020> frame<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:54.710> one

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
apart from the Sprint frame the one

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.350 
apart from the Sprint frame the one
thing<00:04:55.130> is<00:04:55.310> of<00:04:55.550> course<00:04:55.760> they<00:04:55.910> don't<00:04:56.000> come<00:04:56.240> with

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
thing is of course they don't come with

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.150 
thing is of course they don't come with
extra<00:04:56.540> insoles<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.290> insoles<00:04:57.620> are<00:04:57.800> still

extra insoles the insoles are still

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.040 
extra insoles the insoles are still
removable<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:59.150> what<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.419> get<00:04:59.570> is<00:04:59.690> actually<00:04:59.840> a

this is just a very small size it's a
women<00:07:11.120> size<00:07:11.360> 7<00:07:11.840> they<00:07:12.050> don't<00:07:12.230> fit<00:07:12.440> me<00:07:12.470> and<00:07:12.800> to

can see so it really wouldn't even make

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.720 
can see so it really wouldn't even make
much<00:07:18.290> sense<00:07:18.500> better<00:07:19.220> than<00:07:19.370> that<00:07:19.430> if<00:07:19.550> you<00:07:19.610> have

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
much sense better than that if you have

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.340
