take<00:01:46.350> them<00:01:46.590> down<00:01:46.770> always<00:01:47.310> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:47.820> sure

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
take them down always want to make sure

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.249

your<00:01:48.060> hair<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.299> completely<00:01:48.450> dry<00:01:48.780> before<00:01:49.170> you

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
your hair is completely dry before you

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
your hair is completely dry before you
take<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.439> down<00:01:49.680> otherwise<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> get

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
take it down otherwise it's going to get

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.819 
take it down otherwise it's going to get
frizzy<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.540> two<00:01:52.079> seconds<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> whole

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
frizzy in two seconds and the whole

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.389 
frizzy in two seconds and the whole
process<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.570> worth<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.530> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
process is not going to be worth it so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.420 
process is not going to be worth it so
yeah<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.689> take<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.829> down<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
yeah so I'm going to take them down and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
yeah so I'm going to take them down and
separate<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.049> hair<00:02:01.200> is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
separate them and you can see my hair is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
separate them and you can see my hair is
pretty<00:02:01.500> defined<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.520> liked<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.420> little<00:02:03.509> bit

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
pretty defined but I liked a little bit

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.920 
pretty defined but I liked a little bit
more<00:02:03.750> definition<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.829> definitely<00:02:05.659> if<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.810> were

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
more definition so definitely if I were

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.250 
more definition so definitely if I were
to<00:02:07.020> change<00:02:07.229> anything<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:08.039> would<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> trim

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
to change anything I would a have a trim

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.610 
to change anything I would a have a trim
and<00:02:12.190> be<00:02:12.400> use<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> little<00:02:12.970> bit<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.209> gel<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:14.470> it's

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
and be use a little bit of gel but it's

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.710 
and be use a little bit of gel but it's
still<00:02:14.830> shiny<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.269> means<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.599> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
still shiny so that means that the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.440 
still shiny so that means that the
product<00:02:17.310> did<00:02:18.310> work<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.879> there<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.180> some

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
product did work and there is some

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.059 
product did work and there is some
definition<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.260> that's<00:02:20.500> good<00:02:20.709> that's<00:02:20.920> what

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
definition so that's good that's what
