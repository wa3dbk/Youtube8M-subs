 the same after that you get the quest of 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.460
 does not bother nor will 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.840
 sent back and then you have 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.340
 different actually 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.809
 different quest that is what 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.809
 which then exclude each other 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.579
 if one chooses the brewery finds 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:17.350
 then you have the possibility 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.640
 Here was yet quieter then one has the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.759
 possibility here the dwarf before the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.049

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.039
 the trading post have come 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.039
 probably then something else 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.969
 So do not be surprised if this quest yes 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.390
 simply means different and you the same thing 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.390
