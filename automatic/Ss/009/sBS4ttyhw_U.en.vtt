00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
cages up covered in the walls when you

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.410 
cages up covered in the walls when you
come<00:00:26.369> down<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.060> where<00:00:27.240> you'll

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

notice<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.990> biggest<00:00:28.380> change<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.640> go

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
notice the biggest change so as we go

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.250 
notice the biggest change so as we go
down<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> escalator<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
down the escalator as you know on the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
down the escalator as you know on the
map<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.710> orange<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.340> blue<00:00:32.489> underlined

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
map it's orange with a blue underlined

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.729 
map it's orange with a blue underlined
so<00:00:33.300> we've<00:00:33.510> retains<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> orange<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so we've retains it the orange with the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.520 
so we've retains it the orange with the
blue<00:00:34.890> underlined<00:00:35.780> just<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> we've

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
blue underlined just like this we've

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
blue underlined just like this we've
added<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.980> some<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> extra<00:00:38.760> lifts<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
added in some of the extra lifts I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.889 
added in some of the extra lifts I
missed<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.050> whole<00:00:40.260> layer<00:00:40.530> which<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
missed out that whole layer which is the

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.840 
missed out that whole layer which is the
used<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> glitch<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.129> we've<00:00:44.489> added<00:00:44.640> this

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
used to be a glitch so we've added this

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.840 
used to be a glitch so we've added this
fit<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.270> fits<00:00:45.480> being<00:00:45.690> orange<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.430> blue<00:00:47.430> we

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
fit this fits being orange and blue we

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.400 
fit this fits being orange and blue we
head<00:00:48.210> around<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> corner<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.079> there's<00:00:49.260> been

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
head around the corner and there's been

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.930 
head around the corner and there's been
a<00:00:49.440> lot<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> work<00:00:49.890> above<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.399> which<00:00:50.640> I'll<00:00:50.789> show

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
a lot of work above this which I'll show

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
a lot of work above this which I'll show
you<00:00:50.969> towards<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> end<00:00:51.770> that's<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.949> sushi<00:00:53.250> bar

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you towards the end that's the sushi bar

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400 
you towards the end that's the sushi bar
you<00:00:53.670> should<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:53.969> maybe<00:00:54.449> recognize<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.199> now

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you should all maybe recognize that now

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.110 
you should all maybe recognize that now
but<00:00:55.949> here's<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> big<00:00:56.489> change<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> haven't

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
but here's the big change I haven't

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
but here's the big change I haven't
built<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> wrap<00:00:57.539> yet<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.050> we'll<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.559> fly<00:00:58.949> down

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
built a wrap yet so we'll just fly down

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.939 
built a wrap yet so we'll just fly down
and<00:00:59.660> this<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.140> where<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> box<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and this is it this is where the box is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
and this is it this is where the box is
when<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.309> start<00:01:02.640> across<00:01:03.539> there

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
when you start across there

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.289 
when you start across there
it'll<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:04.920> modified<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.640> everything's

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it'll get modified so everything's

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.730 
it'll get modified so everything's
upside-down<00:01:06.630> over<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.409> we've<00:01:07.560> added

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
upside-down over here so we've added

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
upside-down over here so we've added
some<00:01:07.950> stuff<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> ceiling<00:01:09.049> add<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> ramp

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
some stuff to the ceiling add a ramp

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
some stuff to the ceiling add a ramp
here<00:01:10.590> come<00:01:11.189> over<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.909> top<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
here come over and that's the top of the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.390 
here come over and that's the top of the
lift<00:01:12.570> shaft<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.080> lot<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.799> lift<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.159> been

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
lift shaft a lot of the lift has been

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.969 
lift shaft a lot of the lift has been
built<00:01:14.670> we'll<00:01:15.479> head<00:01:15.630> around<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.830> big

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
built we'll head around and that's a big

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
built we'll head around and that's a big
kitchen<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.939> real<00:01:18.090> map<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> kitchen

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
kitchen on the real map it is a kitchen

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.870 
kitchen on the real map it is a kitchen
anyway<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> hole<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> floor

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
anyway and that's the hole in the floor

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
anyway and that's the hole in the floor
which<00:01:20.970> heads<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.330> down<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.979> head<00:01:22.979> around

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
which heads you down and head around

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
which heads you down and head around
here<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.610> I'll<00:01:23.700> show<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.119> backwards

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
here and I'll show you this backwards

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.109 
here and I'll show you this backwards
being<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> bit<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.860> head<00:01:26.520> around<00:01:26.700> them<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
being a bit I head around them out the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
being a bit I head around them out the
wrong<00:01:27.299> direction<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.990> we'll<00:01:28.829> head<00:01:28.979> around

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
wrong direction so we'll head around

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.300 
wrong direction so we'll head around
here<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.759> where<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.420> drop<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
here this is where you can drop down and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.890 
here this is where you can drop down and
head<00:01:32.310> towards<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> lift<00:01:33.030> shaft<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.659> drop

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
head towards the lift shaft so you drop

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
head towards the lift shaft so you drop
down<00:01:34.110> once<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> drop<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:35.430> again<00:01:35.850> head

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
down once then you drop down again head

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.640 
down once then you drop down again head
the<00:01:36.119> other<00:01:36.210> way<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.229> haven't<00:01:37.439> done<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the other way and I haven't done the
