oh<00:03:47.810> boy<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.230> expect<00:03:48.590> no<00:03:49.099> not<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.549> they

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
oh boy and expect no not that they

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.160 
oh boy and expect no not that they
wouldn't<00:03:49.819> expect<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.360> tomato<00:03:50.660> boughs<00:03:50.900> whole

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
wouldn't expect the tomato boughs whole

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.319 
wouldn't expect the tomato boughs whole
thing<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.500> pretty<00:03:51.709> well<00:03:51.920> known<00:03:52.099> yeah<00:03:52.340> but<00:03:53.120> we

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
thing is pretty well known yeah but we

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.449 
thing is pretty well known yeah but we
tend<00:03:53.659> to<00:03:53.750> group<00:03:54.170> for<00:03:55.010> instance<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.370> the

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
tend to group for instance in the

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.640 
tend to group for instance in the
greenhouses<00:03:55.940> we<00:03:56.299> bring<00:03:56.510> in<00:03:56.629> sweet<00:03:56.930> peas<00:03:57.140> so

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
greenhouses we bring in sweet peas so

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.940 
greenhouses we bring in sweet peas so
that<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.129> bees<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.640> pollinators<00:03:59.269> come<00:03:59.480> and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
that the bees the pollinators come and

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.690 
that the bees the pollinators come and
then<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.040> know<00:04:01.129> it's<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.430> type<00:04:01.670> of

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
then you know it's that type of

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.059 
then you know it's that type of
mindfulness<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.810> really<00:04:03.290> integrating<00:04:03.829> things

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
mindfulness of really integrating things

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.559 
mindfulness of really integrating things
that<00:04:04.220> work<00:04:04.370> together<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.970> then<00:04:05.090> doing<00:04:05.299> the

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
that work together and then doing the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.270 
that work together and then doing the
appropriate<00:04:05.810> rotation<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.709> beds<00:04:06.890> the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
appropriate rotation of the beds the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.030 
appropriate rotation of the beds the
thing<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.060> we<00:04:08.870> grow<00:04:09.079> for<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.349> whole<00:04:09.530> year<00:04:09.709> long

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
thing is we grow for the whole year long

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.569 
thing is we grow for the whole year long
so<00:04:10.340> it's<00:04:10.879> all<00:04:11.120> fun<00:04:14.980> but<00:04:15.980> when<00:04:16.160> we<00:04:16.280> need<00:04:16.430> the

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
so it's all fun but when we need the

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.539 
so it's all fun but when we need the
cabbage<00:04:17.030> for<00:04:17.329> doing<00:04:17.570> sauerkraut<00:04:18.169> we<00:04:18.799> need<00:04:19.010> the

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
cabbage for doing sauerkraut we need the

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.789 
cabbage for doing sauerkraut we need the
beets<00:04:19.789> to<00:04:20.239> do<00:04:20.389> also<00:04:20.989> different<00:04:21.410> types<00:04:21.590> of

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
beets to do also different types of

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.340 
beets to do also different types of
fermented<00:04:22.580> products<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.510> then<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:23.780> need<00:04:24.110> the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
fermented products and then we need the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.279 
fermented products and then we need the
kale<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:25.039> cabbage<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.850> broccoli<00:04:26.660> all<00:04:27.050> the
