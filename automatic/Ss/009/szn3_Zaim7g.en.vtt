job just because these are big and bulky
and<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.920> might<00:00:41.070> take<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.340> extra<00:00:41.579> set<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> hands

to help you manipulate it and fit it in
place<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.420> important<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
place and I think it's important to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
place and I think it's important to
point<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.309> doesn't<00:00:47.550> matter<00:00:47.850> where

welding<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.630> plug<00:02:24.870> welding<00:02:25.230> process

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
welding the plug welding process

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.729 
welding the plug welding process
involves<00:02:26.730> punching<00:02:27.000> holes<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> panel<00:02:28.110> so

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
involves punching holes in a panel so

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.400 
involves punching holes in a panel so
you<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:29.010> overlay<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.790> over<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> car<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.930> then

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
you can overlay it over the car and then

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.130 
you can overlay it over the car and then
use<00:02:31.830> your<00:02:32.010> welder<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.970> fill<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.569> hole<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
use your welder to fill the hole and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.170 
use your welder to fill the hole and
this<00:02:34.440> will<00:02:34.860> allow<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> one<00:02:35.489> panel<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.880> stick

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
this will allow the one panel to stick

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.420 
this will allow the one panel to stick
to<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> other<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.930> once<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.739> welded<00:02:38.190> up<00:02:38.280> all

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
to the other and once you welded up all

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.340 
to the other and once you welded up all
the<00:02:38.550> holes<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.540> got<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.780> go<00:02:39.870> back<00:02:40.019> into<00:02:40.260> a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
the holes you got to go back into a

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.770 
the holes you got to go back into a
little<00:02:40.470> bit<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.709> cleanup<00:02:41.010> grinding<00:02:41.610> but<00:02:42.300> this

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
little bit of cleanup grinding but this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.590 
little bit of cleanup grinding but this
kind<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.830> closely<00:02:44.100> replicates<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.120> factory

that we use in the shop and we used it

that we use in the shop and we used it
on<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.780> variety<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.260> different<00:03:28.470> places<00:03:28.829> on<00:03:29.160> this
