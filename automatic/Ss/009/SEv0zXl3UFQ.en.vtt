00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 a new news for the entire field of 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.420
 science and also that it benefits us 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.269
 we 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.390
 Well before starting many of 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.360
 the comments of the people are 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.120
 we can find another planet in another 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.700
 galaxy to millions of light years and not 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.670
 we can find a lost plane if already 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.369
 they know for all the scandal of the nh 370 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.450
 that's what all the others think 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.550
 people besides we can not care 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.340
 our planet and now we are going to destroy 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.160
 another good because that's all 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.420
 Other diverse comments like what good 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.020
 advancement of science 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.300
 it turns out that the kepler telescope has 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.699
 made a new planet with possibility 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 to be habitable or also that there 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.050
 Still life can not be confirmed 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.289
 exactly for sure since this 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.539
 planet is 500 million light years 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.269
 imagine what that is they will have to 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.940
 spend so many very many 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.090
 generations so that we can see it the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.990
 planet was christened the kepler 18 6 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.430
 efe honor the telescope as well as 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.250
 according to the signals 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.350
 they sent to the kepler telescope this 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.750
 planet would have a moderate surface 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.840
 for water and life and where there is water 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.780
 liquid may have seen the statement 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.180
 of this interesting and spectacular 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.610
 the nasa gave it and they said 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.070
 that it is very difficult to actually detect 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.869
 and confirm put these planets 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.000
 of the size of the earth is a 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.960
 unique discovery and now that they 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.990
 they have found it 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.700
 they want to find even more and that's 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.930
 what they are going to do so they are 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.380
 embarking therefore on this task 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.180
 also and have the speculations here 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.730
 a photograph was leaked throughout the network 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.710
 of a simulated comparison of a 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.320
 sunset on the planet that employ 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.300
 with 10 on the new planet because the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.680
 sun its star seems to be darker 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 but a little bigger now and clear 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.369
 that we would like to know what 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.679
 they think of this new finding of the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.390
 science of which part is one of those who 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.650
 they say we can not take care of our 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.660
 planet and we are going to invade another or 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.000
 definitely a breakthrough for the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.400
 science do not forget your comments more
