his<00:01:20.189> iPad<00:01:20.340> instantly<00:01:21.299> actually<00:01:22.020> we're<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
his iPad instantly actually we're in the

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:23.660 
his iPad instantly actually we're in the
process<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.770> putting<00:01:22.920> together<00:01:23.100> an<00:01:23.369> e-book

which<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> possible<00:01:24.450> because<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.960> all

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
which is possible because we have all

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840 
which is possible because we have all
these<00:01:25.320> multimedia<00:01:26.009> capabilities<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.789> the

classrooms so one of the great things I
find<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.579> an<00:01:29.729> interactive<00:01:30.149> classroom<00:01:30.840> which

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
find in an interactive classroom which

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.459 
find in an interactive classroom which
this<00:01:31.499> architecture<00:01:32.429> allows<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.450> Stokes<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
this architecture allows and Stokes is

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.289 
this architecture allows and Stokes is
the<00:01:34.710> fact<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.039> they'll<00:01:35.249> say<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:36.270> know

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the fact that they'll say to me you know

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.679 
the fact that they'll say to me you know
it's<00:01:37.289> really<00:01:37.499> great<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.909> talked<00:01:39.149> about<00:01:39.329> what

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it's really great we talked about what

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.090 
it's really great we talked about what
we<00:01:39.719> talked<00:01:40.020> about<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.350> class<00:01:40.380> when<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.859> see

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
we talked about in class when we see

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.919 
we talked about in class when we see
each<00:01:41.219> other<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.609> places<00:01:41.999> we<00:01:42.119> never<00:01:42.359> expected

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
each other in places we never expected

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.169 
each other in places we never expected
to<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.649> each<00:01:43.770> other<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.700> hope<00:01:44.909> that's

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
to see each other and I hope that's

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.190 
to see each other and I hope that's
really<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.630> happens<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
really what happens that the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.849 
really what happens that the
conversations<00:01:46.890> move<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.880> Stokes<00:01:48.859> onto

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
conversations move out of Stokes onto

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.559 
conversations move out of Stokes onto
the<00:01:49.979> campus<00:01:50.429> and<00:01:50.579> eventually<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.299> into

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
the campus and eventually right into

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.480 
the campus and eventually right into
their<00:01:51.719> lives<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.280> current

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
their lives I think the current

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.279 
their lives I think the current
