scratches long as you don't get any dust
between<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:23.160> case<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:23.940> of<00:01:24.090> your

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180

ipod i can't see this scratching at all

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.270 
ipod i can't see this scratching at all
now<00:01:26.970> fitting<00:01:27.569> the<00:01:27.750> ipod<00:01:28.410> is<00:01:28.590> easy<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
now fitting the ipod is easy this is a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.029 
now fitting the ipod is easy this is a
4th<00:01:29.550> gen<00:01:29.819> ipod<00:01:30.630> touch<00:01:30.869> pop<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.649> into<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.920> back

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
4th gen ipod touch pop it into the back

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.999 
4th gen ipod touch pop it into the back
section<00:01:32.420> get<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.630> front<00:01:34.080> part<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.800> case

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
section get the front part of the case

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
section get the front part of the case
like<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.959> just<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.259> matter<00:01:37.289> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
like so and then it's just a matter of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.460 
like so and then it's just a matter of
clipping<00:01:38.399> it<00:01:38.550> round<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.810> give<00:01:39.990> me<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> push

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
clipping it round and give me a push

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.070 
clipping it round and give me a push
around<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> edges<00:01:41.720> it'll<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.810> tricky

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
around all the edges it'll be tricky

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.999 
around all the edges it'll be tricky
actually<00:01:44.030> but<00:01:45.030> i'm<00:01:45.090> sure<00:01:45.539> once<00:01:46.410> I<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.830> these

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
actually but i'm sure once I get these

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.690 
actually but i'm sure once I get these
bottom<00:01:47.520> sections<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:52.830> will<00:01:53.039> be<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.520> place

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
bottom sections in it will be in place

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.960 
bottom sections in it will be in place
try<00:01:56.700> again<00:01:57.890> now<00:01:58.890> normally<00:01:59.099> I<00:01:59.580> would<00:01:59.819> edit

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
try again now normally I would edit

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.540 
try again now normally I would edit
these<00:02:00.209> bits<00:02:00.479> out<00:02:00.660> but<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.440> think<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.399> bit

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
these bits out but I think that's a bit

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.580 
these bits out but I think that's a bit
of<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> naughty<00:02:02.970> thing<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.539> so<00:02:03.869> let's<00:02:04.319> just

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
of a naughty thing to do so let's just

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.749 
of a naughty thing to do so let's just
keep<00:02:04.800> trying<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.720> here<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.709> almost<00:02:08.490> there

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
keep trying and here we go almost there

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.160 
keep trying and here we go almost there
so<00:02:09.479> let's<00:02:09.630> go<00:02:09.840> round<00:02:10.170> quite<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> few<00:02:11.220> times<00:02:12.170> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so let's go round quite a few times it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.620 
so let's go round quite a few times it
doesn't<00:02:13.530> seem<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.099> want<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.310> clip<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.970> these

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
doesn't seem to want to clip on these

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.260 
doesn't seem to want to clip on these
edges<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:16.349> star<00:02:16.620> game<00:02:16.860> let's<00:02:17.849> just<00:02:18.000> have

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
edges so it's star game let's just have

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.350 
edges so it's star game let's just have
a<00:02:18.300> closer<00:02:18.810> look<00:02:19.140> at<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.380> case<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.730> looks<00:02:21.000> like

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
a closer look at this case it looks like

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.910 
a closer look at this case it looks like
we<00:02:21.870> should<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.230> started<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:23.010> edge<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
we should have started on this edge and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.520 
we should have started on this edge and
put<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.069> hedge<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.489> first<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.540> then<00:02:28.230> held

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
put this hedge in first and then held

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.000 
put this hedge in first and then held
that<00:02:28.709> tight<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.970> then<00:02:30.150> clicked<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
that tight and then clicked it on to the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.550 
that tight and then clicked it on to the
opposing<00:02:32.580> edge

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.140 

all<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.740> keeps<00:02:36.980> happening<00:02:37.190> there<00:02:37.910> we<00:02:38.030> go

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
all the keeps happening there we go

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.230 
all the keeps happening there we go
that's<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.690> top<00:02:38.990> edge<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.700> that's<00:02:40.940> that

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
that's the top edge in and that's that

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.230 
that's the top edge in and that's that
side<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.020> that's<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.190> nail<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:44.030> yeah<00:02:44.209> a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
side in and that's in nail so yeah a

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.300 
side in and that's in nail so yeah a
little<00:02:44.569> bit<00:02:44.630> tricky<00:02:45.050> just<00:02:45.500> go<00:02:45.650> for<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:46.100> edge

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
little bit tricky just go for one edge

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.340 
little bit tricky just go for one edge
and<00:02:46.580> then<00:02:47.060> click<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.420> opposing<00:02:48.050> edge<00:02:48.200> around

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
and then click the opposing edge around

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.470 
and then click the opposing edge around
now<00:02:49.250> as<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.459> cell<00:02:49.640> would've<00:02:49.910> normally<00:02:50.060> I'd<00:02:50.360> is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
now as a cell would've normally I'd is

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.390 
now as a cell would've normally I'd is
it<00:02:50.630> someone<00:02:50.900> kept<00:02:51.080> like<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.470> out<00:02:51.620> but<00:02:52.340> I

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
it someone kept like that out but I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.890 
it someone kept like that out but I
think<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:52.850> important<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.510> see<00:02:53.690> if<00:02:53.810> it

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
think it's important that you see if it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.170 
think it's important that you see if it
is<00:02:53.989> tricky<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.470> fit<00:02:54.680> it's<00:02:55.160> tricky<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.550> fit<00:02:55.850> but

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
is tricky to fit it's tricky to fit but

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.949 
is tricky to fit it's tricky to fit but
once<00:02:56.360> it's<00:02:56.569> in<00:02:56.660> there<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.920> very<00:02:58.310> nice

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
once it's in there it is a very nice

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.210 
once it's in there it is a very nice
okay<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.020> let<00:03:00.290> me<00:03:00.319> give<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.620> tour<00:03:00.830> around<00:03:00.950> at

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
okay so let me give you a tour around at

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.370 
okay so let me give you a tour around at
least<00:03:01.370> sides<00:03:01.550> obviously<00:03:01.940> completely<00:03:02.380> clear

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
least sides obviously completely clear

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.580 
least sides obviously completely clear
this<00:03:04.280> bottom<00:03:04.700> section<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:05.180> nice<00:03:05.360> large<00:03:05.810> cut<00:03:06.380> out

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
this bottom section a nice large cut out

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.250 
this bottom section a nice large cut out
there<00:03:06.800> for<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.700> dock<00:03:08.120> connector<00:03:08.660> the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
there for the dock connector the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.259 
there for the dock connector the
earphone<00:03:09.860> jack<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.280> also<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.670> speaker<00:03:11.090> there

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
earphone jack and also the speaker there

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.509 
earphone jack and also the speaker there
then<00:03:11.989> we've<00:03:12.140> got<00:03:12.170> cut<00:03:12.440> out<00:03:12.470> on<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:12.890> side<00:03:13.130> for

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
then we've got cut out on this side for

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.520 
then we've got cut out on this side for
the<00:03:13.610> volume<00:03:13.940> up<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.300> down<00:03:14.360> it's<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.350> popped

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
the volume up and down it's just popped

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.040 
the volume up and down it's just popped
apart<00:03:15.890> again<00:03:16.480> come<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.660> case<00:03:17.930> stay<00:03:18.530> together

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.420 

push<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.350> together<00:03:24.670> there<00:03:25.670> we<00:03:25.850> go<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:28.100> the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
push that together there we go so the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.540 
push that together there we go so the
top<00:03:28.640> hitch<00:03:29.530> let's<00:03:30.530> take<00:03:30.800> this<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.220> game<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
top hitch let's take this the game the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.360 
top hitch let's take this the game the
top<00:03:31.730> edge<00:03:31.910> here<00:03:32.269> it's<00:03:32.959> got<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.410> cut<00:03:33.890> out<00:03:34.100> for

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
top edge here it's got the cut out for

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.850 
top edge here it's got the cut out for
the<00:03:34.550> power<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.420> off<00:03:35.569> and<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:36.500> on<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.739> back

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
the power on off and then on the back

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.039 
the power on off and then on the back
there's<00:03:37.220> another<00:03:37.430> cut<00:03:37.700> out<00:03:37.880> there<00:03:38.180> for<00:03:38.690> the

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
there's another cut out there for the

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.860 
there's another cut out there for the
camera<00:03:39.459> now<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.519> front<00:03:40.910> obviously<00:03:41.570> remains

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
camera now the front obviously remains

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.410 
camera now the front obviously remains
completely<00:03:42.290> accessible<00:03:43.160> there's<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.120> slight

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
completely accessible there's a slight

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.690 
completely accessible there's a slight
ridge<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.290> front<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.739> case<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.610> it

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
ridge to the front of the case so it

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.890 
ridge to the front of the case so it
does<00:03:46.820> protrude<00:03:47.239> over<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.540> front<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
does protrude over the front of the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.660 
does protrude over the front of the
screen<00:03:48.110> that<00:03:48.799> nicely<00:03:49.070> lay<00:03:49.370> on<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.640> table

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
screen that nicely lay on the table

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.000 
screen that nicely lay on the table
design<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:50.600> it's<00:03:50.750> not<00:03:50.840> going<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.079> touch<00:03:51.290> the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
design so it's not going to touch the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
design so it's not going to touch the
screen<00:03:52.250> on<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.700> table<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:54.620> actual<00:03:55.040> fit<00:03:55.670> and

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
screen on the table the actual fit and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.390 
screen on the table the actual fit and
finish<00:03:56.329> you<00:03:57.260> just<00:03:57.470> look<00:03:57.620> at<00:03:57.709> this<00:03:57.890> it's<00:03:58.280> a

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
finish you just look at this it's a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.039 
finish you just look at this it's a
little<00:03:58.820> tiny<00:03:59.030> gap<00:03:59.450> there<00:03:59.810> between<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:01.190> two

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
little tiny gap there between the two

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.960 
little tiny gap there between the two
sort<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.109> parts<00:04:03.859> of<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.100> case<00:04:04.310> i<00:04:04.579> think<00:04:04.850> that's

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
sort of parts of the case i think that's

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.380 
sort of parts of the case i think that's
clipped<00:04:05.269> improperly<00:04:05.959> now<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.940> although<00:04:07.940> it

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
clipped improperly now and although it

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.140 
clipped improperly now and although it
popped<00:04:08.780> out<00:04:08.930> again<00:04:09.260> on<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.530> top<00:04:09.829> so<00:04:10.579> I'm<00:04:10.820> not

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
popped out again on that top so I'm not

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.530 
popped out again on that top so I'm not
a<00:04:11.570> hundred<00:04:12.200> percent<00:04:12.850> sort<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:13.910> happy<00:04:14.269> with<00:04:14.390> how

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
a hundred percent sort of happy with how

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.310 
a hundred percent sort of happy with how
this<00:04:14.750> is<00:04:14.930> clipping<00:04:15.230> together<00:04:17.079> keeps<00:04:18.079> or

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
this is clipping together keeps or

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.920 
this is clipping together keeps or
popping<00:04:18.739> popping<00:04:19.190> off<00:04:19.459> mind<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.329> let<00:04:20.539> me<00:04:20.810> just

namely clip round on this edge look at
that<00:04:51.689> first<00:04:52.289> co<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.789> was<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.539> is<00:04:54.659> why<00:04:54.810> i

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
that first co so it was this is why i
