we<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.639> 6.9<00:00:14.639> diesel<00:00:15.599> out<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.139> an<00:00:16.230> 85<00:00:16.500> truck

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
we got a 6.9 diesel out of an 85 truck

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.779 
we got a 6.9 diesel out of an 85 truck
that<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> casualty<00:00:19.710> here<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> let<00:00:20.760> me

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
that is the casualty here and let me

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.910 
that is the casualty here and let me
show<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.480> has<00:00:21.720> happened<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.740> familiar

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
show you what has happened it's familiar

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.330 
show you what has happened it's familiar
with<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> cylinder<00:00:23.760> heads<00:00:24.029> off<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.500> IDI<00:00:25.500> 6.9

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
with the cylinder heads off the IDI 6.9

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.550 
with the cylinder heads off the IDI 6.9
as<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.029> see<00:00:27.300> they<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.170> these<00:00:28.289> pre

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
as you can see they have these pre

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.740 
as you can see they have these pre
chambers<00:00:29.039> which<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.429> why<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.539> called

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
chambers which is why it's called

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.350 
chambers which is why it's called
indirect<00:00:31.470> injection<00:00:31.920> because<00:00:32.820> they<00:00:33.180> got

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
indirect injection because they got

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.330 
indirect injection because they got
these<00:00:33.450> pre<00:00:33.719> chambers<00:00:34.170> where<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.800> globe<00:00:35.070> plugs

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
these pre chambers where the globe plugs

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
these pre chambers where the globe plugs
and<00:00:35.579> fuel<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> inserted<00:00:36.480> pre<00:00:37.350> heated<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.950> then

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and fuel is inserted pre heated and then

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
and fuel is inserted pre heated and then
insert<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.670> inside<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.120> cylinder

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
insert it inside the cylinder

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.850 
insert it inside the cylinder
well<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.460> messing<00:00:41.969> three<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.440> inserts

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
well it's messing three of the inserts

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.940 
well it's messing three of the inserts
and<00:00:44.450> there<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.829> was

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
and there they are this one here was

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
and there they are this one here was
bouncing<00:00:47.430> around<00:00:47.489> inside<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.149> cylinder

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
bouncing around inside the cylinder

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.729 
bouncing around inside the cylinder
because<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.860> got<00:00:50.039> blown<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:51.739> after

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
because it got blown out because after

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.410 
because it got blown out because after
you<00:00:52.829> squirt<00:00:53.129> ether<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> glow

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you squirt ether in there and the glow

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.990 
you squirt ether in there and the glow
plugs<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.930> hot<00:00:55.460> it's<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.789> cause<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
plugs are hot it's going to cause a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540 
plugs are hot it's going to cause a
pretty<00:00:57.329> severe<00:00:57.690> explosion<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.829> blew<00:00:59.039> all

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
pretty severe explosion so it blew all

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.729 
pretty severe explosion so it blew all
three<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.120> those<00:01:00.210> completely<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.500> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
three of those completely out here is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.509 
three of those completely out here is
the<00:01:01.949> block<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.680> there<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the block as you can see there is a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.830 
the block as you can see there is a
stamped<00:01:06.590> intention<00:01:08.510> on<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.250> block<00:01:11.250> itself

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
stamped intention on the block itself

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.670 
stamped intention on the block itself
where<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:13.020> came<00:01:13.400> came<00:01:14.400> popping<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.680> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
where they came came popping out this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.660 
where they came came popping out this
block<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:18.210> salvageable<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.259> point

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
block is not salvageable at this point

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.880 
block is not salvageable at this point
it<00:01:20.670> severely<00:01:22.220> indented<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.350> surface<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it severely indented the the surface of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.350 
it severely indented the the surface of
the<00:01:25.979> block<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.670> wouldn't<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.030> able<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.210> machine

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the block we wouldn't be able to machine

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.200 
the block we wouldn't be able to machine
this<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.850> unfortunately<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:29.970> can't

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
this down so unfortunately we can't

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.649 
this down so unfortunately we can't
rebuild<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:32.790> would<00:01:32.909> take<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.299> too<00:01:33.360> much

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
rebuild this it would take way too much

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.630 
rebuild this it would take way too much
work<00:01:33.900> we'd<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> shave<00:01:34.710> too<00:01:34.979> much<00:01:35.130> off<00:01:35.369> in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
work we'd have to shave too much off in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969 
work we'd have to shave too much off in
order<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.119> any<00:01:36.329> benefit<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.740> pretty

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
order to get any benefit that's a pretty

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.219 
order to get any benefit that's a pretty
big<00:01:38.250> dip<00:01:38.880> right<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.540> we'd<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> do

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
big dip right there and we'd have to do

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
big dip right there and we'd have to do
a<00:01:40.259> lot<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.439> machine<00:01:40.799> work<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.369> order<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.880> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a lot of machine work in order to get it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.770 
a lot of machine work in order to get it
back<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> core<00:01:43.759> that<00:01:44.759> block<00:01:45.090> was

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
back up the core that block was

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
back up the core that block was
rebuildable<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.189> bit<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.399> rust
