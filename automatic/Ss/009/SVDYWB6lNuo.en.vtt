 I wanted to compliment you had me 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 said that a certain person I care about 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.000
 a lot would have called me ed 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.789
 actually in the three days you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.130
 tell me you wanted to know precisely the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.040
 intentions of this person I am 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:41.820
 born 19 9 55 yes he an aquarium 17 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.270
 February 56 which is called renzo I take 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.460
 perfect then we see the roms heard 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.739
 fifteen days ago and so it was like 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.379
 in the less badly said this than this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.260
 it's nice because maybe it was that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.170
 person who returned from the high past 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.550
 very good who you see very much I remember there 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.760
 they are situations that they then have 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:08.220
 however romanticona like me remain also 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.439
 all my children at once in 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.390
 private but I wanted to tell you live 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.700
 thanks a lot then let's start a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.560
 mix the cards of their thinking 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.750
 this time since you saw yourself at 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.939
 the two of you then you think about your figure 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.560
 his figure as if you were looking at a picture 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:33.619
 give me the 8 race when you want it ok high 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.619
 low or high cut center 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.330
 but here is changing everything is changing 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.640
 bay beautiful beautiful cards because 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.810
 finally this death card turned 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.440
 that I am not mistaken 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.259
 we had already seen in the drafts why 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.030
 my cards then these I own 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.979
 in the heart so they talk to me 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 I talk to them heart to heart is 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.360
 finally this process then turned 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.399
 of evolution I told you about 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.740
 death as the rebirth process here 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.530
 evolutionary of what could be 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.979
 just the change gives me one 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.830
 development situation then the card 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.830
 of death that we finally say it is 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.010
 as if he is already in an embryonic stage 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.500
 in which from caterpillar has not yet become 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.780
 butterfly, however, is in that middle phase 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.959
 that maybe and chrysalis so let's go 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.760
 already towards an improvement and immediately 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.260
 because the elevation cards are the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.180
 our present 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.450
 there is a card nearby which is the card then 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.340
 of development and fulfillment then 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 what is going to develop ea 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.530
 to make oneself just relative to what 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.780
 your dreams are your expectations but 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.700
 we have also seen now, of course 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.549
 his because otherwise a person if 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.620
 he doesn't want to change it doesn't change him 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.320
 however being an aquarium then 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.600
 son of the wind 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.579
 according to me it is a character that if 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.180
 decides not to change but does not change but 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:06.600
 not even praying to him in the meantime 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.730
 I say that from the first sight there is the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.680
 turtle card finally turned 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.410
 so here too we speed up a little 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.130
 the beautiful times andy this kayaba 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.620
 this turtle that turns me around 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.750
 but it doesn't become a hyper animal to me 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.359
 fast and super fast however it becomes 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.459
 however an animal that knows where to put 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.850
 your feet and know what needs to go to 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.670
 make to build always this pulling yourself 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.250
 home on the shoulders with the card of 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.410
 rebirth near and home right there 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.350
 excitement card so what 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.020
 is a quote that leads us to everything 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.360
 what could be 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.360
 even a wanting not to want is me 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.660
 I therefore say rebirth with paper 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.820
 of excitement goes to dampen this 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.430
 sacrifice as if the sacrifices made in 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.870
 in the past they were finally giving theirs 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.390
 their fruits 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.480
 just because he wants it here 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.130
 just him the sovereign here he is but him 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.630
 wants in a different way than it does 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.340
 wanted first want in a more way 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.550
 engaging wants it in a more way 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.460
 sweet wants in a way anyway 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.940
 there is above all that I tell you the 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.610
 love card with answered here is 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.310
 beautiful because love is paid 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.980
 most beautiful thing that could exist but 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.760
 even with a welcome gift situation 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.640
 so a paid love didn't go to 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.850
 search for strength but as a gift of 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.340
 destiny that anyway gets us more 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.010
 I say there is the card of cunning then you 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.830
 put all the little ones into action 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.560
 clever that we women know ad 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.170
 operate and sing about it 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.360
 speeds up your own time even more 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.120
 for a wonderful card that we go to 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.380
 finish with a card of 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.560
 reconciliation because you have had 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.650
 a life situation 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.830
 we say open but not related 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.650
 lived that aims to bring the right 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.390
 then reconciling two flaps that 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.430
 Yes 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.520
 they reunite that they meet again they go 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.530
 but to fit this card of 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.840
 caban is the card of the land then the 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.650
 solidity even of what is one 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.650
 growth situation then cards 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.650
 beautiful
