00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.640
 but we will first visit the baby in so 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:09.590
 experience when staying the 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.300
 cheetahs there was two months ago 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.990
 a triplet born 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.860
 well i would say just take a look 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.860
 they are higher up 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.390
 these are just very nice things they 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.490
 are now more than two months are two 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.960
 females to a male 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.510
 And yes well we are incredibly naturally 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.070
 We are proud that we have another trie citta 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.750
 piston to the remain just one 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.530
 Magnificent say it never bores 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.530
 you can watch it for hours 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 That 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.540
 the boy cheetah look something else 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 out and their adult mother and that is 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.950
 especially him on hold 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.500
 so first they have at the top 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.910
 actually from those longer brownish ones 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.530
 hair 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.150
 how about the morning and the city and it is 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 actually a kind of writing colors 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.240
 as soon as she becomes older than lose 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.890
 she who 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.780
 we will say they have neck hairs 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.759
 and then they get a disky 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.979
 original spots that she now so 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.660
 even though my top has something 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.610
 quite what her all the running 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.380
 that's how you get away with money 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.940
 the little ones are still in the booth 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.590
 but that will be soon 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.350
 change 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 to find out as a month 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.260
 or three or four months old they are allowed 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.540
 actually outward and yes if 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.760
 so you run outside they stay 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.350
 here for a while 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.970
 and if three months have 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.050
 in the syringe you fight cat disease and 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.490
 sneezing disease 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.380
 and once we have achieved that, then 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.540
 logically in running outside and going 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.970
 a big trains on 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.560
 and two months later the time has come 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.700
 young cheetahs are allowed outside 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.979
 in 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.259
 They have since grown considerably you 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.840
 I choose you are now about 5 months 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.000
 old goes very well and I mean see them 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.720
 They look great and they took the chef 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.030
 cia and sandra famous and the little ones 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.680
 stay nice with mother for now 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.600
 well we basically try them 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.650
 keep mill with the mother for so long 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.020
 look into nature 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.270
 then they usually go with a year or two 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.340
 them to find their own way but 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.730
 basically this good you actually 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.730
 together 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.040
 the boy cheetahs seem to be fine 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.090
 entertain in the country retreat 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.280
 yes well it is natural for the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.620
 visitors also a very nice zele to that 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.090
 well i choose so yes actually a whole 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.519
 large part of Disney's day 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.230
 and we still have some ability to 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.970
 a little climbing in trees because of them 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.709
 not yet have nails that their 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.780
 mother has actually been dull 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.609
 that is to be able to leave behind projects 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.049
 run like a well where young than 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.569
 so here i want to be able to get one 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.349
 bit to climb trees so yes it is 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.349
 a precious says
