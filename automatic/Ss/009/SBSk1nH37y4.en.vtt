elements that we associate with yes in

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.760 
elements that we associate with yes in
evidence<00:01:30.999> but<00:01:31.329> they<00:01:31.599> are<00:01:31.810> fallen<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.679> you

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
beginning there

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.530 
beginning there
there's<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.920> very<00:02:16.160> nice<00:02:16.370> keyboard<00:02:16.580> solo<00:02:17.330> by

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
there's a very nice keyboard solo by

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.450 
there's a very nice keyboard solo by
geoff<00:02:17.780> downes<00:02:17.930> however<00:02:18.440> which<00:02:18.860> leads<00:02:19.100> into<00:02:19.280> a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
geoff downes however which leads into a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.310 
geoff downes however which leads into a
very<00:02:19.840> hunting<00:02:20.840> threat<00:02:21.440> work<00:02:21.620> from<00:02:21.940> Steve<00:02:22.940> Howe

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
very hunting threat work from Steve Howe

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.600 
very hunting threat work from Steve Howe
so<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.350> really<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.220> more<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.520> the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
so I really like this it more of the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.950 
so I really like this it more of the
album<00:02:25.880> have<00:02:25.970> been<00:02:26.000> like<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.660> think<00:02:26.870> it

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
album have been like this I think it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.190 
album have been like this I think it
would<00:02:27.050> have<00:02:27.110> been<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.620> much<00:02:27.830> stronger<00:02:28.100> effort

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
would have been a much stronger effort

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.440 
would have been a much stronger effort
so<00:02:30.200> once<00:02:30.500> again<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.830> would<00:02:31.040> say<00:02:31.490> it's<00:02:32.030> really<00:02:32.420> a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
so once again I would say it's really a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.300 
so once again I would say it's really a
just<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.880> subpar<00:02:34.880> yes<00:02:35.150> album<00:02:35.570> I<00:02:36.100> can<00:02:37.100> still

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
just a subpar yes album I can still

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.830 
just a subpar yes album I can still
recommend<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.000> would<00:02:38.180> still<00:02:38.390> give<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.570> three

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840
