00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
finish on the original back cover but I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
finish on the original back cover but I
think<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.149> think<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.570> prefer<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.930> glossy

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
think but I think I prefer the glossy

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.899 
think but I think I prefer the glossy
finish<00:02:04.649> over<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> matte<00:02:05.189> finish<00:02:05.219> just

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
finish over the matte finish just

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
finish over the matte finish just
because<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.270> love<00:02:06.479> things<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.259> are<00:02:07.409> glossy

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
because I love things that are glossy

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.969 
because I love things that are glossy
and<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:09.000> reason<00:02:09.270> behind<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.690> went<00:02:09.929> with<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.530> red

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
and the reason behind I went with a red

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.720 
and the reason behind I went with a red
version<00:02:11.190> is

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
version is

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.009 
version is
because<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:12.150> red<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.540> black<00:02:12.659> combination

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
because the red and black combination

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.410 
because the red and black combination
seems<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.530> be<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> most<00:02:14.010> popular<00:02:14.459> combination

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
seems to be the most popular combination

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.690 
seems to be the most popular combination
just<00:02:16.110> because<00:02:16.379> mkbhd<00:02:16.799> likes<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.459> anyway

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
just because mkbhd likes it anyway

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.360

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
color combinations rather there we go I

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.330 
color combinations rather there we go I
don't<00:05:01.260> think<00:05:01.320> this<00:05:01.590> is<00:05:01.680> gonna<00:05:01.770> turn<00:05:01.980> out<00:05:02.130> good

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
don't think this is gonna turn out good

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.620 
don't think this is gonna turn out good
but<00:05:02.580> here<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.450> goes

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
but here it goes

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.900 
but here it goes
anyway<00:05:06.440> on<00:05:07.440> this<00:05:07.680> side<00:05:07.950> there<00:05:08.250> is<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.430> whole<00:05:08.730> lot

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
anyway on this side there is a whole lot

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.659 
anyway on this side there is a whole lot
of<00:05:08.970> nothing

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
of nothing

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.909 
of nothing
and<00:05:11.669> on<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.880> top<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.300> course<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.990> headphone

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
and on the top of course the headphone

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.420 
and on the top of course the headphone
jack<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:15.750> on<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.169> back<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:17.010> can<00:05:17.070> see<00:05:17.310> the

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
jack and on the back you can see the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.150 
jack and on the back you can see the
black<00:05:17.760> camera<00:05:18.270> whoa<00:05:18.660> okay<00:05:20.240> so<00:05:21.830> it<00:05:22.830> does

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
black camera whoa okay so it does

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.580 
black camera whoa okay so it does
attract<00:05:23.729> a<00:05:23.850> lot<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.030> finger<00:05:24.330> prints<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:25.169> they

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
attract a lot of finger prints and they

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.680 
attract a lot of finger prints and they
are<00:05:25.770> clearly<00:05:26.490> visible<00:05:26.760> on<00:05:27.000> camera<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.540> also

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
are clearly visible on camera and also

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.350 
are clearly visible on camera and also
off<00:05:27.990> camera<00:05:28.440> so<00:05:29.430> that's<00:05:29.790> a<00:05:30.210> good<00:05:30.479> observation

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
off camera so that's a good observation

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.740 
off camera so that's a good observation
doesn't<00:05:33.360> look<00:05:33.570> like<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:34.020> shows<00:05:35.720> but<00:05:36.720> I

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
doesn't look like it shows but I

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.300 
doesn't look like it shows but I
definitely<00:05:36.960> can't<00:05:37.380> see<00:05:37.590> a<00:05:37.860> lot<00:05:38.040> of<00:05:38.070> finger

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
definitely can't see a lot of finger

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.719 
definitely can't see a lot of finger
prints<00:05:38.490> on<00:05:38.610> this<00:05:39.020> but<00:05:40.020> this<00:05:40.380> does<00:05:40.710> show<00:05:40.979> all<00:05:41.580> of

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
prints on this but this does show all of

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.390 
prints on this but this does show all of
them<00:05:41.910> this<00:05:42.240> doesn't<00:05:42.600> just<00:05:42.979> blends<00:05:43.979> in<00:05:44.220> with

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
them this doesn't just blends in with

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.140 
them this doesn't just blends in with
the<00:05:44.580> color<00:05:44.789> I<00:05:45.030> guess<00:05:47.870> um<00:05:49.370> so<00:05:50.370> there<00:05:50.760> is<00:05:50.970> the

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
the color I guess um so there is the

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.420 
the color I guess um so there is the
camera

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.970 

these<00:05:55.030> people<00:05:55.330> through<00:05:55.620> so<00:05:56.620> I<00:05:56.650> guess<00:05:56.830> that's

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
these people through so I guess that's

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.160 
these people through so I guess that's
been<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.220> really<00:05:57.640> quick<00:05:57.880> unboxing<00:05:58.420> and<00:05:58.840> review

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
been a really quick unboxing and review

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.910 
been a really quick unboxing and review
of<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.350> redmi<00:06:00.130> 1s<00:06:01.440> apart<00:06:02.440> from<00:06:02.530> that<00:06:02.710> there's

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
of the redmi 1s apart from that there's

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.680 
of the redmi 1s apart from that there's
not<00:06:03.100> really<00:06:03.310> much<00:06:03.640> to<00:06:03.880> say<00:06:03.910> about<00:06:04.240> this

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
not really much to say about this

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.470 
not really much to say about this
