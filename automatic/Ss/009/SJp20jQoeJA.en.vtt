have been searching for years and I've
been<00:00:36.540> running<00:00:37.079> support<00:00:37.770> class<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> minute

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
been running support class at a minute

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.049 
been running support class at a minute
and<00:00:39.500> in<00:00:40.550> free-for-alls<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.910> been

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and in free-for-alls have been

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.840 
and in free-for-alls have been
dominating<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.809> free<00:00:43.019> frozen<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.769> just<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.610> mean

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
dominating and free frozen I just I mean

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.670 
dominating and free frozen I just I mean
I<00:00:45.059> usually<00:00:45.269> swap<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> around<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.320> assault

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
I usually swap it around with assault

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.060 
I usually swap it around with assault
and<00:00:47.059> support<00:00:48.059> class<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:49.170> I've<00:00:49.320> found<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and support class but what I've found is

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.979 
and support class but what I've found is
if<00:00:50.790> you<00:00:50.910> put<00:00:51.589> assault<00:00:52.589> and<00:00:52.860> support<00:00:53.489> casts<00:00:53.730> on

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
if you put assault and support casts on

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.420 
if you put assault and support casts on
what<00:00:54.989> I've<00:00:55.110> been<00:00:55.260> doing<00:00:55.649> I've<00:00:55.860> been<00:00:55.890> puttin

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
what I've been doing I've been puttin

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.740 
what I've been doing I've been puttin
UAV<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:58.050> ya<00:00:58.289> advanced<00:00:59.070> UAV<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.879> I've<00:01:00.570> also

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
UAV on see ya advanced UAV and I've also

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.119 
UAV on see ya advanced UAV and I've also
been<00:01:00.930> doing<00:01:01.379> something<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.629> EMP<00:01:03.949> but<00:01:04.949> what

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
been doing something like EMP but what

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.800 
been doing something like EMP but what
happens<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.470> EMP<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.910> takes<00:01:09.149> 15<00:01:09.539> kills

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
happens is the EMP see it takes 15 kills

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.710 
happens is the EMP see it takes 15 kills
to<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.289> so<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.399> you<00:01:11.670> need<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.149> so<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to get to so what you need to do so the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.700 
to get to so what you need to do so the
UAV<00:01:13.170> takes<00:01:13.530> 4<00:01:13.920> kills<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:15.060> EMP<00:01:15.660> takes<00:01:16.020> 15<00:01:16.440> kills

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
UAV takes 4 kills the EMP takes 15 kills

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.330 
UAV takes 4 kills the EMP takes 15 kills
what<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.399> do<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.899> to<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.340> 19

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
what I need to do is they have to get 19

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.900 
what I need to do is they have to get 19
kills<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.940> get<00:01:21.119> 2<00:01:21.450> UAVs<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> thought<00:01:23.729> well

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
kills to get 2 UAVs so I thought well

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.730 
kills to get 2 UAVs so I thought well
why<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:24.630> want<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.050> do<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.530> looked

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
why don't want to do that so I looked

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.199 
why don't want to do that so I looked
for<00:01:25.950> all<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.190> more<00:01:26.369> kill<00:01:26.610> streaks<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.149> I

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209 
for all the more kill streaks and I

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:28.400 
for all the more kill streaks and I
thought<00:01:27.390> well<00:01:27.569> there's<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:27.810> many<00:01:27.959> local

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
thought well there's not many local

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.859 
thought well there's not many local
streets<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.190> can<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.869> in

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
streets really what you can use in

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
streets really what you can use in
support<00:01:31.380> class<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.920> mean<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.670> wanted<00:01:32.910> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
support class I mean if you wanted to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.230 
support class I mean if you wanted to
use<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.270> first<00:01:33.479> 3<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.860> go<00:01:35.009> up

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
use the first 3 I think that to go up

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.910 
use the first 3 I think that to go up
the<00:01:36.240> way<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.690> do<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.200> say<00:01:37.679> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the way you have to do it is like say a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.240 
the way you have to do it is like say a
4<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.729> 5<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.929> 8<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.679> I<00:01:40.739> thought<00:01:40.920> well<00:01:41.069> what's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
4 a 5 and it 8 so I thought well what's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.859 
4 a 5 and it 8 so I thought well what's
the<00:01:41.340> point<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.670> might<00:01:41.789> as<00:01:41.940> well<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.270> um<00:01:42.479> take

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the point I might as well just um take

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.279 
the point I might as well just um take
off<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.800> -<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.940> Rios<00:01:45.360> Taniya<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
off the the - it's just Rios Taniya the

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.719 
off the the - it's just Rios Taniya the
game<00:01:46.470> was<00:01:46.649> lucky<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.069> beginning<00:01:47.429> it's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
game was lucky at the beginning it's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.809 
game was lucky at the beginning it's
just<00:01:47.759> Rios<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.489> there

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.489 
was take off the two high ones which

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:58.249 
was take off the two high ones which
just<00:01:56.759> seen<00:01:56.910> if<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.119> would<00:01:57.270> let<00:01:57.390> me<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
just seen if it would let me do it and I

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.499 
just seen if it would let me do it and I
just<00:01:58.470> left<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> UAV<00:01:59.190> on<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.759> infinitely

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
just left the UAV on and it's infinitely

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.440 
just left the UAV on and it's infinitely
waving<00:02:01.080> it's<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.890> while<00:02:02.670> one's<00:02:02.970> up<00:02:03.239> and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
waving it's like while one's up and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.869 
waving it's like while one's up and
runnin<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.959> get<00:02:04.110> away<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.679> ego<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.729> it's

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:05.879 
runnin you get away the ego then it's

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.320 
runnin you get away the ego then it's
off<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.869> get<00:02:07.020> another<00:02:07.429> you<00:02:08.429> waving<00:02:08.640> UAV

off then you get another you waving UAV
look<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.750> game<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.170> I've<00:02:10.259> got<00:02:10.289> two

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
look at this game there I've got two

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.250 
look at this game there I've got two
UAVs<00:02:11.190> already<00:02:11.580> there's<00:02:12.120> my<00:02:12.300> third<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:13.050> this

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
UAVs already there's my third this this

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.830 
UAVs already there's my third this this
is<00:02:13.440> third<00:02:13.709> UAV<00:02:14.190> that's<00:02:15.000> what<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> UAVs<00:02:15.629> out

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
is third UAV that's what the UAVs out

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.449 
is third UAV that's what the UAVs out
the<00:02:15.930> top<00:02:16.140> representing<00:02:16.709> I'll<00:02:16.950> see<00:02:17.160> how<00:02:17.250> many

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
the top representing I'll see how many

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.820 
the top representing I'll see how many
are<00:02:17.610> getting<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.910> one<00:02:18.180> free<00:02:18.510> for<00:02:18.750> all<00:02:18.840> well

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
are getting this one free for all well

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.490 
are getting this one free for all well
it's<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.190> it's<00:02:20.640> her<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.390> can't<00:02:22.020> believe<00:02:22.290> it's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
it's it it's her I can't believe it's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.640 
it's it it's her I can't believe it's
like<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.860> well<00:02:23.480> that's<00:02:24.480> why<00:02:24.660> I've<00:02:24.810> titled<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
like that well that's why I've titled it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.890 
like that well that's why I've titled it
as<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.770> glitch<00:02:26.069> but<00:02:26.400> if<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.330> think<00:02:27.540> about<00:02:27.690> what

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
as a glitch but if you think about what

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.510 
as a glitch but if you think about what
a<00:02:27.930> glitch<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.379> it's<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:28.680> an<00:02:28.950> advantage<00:02:29.370> over

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
a glitch is it's just an advantage over

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.559 
a glitch is it's just an advantage over
somebody<00:02:29.940> else<00:02:30.090> isn't<00:02:30.300> it

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.240 

so<00:02:33.569> well<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.439> point<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:34.859> game<00:02:35.010> there

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
so well this point of the game there

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.380 
so well this point of the game there
that<00:02:35.459> looks<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.760> me<00:02:35.969> and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
that looks like me and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.559 
that looks like me and
but<00:02:36.780> in-game<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.370> theta<00:02:38.610> mafia<00:02:39.060> in

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
but in-game there this is theta mafia in

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.500 
but in-game there this is theta mafia in
game<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.740> was<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.250> pure<00:02:41.580> were<00:02:41.760> small<00:02:42.240> fare

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
game that was just pure were small fare

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.750 
game that was just pure were small fare
from<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.810> scene<00:02:43.020> now<00:02:43.200> look<00:02:43.920> at<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.069> I'm<00:02:44.280> one

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
from the scene now look at this I'm one

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.949 
from the scene now look at this I'm one
off<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.180> one<00:02:45.720> off<00:02:45.900> kill<00:02:46.170> from<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.130> before<00:02:47.959> UAV

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
off a one off kill from a before UAV

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.440 
off a one off kill from a before UAV
there's<00:02:49.260> there<00:02:49.620> there's<00:02:49.800> me<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.310> four<00:02:50.459> UAV<00:02:50.819> in

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
there's there there's me for four UAV in

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.880 
there's there there's me for four UAV in
one<00:02:51.750> game<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.050> free-for-all

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
one game a free-for-all

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.440 
one game a free-for-all
I<00:02:57.950> mean<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.040> don't<00:02:59.100> know<00:02:59.370> whether<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.880> cook<00:03:00.120> I

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
I mean I don't know whether this cook I

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
this on YouTube to see like this but I

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.890 
this on YouTube to see like this but I
just<00:03:05.280> had<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> little<00:03:05.760> idea<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.450> deal<00:03:06.630> if<00:03:06.810> I

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
just had a little idea of a deal if I

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.250 
just had a little idea of a deal if I
I'll<00:03:07.110> give<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.530> off<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.310> mean<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.140> don't

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
I'll give it off and I mean if you don't

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.400 
I'll give it off and I mean if you don't
know<00:03:10.680> how<00:03:10.950> good<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.190> your<00:03:11.400> wavy<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.410> how

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
know how good a your wavy is and how

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.040 
know how good a your wavy is and how
powerful<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.100> be<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:15.300> absolutely

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
powerful it can be it's absolutely

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.320 
powerful it can be it's absolutely
dominates<00:03:16.739> over<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:17.910> dominate<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
dominates over like it can dominate a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.509 
dominates over like it can dominate a
free-for-all<00:03:18.810> UAV<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.560> mean<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.310> there's<00:03:20.459> a

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
free-for-all UAV I mean if there's a

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.890 
free-for-all UAV I mean if there's a
helicopter<00:03:20.970> up<00:03:21.030> now<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.300> might<00:03:21.420> get<00:03:21.570> me<00:03:21.690> three

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
helicopter up now it might get me three

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.710 
helicopter up now it might get me three
kills<00:03:22.170> but<00:03:22.830> these<00:03:23.010> UAVs<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.820> just<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
kills but these UAVs are just the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.080 
kills but these UAVs are just the
destroying<00:03:25.500> absolutely<00:03:26.070> everything<00:03:26.310> and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
destroying absolutely everything and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.310 
destroying absolutely everything and
helicopter<00:03:27.540> probably<00:03:27.780> wouldn't<00:03:28.050> get<00:03:28.170> me<00:03:28.290> a

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
helicopter probably wouldn't get me a

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.990 
helicopter probably wouldn't get me a
few<00:03:28.500> kills<00:03:28.800> on<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> free-for-all<00:03:29.400> actually<00:03:29.790> in

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
few kills on a free-for-all actually in

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.699 
few kills on a free-for-all actually in
this<00:03:30.360> map<00:03:30.600> probably<00:03:31.140> wouldn't<00:03:31.320> get<00:03:31.410> me<00:03:31.530> one

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
this map probably wouldn't get me one

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.610 
this map probably wouldn't get me one
but<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.459> after<00:03:32.760> get<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.230> wouldn't<00:03:34.440> be

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
but it after get to it and I wouldn't be

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.500 
but it after get to it and I wouldn't be
able<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.800> die<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.160> between<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.640> these<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.360> can

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
able to die in between it these I can

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.729 
able to die in between it these I can
die<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.810> between<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.260> I'm<00:03:37.380> still<00:03:37.590> getting

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
die in between it and I'm still getting

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.020 
die in between it and I'm still getting
on<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.530> had<00:03:40.650> five-year<00:03:41.340> way<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.579> these<00:03:41.730> I

I<00:03:54.959> know<00:03:55.230> I've<00:03:55.320> titled<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.769> glitch<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:56.670> if<00:03:56.790> you

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
I know I've titled it glitch then if you

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.670 
I know I've titled it glitch then if you
do<00:03:56.970> think<00:03:57.239> about<00:03:57.420> what<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.600> glitch<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.500> an

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
do think about what a glitch is it is an

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.430 
do think about what a glitch is it is an
advantage<00:03:59.010> you're<00:03:59.280> over<00:03:59.430> people<00:03:59.820> I<00:04:00.019> know<00:04:01.019> some

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
advantage you're over people I know some

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.530 
advantage you're over people I know some
people<00:04:01.790> winching<00:04:02.790> well<00:04:02.910> that's<00:04:03.060> not<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.269> glitch
