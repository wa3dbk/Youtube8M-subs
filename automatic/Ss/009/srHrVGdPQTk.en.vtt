00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
little path right here well roughly in

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:36.850 
little path right here well roughly in
the<00:01:26.170> end<00:01:26.380> you're<00:01:26.770> just<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:27.039> drive<00:01:27.250> right<00:01:27.460> mile

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.430 

the<00:01:37.860> location<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.390> looking<00:01:39.690> for<00:01:40.080> is<00:01:40.290> going

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
the location we are looking for is going

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:51.550 
the location we are looking for is going
to<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.560> roughly<00:01:40.979> minus<00:01:41.940> 7<00:01:42.270> 30<00:01:42.630> 17

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.499 

so<00:01:52.369> my<00:01:52.880> cursor<00:01:53.630> should<00:01:54.079> be<00:01:54.229> right<00:01:54.439> on<00:01:54.470> about

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
so my cursor should be right on about

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:06.730 
so my cursor should be right on about
here<00:01:57.130> well<00:01:58.130> here<00:01:58.640> ish

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.620 

I<00:02:06.799> fear<00:02:07.579> of<00:02:07.610> public<00:02:07.820> all<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.270> stuff<00:02:08.479> as

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
here is certain click on it break out

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.160 
here is certain click on it break out
with<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.260> Hydra<00:02:36.100> thinner

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:51.110 

it's<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.680> melt<00:02:45.890> slowly<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:50.519> lo<00:02:51.060> and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
it's going to melt slowly and lo and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.170 
it's going to melt slowly and lo and
behold<00:02:51.299> we<00:02:51.689> have<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> data<00:02:52.200> crop<00:02:52.879> this<00:02:53.879> is<00:02:54.030> the

behold we have a data crop this is the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.520 
behold we have a data crop this is the
red<00:02:54.390> matrix<00:02:54.750> chard<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:58.879> it's<00:02:59.879> collected<00:03:00.530> so

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
red matrix chard and it's collected so

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.629 
red matrix chard and it's collected so
that<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.769> red<00:03:01.980> matrix<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.670> hof<00:03:02.819> so
