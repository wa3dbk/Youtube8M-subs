on on the top of my piano bench and and

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.290 
on on the top of my piano bench and and
I<00:04:28.169> put<00:04:28.410> myself<00:04:28.590> on<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.040> timer<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:29.490> my<00:04:29.610> camera<00:04:29.729> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.920 
I put myself on a timer on my camera and
I<00:04:30.419> just<00:04:30.600> took<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.810> quick<00:04:31.020> shot<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.380> myself<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:33.540> I

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
I just took a quick shot of myself and I

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.420 
I just took a quick shot of myself and I
don't<00:04:34.110> want<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.380> look<00:04:34.560> like<00:04:34.620> myself<00:04:34.979> though

obviously<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.850> changed<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.330> up<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.630> little<00:04:36.780> bit

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990
