00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.040
 the ox and the restaurant that guided by 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.080
 ferran adrià and his team has 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.850
 revolutionized the world of cooking a 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.710
 restaurant where everyone wanted 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.170
 go but who could get it 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.630
 honestly it was easier to win the 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.040
 lottery for us was going to turn 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.040
 in something more than a game 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.740
 One fine day, the ferran appeared 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.560
 they approach and he says look at those three 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.020
 kids who use to dine are 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.970
 studies in the amazing things 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.379
 amazing his sculpture in design that 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.480
 would like it to help us if it's a 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.339
 participate to go down to an anal farm 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.230
 in quotes of truth they have 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.949
 transmitted nature does not have 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.180
 sensitivity for water by flowers 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.400
 several days after the sea visit 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.199
 cuspinera we should meet with ferran 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.150
 adrià in the bulli was our 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.680
 opportunity to convince him will ferrán after 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.010
 see a summary of our projects 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.260
 exclaimed guys let's work together 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.320
 in the design of new ways to serve 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.030
 the food with them we thought that that 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.130
 we could have this not to contribute 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.259
 something we could learn 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.420
 something we could learn and over 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.460
 we could have a good time doing the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.649
 project as we raised our 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.179
 problems just like them because we 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.470
 taught by the pieces that had 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.470
 done and here there were two roads 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.900
 Y 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.659
 one of the most important jobs that 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.740
 has done the bulli has been the the dialogue 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.730
 with other disciplines 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.700
 for this when daniel and pere came to 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.680
 see us then we were open and what 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.310
 we wanted to take a leap forward what 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.690
 well there after a little work 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.690
 what's next 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.200
 in some situations situations 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.530
 the most unexpected are the best 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.100
 opportunities and that was what we had 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.100
 happened to us
