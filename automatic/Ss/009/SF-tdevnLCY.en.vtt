00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.270 
Sahara and I can look a little further
down<00:04:03.600> even<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.560> can<00:04:04.739> see<00:04:04.950> some<00:04:05.160> other

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
down even and I can see some other

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.390 
down even and I can see some other
places<00:04:06.209> down<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:06.989> end<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:07.920> guess<00:04:08.220> it

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
places down on that end so I guess it

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.979 
places down on that end so I guess it
might<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:09.030> probably<00:04:09.330> not<00:04:09.420> going<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.600> be<00:04:09.690> too

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989
