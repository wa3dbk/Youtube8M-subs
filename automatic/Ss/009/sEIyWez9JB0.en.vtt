is<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.630> I've<00:02:05.750> tried<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:06.020> be<00:02:06.200> really<00:02:06.409> careful

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
is that I've tried to be really careful

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.940 
is that I've tried to be really careful
not<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.250> leave<00:02:07.430> any<00:02:07.460> dips<00:02:08.380> any<00:02:09.380> places<00:02:09.740> where

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
not to leave any dips any places where

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.600 
not to leave any dips any places where
water<00:02:10.789> would<00:02:11.120> settle<00:02:11.480> because<00:02:11.930> if<00:02:12.110> if<00:02:12.770> water

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
water would settle because if if water

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.699 
water would settle because if if water
sits<00:02:14.000> into<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.330> crack<00:02:14.660> or<00:02:14.900> anything<00:02:15.110> even<00:02:15.440> in

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
sits into a crack or anything even in

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.850 
sits into a crack or anything even in
even<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.340> hard<00:02:16.610> rock<00:02:17.110> when<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.230> freezes

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
even in a hard rock when it freezes

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.580 
even in a hard rock when it freezes
it'll<00:02:19.400> pop<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.180> rock<00:02:20.390> apart<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.319> do<00:02:21.410> have

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
it'll pop that rock apart so I do have

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.650 
it'll pop that rock apart so I do have
to<00:02:21.650> be<00:02:21.740> careful<00:02:21.980> with<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.310> now<00:02:23.180> let<00:02:23.360> me<00:02:23.480> show

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
to be careful with that now let me show

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.810 
to be careful with that now let me show
you<00:02:23.720> how<00:02:24.020> how<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.530> actually<00:02:24.890> added<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
you how how I actually added the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.640

to you to thread it on to a base and

to you to thread it on to a base and
make<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.220> really<00:02:46.489> solid<00:02:47.000> which<00:02:47.330> would<00:02:47.510> sounded

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
make it really solid which would sounded

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.020 
make it really solid which would sounded
like<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.959> really<00:02:48.290> good<00:02:48.500> idea<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:49.160> didn't<00:02:49.850> happen

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
like a really good idea I didn't happen

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.830 
like a really good idea I didn't happen
to<00:02:50.269> have<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> threaded<00:02:51.350> pipe<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.550> used<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:53.120> an

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
to have a threaded pipe so I used a an

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.110 
to have a threaded pipe so I used a an
old<00:02:54.470> curtain<00:02:54.769> rod<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.340> was<00:02:55.430> left<00:02:55.700> here<00:02:56.000> in

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
old curtain rod that was left here in

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.930 
old curtain rod that was left here in
the<00:02:56.239> house<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.410> used<00:02:57.709> Stowe<00:02:58.100> foam<00:02:58.430> like<00:02:58.790> he

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
the house and I used Stowe foam like he

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.690 
the house and I used Stowe foam like he
suggested<00:02:59.600> if<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.410> did<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:00.800> again<00:03:01.040> though<00:03:01.459> I

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
suggested if I did this again though I

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.080 
suggested if I did this again though I
certainly<00:03:02.030> would<00:03:02.300> not<00:03:02.480> use<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.730> spray

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
certainly would not use the the spray

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.470 
certainly would not use the the spray
foam<00:03:05.420> from<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.930> can<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:07.670> was<00:03:07.850> totally<00:03:08.300> my

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
foam from the can that was totally my

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
foam from the can that was totally my
mistake<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:10.130> intended<00:03:10.670> for<00:03:10.820> anything

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
mistake it's not intended for anything

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.319 
mistake it's not intended for anything
more<00:03:12.500> than<00:03:12.799> one<00:03:13.130> inch<00:03:13.370> wide<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:14.000> says<00:03:14.180> that

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
more than one inch wide it says that

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.990 
more than one inch wide it says that
right<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.750> can<00:03:15.070> instead<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.130> would<00:03:16.430> order

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
right on the can instead I would order

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.630 
right on the can instead I would order
some<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:18.079> two-part<00:03:18.620> foam<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.489> can

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
some of the two-part foam that you can

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.819 
some of the two-part foam that you can
get<00:03:19.820> from<00:03:20.030> smooth<00:03:20.420> on<00:03:20.660> or<00:03:20.900> brick<00:03:21.380> in<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.590> yard

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
get from smooth on or brick in the yard

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.699 
get from smooth on or brick in the yard
company<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:23.299> was<00:03:23.450> my<00:03:23.630> mistake<00:03:24.079> I'm<00:03:24.530> sure

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
company so that was my mistake I'm sure

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.330 
company so that was my mistake I'm sure
that<00:03:24.920> James<00:03:25.160> does<00:03:25.400> not<00:03:25.579> use<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.600> can<00:03:27.340> he

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
that James does not use the can he

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.470 
that James does not use the can he
probably<00:03:28.519> doesn't<00:03:28.820> use<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> curtain<00:03:29.269> grotty

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
probably doesn't use a curtain grotty

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.630 
probably doesn't use a curtain grotty
there<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.470> in<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.739> end<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.070> actually<00:03:31.430> worked

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
there but in the end it actually worked

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.210 
there but in the end it actually worked
and<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:31.910> was<00:03:32.030> able<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.500> stick<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.739> curtain<00:03:34.100> rod

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
and I was able to stick the curtain rod

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.860 
and I was able to stick the curtain rod
down<00:03:34.549> in<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:36.190> bucket<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.310> sand<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.090> stayed

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
down in a bucket of sand and it stayed

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.680 
down in a bucket of sand and it stayed
up<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:39.799> would<00:03:40.100> be<00:03:40.400> able<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.150> actually

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
up so that I would be able to actually

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.170 
up so that I would be able to actually
work<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.110> without<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.650> falling<00:03:42.829> over<00:03:43.180> and

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
work on it without it falling over and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.210 
work on it without it falling over and
now<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.720> curtain<00:03:45.019> rod<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.739> going<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:46.010> be

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
now that curtain rod and is going to be

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.800 
now that curtain rod and is going to be
embedded<00:03:46.640> in<00:03:46.820> concrete<00:03:47.030> when<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.510> take<00:03:47.690> it

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
embedded in concrete when I take it

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.110 
embedded in concrete when I take it
outside<00:03:48.190> now<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:49.459> can<00:03:49.579> work<00:03:49.730> on<00:03:49.970> it

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
outside now that I can work on it

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
outside now that I can work on it
standing<00:03:50.630> up<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:51.110> just<00:03:51.560> started<00:03:52.010> adding<00:03:52.459> some

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
standing up I just started adding some

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.900 
standing up I just started adding some
loom<00:03:54.140> gram<00:03:54.350> foil<00:03:54.680> just<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.280> fill<00:03:55.579> in<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
loom gram foil just to fill in the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.819 
loom gram foil just to fill in the
spaces<00:03:56.299> starting<00:03:57.170> at<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.350> bottom<00:03:57.530> and

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
spaces starting at the bottom and

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.100 
spaces starting at the bottom and
working<00:03:58.220> all<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.519> way<00:03:58.549> up<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.690> could<00:03:59.930> use

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
working all the way up you could use

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.229 
working all the way up you could use
crumpled<00:04:00.560> paper<00:04:00.769> instead<00:04:01.370> that's<00:04:01.910> what<00:04:02.090> I've

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
crumpled paper instead that's what I've

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.300 
crumpled paper instead that's what I've
always<00:04:02.510> used<00:04:02.690> before<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.590> foil<00:04:03.859> is<00:04:04.070> kind

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
always used before but the foil is kind

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.920 
always used before but the foil is kind
of<00:04:04.400> nice<00:04:04.579> on<00:04:04.850> something<00:04:05.239> big<00:04:05.450> like<00:04:05.690> this

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
of nice on something big like this

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.960 
of nice on something big like this
especially<00:04:06.829> if<00:04:06.920> you've<00:04:07.100> already<00:04:07.250> filled<00:04:07.760> in

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
especially if you've already filled in

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.449 
especially if you've already filled in
the<00:04:08.209> major<00:04:09.049> forms<00:04:09.620> with<00:04:09.829> something<00:04:10.310> less

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
the major forms with something less

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.760 
the major forms with something less
expensive

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
expensive

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.200 
expensive
and<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.130> reason<00:04:12.490> being<00:04:12.610> is<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.910> can<00:04:13.060> see

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
and the reason being is you can see

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.660 
and the reason being is you can see
right<00:04:13.390> here<00:04:13.750> is<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:14.110> can<00:04:14.290> actually<00:04:14.740> get<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.520> to

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
right here is you can actually get it to

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.140 
right here is you can actually get it to
stay<00:04:16.060> put<00:04:16.510> before<00:04:17.440> taping<00:04:18.070> it<00:04:18.370> on<00:04:18.520> sometimes

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
stay put before taping it on sometimes

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.410 
stay put before taping it on sometimes
not<00:04:19.810> always<00:04:20.020> but<00:04:20.230> sometimes<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.950> helps<00:04:21.490> you

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
not always but sometimes it helps you

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.710 
not always but sometimes it helps you
can<00:04:22.570> put<00:04:23.290> it<00:04:23.380> around<00:04:23.530> an<00:04:24.250> area<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:24.970> it'll<00:04:25.180> stay

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
can put it around an area and it'll stay

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.650 
can put it around an area and it'll stay
there<00:04:26.080> then<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.190> can<00:04:27.220> work<00:04:27.610> with<00:04:27.910> figuring

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
there then you can work with figuring

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.900 
there then you can work with figuring
out<00:04:28.780> where<00:04:28.960> things<00:04:29.200> go<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.530> how<00:04:29.890> how<00:04:30.430> much<00:04:30.700> you

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
out where things go and how how much you

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.820 
out where things go and how how much you
need<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.210> squish<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.960> all<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.530> sort<00:04:32.770> of

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
need to squish it and all that sort of

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.210 
need to squish it and all that sort of
thing<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:33.280> then<00:04:33.880> tape<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:34.450> up<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:35.500> taping<00:04:35.740> it

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
thing and then tape it up the taping it

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.130 
thing and then tape it up the taping it
can<00:04:36.550> be<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.760> little<00:04:36.970> bit<00:04:37.180> frustrating<00:04:37.450> so

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
can be a little bit frustrating so

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.040 
can be a little bit frustrating so
anything<00:04:38.920> that<00:04:38.950> will<00:04:39.190> help<00:04:39.400> I'm<00:04:39.970> gonna<00:04:40.570> go<00:04:40.780> for

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
anything that will help I'm gonna go for

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.280 
anything that will help I'm gonna go for
it

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
it

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.950 
it
I<00:04:41.320> added<00:04:42.070> some<00:04:42.220> heavy<00:04:42.550> wire<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.330> arms<00:04:43.660> and

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
I added some heavy wire to the arms and

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.780 
I added some heavy wire to the arms and
to<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.230> back<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:44.920> that<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:45.130> would<00:04:45.340> be<00:04:45.490> able<00:04:45.610> to

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
to the back so that I would be able to

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.300 
to the back so that I would be able to
change<00:04:46.450> his<00:04:46.720> posture<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:47.530> actually<00:04:47.950> have<00:04:48.160> him

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
change his posture and actually have him

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.510 
change his posture and actually have him
stay<00:04:48.640> where<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.270> thought<00:04:49.780> he<00:04:49.930> belonged<00:04:50.070> I<00:04:51.070> did

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
stay where I thought he belonged I did

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.060 
stay where I thought he belonged I did
change<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.940> posture<00:04:52.180> quite<00:04:52.840> often<00:04:53.140> but<00:04:53.740> the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
change the posture quite often but the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.950 
change the posture quite often but the
wire<00:04:54.280> really<00:04:54.640> helped<00:04:55.150> because<00:04:55.480> at<00:04:55.630> least<00:04:55.750> it

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
wire really helped because at least it

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.470 
wire really helped because at least it
would<00:04:56.080> stay<00:04:56.410> where<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.800> was<00:04:56.980> until<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.850> changed

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
would stay where it was until I changed

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.170 
would stay where it was until I changed
my<00:04:58.600> mind

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
my mind

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.970 
my mind
the<00:05:01.180> bottom<00:05:01.540> portion<00:05:01.690> of<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.470> Scarecrow's

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
the bottom portion of the Scarecrow's

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.330 
the bottom portion of the Scarecrow's
jacket<00:05:03.610> is<00:05:03.910> a<00:05:03.940> little<00:05:04.330> bit<00:05:04.450> ruffled<00:05:05.280> kind<00:05:06.280> of

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
jacket is a little bit ruffled kind of

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.570 
jacket is a little bit ruffled kind of
gathered<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.450> in<00:05:07.960> order<00:05:08.290> for<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.130> look

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
gathered and in order for that to look

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.100 
gathered and in order for that to look
like<00:05:09.850> it's<00:05:10.200> fabric<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.410> used<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:13.110> aluminum

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
like it's fabric I used the aluminum

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.680 
like it's fabric I used the aluminum
mesh<00:05:14.350> a<00:05:14.740> little<00:05:15.250> bit<00:05:15.370> left<00:05:15.580> over<00:05:15.880> from<00:05:16.180> the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
mesh a little bit left over from the

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.230 
mesh a little bit left over from the
Dragons<00:05:17.350> wings<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:18.790> think<00:05:19.000> it's<00:05:19.120> gonna

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
Dragons wings and I think it's gonna

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.330 
Dragons wings and I think it's gonna
work<00:05:19.360> really<00:05:19.750> well<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.350> may<00:05:20.620> have<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.890> take<00:05:21.070> this

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
work really well I may have to take this

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.770 
work really well I may have to take this
off<00:05:23.250> do<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.280> rest<00:05:24.670> of<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.090> sculpture<00:05:25.750> that

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
off do the rest of the sculpture that

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.380 
off do the rest of the sculpture that
you<00:05:26.080> know<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.350> paper<00:05:26.560> mache<00:05:26.950> clay<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.880> then

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
you know the paper mache clay and then

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.180 
you know the paper mache clay and then
put<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.750> back<00:05:28.780> on<00:05:28.930> again<00:05:29.290> otherwise<00:05:29.830> I'm<00:05:30.070> not

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
put it back on again otherwise I'm not

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.410 
put it back on again otherwise I'm not
really<00:05:30.460> sure<00:05:30.640> that<00:05:30.670> I<00:05:30.850> would<00:05:31.060> be<00:05:31.180> able<00:05:31.270> to

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
really sure that I would be able to

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.200 
really sure that I would be able to
completely<00:05:31.900> cover<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.530> armature<00:05:33.250> but<00:05:33.850> I'm

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
completely cover the armature but I'm

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.610 
completely cover the armature but I'm
still<00:05:34.720> thinking<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:35.140> it's<00:05:35.290> gonna<00:05:35.380> work

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
still thinking that it's gonna work

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.260 
still thinking that it's gonna work
quite<00:05:35.920> well<00:05:35.950> because<00:05:36.550> it<00:05:36.790> does<00:05:36.970> look<00:05:37.240> like

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
quite well because it does look like

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.160 
quite well because it does look like
fabric<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.910> mesh<00:05:40.240> really<00:05:40.750> holds<00:05:41.140> the

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
fabric and the the mesh really holds the

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.760 
fabric and the the mesh really holds the
paper<00:05:41.380> mache<00:05:42.280> clay<00:05:42.610> really<00:05:43.090> well<00:05:43.770> the

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
paper mache clay really well the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.860 
paper mache clay really well the
armature<00:05:45.190> is<00:05:45.280> almost<00:05:45.640> done<00:05:45.970> at<00:05:46.150> this<00:05:46.300> point<00:05:46.630> he

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
armature is almost done at this point he

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.980 
armature is almost done at this point he
just<00:05:46.900> needs<00:05:47.290> some<00:05:47.530> fingers<00:05:48.070> and<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:48.580> thumb<00:05:48.990> I'm

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
just needs some fingers and a thumb I'm

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.920 
just needs some fingers and a thumb I'm
using<00:05:50.230> some<00:05:50.590> really<00:05:50.800> heavy<00:05:51.280> aluminum

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
using some really heavy aluminum

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.120 
using some really heavy aluminum
armature<00:05:52.930> wire<00:05:53.170> I'm<00:05:53.550> just<00:05:54.550> going<00:05:54.760> to<00:05:56.130> tape

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
armature wire I'm just going to tape
