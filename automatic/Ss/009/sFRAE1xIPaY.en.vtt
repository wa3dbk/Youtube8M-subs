00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.120
Hello, my friends!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.660
That’s NS and another issue on «I want to know» show.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.980
You want to know something? I’ll tell you about it!

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.200
Pugna can use her Ultimate to instantly kill illusions.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.460
Therefore, Pugna with Aghanim's Scepter can counter any Illusionists ‘till the end.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.402
She is especially cool against Chaos Knight.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.020
His Ultimate cools down for 140 seconds and Pugna with Aghanim's cool down time is zero.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.620
Fountain can’t detect anything in smoke.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.880
This fact can be very useful for you,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.800
if the enemy knocked your gem out of you and put it on his Fountain.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.420
Of course, most of the heroes have problems getting to the enemy Fountain,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.192
but not Nature's Prophet.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.340
There is also a funny opportunity to mine enemy Fountain

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.996
by Techies with Aghanim's Scepter.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.440
Fountain doesn’t see the mines under Ultimate Techies’ sign.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.440
Nature's Prophet can use Sprout to get himself or an ally to the mountain

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.164
or get them out of there.

00:01:28.164 --> 00:01:30.580
It’s a good way to save yourself from the chase.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.520
But it doesn’t work everywhere, so before trying it you better train a bit.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.220
In one of the previous shows I told you about Clockwerk hiding creeps in the forest

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.927
when he’s playing for Dire.

00:01:44.927 --> 00:01:46.728
But many already knew about it.

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:49.940
But there is a feature just like it, but when you’re playing for Radiant.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.900
And only few know about it. Let’s have a look!

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.320
First of all, you need to use Tango on that tree.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.020
After that wait for creeps and try to get as much of them as you can to your box.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.240
Break left block and make creeps run into the forest.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.340
Now block their way back.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.140
Usually you can’t hide more than two creeps that way.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.980
But even that is more than enough to push the line to your side

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.600
and you let you get some free money and experience from your tower.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.080
When you are playing for beloved by everybody Pudge,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.300
you can trick backdoor protection of an enemy base.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.700
For that you need to hook your creep closer to enemy base.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.160
Start doing it from far away to prevent the enemy from noticing you.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.360
You will need about one minute of time and mana for five hooks.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.660
As you can see, there are no creeps on the line around you.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.252
But backdoor doesn’t work.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.660
And that’s all thanks to a creep hidden in the forest.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.180
That’s it, guys, features are out again, so push «Like» button, subscribe to channel,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.840
and now we’ve got titles with me failing.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.780
You can also watch our last video – do so, if you missed it.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.440
Come back in a week, I assure you, I’ll tell you something more. Goodbye!

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.880
Am I alright here?

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.480
I’m so cool!

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.340
His Ultimate cools down for 140 seconds and Pugna with Aghanim's cool down time is zero.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.460
One sec… Blah-blah… After this we wait for creeps.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.300
I’m all out of art again!

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.320
Yeah…

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.060
Features are over again, so… Bye, everybody!
