spinnerbait or swim jig
honestly<00:01:01.379> I've<00:01:01.590> gotten<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.980> where<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.129> thought

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
honestly I've gotten to where I thought

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.149 
honestly I've gotten to where I thought
it's<00:01:02.489> better<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.329> less<00:01:03.359> anymore<00:01:04.350> I'll

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it's better but a lot less anymore I'll

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
it's better but a lot less anymore I'll
still<00:01:05.489> throw<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:05.970> especially<00:01:06.840> around<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
still throw one especially around the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
still throw one especially around the
shad<00:01:07.500> spawn<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.360> pre<00:01:09.630> spawn

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
shad spawn or you know pre spawn

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.780 
shad spawn or you know pre spawn
timeframe<00:01:10.500> I'll<00:01:11.070> use<00:01:11.369> them<00:01:11.520> side-by-side

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
timeframe I'll use them side-by-side

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.030 
timeframe I'll use them side-by-side
I'll<00:01:12.330> use<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.659> both<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> same<00:01:13.799> day

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
I'll use them both you know the same day

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.210 
I'll use them both you know the same day
same<00:01:14.400> conditions<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.409> me<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> ChatterBait

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
same conditions but for me a ChatterBait

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
same conditions but for me a ChatterBait
it<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.970> seems<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:19.020> better

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
it just seems a little bit better

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.550 
it just seems a little bit better
overall<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> does<00:01:21.119> better<00:01:21.560> more

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
overall it's like it does better more

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.830 
overall it's like it does better more
times<00:01:22.860> than<00:01:23.280> experiment<00:01:24.180> does<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> seem<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
times than experiment does and I seem to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.179 
times than experiment does and I seem to
catch<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.350> bit<00:01:25.530> bigger<00:01:25.710> fish<00:01:26.009> on

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
catch a little bit bigger fish on

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.770 
catch a little bit bigger fish on
average<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.729> chatter<00:01:27.060> rate<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> do

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
average with the chatter rate that I do
