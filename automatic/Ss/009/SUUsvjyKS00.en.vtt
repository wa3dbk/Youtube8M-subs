what<00:03:56.190> exactly<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.819> because<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:57.299> just<00:03:57.359> a

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
what exactly it is because it's just a

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.059 
what exactly it is because it's just a
big<00:03:57.720> warehouse<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.530> then<00:03:58.769> there<00:03:58.919> are

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
big warehouse and then there are
