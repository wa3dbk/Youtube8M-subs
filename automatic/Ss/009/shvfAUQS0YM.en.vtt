00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.689
 hi girls after recording the first 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.940
 video has already encouraged me to record a 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.519
 second and nothing in this is I'm going to tell 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.230
 something super super super cortito I'm going to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.839
 teach three jumbos that they sent me from 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 astor I guess you'll know them 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.440
 all but good I'm going to teach you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.730
 to see then some clumsiness that 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.500
 do not know them yet how well 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 watched television or that he has not seen the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.200
 outline here are these these months have 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.540
 sent to them to prove them 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.830
 it's me I have not bought them exactly no 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.800
 is the price they have but try 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.490
 inform me and nothing is the black that is the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.490
 ultra black 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.940
 good the ultra black number 700 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.730
 it would be the green that is the 300 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.390
 my showcase 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.260
 and the blue that is the intense 200 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.930
 I teach you 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.930
 sometimes it seems that they come to fire 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.430
 I suppose you have seen them in the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.110
 the ads are spectacular 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.110
 super intense colors 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.119
 are these 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.760
 and what can I say about them because 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.250
 they have a pretty durability put 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.450
 comfortable high color intensity the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 intensity of color you can appreciate 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.159
 which is that it's amazing that with a 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.229
 last we have the whole marked eye what 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.630
 what I do is blur it but that 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.780
 I tell you that you have to have a lot of 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.520
 care and quickness because if you do not 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.640
 can blur because they stay on fire 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.140
 and it is true that they last a 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.700
 heap in the eye that does not form creases 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.560
 I used them as tests then what 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.570
 what I do is apply a little and what 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.250
 I extend it quickly and then 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.490
 applied the base in the shadow above 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.920
 because what is the color itself as 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.989
 eyeliner can be worth to me but as for 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.970
 shadow for example the blue part 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.730
 too refreshing and black what 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.110
 uses the water line and pretty well 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.970
 so nothing this is a small review 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.190
 to show you what I tell you are the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.860
 24 hours perfect state and sado lainer 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.489
 waterproof and really that is waterproof 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.810
 because then it costs to remove them from 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.739
 astor 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.739
 from astor 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.320
 and nothing more than to count theirs 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.200
 I have these three colors and I tell you 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.820
 I do not know if any more and look well 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.930
 result is pretty good the truth 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.730
 what for what they are 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.050
 I would like them to have been a 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.270
 little less intense or that they have 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.570
 sent a brown color for example but 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.160
 Well this is what what is so 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.760
 that nothing girls I hope that I have 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.210
 liked the short video and that you follow me 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.100
 watching continue subscribing sct worth then 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.730
 a little kiss and we continue to see each other 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.730
 next video
