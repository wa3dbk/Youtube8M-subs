00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
understand how they're laid out so let's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
understand how they're laid out so let's
take<00:01:04.649> a<00:01:04.680> closer<00:01:05.009> look<00:01:07.009> so<00:01:08.009> you<00:01:08.039> might<00:01:08.460> be

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
take a closer look so you might be

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.260 
take a closer look so you might be
surprised<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.300> notice<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.930> only<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:12.149> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
surprised to notice that only one of the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
surprised to notice that only one of the
Black<00:01:12.509> Keys<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.810> he<00:01:13.140> give<00:01:13.289> an<00:01:13.410> octave<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.040> G

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
Black Keys and he give an octave the G

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.109 
Black Keys and he give an octave the G
sharp<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.880> flat<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:16.040> actually<00:01:17.040> located<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
sharp a flat is actually located in the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.600 
sharp a flat is actually located in the
middle<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.409> cracks<00:01:19.770> between<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> white

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
middle of the cracks between the white

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.289 
middle of the cracks between the white
keys<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.439> other<00:01:22.619> black<00:01:23.580> notes<00:01:23.970> are

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
keys all the other black notes are

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.429 
keys all the other black notes are
either<00:01:24.510> shifted<00:01:25.080> left<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> crack<00:01:26.640> or

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
either shifted left of the crack or

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.010 
either shifted left of the crack or
right<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.680> crack<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> let's<00:01:30.630> take<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> look

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
right of the crack so let's take a look

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.800 
right of the crack so let's take a look
at<00:01:31.110> those<00:01:31.259> other<00:01:31.470> notes<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:32.600> c-sharp<00:01:33.600> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
at those other notes right c-sharp and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.910 
at those other notes right c-sharp and
d-flat<00:01:34.040> has<00:01:35.040> shifted<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.520> bit<00:01:35.580> left<00:01:36.590> D<00:01:37.590> sharp

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
d-flat has shifted a bit left D sharp

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.450 
d-flat has shifted a bit left D sharp
and<00:01:38.130> E<00:01:38.220> flat<00:01:38.490> shifted<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:40.009> F<00:01:41.009> sharp

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and E flat shifted a bit right F sharp

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
and E flat shifted a bit right F sharp
and<00:01:41.700> G<00:01:41.850> flat<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.240> shifted<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> bit<00:01:42.960> left<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.650> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and G flat is shifted a bit left and a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.980 
and G flat is shifted a bit left and a
sharp<00:01:45.119> B<00:01:45.479> flat<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.140> shifted<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.920> bit<00:01:47.070> right<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
sharp B flat is shifted a bit right so I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.260 
sharp B flat is shifted a bit right so I
just<00:01:49.409> want<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.740> point<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.340> things<00:01:50.400> out<00:01:50.850> make

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
just want to point these things out make

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.490 
just want to point these things out make
sure<00:01:51.299> you're<00:01:51.600> aware<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.290> you're

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
sure you're aware of this because you're

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.499 
sure you're aware of this because you're
going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> need<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> make<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.130> small

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
going to need to make very small

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.649 
going to need to make very small
adjustments<00:01:54.509> depending<00:01:55.049> on

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
adjustments depending on

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.069 
adjustments depending on
what's<00:01:55.899> your<00:01:56.079> plan<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.360> might<00:01:58.509> ask<00:01:58.659> why

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
what's your plan so you might ask why

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.200 
what's your plan so you might ask why
are<00:01:59.320> these<00:01:59.500> kids<00:01:59.829> shifted<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.880> way<00:02:00.909> they're

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
are these kids shifted the way they're

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.620 
are these kids shifted the way they're
shifted<00:02:01.890> well<00:02:02.890> here's<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.490> answer<00:02:03.520> it's<00:02:04.270> so

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
shifted well here's the answer it's so

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.920 
shifted well here's the answer it's so
you<00:02:05.289> can<00:02:05.350> fit<00:02:05.829> your<00:02:05.950> fingers<00:02:06.610> in<00:02:06.909> between<00:02:07.360> the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
you can fit your fingers in between the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.859 
you can fit your fingers in between the
black<00:02:08.229> notes<00:02:08.819> which<00:02:09.819> gives<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> option

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
black notes which gives you the option

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.520 
black notes which gives you the option
of<00:02:10.929> playing<00:02:11.200> any<00:02:11.500> white<00:02:12.040> key<00:02:12.370> anywhere<00:02:13.530> along

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
of playing any white key anywhere along

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.140 
of playing any white key anywhere along
its<00:02:14.950> entire<00:02:15.160> length<00:02:17.099> which<00:02:18.099> leads<00:02:18.459> us<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
its entire length which leads us to the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.320 
its entire length which leads us to the
next<00:02:19.390> aspect<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> keys<00:02:21.160> which<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.760> how

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
next aspect of the keys which is how

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.589 
next aspect of the keys which is how
long<00:02:22.360> they<00:02:22.810> are<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.819> just<00:02:25.000> notice<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.450> white

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
long they are so just notice the white

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.710 
long they are so just notice the white
keys<00:02:25.870> are<00:02:26.050> about<00:02:26.170> six<00:02:26.590> inches<00:02:26.950> long<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
keys are about six inches long and the
