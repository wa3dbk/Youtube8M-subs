characters<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.059> I<00:00:53.090> think<00:00:53.330> for<00:00:53.630> just<00:00:54.559> the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
characters and I think for just the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.920 
characters and I think for just the
story<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:55.190> general<00:00:55.670> it's<00:00:55.850> it<00:00:56.150> follows<00:00:56.660> the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
story in general it's it follows the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.260 
story in general it's it follows the
quintessential<00:00:57.440> horror<00:00:58.309> film<00:00:58.640> plot<00:00:58.970> lines

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
quintessential horror film plot lines

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.020 
quintessential horror film plot lines
but<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.410> characters<00:01:00.920> are<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:01.370> unique<00:01:01.790> in

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
but the characters are so unique in

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.770 
but the characters are so unique in
themselves<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.720> I<00:01:03.020> think<00:01:03.440> that's<00:01:03.830> very<00:01:03.920> cool

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
always get like this I just think this

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.500 
always get like this I just think this
is<00:04:26.690> just<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:28.040> coolest<00:04:28.310> thing<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:29.060> be<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.210> part

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
is just the coolest thing to be a part

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.590 
is just the coolest thing to be a part
of<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.880> just<00:04:31.880> think<00:04:31.940> it's<00:04:32.120> gonna<00:04:32.240> take<00:04:32.450> the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
of and I just think it's gonna take the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.000 
of and I just think it's gonna take the
world<00:04:32.780> by<00:04:32.930> storm<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.380> really<00:04:33.650> do

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
world by storm I really do

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.650 
world by storm I really do
I<00:04:34.040> think<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.490> genre<00:04:34.760> is<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.240> wave<00:04:35.419> of<00:04:35.450> the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
I think this genre is the wave of the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.030 
I think this genre is the wave of the
future<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:37.190> think<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:38.230> once<00:04:39.230> people<00:04:39.470> see

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
future and I think that once people see

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.420 
future and I think that once people see
the<00:04:40.669> potential<00:04:41.240> behind<00:04:41.419> it<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:42.530> getting<00:04:43.070> to

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
the potential behind it of getting to

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.240 
the potential behind it of getting to
