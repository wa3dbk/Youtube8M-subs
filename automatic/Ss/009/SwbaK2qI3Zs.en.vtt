00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.250 
about any other make and model I think
that<00:05:33.460> this<00:05:33.550> is<00:05:33.700> just<00:05:33.850> an<00:05:34.000> iPhone<00:05:34.150> thing<00:05:34.720> but

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
that this is just an iPhone thing but

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.610 
that this is just an iPhone thing but
one<00:05:35.650> side<00:05:35.919> is<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:36.370> fish<00:05:37.270> island<00:05:37.780> and<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.440> other

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
one side is a fish island and the other

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.650 
one side is a fish island and the other
side<00:05:39.010> can<00:05:39.610> be<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:40.150> macro<00:05:40.990> lens<00:05:41.289> or<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:41.830> wide-angle
