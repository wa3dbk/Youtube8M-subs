position<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.909> honest<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.240> probably<00:01:45.420> would

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
position to be honest I probably would

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.179 
position to be honest I probably would
have<00:01:45.689> played<00:01:45.899> him<00:01:45.960> at<00:01:46.079> cam<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> wanted<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
have played him at cam but I wanted to

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.399 
have played him at cam but I wanted to
play<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.670> person<00:01:48.000> who<00:01:48.090> he<00:01:48.180> had<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.390> cam<00:01:48.570> cam<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
play the person who he had at cam cam so

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.469 
play the person who he had at cam cam so
that's<00:01:49.619> why<00:01:49.799> he<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.299> right

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that's why he is there in the right

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.999 
that's why he is there in the right
midfield<00:01:51.840> position<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.500> team<00:01:52.649> season

Alexis Sanchez and who is very good but
underused<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.399> didn't<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:56.729> use<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
underused I didn't really use and the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
underused I didn't really use and the
reason<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.420> didn't<00:01:57.570> only<00:01:57.659> use<00:01:57.780> him<00:01:57.990> you'll<00:01:58.439> know

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
reason I didn't only use him you'll know

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.530 
reason I didn't only use him you'll know
why<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.159> because<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> team<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
why is because we have the team of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
why is because we have the team of
season<00:02:00.810> Eden<00:02:01.140> Hazard<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.890> left<00:02:02.070> midfield

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that wing is obviously Eden hazards wing

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.620 
that wing is obviously Eden hazards wing
the<00:02:11.730> reason<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.239> Eden
