00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
they are loosely packed together so they

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.130 
they are loosely packed together so they
can<00:00:56.100> move<00:00:56.280> past<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.940> another<00:00:59.270> in<00:01:00.270> ice<00:01:00.480> they

can move past one another in ice they

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.600 
can move past one another in ice they
are<00:01:01.200> tightly<00:01:01.560> packed<00:01:01.890> together<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.460> they

are tightly packed together and they

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.080 
are tightly packed together and they
can't<00:01:02.880> change<00:01:03.210> places<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:05.610> did<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.909> know

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
can't change places but did you know

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.999 
can't change places but did you know
there<00:01:06.329> are<00:01:06.360> actually<00:01:06.479> multiple<00:01:06.930> solid<00:01:07.619> phases

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
there are actually multiple solid phases

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.310 
there are actually multiple solid phases
of<00:01:08.100> ice<00:01:08.280> there's<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> hexagonal<00:01:09.900> ice<00:01:09.990> phase

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
of ice there's a hexagonal ice phase

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.310 
of ice there's a hexagonal ice phase
that<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.920> stable<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.640> negative<00:01:12.119> 150<00:01:12.990> degrees

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that is stable at negative 150 degrees

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.800 
that is stable at negative 150 degrees
Fahrenheit

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
Fahrenheit

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
Fahrenheit
in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> cubic<00:01:16.499> ice<00:01:16.679> phase<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.490> only

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
in the cubic ice phase that is only

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.419 
in the cubic ice phase that is only
stable<00:01:18.090> below<00:01:18.780> negative<00:01:19.170> 150<00:01:20.159> degrees

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
stable below negative 150 degrees

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.649 
stable below negative 150 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:22.789> how<00:01:23.789> does<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.119> fit<00:01:24.420> into

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
Fahrenheit so how does this fit into

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
Fahrenheit so how does this fit into
shape<00:01:25.020> memory<00:01:25.229> materials<00:01:25.950> these<00:01:26.880> materials

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
shape memory materials these materials

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.410 
shape memory materials these materials
also<00:01:27.719> have<00:01:28.049> multiple<00:01:28.289> solid<00:01:28.979> phases<00:01:29.429> there<00:01:30.329> is

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
also have multiple solid phases there is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.149 
also have multiple solid phases there is
a<00:01:30.450> low<00:01:30.689> temperature<00:01:30.719> phase<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.859> called

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
a low temperature phase that is called

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.660 
a low temperature phase that is called
martensite<00:01:33.889> but<00:01:34.889> if<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.100> increase<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
martensite but if we increase the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.789 
martensite but if we increase the
temperature<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.389> atomic<00:01:36.810> alignment<00:01:37.289> changes

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
temperature the atomic alignment changes

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.200 
temperature the atomic alignment changes
into<00:01:38.130> another<00:01:38.429> phase<00:01:38.670> called<00:01:39.420> austenite

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.310 

so<00:01:43.210> at<00:01:43.300> low<00:01:43.480> temperatures<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:44.230> have

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
so at low temperatures we have

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.380 
so at low temperatures we have
martensite<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.130> at<00:01:45.430> high<00:01:45.640> temperatures<00:01:46.150> we

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
martensite and at high temperatures we

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.790 
martensite and at high temperatures we
have<00:01:46.510> austenite<00:01:49.080> how<00:01:50.080> do<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.260> set<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.530> memory

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
have austenite how do we set the memory

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
have austenite how do we set the memory
shape<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:53.050> set<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.380> shape<00:01:53.620> that<00:01:53.650> we<00:01:53.920> want<00:01:54.070> we

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
shape to set the shape that we want we

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.550 
shape to set the shape that we want we
must<00:01:55.060> hold<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.360> material<00:01:55.810> in<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.080> austenite

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
must hold the material in the austenite

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.830 
must hold the material in the austenite
phase<00:01:56.620> at<00:01:57.100> high<00:01:57.340> temperatures<00:01:57.910> here<00:01:58.450> we<00:01:58.720> have

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
phase at high temperatures here we have

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.900 
phase at high temperatures here we have
used<00:01:59.080> screws<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.680> hold<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.040> wire<00:02:00.190> in<00:02:00.220> place<00:02:00.610> on

used screws to hold the wire in place on

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.180 
used screws to hold the wire in place on
a<00:02:00.970> metal<00:02:01.300> plate<00:02:01.330> which<00:02:02.200> we<00:02:02.380> then<00:02:02.530> put<00:02:02.800> into<00:02:03.010> the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
a metal plate which we then put into the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.249 
a metal plate which we then put into the
furnace<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.729> heat<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:06.900> inside<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.050> furnace

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259

furnace to heat it inside the furnace
the<00:02:08.709> wire<00:02:08.860> transforms<00:02:09.789> into<00:02:10.240> austenite<00:02:10.720> which

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the wire transforms into austenite which

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.160 
the wire transforms into austenite which
sets<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.709> memory<00:02:12.010> shape<00:02:12.480> when<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.510> cool<00:02:13.840> down

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
sets the memory shape when we cool down

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.890 
sets the memory shape when we cool down
it<00:02:14.500> transforms<00:02:15.370> into<00:02:15.580> martensite<00:02:16.000> but<00:02:16.810> it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it transforms into martensite but it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.280 
it transforms into martensite but it
does<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.350> without<00:02:17.620> changing<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.430> shape<00:02:18.459> in

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
does so without changing the shape in

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.900 
does so without changing the shape in
the<00:02:20.290> graphic<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.010> see<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.520> atoms

have<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.209> martensite<00:02:22.660> structure<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.739> they

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
have the martensite structure but they

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.590 
have the martensite structure but they
align<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.520> zig-zag<00:02:24.820> pattern

so<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.959> overall<00:02:26.350> shape<00:02:26.620> does<00:02:27.010> not<00:02:27.250> change<00:02:28.050> now

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
so the overall shape does not change now

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.650 
so the overall shape does not change now
we<00:02:29.110> can<00:02:29.410> bend<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.709> wire<00:02:29.950> however<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.850> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
we can bend the wire however we like the

we can bend the wire however we like the
material<00:02:32.200> does<00:02:32.440> not<00:02:32.470> change<00:02:32.890> phase<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
material does not change phase but the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.390 
material does not change phase but the
alignment<00:02:34.450> pattern<00:02:34.780> changes<00:02:35.380> slightly<00:02:35.650> so

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
alignment pattern changes slightly so

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.660 
alignment pattern changes slightly so
they<00:02:36.640> align<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.450> direction<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:39.130> results

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
they align in one direction this results

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.199 
they align in one direction this results
in<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.910> permanent<00:02:40.180> shape<00:02:40.630> change<00:02:41.880> now<00:02:42.880> if<00:02:43.090> we

in a permanent shape change now if we

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.000 
in a permanent shape change now if we
heat<00:02:43.420> up<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.660> wire<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:44.470> goes<00:02:44.650> through<00:02:44.920> the

unlike before this time the shape
doesn't<00:03:20.560> change<00:03:20.799> but<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.310> goes<00:03:21.430> right<00:03:21.519> back<00:03:21.730> to
