00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.109 
even invisible enemies that you have to
sort<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.350> paint<00:01:59.560> with<00:01:59.859> this<00:02:00.039> light<00:02:00.399> i'm<00:02:00.640> going

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
sort of paint with this light i'm going

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.459 
sort of paint with this light i'm going
to<00:02:01.179> be<00:02:01.299> able<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.570> take<00:02:01.749> them<00:02:01.929> out<00:02:02.079> before<00:02:02.259> they

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
to be able to take them out before they

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.550 
to be able to take them out before they
face<00:02:02.890> back<00:02:03.159> out<00:02:03.399> of<00:02:03.579> visibility<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:05.049> there's

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
face back out of visibility so there's

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.800 
face back out of visibility so there's
some<00:02:05.740> other<00:02:05.920> dynamics<00:02:06.640> there<00:02:06.789> in<00:02:06.999> that<00:02:07.149> great

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
some other dynamics there in that great

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.540 
some other dynamics there in that great
multiplayer<00:02:08.259> which<00:02:08.890> obviously<00:02:09.250> really

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
multiplayer which obviously really

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.760 
multiplayer which obviously really
important<00:02:10.240> then<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.319> single-player

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
important then the single-player

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.530 
important then the single-player
experience<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.640> know<00:02:12.760> we're<00:02:12.940> taking<00:02:13.300> full

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
experience you know we're taking full

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.750 
experience you know we're taking full
advantage<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.530> wii<00:02:14.680> motion<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.370> know<00:02:15.490> we

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
advantage of the wii motion you know we

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.750 
advantage of the wii motion you know we
have<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.990> this<00:02:17.560> uh<00:02:17.590> we<00:02:18.250> use<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.580> wiimote

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
have the this this uh we use the wiimote

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.180 
have the this this uh we use the wiimote
not<00:02:19.330> only<00:02:19.569> just<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.840> point<00:02:20.110> shoot<00:02:20.470> but<00:02:21.069> we've

not only just a point shoot but we've
got<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> lot<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.640> mechanics<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.360> allows<00:02:22.690> you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
got a lot of mechanics that allows you

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.900 
got a lot of mechanics that allows you
to<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:24.430> know<00:02:24.550> bank<00:02:25.120> around

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
to you know bank around

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.720 
to you know bank around
with<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.690> using<00:02:27.320> using<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.920> guided<00:02:28.580> missile

with the using using a guided missile

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.360 
with the using using a guided missile
kind<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.420> approach<00:02:30.140> there's<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.830> weapon<00:02:31.220> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
kind of approach there's a weapon that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.850 
kind of approach there's a weapon that
on<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.670> secondary<00:02:32.180> charge<00:02:32.630> mode<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.380> goes

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
on the secondary charge mode it goes

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.190 
on the secondary charge mode it goes
into<00:02:34.040> kind<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.430> bolo<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.090> allows<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.990> to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
into kind of a bolo and allows you to

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.580 
into kind of a bolo and allows you to
likes<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.830> people<00:02:37.250> around<00:02:37.660> around<00:02:38.660> corners<00:02:39.260> or

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
likes to people around around corners or

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.800 
likes to people around around corners or
if<00:02:40.250> they're<00:02:40.490> hit<00:02:40.730> duck<00:02:40.970> down<00:02:41.150> behind<00:02:41.210> cover

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
if they're hit duck down behind cover

alright<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:53.910> we<00:02:54.060> knows<00:02:54.240> multiplayer<00:02:54.960> we<00:02:55.620> know

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
alright so we knows multiplayer we know

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.510 
alright so we knows multiplayer we know
it's<00:02:55.980> online<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:57.450> dreaded<00:02:57.810> friend<00:02:58.110> codes

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
it's online the dreaded friend codes

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.940 
it's online the dreaded friend codes
yeah<00:02:59.520> we<00:03:00.300> have<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.510> work<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.110> well<00:03:01.440> we're

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
yeah we have that work out well we're

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.130 
yeah we have that work out well we're
working<00:03:02.460> on<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.030> what<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.450> what<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> short

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
working on it is what is what the short

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.350 
working on it is what is what the short
answer<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:05.040> know<00:03:05.130> we've<00:03:05.400> got<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.640> multiple

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
answer is you know we've got a multiple

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.420 
answer is you know we've got a multiple
contingencies<00:03:07.290> there<00:03:07.560> we're<00:03:08.280> working

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
contingencies there we're working

don't support friend codes but what
we're<00:03:19.350> promising<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.190> minimally<00:03:20.880> it's<00:03:21.330> going

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
we're promising is minimally it's going

to be as good of an experience or better

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.300 
to be as good of an experience or better
than<00:03:23.520> then<00:03:24.300> say<00:03:24.540> Mario<00:03:25.050> Kart<00:03:25.380> which<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.920> wasn't

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
