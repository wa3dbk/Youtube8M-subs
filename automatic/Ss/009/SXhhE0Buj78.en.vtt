00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is like a wave I don't know what's

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.740 
is like a wave I don't know what's
happened<00:00:38.879> he<00:00:38.940> must<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.180> had<00:00:39.300> some<00:00:39.510> really

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
happened he must have had some really

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.049 
happened he must have had some really
bad<00:00:40.200> contact<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.370> he<00:00:41.430> grows<00:00:41.670> ons<00:00:41.910> got

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
bad contact but because he grows ons got

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.209 
bad contact but because he grows ons got
no<00:00:42.210> wing<00:00:42.420> raikkonen<00:00:43.079> has<00:00:43.530> no<00:00:43.800> front<00:00:44.070> wing

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
no wing raikkonen has no front wing

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.740 
no wing raikkonen has no front wing
either<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.640> there's<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> few<00:00:44.940> cars<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.510> think

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
either so there's a few cars here think

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680 
either so there's a few cars here think
that's<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.469> manner<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.239> Stephens<00:00:48.239> ahead<00:00:48.480> he's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that's the manner of Stephens ahead he's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.180 
that's the manner of Stephens ahead he's
got<00:00:48.870> no<00:00:48.989> front<00:00:49.289> wing<00:00:49.410> either<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.800> we're

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
got no front wing either so we're

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.619 
got no front wing either so we're
picking<00:00:50.460> our<00:00:50.550> way<00:00:50.670> through<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.090> cars<00:00:51.329> quite

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
picking our way through these cars quite

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.569 
picking our way through these cars quite
easily<00:00:51.949> obviously<00:00:52.949> they've<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.190> no<00:00:53.340> wing

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
easily obviously they've got no wing

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.160 
easily obviously they've got no wing
they're<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.270> easy<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> pick<00:00:54.870> off<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
they're going to be easy to pick off and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
they're going to be easy to pick off and
looks<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.649> red<00:00:55.800> blur<00:00:56.010> caveat<00:00:56.430> has<00:00:56.940> no

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
looks like the red blur caveat has no

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
looks like the red blur caveat has no
friend<00:00:57.420> Weezer<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> time<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.620> thought

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
friend Weezer so at the time I thought

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.229 
friend Weezer so at the time I thought
that<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> difficulty<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.850> really<00:01:00.090> low

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that the difficulty was really low

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880 
that the difficulty was really low
because<00:01:00.449> obviously<00:01:01.140> these<00:01:01.410> cars<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.739> going

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
because obviously these cars are going

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
because obviously these cars are going
really<00:01:02.039> slowly<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.670> hang<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.570> must

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
really slowly like hang on but they must

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.880 
really slowly like hang on but they must
be<00:01:03.870> something<00:01:04.019> wrong<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.470> cars<00:01:04.710> cuz

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
be something wrong with these cars cuz

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.770 
be something wrong with these cars cuz
they're<00:01:05.010> breaking<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.600> 10,000<00:01:06.600> miles

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
they're breaking about 10,000 miles

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
they're breaking about 10,000 miles

subscribe to him and I've run a new
wheel<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.070> much<00:02:56.190> better<00:02:56.310> than<00:02:56.460> the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
wheel and it's so much better than the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.070 
wheel and it's so much better than the
wheel<00:02:56.940> I've<00:02:57.060> got<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.270> moment<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.570> hopefully<00:02:57.930> I

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
wheel I've got the moment so hopefully I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.200 
wheel I've got the moment so hopefully I
won't<00:02:58.410> crash<00:02:58.740> 24-7<00:02:59.460> in<00:02:59.550> my<00:02:59.640> videos<00:02:59.910> from<00:03:00.060> now

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
won't crash 24-7 in my videos from now

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.880 
won't crash 24-7 in my videos from now
on<00:03:00.360> because<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.380> situation<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
on because that's the situation the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.560 
on because that's the situation the
moment<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.280> can't<00:03:02.670> do<00:03:03.120> two<00:03:03.300> things<00:03:03.330> at

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
moment I just can't do two things at

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.160 
moment I just can't do two things at
once<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.870> can't<00:03:04.050> break<00:03:04.350> go<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.450> turn<00:03:06.450> at<00:03:06.900> the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
once I can't break go and turn at the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.600 
once I can't break go and turn at the
same<00:03:07.320> time<00:03:07.530> because<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.400> impossible

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
same time because it's just impossible

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.330 
same time because it's just impossible
like<00:03:09.090> I'm<00:03:09.420> having<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.960> use<00:03:10.140> buttons<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.310> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
like I'm having to use buttons on a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.510 
like I'm having to use buttons on a
wheel<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:12.360> go<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.690> stop<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:13.860> just<00:03:14.220> like

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
wheel to go and stop and it's just like

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.000 
wheel to go and stop and it's just like
using<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.450> pad<00:03:15.690> /<00:03:16.050> wheel<00:03:16.350> at<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> same<00:03:16.800> time

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
using a pad / wheel at the same time

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.590 
using a pad / wheel at the same time
it's<00:03:17.250> really<00:03:17.550> difficult<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.240> can't<00:03:18.450> do

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
it's really difficult and so I can't do

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.810 
it's really difficult and so I can't do
it<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.930> I'm<00:03:19.770> using<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.280> as<00:03:20.430> an<00:03:20.520> excuse

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
it and I'm using that as an excuse

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.890 
it and I'm using that as an excuse
hopefully<00:03:21.150> you'll<00:03:21.270> see<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.420> difference<00:03:21.720> when<00:03:21.870> i

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
hopefully you'll see a difference when i

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.060 
hopefully you'll see a difference when i
get<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.140> wheel<00:03:22.290> i<00:03:22.320> can't<00:03:22.650> wait<00:03:22.830> for<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
get the wheel i can't wait for it to

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.530 
get the wheel i can't wait for it to
come<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> post<00:03:23.459> i<00:03:23.730> can't<00:03:24.090> wait<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.480> start

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
come the post i can't wait to start

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.510 
come the post i can't wait to start
using<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:25.020> hopefully<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.560> will<00:03:25.709> see<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
using it hopefully you will see the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.880 
using it hopefully you will see the
difference<00:03:26.670> between<00:03:27.360> using<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:28.140> broken

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
difference between using this broken

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.280 
difference between using this broken
wheel<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.340> using<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.450> new<00:03:30.630> wheel<00:03:30.870> which<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.260> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
wheel and using the new wheel which is a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.470 
wheel and using the new wheel which is a
lot<00:03:31.500> better<00:03:31.650> quality<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.340> better<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.240> drive

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
lot better quality and better to drive

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.590 
lot better quality and better to drive
with<00:03:33.750> hopefully<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.800> yeah<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.640> just<00:03:36.209> can't<00:03:36.420> wait

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
with hopefully so yeah I just can't wait

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.740 
with hopefully so yeah I just can't wait
it's<00:03:36.900> just<00:03:37.110> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.320> be<00:03:37.380> awesome<00:03:38.100> and

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
it's just going to be awesome and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.630 
it's just going to be awesome and
hopefully<00:03:39.750> I'll<00:03:40.350> be<00:03:40.410> better<00:03:40.770> rfactor<00:03:41.490> then

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
hopefully I'll be better rfactor then

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.600 
hopefully I'll be better rfactor then
talking<00:03:42.510> about<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.380> kind<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.709> see<00:03:43.770> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
talking about you can kind of see the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.030 
talking about you can kind of see the
young<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.660> comparison<00:03:46.260> already<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:46.830> we

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
young the comparison already like we

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.490 
young the comparison already like we
just<00:03:47.310> overshoot<00:03:47.850> turn<00:03:48.270> one<00:03:48.630> we've<00:03:49.110> ended<00:03:49.380> up

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
just overshoot turn one we've ended up

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.680 
just overshoot turn one we've ended up
in<00:03:49.680> Mexico<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.700> turn<00:03:50.970> one<00:03:51.240> braking

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
in Mexico with that turn one braking

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.960 
in Mexico with that turn one braking

now<00:04:28.759> so<00:04:28.940> hopefully<00:04:29.090> someone<00:04:29.810> have<00:04:30.289> Mullaly

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
now so hopefully someone have Mullaly

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.920 
now so hopefully someone have Mullaly
will<00:04:30.919> crash<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.430> then<00:04:32.270> we<00:04:32.360> can<00:04:32.479> get<00:04:32.630> ahead<00:04:32.870> of

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
will crash and then we can get ahead of

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.390 
will crash and then we can get ahead of
Maldonado<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.560> finishing<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:33.919> points<00:04:34.220> but

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
Maldonado and finishing the points but

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.890 
Maldonado and finishing the points but
even<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.940> mountain<00:04:35.240> are<00:04:35.330> low<00:04:35.449> crash<00:04:35.690> which

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
even a mountain are low crash which

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.260 
even a mountain are low crash which
wouldn't<00:04:36.590> be<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.740> massive<00:04:37.099> surprise<00:04:37.220> then<00:04:37.970> we'd

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
wouldn't be a massive surprise then we'd

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.879 
wouldn't be a massive surprise then we'd
need<00:04:38.449> someone<00:04:38.780> ahead<00:04:39.199> of<00:04:39.319> him<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.590> crash<00:04:39.710> as

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
need someone ahead of him to crash as

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.710 
need someone ahead of him to crash as
well<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.190> be<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.669> point<00:04:40.880> so<00:04:41.030> hopefully<00:04:41.389> we

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
well to be in the point so hopefully we

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.480 
well to be in the point so hopefully we
can<00:04:41.840> get<00:04:41.900> past<00:04:42.080> mal<00:04:42.289> Nardo<00:04:42.650> beautiful<00:04:43.340> met

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
can get past mal Nardo beautiful met

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.740 
can get past mal Nardo beautiful met
with<00:04:43.610> fish<00:04:43.789> and<00:04:43.880> p11<00:04:44.300> it'd<00:04:44.389> be<00:04:44.479> better<00:04:44.599> than

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
with fish and p11 it'd be better than

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.379 
with fish and p11 it'd be better than
fishing<00:04:45.110> in<00:04:45.440> p12<00:04:45.800> so<00:04:46.370> hopefully<00:04:46.669> round<00:04:47.240> this

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
fishing in p12 so hopefully round this

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.999 
fishing in p12 so hopefully round this
final<00:04:47.780> corner<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.169> penultimate<00:04:48.470> corner<00:04:48.710> now

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
we can get a good run into the final

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.140 
we can get a good run into the final
