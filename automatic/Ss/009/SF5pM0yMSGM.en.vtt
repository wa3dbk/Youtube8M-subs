eleven<00:00:56.960> md<00:00:58.039> so<00:00:59.039> let's<00:00:59.219> play<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.699> animation

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
eleven md so let's play this animation

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
eleven md so let's play this animation
I'll<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.969> slow<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.270> down<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.570> bit<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.170> hour

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
I'll just slow it down a bit to the hour

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.300 
I'll just slow it down a bit to the hour
because<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.920> goes<00:01:05.070> quite<00:01:05.280> fast<00:01:06.710> ok<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.100> june

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
because it goes quite fast ok so in june

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.750 
because it goes quite fast ok so in june
14<00:01:08.850> jun<00:01:09.240> 15<00:01:09.780> jun<00:01:10.170> 16<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> close<00:01:11.520> one

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
14 jun 15 jun 16 it's going to close one

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.020 
14 jun 15 jun 16 it's going to close one
closer<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.350> countdown<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
closer you can see the countdown the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.499 
closer you can see the countdown the
distance<00:01:15.479> i<00:01:16.610> want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.759> fine<00:01:19.670> oops<00:01:20.670> june

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
distance i want to be fine oops june

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.859 
distance i want to be fine oops june
twenty<00:01:21.840> third<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:23.340> extremely<00:01:24.180> close<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.420> fact

twenty third is extremely close in fact

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.530 
twenty third is extremely close in fact
you<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.229> find<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.130> its<00:01:27.060> closest

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
you will find that that is its closest
