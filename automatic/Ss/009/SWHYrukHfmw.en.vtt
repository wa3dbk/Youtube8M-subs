did get a 1916 Canadian dime then I used
to<00:02:50.650> go<00:02:50.769> out<00:02:50.799> quite<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.190> bit<00:02:51.280> with<00:02:51.519> my<00:02:51.670> dad<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.209> he

to go out quite a bit with my dad and he

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.530 
to go out quite a bit with my dad and he
would<00:02:52.660> take<00:02:52.840> me<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.470> different<00:02:53.860> parks<00:02:54.100> and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
would take me to different parks and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.170 
would take me to different parks and
find<00:02:55.540> lots<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.959> wheat<00:02:56.440> pennies<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.150> quite<00:02:58.150> a

find lots of wheat pennies and quite a
few<00:02:58.239> silver<00:02:58.600> coins<00:02:58.959> back<00:02:59.560> then<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.160> hard<00:03:00.670> to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
few silver coins back then it's hard to

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.330 
few silver coins back then it's hard to
remember<00:03:01.060> exactly<00:03:01.450> what<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.350> found<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:03.840> searched

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
remember exactly what I found I searched

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.120 
remember exactly what I found I searched
many<00:03:06.340> places<00:03:06.760> since<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.390> time<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:08.130> each

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
throughout our lives these up here

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.570 
throughout our lives these up here
happen<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.930> things<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.710> my<00:03:49.920> daughter<00:03:50.160> has

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
happen to be things that my daughter has

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.960 
happen to be things that my daughter has
won<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.420> past<00:03:52.340> 12<00:03:53.340> years<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.730> her<00:03:53.940> life

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
won in the past 12 years of her life

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.390 
won in the past 12 years of her life
basically<00:03:54.570> because<00:03:55.170> she's<00:03:55.770> been<00:03:55.920> brought<00:03:56.190> up

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
basically because she's been brought up

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.100 
basically because she's been brought up
and<00:03:56.610> born<00:03:56.880> into<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.240> metal<00:03:57.450> detecting<00:03:57.870> world

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
and born into the metal detecting world

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.880 
and born into the metal detecting world
and<00:03:59.270> so<00:04:00.270> she<00:04:00.330> gets<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.720> enter<00:04:01.020> these<00:04:01.170> different

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
and so she gets to enter these different

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.340 
and so she gets to enter these different
hunts<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.340> competitions<00:04:03.060> she's<00:04:03.420> won<00:04:03.720> several

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
hunts and competitions she's won several

medals and several trophies other people

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.450 
medals and several trophies other people
should<00:04:09.270> be<00:04:09.360> doing<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:10.080> would<00:04:10.350> think<00:04:10.530> only

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
should be doing this I would think only

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.150 
should be doing this I would think only
because<00:04:11.580> it's<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:12.000> good<00:04:12.240> history<00:04:12.570> lesson<00:04:13.230> you

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
because it's a good history lesson you

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.070 
because it's a good history lesson you
learn<00:04:14.430> about<00:04:14.580> everything<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.270> find<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.930> mean

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
learn about everything you find I mean

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.870 
learn about everything you find I mean
you<00:04:16.170> could<00:04:16.290> pick<00:04:16.470> up<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.830> nail<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:17.520> you<00:04:17.670> see<00:04:17.850> a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
you could pick up a nail if you see a

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.670 
you could pick up a nail if you see a
task<00:04:18.210> where<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.630> know<00:04:18.780> it's<00:04:18.989> been<00:04:19.170> there<00:04:19.470> for

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
feel another one so I just you know I

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.430 
feel another one so I just you know I
realized<00:05:17.389> right<00:05:17.600> there<00:05:17.840> there's<00:05:18.080> more<00:05:18.320> than

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
realized right there there's more than

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.409 
realized right there there's more than
one<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:19.010> then<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.790> couldn't<00:05:20.120> tell<00:05:20.270> exactly

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
one and then I couldn't tell exactly

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.870 
one and then I couldn't tell exactly
what<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.080> was<00:05:21.260> except<00:05:22.250> for<00:05:22.400> I<00:05:22.430> could<00:05:22.610> see<00:05:22.760> that

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
what it was except for I could see that

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.600 
what it was except for I could see that
they<00:05:23.060> were<00:05:23.120> badges<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.050> so<00:05:24.830> I<00:05:24.860> rolled<00:05:25.310> them<00:05:25.490> up

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
they were badges and so I rolled them up

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.159 
they were badges and so I rolled them up
in<00:05:25.760> a<00:05:25.850> ball<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.360> carried<00:05:26.660> him<00:05:26.720> back<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:27.080> the

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
in a ball and I carried him back to the

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.260 
in a ball and I carried him back to the
car<00:05:27.410> so<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.100> went<00:05:28.250> back<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.669> next<00:05:28.699> day<00:05:28.970> actually

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
car so I went back the next day actually

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.180 
car so I went back the next day actually
they<00:05:29.900> had<00:05:30.020> dropped<00:05:30.290> a<00:05:30.410> tree<00:05:30.620> over<00:05:30.889> the<00:05:30.979> area

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
they had dropped a tree over the area

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.080 
they had dropped a tree over the area
where<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:32.389> found<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:33.500> so<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:34.490> figured<00:05:34.580> okay

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
where I found this and so I figured okay

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.430 
where I found this and so I figured okay
well<00:05:35.270> they'll<00:05:35.570> probably<00:05:35.750> have<00:05:35.900> it<00:05:36.080> cleared<00:05:36.290> up

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
well they'll probably have it cleared up

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.580 
well they'll probably have it cleared up
the<00:05:36.500> next<00:05:36.800> day<00:05:36.919> and<00:05:37.900> sure<00:05:38.900> enough<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:39.260> went<00:05:39.440> back

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
the next day and sure enough I went back

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.790 
the next day and sure enough I went back
the<00:05:39.740> next<00:05:39.770> day<00:05:40.040> and<00:05:40.340> there<00:05:41.120> was<00:05:41.560> four<00:05:42.560> feet<00:05:42.740> of

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
the next day and there was four feet of

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.950 
the next day and there was four feet of
dirt<00:05:43.040> missing<00:05:43.460> out<00:05:43.580> of<00:05:43.699> the<00:05:43.790> area<00:05:44.000> so<00:05:44.600> I<00:05:44.840> think

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
dirt missing out of the area so I think

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.420 
dirt missing out of the area so I think
the<00:05:45.229> only<00:05:45.260> day<00:05:45.530> I<00:05:45.560> could<00:05:45.889> have<00:05:45.979> even<00:05:46.130> found

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
the only day I could have even found

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.150 
the only day I could have even found
this<00:05:46.699> was<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.330> day<00:05:47.510> that<00:05:47.539> I<00:05:47.720> did<00:05:47.960> find<00:05:48.260> it<00:05:51.160> when

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
this was the day that I did find it when

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.980 
this was the day that I did find it when
we<00:05:52.310> returned<00:05:52.699> mark<00:05:53.060> Jenkins<00:05:53.479> will<00:05:53.630> take<00:05:53.810> us
