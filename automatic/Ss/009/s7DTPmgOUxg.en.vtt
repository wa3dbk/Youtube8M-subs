so<00:02:18.880> we<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.270> hit<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> gigahertz<00:02:19.900> while<00:02:20.860> you

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
so we just hit a gigahertz while you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.589 
so we just hit a gigahertz while you
talk<00:02:21.130> us<00:02:21.250> through<00:02:21.280> 8<00:02:21.640> gigahertz<00:02:21.910> our<00:02:22.300> voltage

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
talk us through 8 gigahertz our voltage

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.320 
talk us through 8 gigahertz our voltage
is<00:02:23.200> 220<00:02:23.890> 104<00:02:24.400> yep<00:02:24.880> 2<00:02:25.450> volts<00:02:26.700> we<00:02:27.700> had<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:27.970> envy

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
is 220 104 yep 2 volts we had the envy

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.350 
is 220 104 yep 2 volts we had the envy
on<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.569> HT<00:02:29.050> clock<00:02:29.349> at<00:02:29.590> around<00:02:29.800> 2.4<00:02:30.640> regards<00:02:31.150> so

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
on the HT clock at around 2.4 regards so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.720 
on the HT clock at around 2.4 regards so
just<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.200> little<00:02:32.470> bit<00:02:32.590> above<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.190> default

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
just a little bit above the default

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.259 
just a little bit above the default
values<00:02:34.720> mr.<00:02:35.380> tenser<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.980> peg<00:02:36.220> temperature<00:02:37.060> is

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
values mr. tenser so peg temperature is

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.199 
values mr. tenser so peg temperature is
negative<00:02:37.930> 1<00:02:38.080> 83<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.580> didn't<00:02:39.819> really<00:02:39.880> move

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
negative 1 83 so it didn't really move

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.910 
negative 1 83 so it didn't really move
much<00:02:40.780> at<00:02:40.959> all<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:44.200> have<00:02:44.349> to<00:02:44.440> increase<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.800> red

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
much at all you have to increase the red

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.290 
much at all you have to increase the red

just<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.420> extend<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.810> range<00:02:49.959> we<00:02:50.410> are<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:51.730> have

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
just to extend the range we are we have

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.610 
just to extend the range we are we have
into<00:02:52.180> CTU<00:02:52.510> multiplier<00:02:53.019> so<00:02:53.230> right<00:02:53.380> now<00:02:53.410> we're

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
into CTU multiplier so right now we're

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.720 
into CTU multiplier so right now we're
using<00:02:53.799> for<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.190> pleasure<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.519> x<00:02:55.180> 30<00:02:55.600> x<00:02:56.200> 31.5<00:02:57.160> is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
using for the pleasure of x 30 x 31.5 is

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.360 
using for the pleasure of x 30 x 31.5 is
highest<00:02:58.150> available<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:58.920> there's<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.980> few<00:03:00.160> more

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
highest available so there's a few more

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.699 
highest available so there's a few more
steps<00:03:00.670> up<00:03:01.319> interpreting<00:03:02.319> multiplier

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
steps up interpreting multiplier

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.199 
steps up interpreting multiplier
obviously<00:03:03.489> we<00:03:03.549> can<00:03:03.670> also<00:03:03.790> increase<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
obviously we can also increase the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.170 
obviously we can also increase the
redbox<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.069> at<00:03:06.069> this<00:03:06.220> point<00:03:06.459> we<00:03:06.819> can<00:03:06.970> do<00:03:07.060> you

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
redbox so at this point we can do you

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.210 
redbox so at this point we can do you
know<00:03:07.299> small<00:03:07.599> steps<00:03:08.110> just<00:03:08.620> by<00:03:08.920> adjusting

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
know small steps just by adjusting

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.490 
know small steps just by adjusting
direct<00:03:09.790> clock<00:03:09.970> by<00:03:10.180> 1<00:03:10.330> megahertz<00:03:10.599> which<00:03:11.019> would

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
direct clock by 1 megahertz which would

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.670 
direct clock by 1 megahertz which would
translate<00:03:11.709> into<00:03:11.980> roughly<00:03:12.790> 30<00:03:13.120> minutes<00:03:13.680> in

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
translate into roughly 30 minutes in

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.000 
translate into roughly 30 minutes in
terms<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.130> actual<00:03:15.250> cpu<00:03:15.819> speed

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
terms of the actual cpu speed

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.330 
terms of the actual cpu speed
so<00:03:17.459> i'll<00:03:17.640> actually<00:03:17.819> i'll<00:03:18.269> try<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.510> station

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
so i'll actually i'll try the station

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.339 
so i'll actually i'll try the station
what<00:03:20.340> does<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.549> tool<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.970> are<00:03:21.000> using

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
what does this tool you are using

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.080 
what does this tool you are using
single<00:03:23.349> tool<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.950> basically<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:24.969> a

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
single tool to basically just a

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.430 
single tool to basically just a
multiplier

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.580 

boy<00:03:29.440> fight<00:03:29.740> version<00:03:30.280> occasion

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
boy fight version occasion

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.940 
boy fight version occasion
so<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.519> think<00:03:32.700> there's<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> free<00:03:33.750> wearable<00:03:34.290> Kate

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
so I think there's a free wearable Kate

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.830 
so I think there's a free wearable Kate
and<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:35.400> not<00:03:35.580> especially<00:03:36.060> just<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.599> same

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
and it's not especially just the same

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.390 
and it's not especially just the same
thing

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
thing

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.030 
thing
I<00:03:37.489> don't<00:03:38.150> think<00:03:38.209> it<00:03:38.420> supports<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:39.079> new<00:03:39.650> CP

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
I don't think it supports the new CP

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.980 
I don't think it supports the new CP
with<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.370> later<00:03:40.939> on

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
with this later on

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.830 
with this later on
this<00:03:42.680> tool<00:03:42.920> is<00:03:42.950> optically<00:03:43.610> available<00:03:44.090> for

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
this tool is optically available for

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.690 
this tool is optically available for
available<00:03:45.200> no<00:03:45.710> this<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.070> not<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.280> publicly

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
available no this is not a publicly

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.430 
available no this is not a publicly
available<00:03:46.790> it's<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.540> tool<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.020> use<00:03:48.050> that

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
available it's the tool that we use that

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.020 
available it's the tool that we use that
ultimately<00:03:48.770> tools<00:03:49.070> what<00:03:49.280> case<00:03:49.460> got<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.730> case

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
ultimately tools what case got a case

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:59.320 
ultimately tools what case got a case
that<00:03:50.240> is<00:03:50.590> i'm<00:03:51.590> sure<00:03:51.800> their<00:03:52.010> servers

I'll just in feature XA were made by

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:22.550 
I'll just in feature XA were made by
this<00:04:09.730> for<00:04:09.940> help

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:36.290 

sit<00:04:23.010> back<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.790> same<00:04:34.700> just<00:04:35.700> an<00:04:35.820> example<00:04:35.940> oh

sit back to the same just an example oh

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.390 
sit back to the same just an example oh
yeah<00:04:36.450> basically<00:04:36.900> decrease<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.860> frequency

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
yeah basically decrease the frequency

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.940 
yeah basically decrease the frequency
using<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.270> multiplier<00:04:39.780> or<00:04:39.810> using<00:04:40.440> direct<00:04:40.680> box

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
using the multiplier or using direct box

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.260 
using the multiplier or using direct box
oh<00:04:41.220> just<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.850> little<00:04:41.880> bit<00:04:42.150> flyer<00:04:42.360> for<00:04:42.660> be
