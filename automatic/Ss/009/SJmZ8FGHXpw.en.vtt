with any boot knife one of the key
features<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.649> how<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:48.889> sheet<00:00:49.249> system<00:00:49.519> works

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
features is how the sheet system works

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.299 
features is how the sheet system works
how<00:00:50.210> do<00:00:50.269> you<00:00:50.510> carry<00:00:50.809> this<00:00:50.989> knife<00:00:51.309> effectively

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
how do you carry this knife effectively

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.680 
how do you carry this knife effectively
and<00:00:52.699> people<00:00:53.030> carry<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:53.420> many<00:00:53.600> different

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
and people carry it in many different

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.099 
and people carry it in many different
ways

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
ways

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.559 
ways
one<00:00:54.589> of<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:54.769> first<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:55.729> foremost<00:00:56.179> obvious

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
one of the first and foremost obvious

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.079 
one of the first and foremost obvious
ways<00:00:56.749> is<00:00:57.049> to<00:00:57.229> carry<00:00:57.469> it<00:00:57.559> inside<00:00:57.679> the<00:00:58.039> boot<00:00:58.219> so

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
ways is to carry it inside the boot so

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.869 
ways is to carry it inside the boot so
the<00:00:59.209> knife<00:00:59.359> snaps<00:00:59.959> into<00:01:00.229> place<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.879> slides

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
the knife snaps into place and slides

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.969 
the knife snaps into place and slides
and<00:01:02.209> is<00:01:02.389> retained<00:01:02.749> that<00:01:03.019> way<00:01:03.139> at<00:01:03.319> first<00:01:03.530> if<00:01:03.859> you

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
and is retained that way at first if you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.380 
and is retained that way at first if you
want<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.250> have<00:01:04.339> another<00:01:04.670> level<00:01:04.909> of<00:01:05.089> retention

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
want to have another level of retention

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.170 
want to have another level of retention
you<00:01:06.080> have<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.260> cord<00:01:06.650> lock<00:01:06.830> with<00:01:07.310> some<00:01:07.460> 550<00:01:07.820> cord

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
you have a cord lock with some 550 cord

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.940 
you have a cord lock with some 550 cord
to<00:01:08.690> make<00:01:08.810> sure<00:01:09.020> that<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.320> knife<00:01:09.470> doesn't<00:01:09.710> come

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
to make sure that the knife doesn't come

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.760 
to make sure that the knife doesn't come
out<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:10.670> inside<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.420> boot<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.410> clip

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
out so inside the boot you have a clip

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.040 
out so inside the boot you have a clip
that<00:01:13.010> goes<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:13.730> to<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.910> front<00:01:14.240> we've<00:01:14.750> got<00:01:14.780> it

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
that goes on to the front we've got it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.750 
that goes on to the front we've got it
set<00:01:15.290> up<00:01:15.410> right<00:01:15.620> now<00:01:15.770> for<00:01:16.160> belt<00:01:16.700> carry<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:19.430> next

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
set up right now for belt carry the next

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.820 
set up right now for belt carry the next
way<00:01:19.910> that<00:01:20.210> someone<00:01:20.480> would<00:01:20.660> carry<00:01:20.900> it<00:01:21.080> is<00:01:21.320> on

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
way that someone would carry it is on

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.160 
way that someone would carry it is on
the<00:01:22.220> outside<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.790> your<00:01:22.880> boot<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.660> you<00:01:23.690> can<00:01:23.960> take

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
the outside of your boot so you can take

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.380 
the outside of your boot so you can take
all<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.650> plot<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.280> leather<00:01:25.550> components<00:01:26.270> off

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
all the plot the leather components off

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.490 
all the plot the leather components off
and<00:01:26.930> just<00:01:27.650> have<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:27.890> retained<00:01:28.700> with<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:30.200> snap

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
and just have it retained with the snap

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.770 
and just have it retained with the snap
feature<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.190> this<00:01:31.670> strap<00:01:32.120> would<00:01:32.480> go<00:01:32.660> around

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
feature and this strap would go around

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.080 
feature and this strap would go around
the<00:01:33.230> boot<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:35.500> hold<00:01:36.500> tight<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.640> position

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
the boot and hold tight to the position

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.390 
the boot and hold tight to the position
that<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.330> want<00:01:38.510> we've<00:01:39.140> also<00:01:39.320> created<00:01:39.710> some

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
that you want we've also created some

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.790 
that you want we've also created some
elastic<00:01:41.180> here<00:01:41.420> used<00:01:41.900> elastic<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:42.530> but<00:01:42.710> we

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
elastic here used elastic here but we

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.940 
elastic here used elastic here but we
know<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.190> elastic<00:01:44.030> can<00:01:44.270> stretch<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:45.500> limit

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
know that elastic can stretch to a limit

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.460 
know that elastic can stretch to a limit
and<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:46.670> put<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:46.940> limiter<00:01:47.330> piece<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.870> webbing

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
and so we put a limiter piece of webbing

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.020 
and so we put a limiter piece of webbing
here<00:01:48.830> as<00:01:48.950> well<00:01:49.159> so<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.580> that<00:01:49.760> doesn't

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
here as well so that that doesn't

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.750 
here as well so that that doesn't
overextend<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.960> elastic<00:01:51.650> so<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.520> would<00:01:52.640> be

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
overextend the elastic so that would be

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.110 
overextend the elastic so that would be
outside<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.360> boot<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.470> next<00:01:54.800> way<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.190> belt

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
outside the boot the next way is belt

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.860 
outside the boot the next way is belt
carry<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.600> as<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.080> mentioned<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:59.270> snaps<00:01:59.630> into

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
carry and as I mentioned this snaps into

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.990 
carry and as I mentioned this snaps into
place<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.500> goes<00:02:00.950> onto<00:02:01.190> your<00:02:01.400> belt<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:01.940> a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
place and goes onto your belt with a

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.899 
place and goes onto your belt with a
