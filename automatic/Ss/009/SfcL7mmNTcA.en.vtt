part of the work that i have brought
forth<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> call<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.950> greatness<00:02:44.100> teachings

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
forth is a call to greatness teachings

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.490 
forth is a call to greatness teachings
the<00:02:45.000> teachings<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> course<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.930> congruence

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the teachings of a course in congruence

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.860 
the teachings of a course in congruence
is<00:02:46.710> that<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.940> ego<00:02:48.710> which<00:02:49.710> is<00:02:49.860> a

is that the ego which is a

process the the ego holds itself

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.460 
process the the ego holds itself
separate<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.530> right<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.080> when<00:03:04.080> we<00:03:04.260> move

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
separate and right and when we move

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.980 
separate and right and when we move

beyond that stage of evolution when we

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.250 
beyond that stage of evolution when we
transcend<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.310> truth<00:03:08.910> we<00:03:09.330> realize<00:03:10.230> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
transcend it in truth we realize that

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.480 
transcend it in truth we realize that
their<00:03:11.090> there<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.300> no<00:03:12.630> right<00:03:13.620> or<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:16.490> their

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
their there is no right or that their

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.110 
their there is no right or that their
that<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.180> all<00:03:18.450> right<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.490> that<00:03:20.490> what<00:03:20.970> we

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
that it's all right and that what we

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.570 
that it's all right and that what we
must<00:03:21.390> do<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.720> make<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.290> highest<00:03:22.920> choice<00:03:24.050> given

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
must do is make the highest choice given

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.100 
must do is make the highest choice given
that<00:03:26.580> everything<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.180> right<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:30.450> mentioned

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
that everything is right you mentioned

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.500 
that everything is right you mentioned
and<00:03:31.470> then<00:03:31.590> go<00:03:31.830> getting<00:03:32.070> too<00:03:32.100> abstract<00:03:34.340> yeah<00:03:35.510> it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
and then go getting too abstract yeah it

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.930 
and then go getting too abstract yeah it
is<00:03:36.930> abstract<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:37.590> sometimes<00:03:38.070> these<00:03:38.340> abstract

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
is abstract but sometimes these abstract

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.990 
is abstract but sometimes these abstract
truths<00:03:39.300> are<00:03:39.570> are<00:03:40.020> quite<00:03:40.350> profound<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.670> while

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
truths are are quite profound and while

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.090 
truths are are quite profound and while
they<00:03:42.239> may<00:03:42.270> be<00:03:42.480> difficult<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.230> grasp<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.920> think

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
they may be difficult to grasp I think

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.280 
they may be difficult to grasp I think
if<00:03:44.220> we<00:03:44.370> try<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:45.180> approach<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.690> from<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.110> few

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
if we try and approach it from a few

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.650 
if we try and approach it from a few
different<00:03:46.380> angles<00:03:46.950> will<00:03:47.340> will<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.270> able<00:03:48.390> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
different angles will will be able to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.170 
different angles will will be able to
eliminate<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.380> question<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.090> I'd

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
eliminate the question and so and I'd

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.810 
eliminate the question and so and I'd
like<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.900> go<00:03:52.050> back<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.370> word<00:03:53.580> you

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
like to go back to is is the word you

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.090 
like to go back to is is the word you
use<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.300> ego<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:55.200> know<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:55.470> bantered<00:03:55.920> around

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
use the ego you know we bantered around

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.900 
use the ego you know we bantered around
so<00:03:56.850> easily<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.450> our<00:03:57.600> conversation<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.860> think<00:03:59.820> it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
so easily in our conversation I think it

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.090 
so easily in our conversation I think it
means<00:04:00.090> possibly<00:04:00.900> means<00:04:01.200> different<00:04:01.500> things<00:04:01.680> to

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
means possibly means different things to

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.979 
means possibly means different things to
different<00:04:02.250> people<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.180> suspect<00:04:03.420> you're

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
different people and I suspect you're

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.320 
different people and I suspect you're
using<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:05.040> very<00:04:05.220> particular<00:04:05.459> way<00:04:05.940> that

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
using it in a very particular way that

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.620 
using it in a very particular way that
I'd<00:04:06.420> like<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.959> amplify<00:04:07.680> all<00:04:08.250> right<00:04:08.520> well<00:04:09.270> I

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
I'd like you to amplify all right well I

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.750 
I'd like you to amplify all right well I
feel<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.860> mean<00:04:11.270> because<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.420> was<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:12.600> seeker<00:04:13.230> of

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
feel I mean because I was a seeker of

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.070 
feel I mean because I was a seeker of
understanding<00:04:14.760> at<00:04:14.880> least<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:15.780> trying

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
to figure my figure out might figure my

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.479 
to figure my figure out might figure my
life<00:04:17.940> out<00:04:18.359> when<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.660> was<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.380> young<00:04:19.980> woman<00:04:20.010> and

right<00:04:58.819> so<00:04:59.819> anyway<00:04:59.940> even<00:05:00.300> even<00:05:00.659> having<00:05:01.020> read<00:05:01.289> so

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
right so anyway even even having read so

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.649 
right so anyway even even having read so
much<00:05:01.770> about<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.280> ego<00:05:02.550> myself<00:05:03.060> having<00:05:03.419> spoken

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
much about the ego myself having spoken

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.779 
much about the ego myself having spoken
to<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.930> lot<00:05:04.169> of<00:05:04.229> people<00:05:04.560> who<00:05:04.979> talked<00:05:05.400> about<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
to a lot of people who talked about the

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.189 
to a lot of people who talked about the
ego<00:05:06.060> this<00:05:06.300> way<00:05:06.509> and<00:05:06.719> that<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:07.740> in<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.819> very

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
ego this way and that I in a very

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.029 
ego this way and that I in a very
inspired<00:05:10.199> moment<00:05:10.889> was<00:05:11.190> given<00:05:11.699> a<00:05:12.740> picture<00:05:13.740> of

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
inspired moment was given a picture of

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.809 
inspired moment was given a picture of
what<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.639> ego<00:05:15.030> is<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:16.830> very<00:05:17.400> simple

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
what the ego is and a very simple

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.930 
what the ego is and a very simple
explanation<00:05:18.050> of<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.440> as<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:20.009> mechanism<00:05:20.400> is<00:05:20.909> a

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
explanation of it as a mechanism is a

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.559 
explanation of it as a mechanism is a
psychological<00:05:21.770> mechanism<00:05:22.770> that<00:05:23.580> is<00:05:23.789> a<00:05:23.819> vital

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
psychological mechanism that is a vital

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.580 
psychological mechanism that is a vital
part<00:05:24.900> of<00:05:25.110> our<00:05:25.229> humanity<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.810> that's<00:05:28.229> what<00:05:28.560> I

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
part of our humanity and that's what I

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.059 
part of our humanity and that's what I
and<00:05:29.190> so<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.789> have<00:05:29.969> drawn<00:05:30.870> that<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.590> i<00:05:31.860> have

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
and so I have drawn that and i have

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.820 
and so I have drawn that and i have
taught<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:32.669> very<00:05:32.969> simple<00:05:33.479> model<00:05:33.779> of<00:05:34.319> the<00:05:34.440> ego

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
taught that very simple model of the ego

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.189 
taught that very simple model of the ego
too<00:05:35.430> many<00:05:35.969> people<00:05:36.389> over<00:05:36.569> the<00:05:36.659> last<00:05:36.690> nine<00:05:37.169> years

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
too many people over the last nine years

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.689 
too many people over the last nine years
and<00:05:38.009> very<00:05:38.639> basically<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.810> ego<00:05:40.259> is<00:05:40.500> it<00:05:41.400> is<00:05:41.669> a

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
and very basically the ego is it is a

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.279 
and very basically the ego is it is a
it's<00:05:42.210> our<00:05:42.389> past<00:05:42.750> it's<00:05:43.139> an<00:05:43.229> accumulation<00:05:44.069> of

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
it's our past it's an accumulation of

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.860 
it's our past it's an accumulation of
experiences<00:05:46.289> that<00:05:46.319> we<00:05:46.560> have<00:05:46.740> had<00:05:46.979> and

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
experiences that we have had and

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.920 
experiences that we have had and
conclusions<00:05:48.870> we<00:05:49.110> have<00:05:49.380> drawn<00:05:49.740> based<00:05:50.490> on<00:05:50.759> those

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
conclusions we have drawn based on those

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:58.159 
conclusions we have drawn based on those
experiences<00:05:52.370> but<00:05:53.370> but<00:05:53.639> it's<00:05:53.819> also<00:05:54.029> the<00:05:57.169> it's

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
experiences but but it's also the it's

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.189 
experiences but but it's also the it's
the<00:05:58.319> kind<00:05:59.219> of<00:05:59.370> mechanism<00:05:59.639> is<00:06:00.210> that<00:06:00.360> the<00:06:00.509> the

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
the kind of mechanism is that the the

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.320 
the kind of mechanism is that the the
function<00:06:01.949> that<00:06:02.069> it<00:06:02.219> is<00:06:02.340> psychologically

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
function that it is psychologically

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.309 
function that it is psychologically
causes<00:06:03.930> us<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.139> feel<00:06:04.680> separate<00:06:05.340> as<00:06:06.000> an<00:06:06.930> egoic

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
causes us to feel separate as an egoic

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.080 
causes us to feel separate as an egoic
being<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:08.930> it<00:06:09.930> causes<00:06:10.349> us<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:11.580> reflect

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
being and it causes us to to reflect

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.510 
being and it causes us to to reflect
very<00:06:12.210> clearly<00:06:12.810> into<00:06:13.169> the<00:06:13.289> past<00:06:13.650> and<00:06:14.039> have<00:06:14.490> a

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
very clearly into the past and have a

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.700 
very clearly into the past and have a
very<00:06:15.120> difficult<00:06:15.419> time<00:06:15.779> seeing<00:06:16.199> what's<00:06:16.440> going

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
very difficult time seeing what's going

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.119 
very difficult time seeing what's going
on<00:06:16.860> right<00:06:17.250> here<00:06:17.300> in<00:06:18.300> the<00:06:18.449> present<00:06:18.870> moment<00:06:19.129> so

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:20.129 
on right here in the present moment so

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.070 
on right here in the present moment so
if<00:06:20.219> i<00:06:20.279> were<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.520> paraphrase<00:06:20.909> you<00:06:21.389> i<00:06:21.419> might<00:06:21.779> say

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
if i were to paraphrase you i might say

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.379 
if i were to paraphrase you i might say
that<00:06:22.409> you're<00:06:22.590> defining<00:06:23.009> the<00:06:23.250> ego<00:06:23.669> is<00:06:23.699> the<00:06:24.060> part

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
that you're defining the ego is the part

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.930 
that you're defining the ego is the part
of<00:06:24.509> ourselves<00:06:24.659> that<00:06:25.319> we<00:06:25.440> typically<00:06:25.940> identify

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
of ourselves that we typically identify

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.980 
of ourselves that we typically identify
with<00:06:27.270> based<00:06:27.599> on<00:06:27.870> our<00:06:28.020> life<00:06:28.259> history<00:06:28.740> yes<00:06:29.990> and

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
with based on our life history yes and

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.920 
with based on our life history yes and
you're<00:06:31.529> suggesting<00:06:32.419> that<00:06:33.419> we<00:06:33.449> limit

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
you're suggesting that we limit

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.800 
you're suggesting that we limit
ourselves<00:06:34.050> when<00:06:34.710> we<00:06:34.860> do<00:06:35.039> that<00:06:35.279> well<00:06:35.880> the<00:06:36.240> ego

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
ourselves when we do that well the ego

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.540 
ourselves when we do that well the ego
is<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.560> limitation

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
is the limitation

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.030 
is the limitation
just<00:06:39.120> like<00:06:39.270> is<00:06:39.420> it<00:06:39.600> like<00:06:39.630> it's<00:06:40.620> very<00:06:40.860> difficult

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
just like is it like it's very difficult

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.860 
just like is it like it's very difficult
to<00:06:41.340> even<00:06:41.520> talk<00:06:41.760> about<00:06:41.820> this<00:06:42.210> because<00:06:42.390> we<00:06:42.690> have

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
to even talk about this because we have

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.900 
to even talk about this because we have
identified<00:06:43.050> ourselves<00:06:43.710> as<00:06:44.100> like<00:06:44.250> we<00:06:44.430> actually

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
identified ourselves as like we actually

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.070 
identified ourselves as like we actually
have<00:06:45.150> no<00:06:45.420> identity<00:06:46.160> you<00:06:47.160> accept<00:06:47.850> the<00:06:47.940> ego<00:06:48.270> the

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
have no identity you accept the ego the

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.940 
have no identity you accept the ego the
ego<00:06:49.110> is<00:06:49.380> our<00:06:49.770> identity<00:06:49.980> and<00:06:50.610> yet<00:06:50.910> it<00:06:51.090> is<00:06:51.300> not<00:06:51.330> us

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
ego is our identity and yet it is not us

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.980 
ego is our identity and yet it is not us
it's<00:06:52.950> not<00:06:53.190> who<00:06:53.610> we<00:06:53.820> are<00:06:55.100> but<00:06:56.100> we<00:06:56.310> have<00:06:56.990> been

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
it's not who we are but we have been

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.370 
it's not who we are but we have been
made<00:06:58.350> to<00:06:58.530> believe<00:06:58.710> that's<00:06:59.400> who<00:06:59.610> we<00:06:59.790> are<00:07:00.230> we<00:07:01.230> are

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
made to believe that's who we are we are

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.730 
made to believe that's who we are we are
so<00:07:01.710> much<00:07:01.860> more<00:07:01.920> than<00:07:02.460> that<00:07:03.200> and<00:07:04.200> our<00:07:04.470> self

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
so much more than that and our self

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.770 
so much more than that and our self
expression<00:07:05.490> the<00:07:05.610> way<00:07:05.700> you<00:07:05.760> speak<00:07:06.510> of

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
expression the way you speak of

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.720 
expression the way you speak of
self-expression<00:07:07.410> is<00:07:07.770> so<00:07:08.160> much<00:07:08.370> more<00:07:08.400> than

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
self-expression is so much more than

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.080 
self-expression is so much more than
that<00:07:09.090> yes<00:07:09.600> and<00:07:10.530> of<00:07:11.070> course<00:07:11.340> the<00:07:11.490> way<00:07:11.640> I<00:07:11.670> speak

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
that yes and of course the way I speak

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.150 
that yes and of course the way I speak
about<00:07:12.300> self-expression<00:07:12.900> is<00:07:13.440> with<00:07:13.830> a<00:07:13.860> capital

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
about self-expression is with a capital

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.900 
about self-expression is with a capital
S<00:07:14.750> there<00:07:15.750> is<00:07:15.930> the<00:07:16.230> the<00:07:16.530> lower<00:07:16.800> self<00:07:17.370> which<00:07:17.670> is

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
S there is the the lower self which is

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.570 
S there is the the lower self which is
the<00:07:18.150> ordinary<00:07:19.080> personality<00:07:19.830> the<00:07:19.980> lower<00:07:20.190> mind
