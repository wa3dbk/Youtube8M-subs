now<00:00:02.159> we<00:00:02.220> have<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.639> standard<00:00:03.179> C<00:00:03.360> my<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.629> CMYK

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
now we have a a standard C my a CMYK

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.970 
now we have a a standard C my a CMYK
image<00:00:05.160> now<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.000> recommend<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.720> use<00:00:06.750> RGB<00:00:07.200> images

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
image now we recommend to use RGB images

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.540 
image now we recommend to use RGB images
for<00:00:08.189> separating<00:00:08.730> with<00:00:08.880> easier<00:00:09.690> what<00:00:09.990> CMYK<00:00:10.550> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
for separating with easier what CMYK the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.780 
for separating with easier what CMYK the
colors<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.360> CMYK<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.170> very<00:00:13.469> flat<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.130> dull<00:00:14.429> and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
colors and CMYK a very flat and dull and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.090 
colors and CMYK a very flat and dull and
easy<00:00:15.360> out<00:00:15.480> will<00:00:15.780> produce<00:00:16.170> flat<00:00:16.740> dull

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
easy out will produce flat dull

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
easy out will produce flat dull
separations<00:00:17.930> so<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> first<00:00:19.230> thing<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.500> going

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
separations so the first thing I'm going

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.179 
separations so the first thing I'm going
to<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:19.949> click<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.279> improve<00:00:20.880> image<00:00:21.270> RGB<00:00:22.260> they

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
to do is click on improve image RGB they

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.509 
to do is click on improve image RGB they
will<00:00:23.340> automatically<00:00:24.529> convert<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.710> an<00:00:25.920> RGB

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
will automatically convert it to an RGB

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.609 
will automatically convert it to an RGB
image<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.900> add<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.470> of

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
image and I add a little bit of

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.569 
image and I add a little bit of
sharpness<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.279> color<00:00:30.890> now<00:00:31.890> I'm<00:00:32.070> also<00:00:32.430> going

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
sharpness and color now I'm also going

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.090 
sharpness and color now I'm also going
to<00:00:32.759> add<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> bit<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.239> contrast<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.440> will<00:00:34.800> also

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to add a bit of contrast that will also

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979 
to add a bit of contrast that will also
boost<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> colors<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
boost the colors you can see the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.650 
boost the colors you can see the
difference<00:00:37.320> between<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.680> two<00:00:37.860> images<00:00:38.660> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
difference between the two images the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
difference between the two images the
one<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> right<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.379> will<00:00:40.559> produce<00:00:40.710> much

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
one on the right here will produce much

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
one on the right here will produce much
better<00:00:41.430> color<00:00:41.730> separations<00:00:42.390> than<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:42.780> on

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
better color separations than the one on

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.100 
better color separations than the one on
the<00:00:42.989> left<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.590> we'll<00:00:43.739> close<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.980> down<00:00:45.110> now

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the left so we'll close that down now

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.720 
the left so we'll close that down now
we'll<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.440> ahead<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.829> separate<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.370> using

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
we'll go ahead and separate this using

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.490 
we'll go ahead and separate this using
the<00:00:47.820> standard<00:00:48.270> separate<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.930> white<00:00:49.140> shirts

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the standard separate for white shirts

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:15.109 
the standard separate for white shirts
routine

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.510 

now<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:16.049> routine<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.710> complete<00:01:17.219> we'll

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
now that the routine is complete we'll

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.039 
now that the routine is complete we'll
go<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.969> channels<00:01:18.329> list<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:18.750> view<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
go to the channels list and view the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.230 
go to the channels list and view the
separations<00:01:19.679> so<00:01:19.950> we'll<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.820> through<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.119> one

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
separations so we'll go through them one

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.490 
separations so we'll go through them one

dark blue green brown medium gray high
light<00:01:28.649> white<00:01:28.859> we<00:01:29.549> won't<00:01:29.759> use<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> high<00:01:30.179> light

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.380 
light white we won't use the high light
white<00:01:31.399> you<00:01:32.399> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.789> haven't<00:01:32.939> created<00:01:33.149> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
white you can see we haven't created a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.090 
white you can see we haven't created a
white<00:01:33.569> basis<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.560> use<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> white

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
white basis because we use the white

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.919 
white basis because we use the white
shirt<00:01:35.369> routine<00:01:35.789> in<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.030> print<00:01:36.539> that's<00:01:36.689> going

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
shirt routine in this print that's going

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.169 
shirt routine in this print that's going
on<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> white<00:01:37.560> shirt<00:01:37.859> so<00:01:38.399> we<00:01:38.579> therefore<00:01:38.819> do

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
on to a white shirt so we therefore do

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.660 
on to a white shirt so we therefore do
not<00:01:39.209> need<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> white<00:01:39.750> base<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.340> turned<00:01:41.579> on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
not need a white base so if I turned on

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.630 
not need a white base so if I turned on
the<00:01:41.700> colors<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.209> at<00:01:42.359> a<00:01:42.420> time<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.369> get<00:01:44.549> an

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the colors one at a time we can get an

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.440 
the colors one at a time we can get an
idea<00:01:44.969> of<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.209> it's<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.539> print<00:01:45.750> like

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
idea of what it's going to print like

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.789 
idea of what it's going to print like
green<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.599> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:48.959> only<00:01:48.989> have<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.289> little

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
green you can see we only have a little

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.919 
green you can see we only have a little
tiny<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.489> bit<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.849> green<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.569> don't

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
tiny little bit of green here I don't

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.449 
tiny little bit of green here I don't
think<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.170> need<00:01:52.349> to<00:01:52.380> print<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.829> green<00:01:53.039> we<00:01:53.250> can

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
think we need to print the green we can

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.190 
think we need to print the green we can
simulate<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.090> green<00:01:54.479> which<00:01:54.810> I'll<00:01:54.989> show<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
simulate the green which I'll show you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.620 
simulate the green which I'll show you
in<00:01:55.349> one<00:01:55.469> minute

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
in one minute

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.010 
in one minute
duck<00:01:57.630> Brown<00:01:58.340> medium<00:01:59.340> gray<00:01:59.819> and<00:02:01.429> black<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> what

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
duck Brown medium gray and black so what

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.869 
duck Brown medium gray and black so what
I'm<00:02:04.110> gonna<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.619> I'm<00:02:04.739> gonna<00:02:04.799> intensify<00:02:05.219> some

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:05.879 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna intensify some

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.249 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna intensify some
of<00:02:05.969> these<00:02:06.060> colors<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.569> think<00:02:06.750> we'll<00:02:06.899> start<00:02:07.170> off

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
of these colors I think we'll start off

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.619 
of these colors I think we'll start off
with<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.590> yellow<00:02:08.060> but<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.179> tuned<00:02:09.360> all<00:02:09.479> those

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
with the yellow but it's tuned all those

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.449 
with the yellow but it's tuned all those
channels<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.110> again<00:02:10.440> come<00:02:11.069> down<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.430> our

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
channels all again come down to our

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.160 
channels all again come down to our
actions<00:02:12.000> list<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.480> come<00:02:12.690> down<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.049> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
actions list and then come down to the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.800 
actions list and then come down to the
easier<00:02:13.560> green<00:02:14.069> buttons<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:15.360> see<00:02:15.390> I've<00:02:15.629> got<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
easier green buttons you see I've got a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.509 
easier green buttons you see I've got a
button<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:16.349> increased<00:02:16.980> color<00:02:17.280> and

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
channel I took on there you can see that

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.900 
channel I took on there you can see that
yellow<00:02:22.019> getting<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.350> bit<00:02:22.530> stronger<00:02:22.920> I'm<00:02:23.700> gonna

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
yellow getting a bit stronger I'm gonna

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.710 
yellow getting a bit stronger I'm gonna
do<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.239> again<00:02:26.000> this<00:02:27.000> really<00:02:27.209> comes<00:02:27.540> with

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
do that again this really comes with

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.319 
do that again this really comes with
experience<00:02:28.260> whether<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.709> do<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:28.950> or<00:02:29.329> how

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
experience whether you do that or how

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.479 
experience whether you do that or how
much<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.109> by<00:02:31.290> depends<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.069> what<00:02:32.310> your

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
much you do that by depends on what your

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.309 
much you do that by depends on what your
printing<00:02:32.849> techniques<00:02:33.269> are<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:34.170> that's

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
printing techniques are like so that's

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.930 
printing techniques are like so that's
just<00:02:34.530> gonna<00:02:34.709> come<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.190> bit<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.370> trying<00:02:35.730> at

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
just gonna come with a bit of trying at

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.610 
just gonna come with a bit of trying at
trial<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.450> error<00:02:36.720> how<00:02:37.410> much<00:02:37.790> increase<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.970> add

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
trial and error how much increase to add

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.930 
trial and error how much increase to add
the<00:02:40.620> red<00:02:40.799> looks<00:02:41.010> pretty<00:02:41.280> good<00:02:41.489> I'm<00:02:41.639> not<00:02:41.819> gonna

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
the red looks pretty good I'm not gonna

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.000 
the red looks pretty good I'm not gonna
do<00:02:42.180> anything<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:43.049> magenta<00:02:43.709> could

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
do anything to that magenta could

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.890 
do anything to that magenta could
probably<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.700> with<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.910> bit<00:02:45.180> more<00:02:47.569> color<00:02:48.569> let's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
probably do with a bit more color let's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
probably do with a bit more color let's
go<00:02:49.169> back<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.980> increased<00:02:50.549> color<00:02:50.849> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
go back to the increased color and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.349 
go back to the increased color and
Channel<00:02:52.819> once<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:54.030> enough

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
Channel once is enough

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.920 
Channel once is enough
and<00:02:54.660> maybe<00:02:55.760> see<00:02:56.760> we're<00:02:56.940> printing<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.510> Blues

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.610 
and maybe see we're printing to Blues

here

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.740 
here
I<00:03:00.680> like<00:03:01.680> blue<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.190> dark<00:03:02.459> blue<00:03:02.730> I'm<00:03:03.540> just

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
I like blue and a dark blue I'm just

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.449 
I like blue and a dark blue I'm just
gonna<00:03:03.900> increase<00:03:04.169> the<00:03:04.680> color<00:03:04.919> on<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> light

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
gonna increase the color on the light

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.040 
gonna increase the color on the light
blue

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.420 

maybe<00:03:12.050> there's<00:03:12.349> you<00:03:12.470> know<00:03:12.500> it's<00:03:12.770> just<00:03:13.099> like<00:03:13.220> I

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
maybe there's you know it's just like I

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.130 
maybe there's you know it's just like I
said<00:03:13.459> before<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:14.150> guesswork<00:03:14.569> at<00:03:15.020> the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
said before it's just guesswork at the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.100 
said before it's just guesswork at the
state<00:03:15.410> I'm<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.520> Green<00:03:16.819> we're<00:03:17.780> not<00:03:17.900> going<00:03:18.050> to

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
state I'm the Green we're not going to

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.750 
state I'm the Green we're not going to
print<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.410> green<00:03:18.650> we're<00:03:18.830> gonna<00:03:18.950> simulate<00:03:19.370> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
print the green we're gonna simulate the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.640 
print the green we're gonna simulate the
green<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.630> how<00:03:20.750> we<00:03:20.810> do<00:03:21.020> that<00:03:21.230> has<00:03:21.380> come<00:03:21.620> down

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
green and how we do that has come down

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.930 
green and how we do that has come down
and<00:03:22.069> click<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.640> combined<00:03:23.120> green<00:03:23.450> channel<00:03:24.940> what

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
and click on combined green channel what

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.040 
and click on combined green channel what
that<00:03:26.120> does<00:03:26.300> is<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.569> takes<00:03:26.720> all<00:03:26.900> the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
that does is it takes all the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.559 
that does is it takes all the
information<00:03:27.590> from<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.920> green<00:03:28.300> adds<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.540> to

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
information from the green adds it to

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.620 
information from the green adds it to
the<00:03:29.810> yellow<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.530> light<00:03:30.739> blue<00:03:31.069> so<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.060> are

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
the yellow and the light blue so you are

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.630 
the yellow and the light blue so you are
therefore<00:03:33.019> creating<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.560> simulated<00:03:34.099> green<00:03:34.430> so

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
therefore creating a simulated green so

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.009 
therefore creating a simulated green so
you<00:03:34.670> no<00:03:34.910> longer<00:03:34.940> have<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.360> put<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.810> green

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
you no longer have to put the green

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.540 
you no longer have to put the green

we'll<00:03:37.910> do<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.209> same<00:03:38.420> with<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.750> dark<00:03:38.989> brown

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
we'll do the same with the dark brown

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.250 
we'll do the same with the dark brown
it's<00:03:40.760> only<00:03:40.940> because<00:03:41.150> we've<00:03:41.480> got<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.690> little<00:03:41.930> bit

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
it's only because we've got a little bit

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.900 
it's only because we've got a little bit
of<00:03:42.410> color<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:42.920> we're<00:03:43.040> going<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.220> simulate<00:03:43.489> it

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
of color that we're going to simulate it

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.699 
of color that we're going to simulate it
if<00:03:44.090> there<00:03:44.299> was<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.420> lot<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.930> brown<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.410> image

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
if there was a lot of brown in the image

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.979 
if there was a lot of brown in the image
then<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.280> wouldn't<00:03:46.580> simulate<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.269> but<00:03:47.870> in

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
then you wouldn't simulate it but in

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.780 
then you wouldn't simulate it but in
this<00:03:48.080> particular<00:03:48.319> case<00:03:48.920> we're<00:03:49.400> gonna<00:03:49.489> go

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
this particular case we're gonna go

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.270 
this particular case we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.299> combine<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.530> brown<00:03:51.680> channel<00:03:52.160> as

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
ahead and combine the brown channel as

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.050 
ahead and combine the brown channel as
well<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.959> here<00:03:57.200> we<00:03:57.290> go<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:58.430> can<00:03:58.640> turn<00:03:58.849> off

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
well so here we go so we can turn off

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.240 
well so here we go so we can turn off
medium<00:03:59.690> grey<00:03:59.959> we<00:04:00.170> don't<00:04:00.410> need<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.739> one<00:04:00.950> high
