00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.660
 m 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.089
 so I came for a first time a week 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.949
 no because I did 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.519
 the club here I do not do pain at all 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.999
 by the way I come back saying after 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.869
 finally we learn that his father 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.560
 we are very happy with the result 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.419
 at the time of course 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.419
 but you're missing but I can continue to absorb 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.880
 I hope to find 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 this result now for them 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.610
 it was really a nice surprise to find that this is 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.970
 these new hair note door 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.190
 and to put it on demand this morning 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 six years it went very well and under local anesthesia and so this 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.430
 second intervention 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.570
 that it is an androgenetic alopecia call to continue to support 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.190
 there are different kinds 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.580
 and so here we are going to do a second session 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.910
 to identify you 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.470
 the aso as much that burst high and get what's called the month effect 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.530
 so here I am going to make the drawing criticizable 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.680
 before planting grafts 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 I cut out a perfume 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.340
 score it depends 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.130
 depending on the evening involvement for a meeting 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.030
 sampling technique by segment 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 either in team the technique of sampling by pq 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.890
 so here I am decimating mont-tourbillon to respect the meaning 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.530
 implantation 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.530
 but before I start planting I will rothen local anesthetic 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.660
 asleep to all this mud 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.020
 and what to do flanks 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.170
 with a magnifying glass and the cries of goldsmith as much as I would have cut crack 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.620
 finally every day we see there 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.420
 that the Greeks 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.690
 we wear hair that has been taken from the occipital area 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.690
 and who have been relocated 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.300
 if you look in the taton family classification 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 effective alopecia 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.810
 we do not impose more 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.859
 he still keeps his crown 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.499
 for a profile later on afp 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.499
 and purchased as part of the company 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.479
 then the south grafts will follow 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.269
 completely natural 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.370
 these are the next three months of the patient so also without venturing into 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.019
 the oceania zone 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.069
 vaud and friborg naturally whiten 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.939
 exactly the same hair 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.029
 m 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.029
 at the moment the days 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.269
 rumors were disturbing because the euro is good for me to find them a 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.159
 agreement 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.159
 that I did this operation 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.819
 new report they are happy for me 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.449
 the pivot that may seem happy for myself 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.449
 I talked about that 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.479
 that's all it's 16 euros his share it does not play on% 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.719
 people I did not know 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.409
 in the face of these remarks 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.359
 so the last hand 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.139
 it's because I started to lose 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.879
 we would have the man as can see in the photos 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.699
 others were taken 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:14.949
 not really 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.579
 the difference 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.579
 and so that the week's nos 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.319
 what did they do for me 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.419
 little I can not do too much 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.080
 he is fighting against the clock 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.269
 in this operation c 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.279
 it's not an operation 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.439
 on the mobile supply side 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.450
 in the morning 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.280
 to paraphrase churchill
