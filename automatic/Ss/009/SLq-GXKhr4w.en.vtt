00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.679 

our<00:00:00.299> approach<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:01.520> students<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.730> very

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
our approach to students is a very

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.619 
our approach to students is a very
community-oriented<00:00:04.470> an<00:00:04.680> approach<00:00:05.180> and<00:00:06.180> for

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
community-oriented an approach and for

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.770 
community-oriented an approach and for
most<00:00:06.779> cases<00:00:07.140> like<00:00:08.030> one<00:00:09.030> out<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.360> million<00:00:09.570> you

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
most cases like one out of a million you

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.379 
most cases like one out of a million you
may<00:00:09.929> say<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.590> case<00:00:10.800> like<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.389> verbal

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
may say in a case like this verbal

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.270 
may say in a case like this verbal
interaction<00:00:12.960> doesn't<00:00:13.290> work<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
interaction doesn't work and the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:27.200 
interaction doesn't work and the
individual<00:00:14.790> themselves<00:00:16.760> well<00:00:26.029> more<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
individual themselves well more is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.169 
individual themselves well more is
better<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> had<00:00:28.920> only<00:00:29.189> been<00:00:29.369> like

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
better because if it had only been like

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.970 
better because if it had only been like
one<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.539> two<00:00:30.570> officers<00:00:31.140> we're<00:00:31.679> gonna<00:00:31.830> have

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
one or two officers we're gonna have

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.470 
one or two officers we're gonna have
injuries<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.759> we're<00:00:32.880> gonna<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.120> injuries

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
injuries and we're gonna have injuries

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
injuries and we're gonna have injuries
all<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> way<00:00:33.809> around<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> more<00:00:34.530> options

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
all the way around so the more options

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.979 
all the way around so the more options
they're<00:00:35.309> trying<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> subdue<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.480> individual

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
they're trying to subdue the individual

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
they're trying to subdue the individual
and<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.530> difficult<00:00:37.770> circumstances

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and to be very difficult circumstances

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.240 
and to be very difficult circumstances
is<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> way<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.930> exactly<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> way<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
is the way that exactly the way that the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.209 
is the way that exactly the way that the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
wish you wouldn't do that because we're

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.370 
wish you wouldn't do that because we're
trying<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> serious<00:02:19.290> conversation<00:02:21.380> in

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
trying to have a serious conversation in

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.960 
trying to have a serious conversation in
terms<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.769> investigation<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.549> still<00:02:23.790> is

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
terms of the investigation it still is

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.550 
terms of the investigation it still is
early<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.660> certain<00:02:24.930> things<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:25.380> can't

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
early and certain things that we can't

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.710 
early and certain things that we can't
talk<00:02:25.739> about<00:02:25.799> yet<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.610> as<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.360> days<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.690> by

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
talk about yet but as the days go by

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.050 
talk about yet but as the days go by
that<00:02:28.110> will<00:02:28.260> likely<00:02:28.440> unfold<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.400> guess<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
that will likely unfold I guess the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.090 
that will likely unfold I guess the
issue<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.420> I'm<00:02:30.750> still<00:02:31.019> sort<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.260> stuck<00:02:31.350> on<00:02:31.620> is

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
issue that I'm still sort of stuck on is

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.039 
issue that I'm still sort of stuck on is
understanding<00:02:32.850> how<00:02:33.000> such<00:02:33.299> force<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.750> is

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
understanding how such force that is

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.860 
understanding how such force that is
obvious<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.709> video<00:02:35.450> contributes<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
obvious in the video contributes to the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.490 
obvious in the video contributes to the
the<00:02:37.650> well-being<00:02:38.120> or<00:02:39.120> quality<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:40.140> student

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the well-being or quality of student

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.890 
the well-being or quality of student
life<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:41.010> think<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.430> think<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:42.180> actually<00:02:42.630> a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
life I think I think it's actually a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.580 
life I think I think it's actually a
very<00:02:43.470> good<00:02:43.709> experience<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:45.410> jumping<00:02:46.410> to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
very good experience in jumping to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.830 
very good experience in jumping to
conclusions<00:02:47.130> because<00:02:47.760> often<00:02:48.360> times<00:02:48.569> we'll

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
conclusions because often times we'll

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.030 
conclusions because often times we'll
see<00:02:48.870> something<00:02:49.260> whether<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.829> car

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
see something whether it's a car

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.590 
see something whether it's a car
accident<00:02:50.070> or<00:02:50.640> something<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.390> and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
accident or something like this and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.930 
accident or something like this and
think<00:02:52.200> something<00:02:52.950> has<00:02:53.160> happened<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.730> we

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
think something has happened that we

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.030 
think something has happened that we
that<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.269> see<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.230> could<00:02:55.380> be<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:55.650> totally

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
that we see and it could be like totally

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.289 
that we see and it could be like totally
different<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.489> this<00:02:56.609> particular<00:02:56.910> situation

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
different in this particular situation

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.900 
different in this particular situation
when<00:02:57.870> all<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.950> circumstances<00:02:59.760> are

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
when all of the the circumstances are

when all of the the circumstances are
explained<00:03:00.359> people<00:03:01.260> will<00:03:01.350> better<00:03:01.530> understand

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
explained people will better understand
