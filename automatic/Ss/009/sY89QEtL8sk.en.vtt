the<00:02:33.680> store<00:02:33.980> thing<00:02:34.220> like<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.730> said<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:36.560> can

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
the store thing like I said this you can

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.600 
the store thing like I said this you can
build<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.160> as<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.630> to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
build it as is so you can have to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.730 
build it as is so you can have to
complete<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.880> beam<00:02:41.300> javelins<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.110> then<00:02:42.260> this

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
complete it beam javelins and then this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.900 
complete it beam javelins and then this
set<00:02:43.390> well<00:02:44.560> kill<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:47.920> DB<00:02:48.920> machine<00:02:49.340> guns<00:02:49.640> and

set well kill on DB machine guns and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.150 
set well kill on DB machine guns and
then<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.120> will<00:02:50.239> simply<00:02:50.690> put<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.530> shield<00:02:51.890> on

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
then you will simply put the shield on

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.330 
then you will simply put the shield on
there<00:02:53.150> saying<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.900> can't<00:02:54.110> have<00:02:54.350> an<00:02:54.620> active

just like you would get on the heart of
the<00:05:04.430> century<00:05:04.880> in<00:05:05.090> fact<00:05:05.720> I'm<00:05:05.900> almost<00:05:06.170> positive

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
the century in fact I'm almost positive

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.860 
the century in fact I'm almost positive
that<00:05:06.950> these<00:05:07.310> are<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.730> exact<00:05:08.090> beam<00:05:08.330> parts<00:05:08.720> that

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
that these are the exact beam parts that

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.200 
that these are the exact beam parts that
we<00:05:09.020> got<00:05:09.290> with<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.250> higher<00:05:10.460> universal<00:05:11.000> century

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
we got with the higher universal century

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.260 
we got with the higher universal century

kiss shot area repair version the beam

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.360 
kiss shot area repair version the beam
javelin<00:05:14.600> itself<00:05:14.870> also<00:05:15.140> feels<00:05:15.530> exactly<00:05:16.100> like

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
javelin itself also feels exactly like

something<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:17.030> would<00:05:17.150> get<00:05:17.240> pretty<00:05:17.390> hungry<00:05:17.690> at

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
something you would get pretty hungry at

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.470 
something you would get pretty hungry at
Universal<00:05:18.230> century<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:19.340> overall<00:05:19.850> I<00:05:20.180> would<00:05:20.360> say

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
Universal century so overall I would say

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.360 
Universal century so overall I would say
this<00:05:20.540> is<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.720> very<00:05:21.140> nice<00:05:21.440> high<00:05:21.740> quality<00:05:21.800> set

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
this is a very nice high quality set

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.790 
this is a very nice high quality set
with<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.760> lot<00:05:22.820> of<00:05:23.240> playability<00:05:23.990> going<00:05:24.440> on<00:05:24.590> and

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
with a lot of playability going on and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.180 
with a lot of playability going on and
if<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:25.370> could<00:05:25.670> somehow<00:05:26.560> get<00:05:27.560> two<00:05:27.830> of<00:05:27.860> these

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
if you could somehow get two of these

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.220 
if you could somehow get two of these
you<00:05:28.730> could<00:05:28.880> even<00:05:29.060> do<00:05:29.330> more<00:05:29.900> fun<00:05:30.170> things

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
you could even do more fun things

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.740 
you could even do more fun things
because<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:30.860> could<00:05:31.130> put<00:05:31.490> if<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.210> have<00:05:32.420> the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
because you could put if you have the

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.500 
because you could put if you have the
beam<00:05:33.530> javelin<00:05:34.010> in<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.190> accubow<00:05:34.520> here<00:05:34.850> you<00:05:35.240> can

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
beam javelin in the accubow here you can

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.170 
beam javelin in the accubow here you can
put<00:05:35.870> it<00:05:36.050> well<00:05:36.770> you<00:05:36.860> can't<00:05:37.100> put<00:05:37.280> the<00:05:37.520> spike<00:05:37.940> on

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
put it well you can't put the spike on

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.050 
put it well you can't put the spike on
top<00:05:38.480> and<00:05:38.720> spike<00:05:39.170> at<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:39.350> bottom<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.400> you<00:05:40.790> will

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
top and spike at the bottom so you will

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.440 
top and spike at the bottom so you will
have<00:05:41.360> even<00:05:41.720> more<00:05:42.070> big<00:05:43.070> effect<00:05:43.460> things<00:05:43.730> going

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
have even more big effect things going

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.530 
have even more big effect things going
on<00:05:44.570> there<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.140> if<00:05:45.740> you<00:05:46.010> own<00:05:46.220> any<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.420> the

on there and if you own any of the

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.540 
on there and if you own any of the
unicorn's<00:05:48.140> I<00:05:48.260> can<00:05:48.710> absolutely<00:05:48.980> recommend

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.420 
unicorn's I can absolutely recommend
that<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.210> pick<00:05:50.900> up<00:05:51.110> this<00:05:51.290> set<00:05:51.470> if<00:05:51.800> you<00:05:52.220> can

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
that you pick up this set if you can

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.600 
that you pick up this set if you can
find<00:05:52.730> it<00:05:52.910> still<00:05:53.660> for<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.050> decent<00:05:54.530> price<00:05:54.770> because

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
find it still for a decent price because

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.550 
find it still for a decent price because
that's<00:05:55.820> really<00:05:56.540> one<00:05:56.810> thing<00:05:56.990> I<00:05:57.080> have<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.440> worry

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
that's really one thing I have to worry

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.380 
that's really one thing I have to worry
about<00:05:57.710> don't<00:05:58.130> go<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.580> overpay<00:05:59.090> for<00:05:59.120> this

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
about don't go and overpay for this

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.940 
about don't go and overpay for this
price<00:05:59.630> at<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.350> end<00:06:00.380> of<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.620> day<00:06:00.680> it's<00:06:00.890> still

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
price at the end of the day it's still

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.120 
price at the end of the day it's still
just<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:01.729> beam<00:06:02.090> javelin<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:03.740> if<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:03.979> really

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
just a beam javelin and if you really

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.500 
just a beam javelin and if you really
want<00:06:04.430> to<00:06:04.490> pick<00:06:04.610> something<00:06:05.000> up<00:06:05.060> you<00:06:05.240> could

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
want to pick something up you could

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.690 
want to pick something up you could
always<00:06:05.690> give<00:06:05.990> them<00:06:06.140> something<00:06:06.410> else

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
always give them something else

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.760 
always give them something else
and<00:06:07.790> if<00:06:08.450> we're<00:06:08.660> gonna<00:06:08.720> pay<00:06:08.960> too<00:06:09.020> much<00:06:09.200> for<00:06:09.500> this

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
and if we're gonna pay too much for this

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.940 
and if we're gonna pay too much for this
well<00:06:10.100> then<00:06:10.520> you<00:06:11.000> could<00:06:11.600> almost<00:06:11.870> just<00:06:12.590> buy<00:06:12.890> the

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
well then you could almost just buy the

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.510 
well then you could almost just buy the
masa<00:06:13.610> rate<00:06:13.940> version<00:06:14.330> of<00:06:14.510> this<00:06:15.080> set<00:06:15.320> which<00:06:16.250> also

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
masa rate version of this set which also

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.120 
masa rate version of this set which also
comes<00:06:17.060> with<00:06:17.180> the<00:06:17.540> beam<00:06:17.690> javelin<00:06:18.260> so<00:06:18.800> that's

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
comes with the beam javelin so that's

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.520 
comes with the beam javelin so that's
that<00:06:19.400> oh<00:06:19.640> and<00:06:19.970> one<00:06:20.150> final<00:06:20.180> thing<00:06:20.690> I<00:06:20.930> quickly

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
that oh and one final thing I quickly

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.970 
that oh and one final thing I quickly
have<00:06:21.680> to<00:06:21.710> mention<00:06:22.160> is<00:06:22.990> one<00:06:23.990> thing<00:06:24.320> I<00:06:24.500> thought

that<00:06:25.250> he<00:06:25.490> might<00:06:25.880> have<00:06:25.940> been<00:06:26.180> able<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.480> do<00:06:26.780> is

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
that he might have been able to do is

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.520 
that he might have been able to do is
put<00:06:28.100> this<00:06:28.460> thing<00:06:28.820> here<00:06:29.360> on<00:06:29.510> the<00:06:29.930> tip<00:06:30.170> of<00:06:30.320> the

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
put this thing here on the tip of the

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.590 
put this thing here on the tip of the
beam<00:06:30.680> javelin<00:06:31.190> cuz<00:06:31.370> we<00:06:31.550> do<00:06:31.730> have<00:06:31.970> this<00:06:32.120> clip

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
beam javelin cuz we do have this clip

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.620 
beam javelin cuz we do have this clip
here<00:06:32.870> and<00:06:33.050> it<00:06:33.320> actually<00:06:33.800> clicks<00:06:34.190> on<00:06:34.330> to<00:06:35.330> for

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
here and it actually clicks on to for

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.080 
here and it actually clicks on to for
example<00:06:35.690> this<00:06:36.290> part<00:06:36.590> here<00:06:36.740> kind<00:06:37.070> of<00:06:37.220> however

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
example this part here kind of however

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.940 
example this part here kind of however
then<00:06:38.450> I<00:06:38.480> quickly<00:06:38.750> realized<00:06:39.350> that<00:06:39.530> in<00:06:39.680> order<00:06:39.770> to

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
then I quickly realized that in order to

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.100 
then I quickly realized that in order to
do<00:06:40.070> that<00:06:40.250> you<00:06:40.550> would<00:06:40.640> have<00:06:40.850> to<00:06:41.120> turn<00:06:41.660> this

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
do that you would have to turn this

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.370 
do that you would have to turn this
thing<00:06:42.170> around<00:06:43.030> 45<00:06:44.030> degrees<00:06:44.330> in<00:06:44.480> order<00:06:44.690> to<00:06:44.870> go

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
thing around 45 degrees in order to go

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.260 
thing around 45 degrees in order to go
on<00:06:45.680> there<00:06:45.950> and<00:06:46.160> that's<00:06:46.370> really<00:06:46.760> that<00:06:46.880> one

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
on there and that's really that one

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.420 
on there and that's really that one
thing<00:06:47.540> that<00:06:47.720> would<00:06:47.870> make<00:06:47.900> this<00:06:48.430> fantastic

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
thing that would make this fantastic

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.960 
thing that would make this fantastic
weapon<00:06:49.610> set<00:06:50.050> absolutely<00:06:51.050> perfect<00:06:51.980> so<00:06:52.700> that's

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
weapon set absolutely perfect so that's
