layers of clear coat over the color and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.109 
layers of clear coat over the color and
that's<00:00:14.019> what<00:00:14.259> gives<00:00:14.409> it<00:00:14.650> its<00:00:14.860> depth<00:00:15.219> you<00:00:15.940> use<00:00:16.090> a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
that's what gives it its depth you use a

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.710 
that's what gives it its depth you use a
hybrid<00:00:16.480> acetate<00:00:17.320> based<00:00:17.680> finish<00:00:18.180> very<00:00:19.180> similar

as the tone of the guitar is concerned

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.230 
as the tone of the guitar is concerned
you<00:00:26.710> want<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:27.010> keep<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.340> finish<00:00:27.640> thin<00:00:27.970> so<00:00:28.210> that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
you want to keep the finish thin so that

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.540 
you want to keep the finish thin so that
guitar<00:00:28.660> can<00:00:28.840> vibrate<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.470> breathe<00:00:29.710> and

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
guitar can vibrate and breathe and

manufacturer the finish recommends this
lets<00:01:15.850> all<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.240> solvent<00:01:16.750> come<00:01:16.900> out<00:01:17.050> of<00:01:17.200> the

lets all the solvent come out of the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.230 
lets all the solvent come out of the
paint<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:17.890> we<00:01:18.070> get<00:01:18.250> much<00:01:18.460> less<00:01:18.670> shrinkage

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
paint and we get much less shrinkage

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.070 
write the guitar looked great if he puts
an<00:01:33.670> edge<00:01:33.820> wrong<00:01:34.120> it'll<00:01:34.390> toss<00:01:34.720> it<00:01:34.930> on<00:01:35.020> the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
an edge wrong it'll toss it on the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.740 
an edge wrong it'll toss it on the
ground<00:01:35.470> too<00:01:36.280> much<00:01:36.460> pressure<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.330> he<00:01:37.480> burns

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
ground too much pressure and he burns

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.900 
ground too much pressure and he burns
through<00:01:38.080> not<00:01:38.500> enough<00:01:38.800> pressure<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.610> stays

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
through not enough pressure and it stays

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.140 
through not enough pressure and it stays
dull<00:01:40.320> there's<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.440> fine<00:01:41.680> art<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.160> it<00:01:42.280> if<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.000> do

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
dull there's a fine art to it if you do

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.040 
dull there's a fine art to it if you do
it<00:01:43.240> right<00:01:43.420> you've<00:01:43.690> really<00:01:43.990> got<00:01:44.170> something

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.660 

I<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:50.020> most<00:01:50.170> everybody<00:01:50.530> likes<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.220> get<00:01:51.370> the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
I think most everybody likes to get the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.580 
I think most everybody likes to get the
outside<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.210> their<00:01:52.300> guitar<00:01:52.660> looking<00:01:53.020> good<00:01:53.200> one

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
outside of their guitar looking good one

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.990 
outside of their guitar looking good one
of<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.800> things<00:01:53.980> we<00:01:54.130> really<00:01:54.460> take<00:01:54.700> special

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
of the things we really take special

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.640 
of the things we really take special
pride<00:01:55.360> in<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.020> places<00:01:56.410> that<00:01:56.530> you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
pride in is that the places that you

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
guitar looks great but the inside looks

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.640 
guitar looks great but the inside looks
great<00:02:33.970> too<00:02:34.210> it's<00:02:34.630> kind<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> fine<00:02:35.410> watch

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
you know that the inside is as much

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.740 
you know that the inside is as much
precision<00:02:38.230> piece<00:02:38.830> as<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.070> outside<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.850> if<00:02:40.570> you

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
precision piece as the outside is if you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.320 
precision piece as the outside is if you
open<00:02:41.020> up<00:02:41.380> your<00:02:41.680> guitar<00:02:41.830> or<00:02:42.340> whatever<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.210> is

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
you'll never be looking then you can

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.630 
you'll never be looking then you can
really<00:02:46.870> see<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.590> kind<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:47.890> quality<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.340> they

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
really see the kind of quality that they

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.940 
really see the kind of quality that they
stand<00:02:48.910> for<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:50.260> that's<00:02:50.350> what<00:02:50.560> we're<00:02:50.710> doing
