in the Pacific Ocean was in the phone um
and<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.680> may<00:00:43.829> not<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.129> used<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> best

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and I may not have used the best

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.880 
and I may not have used the best
possible<00:00:45.600> method<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.230> there<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> use<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
possible method out there but I use a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.279 
possible method out there but I use a
method<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.370> worked<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:47.730> me<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
method that worked for me and it was the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.660 
method that worked for me and it was the
one<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.920> popped<00:00:50.340> into<00:00:50.489> my<00:00:50.640> head

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
one that just popped into my head

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.340 
one that just popped into my head
obviously<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.629> easiest<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.199> of

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
obviously it was the easiest kind of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
obviously it was the easiest kind of
thing<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> drop<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> hat<00:00:53.550> so

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
thing to do with the drop of a hat so

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.060 
thing to do with the drop of a hat so
actually<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.840> had<00:00:54.960> all<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.289> contacts<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.980> my

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
actually I had all my contacts on my

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.520 
actually I had all my contacts on my
iPhone<00:00:56.489> saved<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.270> my<00:00:57.420> contacts<00:00:57.899> app<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.379> my

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
iPhone saved to my contacts app on my

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
iPhone saved to my contacts app on my
Mac<00:00:58.739> which<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.309> typical<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.850> lot<00:01:00.359> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
Mac which is pretty typical a lot of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.939 
Mac which is pretty typical a lot of
people<00:01:00.660> sync<00:01:00.899> their<00:01:01.020> contacts<00:01:01.410> between<00:01:01.620> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
people sync their contacts between that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
people sync their contacts between that
app<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> was<00:01:03.690> able<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
app and so that way I was able to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.260 
app and so that way I was able to
actually<00:01:04.170> take<00:01:04.439> those<00:01:04.650> contacts<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.519> export

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
actually take those contacts and export

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
actually take those contacts and export
them<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.659> dot<00:01:06.900> CSV<00:01:07.409> file<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.340> think

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
them to a dot CSV file which I think

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.330 
them to a dot CSV file which I think
could<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.030> import<00:01:09.840> into<00:01:10.020> my<00:01:10.470> Google<00:01:11.250> account

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
could then import into my Google account

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.490 
could then import into my Google account
contacts<00:01:12.090> list<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> way<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> actually

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
contacts list so that way it actually

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.080 
contacts list so that way it actually
tagged<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> separately<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> whole

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
tagged it separately so I have a whole

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.600 
tagged it separately so I have a whole
separate<00:01:15.509> section<00:01:16.409> tag<00:01:16.710> section<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.250> iPhone

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
this took some getting used to initially

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
a one or two tap kind of situation to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.280 
a one or two tap kind of situation to
tap<00:02:40.520> boom<00:02:40.820> right<00:02:41.330> apps<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.990> had<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.170> figure

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
tap boom right apps and I had to figure

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.500 
tap boom right apps and I had to figure
out<00:02:42.380> how<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.560> close<00:02:42.830> apps<00:02:43.190> because<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.270> was

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
out how to close apps because that was

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.690 
out how to close apps because that was
different<00:02:44.720> from<00:02:44.870> other<00:02:45.110> Android<00:02:45.590> devices<00:02:45.700> and

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
different from other Android devices and

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.040 
different from other Android devices and
I<00:02:46.790> didn't<00:02:47.090> now<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.240> actually<00:02:47.510> have<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.840> think

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
I didn't now I actually have to think

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.810 
I didn't now I actually have to think
about<00:02:48.260> closing<00:02:48.440> applications<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.459> not<00:02:49.550> using

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
about closing applications and not using

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.699 
about closing applications and not using
up<00:02:49.910> all<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.120> RAM<00:02:50.270> on<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.570> phone<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.620> was

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
up all the RAM on the phone so that was

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.780 
up all the RAM on the phone so that was
another<00:02:51.890> thing<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.250> think<00:02:52.400> about<00:02:52.459> but

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
another thing to think about but

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.340 
another thing to think about but
