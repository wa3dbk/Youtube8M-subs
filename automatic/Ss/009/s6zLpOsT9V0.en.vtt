deal i guess i can even say like I said

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480 
deal i guess i can even say like I said
in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.720> Lamont<00:01:25.110> Peterson<00:01:25.259> Timothy<00:01:26.250> Bradley

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
in the Lamont Peterson Timothy Bradley

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670 
in the Lamont Peterson Timothy Bradley
when<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.270> fight<00:01:27.570> got<00:01:27.720> announced<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.290> really

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
when that fight got announced I really

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.499 
when that fight got announced I really
was<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.009> Bradley<00:01:29.549> then<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.970> changed<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.479> mind

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
was on Bradley then I changed my mind

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.109 
was on Bradley then I changed my mind
but<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> reason<00:01:31.799> why<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> was<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.640> Bradley

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
but the reason why I was on Bradley

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
but the reason why I was on Bradley
earliest<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:33.840> Lamont<00:01:34.380> Peterson's<00:01:34.890> last

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
earliest because Lamont Peterson's last

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.789 
earliest because Lamont Peterson's last
fight<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.240> way<00:01:36.390> he<00:01:36.570> came<00:01:36.780> forward<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.500> saw

really fast hands and we found out now

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.460 
really fast hands and we found out now
that<00:03:11.310> he<00:03:11.790> definitely<00:03:12.209> has<00:03:12.540> pop<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.139> his<00:03:13.260> last

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
that he definitely has pop in his last

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.830 
that he definitely has pop in his last
two<00:03:13.709> fights<00:03:13.849> enough<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:15.030> make<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.329> respect

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
two fights enough to make you respect

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.750 
two fights enough to make you respect
him<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.139> guess<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.769> where<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.340> think

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
him and I guess this is where I think

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.460 
him and I guess this is where I think
he's<00:03:17.849> just<00:03:18.030> better<00:03:18.329> all-around<00:03:18.629> fighter<00:03:19.199> so

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
he's just better all-around fighter so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.530 
he's just better all-around fighter so
no<00:03:19.590> matter<00:03:19.709> how<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.040> fights<00:03:20.400> going<00:03:20.639> on<00:03:20.760> your
