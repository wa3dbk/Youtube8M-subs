00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello together after my last video 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:05.910
 I wrote to a subscriber 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.680
 and wanted to know if I maybe one 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.559
 make video about false eyelashes 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
 and how to correctly apply them if 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.559
 So you have exactly the same problems 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.090
 then you should now stay tuned because 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.640
 in this video thats me so you 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.740
 answer other questions and be on the spot 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 show how to correct false eyelashes 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 Apply a lot of fun before me 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.529
 again tutorial beginning he will show you 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.730
 still fast my three favorite 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.519
 eyelashes and that would be in any case 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.300
 pull from p2 here are the passion 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.340
 for special 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.050
 So you have a clear vacancy 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.720
 was always attached to it that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 means you can do it without eyeliner 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.489
 wear without you would see that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.050
 then they are very thin but super long 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.210
 which is of course talking here though 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.120
 this extra kick to length again 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.870
 I have adoption then I have ss 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.280
 the frame for frame 05 to be natural 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.860
 Personally, not so much longer 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.780
 rather of volume also have a clear / 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.430
 band and if you do not even 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.989
 wanted to start a whole band and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.670
 really a great natural result 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.499
 want to have then I would always 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 single eyelashes recommend as are here 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:08.729
 also from eating steve blame for sale 04 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.229
 single are shorter down here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.999
 they become longer that means you are 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.420
 can the really super variable 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:18.090
 Adjustment too much or as little as you 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 want to apply if you then we 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.789
 have found the use synonymous 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.859
 you will always like to guess 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.630
 nestle once completely finished 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:26.399
 This is especially your eye make up 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.249
 so expensive eyelashes 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.419
 because the wrong of the should always 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.490
 last step is yours 

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:33.840
 eye make-up so come almost no 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.700
 mascara on the eyelashes 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.829
 This makes them easy to clean 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.329
 if you take her off again and by doing so 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.159
 keep them longer danny quicksilver 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.469
 False eyelashes quite simply several times 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.090
 Use blood here if they really are 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.380
 each have but still convenient 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.349
 after I wear it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.939
 Apply this up to ten times 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:52.380
 really pure exercise and thus the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.700
 do not totally wrong right away 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 runs like i did in the beginning 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.420
 did I tell you would 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.460
 tutorial too 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.350
 but do not despair it is really 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.880
 really practice thing and if you are in the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.710
 fall on a special evening on each 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.330
 I would not advise to wear it 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.040
 She's in for the first time this evening 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.750
 wear but practice it first 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.030
 Free afternoon if you are not 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.790
 So really need practice makes 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.590
 Master in this case so enough info 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.120
 Now it starts with the tutorial I 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.220
 I hope I could get you to somehow 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.550
 If yes , I would help myself as always 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.709
 look over once and euro 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.390
 So here you see the eyelashes 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.370
 I'll use that coming in like that 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 a small paper box in the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.150
 There is a small plastic thing 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.830
 on which the eyelashes are moored with 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.209
 a light glue then the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.260
 but not about them on yours 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.390
 eyes to fix 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.160
 this is usually a small sticker 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.690
 still included in the pack 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.049
 here now so begins the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.700
 eyelashes quite easily and this stream of sand 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.010
 remove plastic thing best we 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.440
 your fingers or tweezers and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.549
 best starts from the outside without it 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.549
 to damage the eyelashes 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.650
 if you have your eyelashes then you see 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.900
 it's the most false eyelashes easy 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.170
 they are way too long, so they look good 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.580
 every eye because they want yours 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.230
 could arbitrarily cut so puts on 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.730
 best like me here on eye once 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.550
 and then you see a part of the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.080
 just too long 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.400
 So go through a pair of scissors and disconnect 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.740
 this part just once from then 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.840
 you need a pair of tweezers and one 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.460
 eyelash glue most just come 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.780
 as I said with a glue but I for 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.610
 two glue not good 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.730
 that's why I take that with patrice 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.140
 but that of acid too , then fine 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.330
 he will give them this through the donor 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.670
 glue was in it and sweeps her 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.010
 Just eyelashes once or twice until 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.660
 down with glue and then it comes 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.090
 it really depends on you 30 seconds 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.120
 wait until the glue is so light 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.650
 is dried and suzuki is and then 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.970
 you should best a mirror 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.530
 take or somewhere close to one 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.260
 mirror drangehen that you really 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.090
 Everything in full view I carry mine 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.620
 false eyelashes now on me as follows 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.420
 look down into a mirror and 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.280
 comes from above with the tweezers and the 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.110
 false eyelashes as between and 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.870
 Position this once so roughly in the 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.310
 then take my middle eyelashes 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.560
 me the pens of false eyelashes and 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.840
 pull it out and out again 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.450
 inside until I find the place you want 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.310
 I guess she also found it later 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.109
 I just want to have a nice life 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.910
 looks and then I take that 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.830
 Eyelashes try to get as close as you can 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.310
 to my course in the club too 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.170
 bring 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.240
 because the closer the two eyelashes 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.310
 are together and as unobtrusive it is 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.200
 the whole outside the more natural 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.570
 and I'm doing that as well as possible 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.280
 I take my wrong and 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.990
 natural eyelashes between the tip 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.080
 tweezers and keep pushing 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.730
 so said to her you really care that 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.620
 not only your skin in between 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.410
 but only have the case with you 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.000
 because you would otherwise really bad w 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.190
 I did that with my own 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.840
 finger the eyelashes nicely upwards with it 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.130
 you have the desired momentum come around 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.350
 The glue is exactly at this production 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.570
 also dries and then I just take 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.210
 once tweezers again and back the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.860
 eyelashes together to one another 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.290
 I feel confident and she herself 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.290
 really good and firm feel 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.689
 so i hope i could help you 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.759
 so Matip is even if it the begging 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.499
 team of orders then really tries 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.340
 to relax your eyes as soon as possible 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:31.379
 she distorts something or just does not 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.080
 The eyelashes have also been relaxing since the gp 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:36.120
 Wrong on your skin contracts and 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.229
 her as the clover commissioned as soon as you 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.819
 that too relax again 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.460
 then the eyelashes pull it feels 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.319
 just terrible and can at first 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.749
 itch and so what really tries 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.310
 to be relaxed and therefore should 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.020
 is also absolutely necessary to practice a few times 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.000
 before she really wants to wear 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.529
 if the video has fallen 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.590
 wish me as mentioned earlier 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.270
 look forward to one and a euro 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.250
 then continue your video feature in the 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.250
 comment box until next time
