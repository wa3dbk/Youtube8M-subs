00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.440
 how many times have they seen us in the 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.369
 need to use some image in 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.070
 some work but that image is 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.320
 too small for your project and 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.860
 resize need it more 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.990
 large and commonly if not commonly 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.540
 whenever you resize with photoshop 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.449
 to make the image bigger 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.180
 alters and loses its properties and looks 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.370
 bad well well I bring you the solution to 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.440
 that problem'll teach you a 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 application that is called photos 104 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.140
 I will be here I am going to open it 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.560
 and this has been the interface and the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:08.500
 photo desk a pro 4 well 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:14.310
 so if I have this image of their 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:18.740
 dimensions are 256 by 256 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.810
 I'm going to drag it to the desk 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.810
 of photos on the loose 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.920
 here in their pixels usually the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.680
 images have 72 pixels I put it on 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:40.200
 150 and in its size 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:44.250
 I'm going to increase it to 600 more than double 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.009
 here in the profiles come some 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.710
 options like soft photos detailed photo 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.560
 extra carved equal soft graphic on the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.619
 silent extra detailed for this 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.490
 example let's use this graphics 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.320
 detailed 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.390
 once you choose is the profile goes to 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 start here if you look at the bar of 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.320
 start scanning 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.590
 here is going to start a hairline to pass 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.290
 on top of the image 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.590
 and maybe because of the video I'm recording 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.710
 the video does not look so much but here you go to 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.690
 can see 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.560
 how are you scanning the image for 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.560
 resize 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.350
 since I finished 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.090
 this bar is completed that means 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.300
 that I finished well she ended here 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.710
 also in this part if you click 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.020
 you can unfold 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.750
 a series of parameters that also 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.940
 they can move him, I'm going to leave him like that 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.290
 then we are simply going to give in 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.290
 save as it ended 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.250
 whom I name I give a name for 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.250
 example the gift 2 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.880
 in type here come the formats type 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.060
 png jpg bmp yg i will leave it in png 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.880
 since our image is a png without 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.210
 fine background then only lamus 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.430
 save here in compression 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.070
 you read how is the compression that you 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.520
 you want me to put the best and I'll 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.520
 to accept 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.120
 and here we will show the progress of d 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.120
 that is being saved 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.560
 well already saved already we only give the 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.560
 made button 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.370
 and let's see the difference this is 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.090
 gift 1 the original that we would have of 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.090
 256 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.920
 and let's see the next 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 resized 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.740
 if you notice you did not lose much quality 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.740
 I do not even notice 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.190
 You can also open in photoshop by 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.190
 example 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.180
 I'm going to drag this image on the 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.180
 first the little one towards photoshop 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.969
 I'm going to file to automate and I'm going 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.300
 to choose in the second option here you see 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.129
 two options choose the second one is very 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.969
 important this because if you choose the 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:56.479
 first you will leave something record 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.479
 we choose the second 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.940
 and it's going to open the photoshop 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:13.270
 here is the same as the size 600 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:18.180
 you can choose the parameters that you 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.180
 you want and let's wait for it to end 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:36.419
 since I finish then we are going to give this 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.419
 resize button 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.120
 and the process begins 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.330
 and when finished this it will open 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.660
 logically in photoshop it's going to 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.660
 resize 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:10.000
 equal to 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.870
 you see what an interesting and useful application 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.210
 unfortunately I can not say that 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.699
 how it is installed but for that there 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.699
 many videos where they explain it to you or if 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.340
 do not simply follow your intuition not 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:26.810
 you occupy any video tutorial for 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:30.229
