00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
shapes animals this is whether this is I

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.759 
shapes animals this is whether this is I
don't<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.630> cake<00:03:54.989> what's<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> question

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
don't know cake what's the question

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.620 
don't know cake what's the question
which<00:03:56.010> pictures<00:03:56.430> belong<00:03:56.790> together<00:03:57.030> so

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
which pictures belong together so

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.860 
which pictures belong together so
matching<00:03:58.200> game<00:03:58.410> that's<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.430> repeat<00:03:59.880> do<00:04:00.810> you

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
matching game that's a repeat do you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.770 
matching game that's a repeat do you
know<00:04:01.170> what<00:04:01.920> these<00:04:02.100> hidden<00:04:02.430> letters<00:04:02.850> are<00:04:03.060> so

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
know what these hidden letters are so

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.360 
know what these hidden letters are so
you<00:04:03.840> can<00:04:03.959> go<00:04:04.109> through<00:04:04.380> them<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.859> they're

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
you can go through them and they're

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.349 
you can go through them and they're
two-sided

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
two-sided

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.720 
two-sided
so<00:04:06.510> every<00:04:06.840> card<00:04:07.109> has<00:04:07.230> another<00:04:07.650> side

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
so every card has another side

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.610 
so every card has another side
so<00:04:08.879> we<00:04:09.000> have<00:04:09.120> how<00:04:09.420> many<00:04:09.629> dots<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.379> count

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
so we have how many dots can you count

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.850 
so we have how many dots can you count
so<00:04:10.920> counting<00:04:11.459> games<00:04:12.379> do<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:13.440> know<00:04:13.650> where

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
so counting games do you know where

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.470 
so counting games do you know where
these<00:04:14.069> vowels<00:04:14.340> are<00:04:14.700> hidden<00:04:16.100> okay<00:04:17.239> just<00:04:18.239> put<00:04:18.450> a

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
these vowels are hidden okay just put a

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.530 
these vowels are hidden okay just put a

at this one look how many answers you

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.070 
at this one look how many answers you
possibly<00:04:23.550> have<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.030> it's<00:04:24.180> maxed<00:04:24.600> out<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:24.930> that

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
possibly have so it's maxed out on that

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.100 
possibly have so it's maxed out on that
way<00:04:25.290> we<00:04:26.130> have<00:04:26.250> animals<00:04:26.820> carrot<00:04:27.389> match<00:04:27.840> the
