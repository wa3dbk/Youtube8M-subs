00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.200
 when the brothers 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.509
 in it 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:20.800
 efe 62 58 and we manufacture multiple 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.820
 corpses the lines fit the pipes 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.820
 of water gas 3 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.820
 we install this instruction we manufacture 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.820
 the body to the subway flow that I am now 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.640
 of air 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.410
 also the real exempts minors old 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410
 director 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.309
 yes 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.000
 and it is that he told me it is said that man 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.480
 I was fuller is leaving with the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 villain 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.280
 that's why he probably injected a little 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.280
 more than once 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.530
 cast 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:40.550
 he could walk very poor he only takes 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.890
 little and temperatures are not heated 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.820
 I do not usually do not raise people there is not a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.590
 breakage risk 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.540
 in fact it is the blowout others more 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.790
 fuel gives you and more heat up and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.580
 there begins to be danger and more there is a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.580
 a certain point life can be damaged 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.770
 clear then he's currently going 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:07.600
 I have it tuned to 12 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.600
 because if you go with more than that 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.760
 180 degrees celsius 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.060
 is where having the low carbon 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.060
 you always have to measure it generates multiple 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.650
 because the turbo like it does a job 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.969
 dynamic the temperature differs out 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.280
 the journeys study in what to do 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:38.069
 front before the effect of work 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.069
 just reading because part of the heat 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.270
 good 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.190
 They are among those who see 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.670
 because it has a bed because as it is 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.670
 thinking about money the series fr 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:13.250
 here goes a voice to the air directly from 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.250
 the face of the tablets 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.460
 I'm an actor 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.880
 bersin 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.740
 of everything incorporated is designed to 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.460
 productions 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.460
 it is an installation 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.390
 I said as
