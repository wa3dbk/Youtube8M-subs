really hurt of school once again the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.130 
really hurt of school once again the
fact<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.010> we<00:02:35.310> started<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.090> bulky<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.660> three

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
fact that we started a bulky for three

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.170 
fact that we started a bulky for three
times<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:38.430> know<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.670> didn't<00:02:38.880> slip<00:02:39.030> in

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
times and you know we didn't slip in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.840 
times and you know we didn't slip in
from<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:43.140> can't<00:02:43.380> beat<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.850> we've

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
from it you just can't beat it we've

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.850 
from it you just can't beat it we've
done<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.380> too<00:02:46.380> many<00:02:46.500> times<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.860> know

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
done it too many times so it's you know

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.309 
done it too many times so it's you know
I<00:02:49.890> thought<00:02:50.519> we<00:02:50.640> had<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.360> opportunities<00:02:52.049> again

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
I thought we had the opportunities again

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.270 
I thought we had the opportunities again
even<00:02:52.560> though<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.680> don't<00:02:52.890> think<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.069> played

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
even though I don't think we played

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.610 
even though I don't think we played
great<00:02:53.549> at<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> same<00:02:54.660> time<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:55.019> did<00:02:55.140> enough<00:02:55.440> to

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
great at the same time we did enough to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.400 
great at the same time we did enough to
create<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.950> chances<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.660> again

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
create the chances in and again

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.730 
create the chances in and again
cities<00:02:58.920> initiative<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.670> finish<00:03:00.470> your<00:03:01.470> players

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
cities initiative to finish your players

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.860 
cities initiative to finish your players
seem<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.310> closing<00:03:02.970> down<00:03:03.090> their<00:03:03.480> players<00:03:03.720> in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
seem to be closing down their players in

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.030 
seem to be closing down their players in
the<00:03:03.930> midfield<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.350> little<00:03:04.530> faster<00:03:04.860> than<00:03:04.890> they

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the midfield a little faster than they

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.230 
the midfield a little faster than they
were<00:03:05.160> being<00:03:05.310> able<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.610> find<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.090> thought

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
were being able to find it and I thought

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.130 
were being able to find it and I thought
that<00:03:06.300> would<00:03:06.450> kind<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.690> really<00:03:06.900> made<00:03:07.020> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
that would kind of really made the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.690 
that would kind of really made the
difference<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.530> game<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:08.130> how<00:03:08.640> you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
difference in the game and just how you

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.400 
difference in the game and just how you
played<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.150> transition<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.690> how<00:03:09.960> quickly<00:03:10.170> you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
played in transition and how quickly you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.140 
played in transition and how quickly you
were<00:03:10.470> able<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.740> close<00:03:10.950> down<00:03:11.130> saw<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
were able to close down saw that in the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.110 
were able to close down saw that in the
goals<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:13.140> guess<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.250> did<00:03:14.370> what<00:03:14.610> did<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.850> feel

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
goals I guess what did what did you feel

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.150 
goals I guess what did what did you feel
your<00:03:15.300> team<00:03:15.540> did<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.410> make<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.710> difference<00:03:16.920> in

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
your team did to make that difference in

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.250 
your team did to make that difference in
that<00:03:17.280> game<00:03:17.490> oh<00:03:18.890> it's<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:20.340> traditional

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
that game oh it's just traditional

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.630 
that game oh it's just traditional
defending<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.500> know<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.650> think<00:03:22.860> they<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.490> a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
defending you know I think they have a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.950 
defending you know I think they have a
great<00:03:23.910> team<00:03:24.240> and<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:27.150> knew<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:27.540> had<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.720> close

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
great team and we knew we had to close

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.540 
great team and we knew we had to close
down<00:03:28.020> a<00:03:28.230> little<00:03:28.380> quicker<00:03:28.620> than<00:03:28.710> normal<00:03:28.860> really

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
down a little quicker than normal really

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
midfields like they have you have to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.280 
midfields like they have you have to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
have players that are closing the ball

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.050 
have players that are closing the ball
quickly<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.740> this<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:44.280> something<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.670> bit<00:03:44.820> that

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
quickly and this is something a bit that

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.350 
quickly and this is something a bit that
that<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:46.770> we've<00:03:46.950> seen<00:03:47.190> leading<00:03:47.910> up<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.240> this

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
that that we've seen leading up to this

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.680 
that that we've seen leading up to this
and<00:03:48.510> our<00:03:48.600> preseason<00:03:49.580> in<00:03:50.580> our<00:03:50.760> non<00:03:51.450> league

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
and our preseason in our non league

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.600 
and our preseason in our non league
schedule<00:03:51.930> we've<00:03:52.230> seen<00:03:52.410> some<00:03:52.590> really<00:03:52.920> really

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
schedule we've seen some really really

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.900 
schedule we've seen some really really
organized<00:03:54.270> teams<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.440> who<00:03:56.430> want<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.730> take

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
organized teams and so who want to take

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.070 
organized teams and so who want to take
something<00:03:57.150> from<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.450> we've<00:03:57.780> learned<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
something from that we've learned a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.780 
something from that we've learned a
little<00:03:58.230> bit<00:03:58.320> from<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.950> think<00:03:59.220> some<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.610> our

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
little bit from that I think some of our

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.830 
little bit from that I think some of our
younger<00:04:00.000> players<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.480> learned<00:04:00.660> from<00:04:00.720> that

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
younger players have learned from that

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.990 
younger players have learned from that
so<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:02.070> thought<00:04:02.490> we<00:04:02.610> did<00:04:02.760> pretty<00:04:02.880> well

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
so I thought we did pretty well

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.240 
so I thought we did pretty well
defensively<00:04:03.420> today<00:04:03.810> compared<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.530> earlier

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
defensively today compared to earlier

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.330 
defensively today compared to earlier
this<00:04:05.580> season<00:04:06.680> what<00:04:07.680> did<00:04:07.770> you<00:04:07.860> feel<00:04:08.040> with<00:04:08.190> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
this season what did you feel with the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.280 
this season what did you feel with the
major<00:04:08.700> improvement<00:04:09.240> in<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.390> back<00:04:09.570> there<00:04:09.810> just

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
major improvement in the back there just

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.310 
major improvement in the back there just
communication<00:04:10.800> just<00:04:11.610> our<00:04:11.790> communication<00:04:12.390> and

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
communication just our communication and

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.740 
communication just our communication and
this<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.770> great<00:04:13.950> stadium<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.400> play<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:14.750> but

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
this is a great stadium to play in but

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.360 
this is a great stadium to play in but
they<00:04:15.870> can't<00:04:16.080> hear<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.320> coaches<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.190> have

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
they can't hear the coaches so you have

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.060 
they can't hear the coaches so you have
the<00:04:17.489> players<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.540> coach<00:04:18.720> each<00:04:19.560> line<00:04:19.919> in

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the players have to coach each line in

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.850 
the players have to coach each line in
front<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.370> them<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.870> thought<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.530> guys<00:04:22.680> did

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
front of them so I thought the guys did

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.340 
front of them so I thought the guys did
a<00:04:22.919> great<00:04:23.010> job<00:04:23.100> coaching<00:04:23.610> each<00:04:23.730> other<00:04:23.940> tonight

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
let's take the coaches out of it i

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.580 
let's take the coaches out of it i
thought<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.760> team<00:04:27.300> coached<00:04:27.690> each<00:04:27.900> other<00:04:28.080> more

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
thought the team coached each other more

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.960 
thought the team coached each other more

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
there's just so little space in there

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.400

off a little bit in the second half they

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.560 
off a little bit in the second half they
got<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> lucky<00:04:51.030> first<00:04:51.420> goal<00:04:52.550> but<00:04:53.550> then<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.120> kind

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
got a lucky first goal but then we kind

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.510 
got a lucky first goal but then we kind
of<00:04:54.690> make<00:04:54.810> broke<00:04:55.020> down<00:04:55.230> in<00:04:55.380> a<00:04:55.440> few<00:04:55.590> plays<00:04:55.860> we<00:04:56.400> had

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
of make broke down in a few plays we had

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.130 
of make broke down in a few plays we had
her<00:04:56.640> chances<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.120> put<00:04:57.300> some<00:04:57.450> away<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:58.020> know

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
her chances to put some away to you know

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.630 
her chances to put some away to you know
it's<00:04:58.470> about<00:04:58.710> storing<00:04:59.100> it<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.400> that's<00:04:59.580> what

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
it's about storing it and that's what

it's about storing it and that's what
they<00:04:59.820> did<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.800> then<00:05:02.040> thought<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.060> middle<00:05:03.270> of

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
they did and then thought the middle of

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.550 
they did and then thought the middle of
field<00:05:03.480> got<00:05:03.660> even<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.930> little<00:05:04.050> tougher<00:05:04.350> for<00:05:04.470> you
