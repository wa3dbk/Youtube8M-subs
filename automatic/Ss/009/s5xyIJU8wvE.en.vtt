00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.240
 a match that promises to be extremely 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.340
 stretched between nîmes 17th and laval 15th 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.259
 two teams looking to get 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.910
 maintain in league 2 a confrontation 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.800
 direct which is very expensive 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.869
 on the second to last day 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.189
 Nimes is on a level playing field with 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.680
 auxerre the first relegable 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.960
 laval has only two points of progress on 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.970
 these same auxerrois both formations 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.590
 have only been defeated by one 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.940
 recovery over the last five games 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.650
 evidence that it clings and that they 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.980
 have taken points to try to get 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.350
 to save 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.699
 the first opportunity and nîmoise a 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.930
 Olympic Nimes team almost at 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.930
 complete for this match 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.909
 in front laval and private fashion designer 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.790
 karim coulibaly and baby be three 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.190
 holders new opportunities for 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.760
 nîmes with a balloon in the surface of 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.040
 repair 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.739
 it's repulsed by lionel cappone laval 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.960
 resists in this early game is a 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.790
 luck for Laval residents with bekamenga 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.110
 one of the best scorers of the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.920
 championship that no longer marks since 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.970
 a few matches is still nîmes 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.630
 who has the best opportunities 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.950
 shooting of mouritala ogunbiyi 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.270
 the Beninese international inscribes his 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.310
 second goal of the season 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.689
 in the 41st minute just before the break a 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.200
 goal of utmost importance 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.770
 but laval reacted three minutes later 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.770
 the attempt countered then the second 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.780
 anthony robic 44th minute is 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.340
 the equalization of laval 4th goal of the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.469
 season for robic and nîmes who did not 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.890
 knew how to preserve its short advantage during 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:47.499
 long time in half time a goal 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.740
 everywhere it's confirmed it's a match to 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.740
 voltage 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.950
 the two teams that are going to have to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.420
 release a little more in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 second period with more pressure 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.050
 on Nîmes shoulders because nîmes and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.920
 the worst placed team of the two 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.240
 you have to win at home 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.930
 and that's the opportunity that can allow 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.610
 to do 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.090
 the goal of samir benmeziane at the 69th 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.730
 minute 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.190
 10th goal of the season for benmeziane who 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.250
 becomes sole scorer of the nimes 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.250
 Olympic 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.150
 the purpose of the relief for the crocos and 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.850
 who will still suffer because laval 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.440
 tried again to even another one 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.970
 choice opportunity it's pushed back by 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.800
 cyrille merville opportunities of 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.350
 two sides the match is pretty uncertain 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.570
 and the anthem clings to his busan 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.980
 still cleared the Laval residents who 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.090
 insist the Nimes who against with 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.860
 this fault in the surface of 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.709
 repair and the penalty spot 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.560
 designated by saïd ennjimi perhaps the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.560
 goal of the final victory for nimes 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.250
 is an action of the highest 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.470
 importance and saved by lionel 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.420
 cappone leaving laval a short hope 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.700
 back to the score but it's too late 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.799
 and it is well nîmes who impose themselves 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 plus one of the Nîmes who approaches the 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.290
 maintaining through others 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.080
 results 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.080
 laval stays out of the red zone
