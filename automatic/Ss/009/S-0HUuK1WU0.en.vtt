I<00:01:20.280> don't<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:20.909> kill<00:01:21.060> Brock

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
Paul Heyman screwed his WWE career over

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.719 
Paul Heyman screwed his WWE career over
in<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:57.689> he<00:01:57.869> did<00:01:58.110> CM<00:01:58.799> Punk<00:01:59.100> apollomon<00:01:59.490> had

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
in which he did CM Punk apollomon had

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.190 
in which he did CM Punk apollomon had
such<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> bond<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:00.689> such<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> connection

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
such a bond they had such a connection

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080 
such a bond they had such a connection
and<00:02:01.619> then<00:02:02.009> Paul<00:02:02.219> Heyman<00:02:02.490> had<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.700> kill<00:02:02.909> all

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and then Paul Heyman had to kill all

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.030 
and then Paul Heyman had to kill all
that<00:02:03.299> off<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.659> he<00:02:03.840> wanted<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> side<00:02:04.560> with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that off because he wanted to side with

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.520 
that off because he wanted to side with
Brock<00:02:05.399> Lesnar<00:02:05.430> instead<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.719> now<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.350> this

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
Brock Lesnar instead so now we have this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.979 
Brock Lesnar instead so now we have this
scenario<00:02:08.340> where<00:02:08.910> Leslie<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> go

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
scenario where Leslie was going to go

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.540 
scenario where Leslie was going to go
against<00:02:10.259> CM<00:02:10.560> Punk<00:02:10.800> out<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> helmet<00:02:11.400> sound

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
against CM Punk out the helmet sound

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.589 
against CM Punk out the helmet sound
like<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.819> said<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> don't<00:02:12.150> think<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.450> would

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
like I said I don't think this would

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.850 
like I said I don't think this would
really<00:02:12.720> kill<00:02:13.020> off<00:02:13.170> any

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
really kill off any

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.500 
really kill off any
momentum<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.340> Brock<00:02:14.550> Lesnar<00:02:14.580> CM<00:02:15.150> Punk<00:02:15.360> where

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
momentum of Brock Lesnar CM Punk where

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.940 
momentum of Brock Lesnar CM Punk where
to<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.810> victory<00:02:16.050> especially<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.800> was

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
to get the victory especially if it was

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.400 
to get the victory especially if it was
in<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.190> match<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.000> was<00:02:18.360> not<00:02:18.600> short-sighted

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
in a match that was not short-sighted

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.500 
in a match that was not short-sighted
and<00:02:19.500> match<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.070> very<00:02:20.370> close<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.120> that's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
and match that was very close and that's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.760 
and match that was very close and that's
exactly<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.140> when<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.590> less

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
exactly what it is when you get less

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.070 
exactly what it is when you get less
than<00:02:22.800> vs<00:02:23.190> CM<00:02:23.460> Punk<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.910> WWE<00:02:24.270> ring<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.900> very

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
than vs CM Punk in a WWE ring it's very

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.780 
than vs CM Punk in a WWE ring it's very
close<00:02:25.320> but<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.100> are<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> goal<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.610> an

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
close but if you are a goal in an

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
close but if you are a goal in an
octagon<00:02:27.360> or<00:02:27.570> UFC<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.320> course<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.740> would<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:29.010> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
octagon or UFC of course it would be a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.030 
octagon or UFC of course it would be a
different<00:02:29.370> story<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:30.420> I'm<00:02:30.480> glad<00:02:31.020> what<00:02:31.500> with

different story but I'm glad what with

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.620 
different story but I'm glad what with
what<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.340> witnessed<00:02:32.700> at<00:02:32.820> SummerSlam<00:02:33.330> between

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
what we witnessed at SummerSlam between

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
Brock Lesnar in CM Punk they turned up

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.850 
Brock Lesnar in CM Punk they turned up
the<00:02:36.090> violence<00:02:36.720> fact<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.110> they<00:02:37.200> turned<00:02:37.260> up<00:02:37.680> on

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the violence fact that they turned up on

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.710 
the violence fact that they turned up on
the<00:02:38.400> unpredictable<00:02:39.060> factoring<00:02:39.600> at

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
the unpredictable factoring at

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.449 
the unpredictable factoring at
SummerSlam<00:02:40.290> we<00:02:40.470> expected<00:02:40.950> great<00:02:41.100> things<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
SummerSlam we expected great things and

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.250 
SummerSlam we expected great things and
that's<00:02:41.610> exactly<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:42.209> we<00:02:42.300> got<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.720> I'm<00:02:43.020> sure

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
that's exactly what we got and I'm sure

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.690 
that's exactly what we got and I'm sure
if<00:02:43.410> these<00:02:43.500> two<00:02:43.740> were<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.010> meet<00:02:44.160> inside<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.490> Hell

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
if these two were to meet inside a Hell

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.070 
if these two were to meet inside a Hell
in<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.880> Cell<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.240> would<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.450> no<00:02:45.600> different<00:02:45.959> I

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
in a Cell it would be no different I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.960 
in a Cell it would be no different I
just<00:02:46.500> hope<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> WWE<00:02:47.100> changes<00:02:47.820> their

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
just hope that the WWE changes their

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.810 
just hope that the WWE changes their
minds<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.600> see<00:02:48.990> less<00:02:49.260> their<00:02:49.500> vs<00:02:50.190> CM<00:02:50.550> Punk

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
minds and we see less their vs CM Punk

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.699 
minds and we see less their vs CM Punk
for<00:02:51.270> hell<00:02:51.450> nacelle<00:02:51.840> especially<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.590> is

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
for hell nacelle especially if this is

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.100 
for hell nacelle especially if this is
going<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.070> last<00:02:53.250> time<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:54.050> WWE<00:02:55.050> is

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
going to be the last time that WWE is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.570 
going to be the last time that WWE is
going<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.320> showcase<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.890> pay-per-view<00:02:56.130> I

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
going to showcase this pay-per-view I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.490 
going to showcase this pay-per-view I
think<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.150> should<00:02:57.270> end<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.930> being<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
think it should end with a being and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.870 
think it should end with a being and
this<00:02:58.709> would<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> right<00:02:59.459> way<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.670> go<00:02:59.760> about

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
this would be the right way to go about

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.699 
this would be the right way to go about
