00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 the 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.540
 rockers dot net 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.039
 Well when we arrived in Mexico, it was good 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.349
 group started here in the us and we had 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.599
 the opportunity to go to Mexico a couple of 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.939
 tour times the first time we went and 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.619
 nobody knew us the second one is we went and 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.540
 we already know a little more people 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.000
 and there was this word spread and there was 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.019
 myspace and social networks where they could 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.190
 have contact with our music 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:44.540
 so if we arrived and it was to start 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.400
 from scratch we played where we could not no 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.869
 I do not remember when we started running 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.530
 but I did see if we were playing a lot 

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.600
 weather 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 without being paid 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.519
 but it was growing that's why we 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.410
 we were in Mexico because there was every 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.079
 we played there was more and more and more and more 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.839
 people and I think that one of the 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.309
 determining dates of the career of 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.970
 swarm was our first Latin lives 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.550
 in 2009 that we did not realize 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.720
 until we already had an audience 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.150
 quite numerous 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.900
 and more things started to happen later 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.900
 after there 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.430
 if they change in the way of composing not 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.960
 change if he always humberto arrives with 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.560
 a song 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.270
 with the guitar and sometimes nothing else has 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.970
 fix quote sometimes has more fixes 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.190
 ya da already has a song already with almost 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.009
 everything has already been done and we just played more 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.650
 or less what he describes to us 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.970
 it depends on the song but always the 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.840
 creative process if it's between us 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.700
 five and it's in the rehearsal room 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.189
 what does change are the techniques of 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.990
 recording the first record was very homemade 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.100
 the second feline was very very homemade what 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.750
 we recorded on my computer on my pc 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.280
 colorblind we were already a study we use 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.280
 tape we never had 200 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.660
 this 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.310
 the third guest disk saving 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.470
 we went for the first time to sonic ranch that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.010
 it's a very large study we had never 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.230
 been there 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.400
 and this one we also recorded a sonic 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.260
 ranch but this one for the first time 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.439
 we work with a product 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.439
 of ivory bye is not an Englishman 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.569
 and well yes that also keeps cool 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.370
 I think the band that keeps cool 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.810
 the sound d 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.810
 of the band between disc and disc 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.980
 Hematophagous was one of the last 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:45.159
 songs that we composed of proaÃ±o and 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.909
 I do not know if that was why he felt more 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.069
 new to us and we grabbed it like 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.450
 to accommodate her that I liked to play 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.599
 when we were rehearsing we do not like 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.769
 all the elements that the song has 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.989
 using all the songs but in this 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.069
 there was something special and I think as 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.800
 We considered it a good 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.629
 ambassador of the disc has as has 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.069
 like the old swarming sound but 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.019
 also like the new sound of this 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.780
 disk and it has all the elements that 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.090
 we like the romantic ballad of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.150
 most raw rock 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.310
 it made us interesting about the story 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.930
 that talks about the song that is not a theme 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.409
 so conventional 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.060
 then we get excited about that song 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.489
 as first single and already others 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.280
 singles we let the audience more 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.810
 or less this one, what are the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.219
 favorites and there we go determining 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.750
 which songs are playing but the 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.900
 first simple as the favorite of the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.760
 five 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.760
 for professionals 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.470
 we are already comfortable in 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.030
 Mexico 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.220
 ask another question until yes 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.200
 we arrived as foreigners can truly 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.680
 mexico we are not foreigners like 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.680
 magnify 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.180
 but we who better want us 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.819
 here as in Mexico I hope that happens 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.580
 is the idea 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.109
 there are many there are many Mexicans here 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.130
 many Latin Americans who live in 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.550
 mexico and 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.560
 excuse us and it's public that 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.910
 you can potentially hear 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.250
 swarm also in fact but good not 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.800
 is a saying is the truth the city with 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.869
 more Mexicans in the world is the df and the 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.419
 second angels 

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:40.990
 that tells you a lot and if you're watching 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.530
 every time 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.220
 more we do not use those artists who come to 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.690
 the action in the US hopefully and swarm follow 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.780
 growing up here as what has been 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.780
 doing 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.590
 no no no it's just beginning to this 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.590
 the album has just been released 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.550
 last year we already made some dates 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.200
 in mexico 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.520
 we start with festivals and right now 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.580
 we are in the concerts of us 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.879
 we are being this they want us we are going to 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.680
 go back and keep playing mexico played 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.009
 a little bit bigger we are going to do the 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.479
 Latin Live Festival in Mexico DF 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.099
 let's announce there a surprise 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.520
 also to mexico df but we can not 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:35.259
 say but they are on the lookout and 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.970
 let's go back to usa 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.400
 let's go back to texas how 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.310
 imagine in March we started roasted which 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.820
 to the judge that we were going to go step dallas already to 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.480
 other cities 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:52.170
 Texas and I'm going to keep playing I think 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.940
 that this disc is going to be the disc that 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.470
 where else are we going to play we have played 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.669
 so far it is not the album anymore 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:02.110
 busy to manage 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.419
 possibly we are going to go to chile we want
