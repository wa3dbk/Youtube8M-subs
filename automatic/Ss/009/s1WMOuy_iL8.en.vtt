00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
yeah I just got a point like where like

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.380 
yeah I just got a point like where like
I<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.740> spend<00:01:23.070> eight<00:01:23.310> hours<00:01:23.490> uploading<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I would spend eight hours uploading a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.060 
I would spend eight hours uploading a
video<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.140> would<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.409> fail<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
video and then it would just fail and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100 
video and then it would just fail and
that<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.340> happen<00:01:26.520> multiple<00:01:27.270> times<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.869> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that would happen multiple times so it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
that would happen multiple times so it
just<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> point<00:01:28.710> where<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> was<00:01:29.369> just

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
just got to the point where I was just

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
just got to the point where I was just
that<00:01:30.119> pissed<00:01:30.420> off<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.140> like<00:01:31.290> I'm<00:01:31.500> just

gonna<00:01:31.799> wait<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:33.150> huge<00:01:33.509> reason<00:01:33.659> why<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
gonna wait and a huge reason why I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
gonna wait and a huge reason why I
thought<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> why<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> wait<00:01:35.549> is

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
thought I why I was going to wait is

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.539 
thought I why I was going to wait is
because<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.270> isp<00:01:36.810> kept<00:01:37.189> leading<00:01:38.189> me<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
because my isp kept leading me to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.770 
because my isp kept leading me to
believe<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.689> getting

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
anyways so like a good way to start

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.120 
anyways so like a good way to start
again<00:03:13.360> it's<00:03:13.540> like<00:03:13.690> making<00:03:14.230> videos<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.860> kind<00:03:15.040> of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
again it's like making videos is kind of

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.800 
again it's like making videos is kind of
like<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.370> gym<00:03:15.580> where<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.820> if<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.120> stop<00:03:16.390> it's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
like the gym where you if you stop it's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.509 
like the gym where you if you stop it's
hard<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.260> get<00:03:17.440> back<00:03:17.590> into<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:18.010> groove<00:03:18.160> and

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
hard to get back into the groove and

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.100 
hard to get back into the groove and
then<00:03:19.000> once<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.300> get<00:03:19.450> back<00:03:19.570> into<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.959> groove

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
then once you get back into the groove

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.580 
then once you get back into the groove
it<00:03:20.350> starts<00:03:20.680> being<00:03:21.540> becoming<00:03:22.540> easier<00:03:22.750> again<00:03:23.230> so

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
it starts being becoming easier again so

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.520 
it starts being becoming easier again so
