00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.790
 hey people and welcome to the felt 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.000
 five shots of a new chip 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.309
 Video 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 Today it's his turn because I have 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.190
 because sometimes something was said which is not true 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.190
 and there are also a few small ones 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 tricks 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.330
 So first, the always this video should 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.539
 it does not serve to you hey super 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.789
 diamond techniques to show it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.800
 rather, it's about having one of these 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.369
 Tempi times, it just starts again 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.840
 a few little things to learn so 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.760
 first to what i said i 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 'm so I do not know if I was in the the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 Last release video said that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 would be like a car tech riester is what 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.250
 That's not true, that's what I want you to do 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 so once usually show up 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.329
 everything from texas I could auto 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.129
 tech is making Genotec 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.629
 but in her being the spinning form is 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.010
 it so i do a car tech i do 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.170
 the way through which I still have a car tech 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.260
 But my car tech will not 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 vividly just leave it like me 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.799
 have another hit but it comes 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.850
 no knight so I wanted the times 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.130
 of course I just have it now 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.290
 but now shown to the true 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.500
 smaller breaks this gives and his 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.610
 team bomb 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.020
 Just take a look at this and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 important is look at the spider 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.490
 Baumann Okay, I'll go home 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.110
 here to the right back 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.009
 and what does the bomb have done ? 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 she was flown with, if you like 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.150
 Make yourselves in the spinning shape 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.000
 fly your splinter bomb with yes that 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 can be many situations I changed my 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.780
 imagine 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.549
 there is an adversary to him you have the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 bomb you have packed and 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.790
 you do not kill him because you know that 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.259
 it would survive and you would be there 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.320
 go by because you happen to be too 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.360
 holiday lola I'm now but where 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.340
 I want her could it anyway 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.740
 watch and the bomb would fly and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.299
 the enemy would die 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.990
 I would not underestimate that now 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.310
 because that's the match and I'm mine 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.659
 not sure now I have that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.640
 but I can test my 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.280
 I do not know if they are spinning now 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.530
 Bomb over days when you fly back 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.960
 That's why I'm very happy 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.550
 not yet 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:19.480
 Nobody should pay attention to that 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.990
 That's why I'm doing that's okay 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:31.360
 often missing 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:35.200
 the moment is the security 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.680
 and 7 do not okay you over goals 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.980
 but it is those who have been quite funny 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.150
 the second trick is whoever with me 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.710
 really hope that is not so if their 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.510
 loveliness with yours you can 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.580
 at quasi could quasi an opponent 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.220
 jump what the interesting thing is 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.200
 you see this circle yes this one 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.760
 circle is mostly always fake you have 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.120
 a little bit mostly always 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.700
 more 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.250
 that is because they are here the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.650
 opponent but you do not see his hit box 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.280
 So his his you can almost 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.110
 Imagine having an opponent in one 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.850
 the floor, a square has indeed presented as 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.620
 yes, under this opponent a square forum 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.000
 circle I do not know how that is that it 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.820
 so seen the box in which to meet him 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.870
 if you look at it 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.560
 I think it's a bit more 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.360
 not much now 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.470
 I think I'm the enemy now 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.370
 actually should have and there speaks 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.110
 also to the box is really so far 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.120
 bigger than you can see here and 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.160
 even if the opponent moves yes if 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.960
 her because in the moment where he makes in 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.320
 the box is and even if it just flies 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.630
 with him with so it is not much but 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.370
 hey I know I can make my early 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.300
 So why do not I let that happen 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.910
 actually easy anyway 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.960
 know how to train so you can too 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.670
 just have an eye on it 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.110
 I'm doing it that way now, too 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.730
 that I do not care about the price 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.410
 but I have it I like it 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.960
 easy 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.700
 and that is also a greeting and all 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.010
 there is still little entry that that 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.780
 is probably something you can now 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.830
 already knows when otti have played 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.420
 you probably and me really 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.340
 People come on it when you run away 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.959
 yes you are so 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.889
 clue how here is a brand of 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.660
 pursued me well here is bavaria the 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.310
 just follow me playmate 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.750
 and your little spiders are blocking them 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.150
 skillshots especially later but still 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.360
 increase 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.690
 that was it for the video and one 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.660
 thing looks up 90 21 masri on 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.729
 Illies walks in the plaine or supporter 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.949
 I always have the chance in it so now 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.330
 also from me and I hope I 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.160
 could help you a bit 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.699
 to get better with lillys and has three 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.699
 new titles
