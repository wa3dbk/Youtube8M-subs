 the new city camping 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599

 the competition four points where does that come from 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.809

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.449
 the fact that today 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.709

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.409
 sir steps along 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.500
