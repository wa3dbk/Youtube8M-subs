00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
a couple inches off the inside I really

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.930 
a couple inches off the inside I really
don't<00:02:30.390> know<00:02:30.569> exactly<00:02:30.810> how<00:02:31.519> where<00:02:32.519> my<00:02:32.700> hair

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
don't know exactly how where my hair

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.210 
don't know exactly how where my hair
would<00:02:33.150> how<00:02:33.450> far<00:02:33.930> my<00:02:34.200> hair<00:02:34.440> has<00:02:34.680> grown<00:02:34.860> since

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.339 
would how far my hair has grown since
the<00:02:35.370> last<00:02:35.550> relaxing<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:36.720> even<00:02:37.140> would<00:02:37.319> be

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
the last relaxing but even would be

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.130 
the last relaxing but even would be
still<00:02:37.920> trimming<00:02:38.400> off<00:02:38.550> those<00:02:38.849> inches<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.569> think

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
still trimming off those inches I think

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.559 
still trimming off those inches I think
it's<00:02:40.260> pretty<00:02:40.440> much<00:02:40.650> still<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.910> length<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.390> was

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
it's pretty much still the length it was

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.390 
it's pretty much still the length it was
or<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> little<00:02:43.170> bit<00:02:43.290> longer<00:02:43.440> than<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.800> was<00:02:44.040> like

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
or a little bit longer than it was like

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.820 
or a little bit longer than it was like
oh<00:02:44.640> six<00:02:45.150> my<00:02:45.360> legs<00:02:45.599> were<00:02:45.840> nicer<00:02:46.260> let<00:02:46.620> me<00:02:46.680> show

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
want to lose my length because I have

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.790 
want to lose my length because I have
come<00:03:17.550> attached<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.450> over<00:03:18.599> time<00:03:18.780> but<00:03:19.470> I

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
come attached to it over time but I

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.729 
come attached to it over time but I
seriously<00:03:20.400> want<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:21.239> renew<00:03:21.840> my<00:03:21.870> easing<00:03:22.560> in

seriously want to renew my easing in

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.399 
seriously want to renew my easing in
because<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.870> evaluated<00:03:24.870> my<00:03:25.049> hair<00:03:25.290> especially

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
because I evaluated my hair especially

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.640 
because I evaluated my hair especially
when<00:03:25.860> it's<00:03:26.010> wet<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.610> can<00:03:26.819> literally<00:03:27.150> see

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
when it's wet and I can literally see

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.860 
when it's wet and I can literally see
that<00:03:28.650> my<00:03:29.159> ears<00:03:29.400> are<00:03:29.670> oh<00:03:29.940> they're<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> oldest

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
that my ears are oh they're the oldest

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.820 
that my ears are oh they're the oldest
part<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.170> my<00:03:31.349> hair

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
part of my hair

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.530 
part of my hair
judging<00:03:32.220> by<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> length<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.879> my<00:03:33.030> hair<00:03:33.060> now

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
judging by the length of my hair now

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.410 
judging by the length of my hair now
I've<00:03:34.319> kind<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.129> just<00:03:35.310> opted<00:03:35.700> into<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.180> ears

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
I've kind of just opted into the ears

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.449 
I've kind of just opted into the ears
are<00:03:36.870> probably<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.530> starting<00:03:37.950> hair<00:03:38.220> when<00:03:38.430> I

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
are probably the starting hair when I

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.240 
are probably the starting hair when I
first<00:03:39.030> started<00:03:39.450> my<00:03:39.569> own<00:03:39.870> hair<00:03:40.650> journey<00:03:40.950> week

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
first started my own hair journey week

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.490 
first started my own hair journey week
is<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.239> hair<00:03:42.450> that's<00:03:42.629> on<00:03:42.780> my<00:03:42.840> ears<00:03:43.200> now

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
is this the hair that's on my ears now

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.830 
is this the hair that's on my ears now
so<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.400> course<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.120> gonna<00:03:45.360> be<00:03:45.599> as

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
so of course it's not gonna be as
