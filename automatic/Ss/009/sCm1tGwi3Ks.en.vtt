00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.340

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.340
 anime recommendations for the holidays 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.850
 I'll start with super recommended anime 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.870
 for all ages and sexes and I gave 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.090
 plus one and at 0 the tea is an animal of 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 comedy with only 13 episodes and three 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.309
 real 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 the anime tells the story of a detective 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 his helper than the demons to his 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.050
 investigations, but it has started a bit 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 How many different ones are there for me? 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 often the great charm of anime the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.930
 miami has a motor a good face but so 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.559
 good that his term and was up to winner 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.479
 of prizes there in our beloved japan 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.450
 the anime followed recommended for boys and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.880
 girls but who are more than 14 years old 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 donating a jewish index is an anime of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.400
 adventure and romance that has two 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.009
 seasons 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.049
 both with an average of 20 and 25 episodes and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.700
 Tells stories of taking a boy who 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.500
 has a very sweaty arm with the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.119
 spirit of chance which causes 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.549
 anything touched by it 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.240
 I simply wasted 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.890
 get some miscellaneous order take and see 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.110
 world where science provides 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.180
 Strange powers for people 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 but in this world there are also sorrows 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.829
 who almost always hide their presence 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.840
 take a normal boy until he finds 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.619
 A little girl with a bill in her 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.570
 balcony 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.280
 He adopts the girl and makes everything cool 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.229
 buy anything and everything 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.000
 the one that draws the most attention in the expensive anime is 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.799
 that everyone is easier to take 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.030
 but the motherfucker always wins 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.159
 always manage to be somehow 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 totally random even stranger 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.280
 do not fucking make sense or 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.750
 always win that here in the river today in 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.219
 a lively show without even me 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.380
 I recommend it to people who are 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.849
 adults due to the fact that this 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 story a little heavy for those still 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.739
 kid 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.930
 the anime has 26 episodes and tells the 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.760
 history was a kid and see if a 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.010
 population that lives within large 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.530
 walls that protect them from the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.659
 ends monstrous giants that do not 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.989
 has no intelligence and its only 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.939
 motivation is to kill humans 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.439
 the anime is surrounded by mystery and blood and 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.909
 Your plot is so good, but so good. 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.579
 it was considered one of the great 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.159
 stones of Japan being able to some 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.980
 time to unlock big manga like 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.269

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.519

 holy war of the year 1743 with a focus on 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.970
 knights of gold being that the anime has 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.580
 a story just fuck man 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.860

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.810
 I've seen from the inside of several 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.610
 and several animals stay out of the fact 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.890
 you can also display some of the 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.860
 most charismatic characters ever created 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.390
 inside the universe if you say 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.250

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.980

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.510

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.140

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.150
 blood and I fell running in their veins 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.519
 which aims to achieve a 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.650
 certain peace between humans and demons 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.480
 if you are a fan of nem you have a good 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.069
 level for you see on vacation 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.230
 if you're already big enough to 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.410
 watch horror movies alone and those 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.060
 that may at dawn on the band is 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.280
 Needed my pregnant mommy bag

 social security that one day is recruited 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.229
 to a game where you need to kill and 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.300
 even surviving could only be more 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.640
 a cliche if it were not for the fact that 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.930
 that the prize is one that will survive your 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.789
 God's abode 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.410
 besides trying not to die the protagonist 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.169
 and what you still need to give at least 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.650
 passionate and psychopathic of this animal with 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.270
 certainty that attracts the most attention 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.430
 if you like a lighter team with 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.830
 more dynamism and why not even the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.930
 romance I will indicate but today the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.389
 mm with 26 episodes that tell the story 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.430
 of kazuki a normal and ordinary boy like 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.560
 any other than on a certain day in a 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.770
 act of heroism die trying to protect 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.139
 a kitten who had soon after him 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.580
 resurrects and gains superpowers and together 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.470
 of the girl who starts to face several 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.760
 musicians to save the world these 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.620
 damn devils 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.260
 the anime has a plot very similar to the 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.120
 policy is similar but he 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.780
 has a peculiarity that makes the bath 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.580
 original 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.050
 so I think it would be great 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.060
 the mood of the led is unanimous with ten 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.550
 episodes recommended for little boy of 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.909
 little girls with over 16 years since the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.500
 enem is a little jealous then the 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.689
 name tells the story of a 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.520
 different from everything you 've ever seen 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:30.189
 the stage is a nerd and gold of all 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.699
 geek culture in general in Japanese right 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:32.800
 general 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.930
 One day I met a girl. 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.210
 that by destiny ends 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.330
 dying then states promises to give a 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.159
 way to bring back to life 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.319
 The coolest thing about this anime without 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.539
 shadow of doubt is being able to count 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.090
 every premiere that appears dragon ball 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.759
 It went out looks very strange of some 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.830
 good is there a certain moment that the state is only 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.169
 has a camera man rat he does a project 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.879
 of a speech walk is to tie and 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.639
 outside that big but no one shows up 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:03.190
 dragonball manga appears sfb occupies 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.289
 action plus a bulldog before the face 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.389
 throughout the year and appears on 17 of a 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.740
 good only in the first episode contains more 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.629
 of eight thousand boxes 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.639
