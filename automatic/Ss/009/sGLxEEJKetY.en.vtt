about the SE 200 the hydrofoil for my
boat<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.639> figured<00:00:14.880> since<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.150> got<00:00:15.240> another

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480

to call it for my boat I figured I'd

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
to call it for my boat I figured I'd
share<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.539> y'all

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it's nanoscopic camera which I will plan

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.339 
it's nanoscopic camera which I will plan
to<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.630> inspect<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> inside<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
to use to inspect the inside of the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.860 
to use to inspect the inside of the
cylinders<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.360> inspect<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> inside<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> my

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
cylinders and inspect the inside of my

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.209 
cylinders and inspect the inside of my
boat<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.500> double<00:00:34.620> bottoms<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
boat you know the double bottoms and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.990 
boat you know the double bottoms and
stuff<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:37.219> just<00:00:38.219> came<00:00:38.579> across<00:00:38.730> it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
stuff like that I just came across it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.400 
stuff like that I just came across it
and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.149> figured<00:00:39.390> I'd<00:00:39.450> share<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> so

here yeah small little it's not like a
pinhole<00:03:07.200> camera<00:03:07.520> for<00:03:08.520> LEDs<00:03:08.880> next<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:11.510> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
pinhole camera for LEDs next to it and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.760 
pinhole camera for LEDs next to it and
let's<00:03:15.180> hook<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.080> what<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.410> does

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.159 
little hole hoping you can actually see
this<00:06:01.150> and<00:06:01.360> you<00:06:01.449> slide<00:06:01.629> this<00:06:01.779> back<00:06:01.960> over<00:06:02.169> it<00:06:02.729> no

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
this and you slide this back over it no

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.439 
this and you slide this back over it no
plastic<00:06:05.169> on<00:06:05.289> it<00:06:05.439> and<00:06:06.310> then<00:06:06.659> you<00:06:07.659> have<00:06:07.810> this

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
plastic on it and then you have this

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.529 
plastic on it and then you have this
absolute<00:06:10.449> took<00:06:10.599> it<00:06:10.719> off<00:06:10.810> already

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
absolute took it off already

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:19.709 
absolute took it off already
this<00:06:13.539> stuff<00:06:13.779> is<00:06:13.930> difficult<00:06:18.389> I'll<00:06:19.389> have<00:06:19.599> to

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
this stuff is difficult I'll have to

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:20.939 
this stuff is difficult I'll have to
fiddle<00:06:19.870> with<00:06:20.080> it<00:06:20.110> a<00:06:20.229> bit<00:06:20.379> more<00:06:20.529> to<00:06:20.680> get<00:06:20.770> it<00:06:20.889> to

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
fiddle with it a bit more to get it to

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.600 
fiddle with it a bit more to get it to
work<00:06:21.099> properly<00:06:21.129> I<00:06:21.610> think<00:06:22.169> but<00:06:23.279> it<00:06:24.279> is<00:06:24.430> quite

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
work properly I think but it is quite

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.269 
work properly I think but it is quite
handy<00:06:25.000> to<00:06:25.289> look<00:06:26.289> into<00:06:26.500> small<00:06:26.740> spaces<00:06:27.250> like

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:27.279 
handy to look into small spaces like

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:31.320 
handy to look into small spaces like
similar<00:06:27.879> heads<00:06:28.090> or<00:06:28.389> exhausts<00:06:29.349> or<00:06:30.000> in<00:06:31.000> my<00:06:31.150> case

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
similar heads or exhausts or in my case

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:37.079 
similar heads or exhausts or in my case
the<00:06:31.539> bottom<00:06:31.689> of<00:06:31.900> my<00:06:31.930> boat<00:06:35.009> my<00:06:36.009> view<00:06:36.339> of<00:06:36.550> what

might be going on or not be going on see

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:41.640 
might be going on or not be going on see
