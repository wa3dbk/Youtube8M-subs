00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
messing around with this fuel pump a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.370 
messing around with this fuel pump a
little<00:00:08.099> bit<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.719> what<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.750> figured<00:00:10.200> out<00:00:10.320> is

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
little bit and what I figured out is

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.669 
little bit and what I figured out is
that<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.950> line<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.580> not<00:00:12.000> clogged<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.840> got<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
that the line is not clogged I got a

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.540 
that the line is not clogged I got a
good<00:00:13.920> clean<00:00:14.960> stream<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.170> gas<00:00:16.350> coming<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.340> of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
good clean stream of gas coming out of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.870 
good clean stream of gas coming out of
it

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.330 
it
all<00:00:18.750> righty<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.170> order<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.529> get<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> fuel

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
all righty in order to get to the fuel

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.689 
all righty in order to get to the fuel
pump<00:00:21.650> easiest<00:00:22.650> way<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> can<00:00:23.100> figure<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.550> do

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
pump easiest way I can figure out to do

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.330 
pump easiest way I can figure out to do
it<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.180> take<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.230> distributor<00:00:25.920> out<00:00:25.949> which

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
it is to take the distributor out which

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.169 
it is to take the distributor out which
I've<00:00:26.519> done<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:27.769> and<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:29.760> ain't<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I've done here and this ain't like a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.640 
I've done here and this ain't like a
shitty<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.750> know<00:00:30.840> Chevy<00:00:31.140> has<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> little

shitty you know Chevy has a little
twisted<00:00:32.099> gear<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:33.809> rotor<00:00:34.800> button

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
twisted gear so the the rotor button

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740 
twisted gear so the the rotor button
turns<00:00:35.460> when<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.760> pull<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.570> has

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
turns when you pull it out this one has

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.229 
turns when you pull it out this one has
two<00:00:37.079> notches<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.980> go<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
two notches in it that go down in the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.750 
two notches in it that go down in the
motor<00:00:39.450> I've<00:00:39.809> had<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> lot<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.440> looks<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.550> lot

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
motor I've had a lot of looks like a lot

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.250 
motor I've had a lot of looks like a lot
of<00:00:41.790> all<00:00:42.000> weekend<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.870> thinking

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of all weekend in here and I'm thinking

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.830 
of all weekend in here and I'm thinking
of<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.730> this<00:00:44.730> fuel<00:00:45.030> pump<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.450> ain't<00:00:45.690> very

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
of this this fuel pump really ain't very

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.639 
of this this fuel pump really ain't very
tight<00:00:47.149> so<00:00:48.149> while<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> got<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.500> here

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
tight so while I got this out of here

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.619 
tight so while I got this out of here
I'll<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.640> ahead<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.850> make<00:00:50.910> sure<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.149> think<00:00:51.480> what

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
I'll go ahead and make sure I think what

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
I'll go ahead and make sure I think what
happened<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> last<00:00:52.260> time<00:00:52.469> somebody

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
happened is the last time somebody

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.229 
happened is the last time somebody
changed<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.160> they<00:00:53.340> probably<00:00:53.520> didn't<00:00:54.120> do

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
changed this they probably didn't do

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.630 
changed this they probably didn't do
what<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.690> did<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.770> probably<00:00:56.100> didn't<00:00:56.399> pull

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
what I just did it probably didn't pull

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
what I just did it probably didn't pull
that<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.840> could<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.079> been<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.320> this

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that out and it could have been at this

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
that out and it could have been at this
thing<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.090> just<00:01:00.090> wicked<00:01:00.239> loose<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.750> had

thing we just just wicked loose I had

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
thing we just just wicked loose I had
him<00:01:01.050> turn<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> side<00:01:01.800> yet<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:03.000> don't

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
him turn it up the side yet and I don't

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
him turn it up the side yet and I don't
know<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.439> blow<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.280> not

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
know if all can blow out of there or not

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.149 
know if all can blow out of there or not
but<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.920> why<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
but if it can and I don't see why it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250 
but if it can and I don't see why it
wouldn't<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> pretty<00:01:09.869> good<00:01:09.960> spot<00:01:10.229> for

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
wouldn't and be a pretty good spot for

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.789 
wouldn't and be a pretty good spot for

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
know if I got any Volkswagen gaskets I

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
know if I got any Volkswagen gaskets I
don't<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> seal<00:01:16.320> that

don't know if we got for a seal that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
don't know if we got for a seal that
goes<00:01:16.710> around<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> base<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> distributor

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
goes around the base of that distributor

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.370 
goes around the base of that distributor
there<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.299> I'll<00:01:18.420> I'll<00:01:18.720> figure<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> out

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
there but I'll I'll figure all that out

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
there but I'll I'll figure all that out
as<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.979> putting<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.430> together<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> then

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
as I'm putting it back together and then

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.340 
as I'm putting it back together and then
we'll<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.350> got<00:01:23.509> okay<00:01:24.509> got<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.140> all

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
we'll see what we got okay got it all

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.530 
we'll see what we got okay got it all
back<00:01:25.530> together<00:01:25.680> she's<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.549> running<00:01:26.759> she's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
back together she's not running she's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630 
back together she's not running she's
still<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:28.080> pumping<00:01:28.439> fuel<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:29.280> things<00:01:29.549> I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
still not pumping fuel one things I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.289 
still not pumping fuel one things I
noticed<00:01:29.970> about<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.479> new<00:01:31.130> fuel<00:01:32.130> pump<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.700> if

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
noticed about this new fuel pump is if

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.550 
noticed about this new fuel pump is if
you<00:01:33.509> look<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> bottom<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you look at the bottom of this one you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160 
you look at the bottom of this one you
can<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.220> arm<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.869> down<00:01:36.869> here

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
can see this little arm is down here

below the bottom of the unit here and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
below the bottom of the unit here and
when<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.350> little<00:01:43.680> there's<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:44.280> rod

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
when that little there's a little rod

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
when that little there's a little rod
that<00:01:44.850> pushes<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> rod

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that pushes on this and when the rod

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.980 
that pushes on this and when the rod
pushes<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.610> should<00:01:47.970> pump<00:01:48.689> from

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
pushes it up here it should pump from

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.010 
pushes it up here it should pump from
there<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:51.090> thing<00:01:51.659> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there on this one that little thing is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.289 
there on this one that little thing is
up<00:01:52.409> inside<00:01:52.979> here<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:53.759> hanging<00:01:54.119> down

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
up inside here it's not hanging down

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.010 
up inside here it's not hanging down
like<00:01:54.329> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
like that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
like that
but<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.979> whatever<00:01:56.130> reason<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:56.969> pumping

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
but for whatever reason it's not pumping

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.149 
but for whatever reason it's not pumping
and<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:58.049> fuel<00:01:58.320> line<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.710> working

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
and I know my fuel line is working

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
and I know my fuel line is working
because<00:01:59.280> I've<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.790> plenty<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> fuel<00:02:00.750> coming

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
because I've it's plenty of fuel coming

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.600 
because I've it's plenty of fuel coming
out<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.070> clean<00:02:02.369> there's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
out of there it's good and clean there's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.440 
out of there it's good and clean there's
not<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> problem

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
not a problem

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.020 
not a problem
yeah<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.189> do<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> problem<00:02:06.540> right<00:02:07.080> there

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
yeah so I do have a problem right there

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.520 
yeah so I do have a problem right there
and<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.300> need<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.569> figure<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.989> out

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and I need to figure that out

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.100 
and I need to figure that out
okay<00:02:11.310> let's<00:02:11.550> talk<00:02:11.700> fuel<00:02:12.000> pumps<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
okay let's talk fuel pumps here is the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.920 
okay let's talk fuel pumps here is the
one<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:14.700> was<00:02:14.819> on<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.150> car<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.599> he<00:02:15.720> did<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
one that was on the car and he did you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.780 
one that was on the car and he did you
notice<00:02:16.319> if<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.620> depress<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.610> has<00:02:17.760> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
notice if I depress this this has a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.960 
notice if I depress this this has a
little<00:02:17.940> spring<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.489> starts<00:02:20.850> to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
little spring to it but it starts to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.670 
little spring to it but it starts to
actually<00:02:21.300> take<00:02:21.569> hold<00:02:21.840> right<00:02:22.140> about<00:02:22.410> there

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680

they<00:03:00.390> have<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.600> picture<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:02.840> fuel<00:03:03.840> pump

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
they have a picture of this fuel pump

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.470 
they have a picture of this fuel pump
that<00:03:04.319> does<00:03:04.769> not<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.910> little<00:03:06.060> arm

sticking out this is a generator only
fuel<00:03:11.940> pump<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.480> then<00:03:12.810> they<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.260> one

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
fuel pump and then they have this one

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.870 
fuel pump and then they have this one
which<00:03:14.579> is<00:03:14.609> an<00:03:14.850> alternator<00:03:15.950> fuel<00:03:16.950> pump<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.489> it

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
which is an alternator fuel pump and it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.990 
which is an alternator fuel pump and it
does<00:03:18.269> have<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.109> see<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:20.000> arm

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
does have you can see that little arm

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.690 
does have you can see that little arm
sticking<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:21.930> which<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.290> what<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.530> have<00:03:22.950> I'm

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
sticking out which is what I have I'm

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.720 
sticking out which is what I have I'm
also<00:03:24.000> looking<00:03:24.299> over<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.109> engine<00:03:25.859> numbers

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
also looking over here on engine numbers

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.080 
also looking over here on engine numbers
I<00:03:26.910> looked<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.239> Samba<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.109> found<00:03:29.070> another<00:03:29.400> site

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
I looked on Samba I found another site

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.569 
I looked on Samba I found another site
down<00:03:30.390> here<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.970> listed<00:03:34.310> these<00:03:35.310> are<00:03:35.459> all

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
down here and it listed these are all

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.699 
down here and it listed these are all
the<00:03:35.760> engine<00:03:36.090> codes<00:03:36.359> in<00:03:36.570> my<00:03:36.720> code<00:03:36.989> my<00:03:37.410> engine

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
the engine codes in my code my engine

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.949 
the engine codes in my code my engine
code<00:03:37.890> starts<00:03:38.250> with<00:03:38.370> an<00:03:38.519> F<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.150> only<00:03:39.390> F<00:03:39.600> I

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
code starts with an F and the only F I

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.960 
code starts with an F and the only F I
see<00:03:40.290> here<00:03:40.620> are<00:03:40.829> aftermarket<00:03:41.670> cases<00:03:42.620> 1600<00:03:43.620> CC

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
see here are aftermarket cases 1600 CC

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.280 
see here are aftermarket cases 1600 CC
so<00:03:44.970> I'm<00:03:45.030> thinking<00:03:45.390> okay<00:03:45.750> there's<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.079> good

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
so I'm thinking okay there's a good

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.099 
so I'm thinking okay there's a good
chance<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.680> I've<00:03:46.859> got<00:03:47.010> an<00:03:47.130> aftermarket<00:03:47.579> case

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
chance that I've got an aftermarket case
