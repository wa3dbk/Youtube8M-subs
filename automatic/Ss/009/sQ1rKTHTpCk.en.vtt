to get into them like right now and talk
a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.710> about<00:01:34.829> some<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> ideas

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
a little bit about some of the ideas

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
a little bit about some of the ideas
that<00:01:35.880> most<00:01:36.119> people<00:01:36.360> had<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> basically<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
that most people had and basically the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
that most people had and basically the
way<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> should

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
way they think about is that it should

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
way they think about is that it should
have<00:01:39.540> been<00:01:39.600> included<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.140> multiplayer

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
have been included as a multiplayer

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.469 
have been included as a multiplayer
component<00:01:40.820> anyway<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.909> should<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.150> been<00:01:42.210> put

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
component anyway it should have been put

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
component anyway it should have been put
in<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.590> first<00:01:43.619> place<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.070> lot<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280

against<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> whole<00:01:51.840> bunch<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.079> people<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
against a whole bunch of people and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.539 
against a whole bunch of people and
trying<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> sync<00:01:52.860> each<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.100> ships<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
trying to sync each other ships and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
trying to sync each other ships and
stuff<00:01:53.700> I'd<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.939> pretty<00:01:54.090> sweet<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.500> think<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
stuff I'd be pretty sweet and I think a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
stuff I'd be pretty sweet and I think a
lot<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:56.060> awesome<00:01:57.060> ideas<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.600> some<00:01:57.750> people

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
lot of awesome ideas that some people

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420 
lot of awesome ideas that some people
had<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.560> well<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.860> some<00:01:59.009> idea<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
had out there as well as some idea that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.999 
had out there as well as some idea that
I<00:01:59.460> came<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.850> with<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.439> could<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.590> make<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
I came up with that could really make a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.510 
I came up with that could really make a
potentially<00:02:02.640> great<00:02:03.570> multiplayer<00:02:04.439> game<00:02:05.040> type

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
potentially great multiplayer game type

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.760 
potentially great multiplayer game type
for<00:02:06.240> Assassin's<00:02:06.810> Creed<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> future<00:02:07.619> that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
for Assassin's Creed in the future that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
for Assassin's Creed in the future that
can<00:02:07.950> probably<00:02:08.160> change<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.819> lot<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.000> what<00:02:09.239> people

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
can probably change a lot of what people

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.750 
can probably change a lot of what people
think<00:02:09.690> about<00:02:10.069> regular<00:02:11.069> gaming<00:02:11.580> online

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
think about regular gaming online

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.950 
think about regular gaming online
because<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.450> mean

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
because I mean

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.630 
because I mean
schemes<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.560> guns<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.980> Icarus<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.370> air

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
schemes like guns of Icarus and air

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.610 
schemes like guns of Icarus and air
Buccaneers<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> similar<00:02:16.320> concept

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
Buccaneers that do a similar concept

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.200 
Buccaneers that do a similar concept
instead<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.280> being<00:02:17.460> on<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> ocean<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.120> in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
instead of being on the ocean there in

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.060 
instead of being on the ocean there in
the<00:02:18.300> sky<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:18.930> Zeppelin<00:02:19.230> style<00:02:19.650> things

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the sky and like Zeppelin style things

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.570 
the sky and like Zeppelin style things
and<00:02:20.340> blimps<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.380> there<00:02:22.380> are<00:02:22.620> first-person

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
and blimps and there are first-person

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.980 
and blimps and there are first-person
shooters<00:02:23.970> essentially<00:02:24.540> where<00:02:24.690> people<00:02:24.930> are

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
shooters essentially where people are

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.090 
shooters essentially where people are
just<00:02:25.080> running<00:02:25.200> around<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.590> deck<00:02:25.770> doing<00:02:25.980> their

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
just running around the deck doing their

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.770 
just running around the deck doing their
own<00:02:26.130> thing<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.580> guys<00:02:26.760> piloting<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.330> guy<00:02:27.600> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
own thing one guys piloting one guy a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.880 
own thing one guys piloting one guy a
whole<00:02:27.900> bunch<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.050> other<00:02:28.140> people<00:02:28.440> are<00:02:28.560> gunning

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
whole bunch of other people are gunning

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.440 
whole bunch of other people are gunning
they're<00:02:29.370> all<00:02:29.490> doing<00:02:29.670> their<00:02:29.880> own<00:02:29.910> thing<00:02:30.030> which

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
they're all doing their own thing which

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.420 
they're all doing their own thing which
is<00:02:30.480> still<00:02:30.750> pretty<00:02:30.900> cool<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:32.220> think<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
is still pretty cool and I think that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.980 
is still pretty cool and I think that
there's<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.000> lot<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.150> potential<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.780> too

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
there's a lot of potential for that too

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.300 
there's a lot of potential for that too
in<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.290> game<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:35.010> I'll<00:02:35.130> talk<00:02:35.280> about

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
in a game like this but I'll talk about

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.910 
in a game like this but I'll talk about
that<00:02:35.550> later<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.500> basically<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.560> want<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.770> talk

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
that later on basically I want to talk

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.200 
that later on basically I want to talk
about<00:02:37.950> now<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:38.550> how<00:02:38.640> they<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.910> easily

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
about now is just how they can easily

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.060 
about now is just how they can easily
transfer<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.110> single-player<00:02:40.470> component<00:02:41.010> of

transfer the single-player component of

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.980 
transfer the single-player component of
this<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.820> transferring<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.390> multiplayer<00:02:42.780> and

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
very well now obviously East ship would

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.320 
very well now obviously East ship would
have<00:05:05.159> like<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.430> gunboat<00:05:05.819> what<00:05:05.969> else<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.240> be

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
have like a gunboat what else to be

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.850 
have like a gunboat what else to be
faster<00:05:06.779> and<00:05:06.930> more<00:05:07.020> nimble<00:05:07.379> but<00:05:07.590> at<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.710> same

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
faster and more nimble but at the same

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.379 
faster and more nimble but at the same
time<00:05:08.039> would<00:05:08.189> contain<00:05:08.460> less<00:05:08.669> firepower<00:05:08.909> and

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
time would contain less firepower and

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.089 
time would contain less firepower and
pretty<00:05:09.659> much<00:05:09.689> be<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:09.900> lot<00:05:10.139> easier<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:10.439> sink<00:05:10.860> and

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
pretty much be a lot easier to sink and

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.070 
pretty much be a lot easier to sink and
we're<00:05:11.699> men<00:05:11.849> of<00:05:11.879> war<00:05:12.090> kind<00:05:12.509> of<00:05:12.599> like<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.960> way

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
we're men of war kind of like the way

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.119 
we're men of war kind of like the way
they<00:05:13.199> are<00:05:13.349> right<00:05:13.379> now<00:05:13.560> they've<00:05:13.860> got<00:05:13.949> a<00:05:13.979> lot<00:05:14.099> of

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.129 
they are right now they've got a lot of

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:15.860 
they are right now they've got a lot of
firepower<00:05:14.400> or<00:05:14.729> not<00:05:14.969> as<00:05:15.150> maneuverable<00:05:15.539> but

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
firepower or not as maneuverable but

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.779 
firepower or not as maneuverable but
they're<00:05:16.199> easily<00:05:16.409> still<00:05:16.919> probably<00:05:17.610> the

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
they're easily still probably the

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.909 
they're easily still probably the
dominant<00:05:18.180> ship<00:05:18.360> in<00:05:18.569> the<00:05:18.659> ocean<00:05:18.689> on<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.740> high

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
seas and they can easily do something

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.779 
seas and they can easily do something
really<00:05:22.289> cool<00:05:22.560> with<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.919> online<00:05:23.069> that<00:05:23.490> way<00:05:23.610> and

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
really cool with the online that way and

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.300 
really cool with the online that way and
they<00:05:23.879> can<00:05:24.000> honestly<00:05:24.150> make<00:05:24.539> it<00:05:24.689> so<00:05:24.839> it's<00:05:25.020> like

be<00:05:46.830> very<00:05:47.039> challenging<00:05:47.279> because<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.729> wouldn't

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
be very challenging because I wouldn't

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.100 
be very challenging because I wouldn't
just<00:05:47.969> be<00:05:48.120> like<00:05:48.149> going<00:05:48.419> up<00:05:48.479> against<00:05:48.689> AI<00:05:48.839> we're

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
just be like going up against AI we're

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.749 
just be like going up against AI we're
like<00:05:49.259> okay<00:05:49.710> you<00:05:49.830> know<00:05:49.949> it's<00:05:50.399> actually<00:05:50.490> going

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
like okay you know it's actually going

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.029 
like okay you know it's actually going
to<00:05:50.819> be<00:05:50.879> human<00:05:51.599> error<00:05:51.960> human<00:05:52.529> mistakes<00:05:52.860> and

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
to be human error human mistakes and

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.529 
to be human error human mistakes and
human<00:05:53.279> strategies<00:05:53.699> people<00:05:54.330> going<00:05:54.449> to<00:05:54.479> be

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
human strategies people going to be

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.420 
human strategies people going to be
thinking<00:05:54.870> about<00:05:54.990> how<00:05:55.169> to<00:05:55.229> position<00:05:55.919> your<00:05:56.069> ship

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
certain formation in which you can

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.629 
certain formation in which you can
volley<00:06:01.020> a<00:06:01.229> shit<00:06:01.680> ton<00:06:01.860> of<00:06:01.919> firepower<00:06:02.399> in<00:06:02.580> the

you can go and read online all the
people<00:06:11.699> that<00:06:11.819> thought<00:06:11.939> about<00:06:12.089> this<00:06:12.330> kind<00:06:12.509> of

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
people that thought about this kind of

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.999 
people that thought about this kind of
stuff<00:06:12.599> it's<00:06:13.020> like<00:06:13.080> I'm<00:06:13.319> inspired<00:06:13.800> I'm

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
stuff it's like I'm inspired I'm

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:15.170 
stuff it's like I'm inspired I'm
thinking<00:06:14.310> that<00:06:14.430> this<00:06:14.550> should<00:06:14.879> be<00:06:14.969> something

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
thinking that this should be something

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.610 
thinking that this should be something
that<00:06:15.330> should<00:06:15.479> really<00:06:15.659> consider<00:06:15.870> in<00:06:16.259> future

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
that should really consider in future

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.779 
that should really consider in future
Assassin's<00:06:17.069> Creed<00:06:17.250> games<00:06:17.520> because<00:06:17.669> they

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
Assassin's Creed games because they

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.469 
Assassin's Creed games because they
could<00:06:17.939> really<00:06:18.210> go<00:06:18.419> somewhere<00:06:18.870> great<00:06:19.710> and<00:06:20.479> just

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
could really go somewhere great and just

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.029 
could really go somewhere great and just
generally<00:06:21.839> have<00:06:22.020> an<00:06:22.139> awesome<00:06:22.589> multiplayer

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
generally have an awesome multiplayer

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.249 
generally have an awesome multiplayer
experience<00:06:23.639> now<00:06:24.270> the<00:06:24.330> idea<00:06:24.659> is<00:06:24.870> obviously<00:06:25.199> I

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 
experience now the idea is obviously I

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:26.869 
experience now the idea is obviously I
kind<00:06:25.560> of<00:06:25.589> gave<00:06:25.770> we're<00:06:25.949> just<00:06:26.099> the<00:06:26.159> basics<00:06:26.610> very

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
kind of gave we're just the basics very

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:28.670 
kind of gave we're just the basics very
fleshed<00:06:27.330> out<00:06:27.509> kind<00:06:27.930> of<00:06:27.960> just<00:06:28.139> the<00:06:28.259> simplest

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
fleshed out kind of just the simplest

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.809 
fleshed out kind of just the simplest
terms<00:06:28.889> because<00:06:29.189> they<00:06:29.250> can<00:06:29.370> go<00:06:29.490> really<00:06:29.699> deep

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
terms because they can go really deep

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.010 
terms because they can go really deep
like<00:06:30.180> I've<00:06:30.300> been<00:06:30.419> thinking<00:06:30.659> of<00:06:30.719> some<00:06:30.870> game

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
like I've been thinking of some game

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.019 
like I've been thinking of some game
mechanics<00:06:31.409> they<00:06:31.469> can<00:06:31.620> focus<00:06:31.979> on<00:06:32.279> instead<00:06:32.879> of

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
mechanics they can focus on instead of

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.360 
mechanics they can focus on instead of
having<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.389> so<00:06:33.539> every<00:06:33.870> ship<00:06:34.110> can<00:06:34.919> like<00:06:35.279> in

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
having it so every ship can like in

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.409 
having it so every ship can like in
single-player<00:06:35.729> where<00:06:36.000> you're<00:06:36.120> allowed<00:06:36.209> to

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
single-player where you're allowed to

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.089 
single-player where you're allowed to
equip<00:06:36.779> all<00:06:36.990> kinds<00:06:37.409> of<00:06:37.440> different<00:06:37.769> types<00:06:37.949> of

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
equip all kinds of different types of

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.129 
equip all kinds of different types of
ammunition<00:06:38.399> make<00:06:39.240> us<00:06:39.389> so<00:06:39.539> maybe<00:06:39.719> you<00:06:39.899> can<00:06:39.990> only

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
ammunition make us so maybe you can only

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:40.460 
ammunition make us so maybe you can only
mad

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
mad

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.770 
mad
maximum<00:06:40.950> of<00:06:41.040> two<00:06:41.250> so<00:06:41.910> every<00:06:42.270> player<00:06:42.480> can<00:06:42.690> only

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
maximum of two so every player can only

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.960 
maximum of two so every player can only
have<00:06:42.960> a<00:06:42.990> maximum<00:06:43.320> two<00:06:44.130> types<00:06:44.430> so<00:06:44.670> either<00:06:44.790> they

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
have a maximum two types so either they

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.690 
have a maximum two types so either they
can<00:06:45.090> have<00:06:45.240> like<00:06:45.450> the<00:06:46.110> oiled<00:06:46.560> up<00:06:46.710> kind<00:06:47.610> of

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
can have like the oiled up kind of

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.480 
can have like the oiled up kind of
heated<00:06:48.000> cannonball<00:06:48.930> or<00:06:49.230> that<00:06:49.710> cannonball

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
heated cannonball or that cannonball

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.700 
heated cannonball or that cannonball
with<00:06:50.670> chains<00:06:50.940> take<00:06:51.300> out<00:06:51.450> their<00:06:51.600> sales<00:06:51.900> stuff

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
with chains take out their sales stuff

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.770 
with chains take out their sales stuff
like<00:06:52.950> that<00:06:52.980> that<00:06:53.400> way<00:06:53.790> every<00:06:54.270> ship<00:06:54.480> kind<00:06:54.690> of

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
like that that way every ship kind of

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.020 
like that that way every ship kind of
has<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:54.930> certain<00:06:55.560> role<00:06:55.890> to<00:06:56.100> play<00:06:56.250> when<00:06:56.910> they're

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
has a certain role to play when they're

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.970 
has a certain role to play when they're
going<00:06:57.180> online<00:06:57.690> in<00:06:58.260> the<00:06:58.350> battlefield<00:06:58.680> without

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
going online in the battlefield without

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
going online in the battlefield without
actually<00:06:59.370> gonna<00:06:59.460> have<00:06:59.550> to<00:06:59.610> like<00:06:59.820> you<00:06:59.970> know

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
actually gonna have to like you know

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510 
actually have some guy come in there

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.970 
actually have some guy come in there
maybe<00:07:03.660> take<00:07:03.930> out<00:07:04.020> their<00:07:04.200> sales<00:07:04.440> one<00:07:04.770> guy's

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
maybe take out their sales one guy's

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.020 
maybe take out their sales one guy's
more<00:07:05.190> efficient<00:07:05.520> at<00:07:05.580> taken<00:07:05.820> out<00:07:05.940> the

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
more efficient at taken out the

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.430 
more efficient at taken out the
man-of-wars<00:07:06.510> so<00:07:06.720> it<00:07:06.810> comes<00:07:06.990> out<00:07:07.200> with

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 
man-of-wars so it comes out with

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.760 
man-of-wars so it comes out with
whatever<00:07:08.130> those<00:07:08.400> tarde<00:07:09.000> laced<00:07:09.840> cannonballs

whatever those tarde laced cannonballs

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.170 
whatever those tarde laced cannonballs
are<00:07:10.950> and<00:07:11.130> just<00:07:11.160> fire<00:07:11.550> them<00:07:11.760> into<00:07:12.090> the

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
are and just fire them into the

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.250 
are and just fire them into the
man-of-war<00:07:12.480> while<00:07:12.810> you<00:07:12.900> sitting<00:07:13.230> there

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260 
man-of-war while you sitting there

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.920 
man-of-war while you sitting there
pretty<00:07:14.250> much<00:07:14.430> useless<00:07:15.300> because<00:07:15.600> you<00:07:15.750> can't

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
pretty much useless because you can't

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.420 
pretty much useless because you can't
really<00:07:15.960> move<00:07:16.350> around<00:07:16.620> or<00:07:16.770> do<00:07:16.890> anything<00:07:17.130> and

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
really move around or do anything and

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.310 
really move around or do anything and
then<00:07:18.090> you<00:07:18.180> can<00:07:18.330> destroy<00:07:18.690> the<00:07:18.840> opposition

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320 
then you can destroy the opposition

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.050 
then you can destroy the opposition
quite<00:07:19.800> effectively<00:07:20.220> by<00:07:20.430> coordinating<00:07:20.760> with

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
quite effectively by coordinating with

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.730 
quite effectively by coordinating with
your<00:07:21.180> team<00:07:21.330> now<00:07:22.050> of<00:07:22.110> course<00:07:22.230> the<00:07:22.410> other<00:07:22.530> one<00:07:22.710> I

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
your team now of course the other one I

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.320 
your team now of course the other one I
was<00:07:22.920> talking<00:07:23.040> about<00:07:23.280> was<00:07:23.490> pretty<00:07:23.730> much<00:07:23.850> if<00:07:24.180> you

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
was talking about was pretty much if you

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.670 
was talking about was pretty much if you
guys<00:07:24.450> are<00:07:24.660> freely<00:07:24.870> with<00:07:24.990> guns<00:07:25.200> of<00:07:25.350> Icarus<00:07:25.650> and

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
guys are freely with guns of Icarus and

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.530 
guys are freely with guns of Icarus and
air<00:07:25.920> Buccaneers<00:07:26.520> it's<00:07:26.940> pretty<00:07:27.120> much<00:07:27.240> the<00:07:27.300> same

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
air Buccaneers it's pretty much the same

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.260 
air Buccaneers it's pretty much the same
concept<00:07:28.080> except<00:07:28.320> you're<00:07:28.440> in<00:07:28.530> the<00:07:28.620> sky<00:07:28.920> and

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270 
concept except you're in the sky and

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.220 
concept except you're in the sky and
every<00:07:30.270> player<00:07:30.420> kind<00:07:30.900> of<00:07:30.990> it's<00:07:31.110> like<00:07:31.200> a

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230 
every player kind of it's like a

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.630 
every player kind of it's like a
first-person<00:07:31.620> shooter<00:07:32.100> and<00:07:32.220> everyone's<00:07:32.490> kind

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.640 
first-person shooter and everyone's kind

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.070 
first-person shooter and everyone's kind
of<00:07:32.669> running<00:07:32.880> around<00:07:32.970> doing<00:07:33.690> their<00:07:33.840> own<00:07:33.960> thing

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 
of running around doing their own thing

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.940 
of running around doing their own thing
one<00:07:34.590> person<00:07:34.919> pilots<00:07:35.250> other<00:07:35.850> person<00:07:36.300> guns

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:36.950 
one person pilots other person guns

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.780 
one person pilots other person guns
multiple<00:07:37.950> people<00:07:38.130> gonna<00:07:38.310> actually<00:07:38.460> I<00:07:38.640> could

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:38.790 
multiple people gonna actually I could

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.710 
multiple people gonna actually I could
do<00:07:38.880> something<00:07:38.910> like<00:07:39.150> that<00:07:39.240> but<00:07:39.450> that<00:07:39.600> would<00:07:39.690> be

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 
do something like that but that would be

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.030 
do something like that but that would be
completely<00:07:40.290> separate<00:07:40.680> it<00:07:40.740> wouldn't<00:07:40.950> really

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.040 
completely separate it wouldn't really

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.350 
completely separate it wouldn't really
fit<00:07:41.250> in<00:07:41.370> Assassin's<00:07:41.760> Creed<00:07:41.940> because<00:07:42.150> it<00:07:42.240> would

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 
fit in Assassin's Creed because it would

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.020 
fit in Assassin's Creed because it would
take<00:07:42.650> completely<00:07:43.650> the<00:07:43.740> other<00:07:43.919> like<00:07:44.820> another

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.030 
take completely the other like another

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.820 
take completely the other like another
all<00:07:45.810> the<00:07:45.960> resources<00:07:46.290> that<00:07:46.530> would<00:07:46.680> be

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:46.830 
all the resources that would be

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.750 
all the resources that would be
completely<00:07:47.160> different<00:07:47.280> from<00:07:47.460> what's<00:07:47.669> already

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:47.760 
completely different from what's already

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.610 
completely different from what's already
there<00:07:48.150> right<00:07:48.750> now<00:07:48.960> and<00:07:49.020> so<00:07:49.260> what<00:07:49.410> they<00:07:49.500> could

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 
there right now and so what they could

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.840 
there right now and so what they could
do<00:07:49.710> with<00:07:49.860> what's<00:07:50.130> there<00:07:50.370> right<00:07:50.550> now<00:07:50.700> would

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:50.850 
do with what's there right now would

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.340 
do with what's there right now would
just<00:07:51.000> be<00:07:51.120> simply<00:07:51.450> transferring<00:07:51.870> it<00:07:52.020> over<00:07:52.080> with

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:52.350 
just be simply transferring it over with

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.110 
just be simply transferring it over with
some<00:07:52.500> extra<00:07:52.740> features<00:07:52.890> whereas<00:07:53.790> doing<00:07:54.030> it

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 
some extra features whereas doing it

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.430 
some extra features whereas doing it
that<00:07:54.300> way<00:07:54.330> would<00:07:54.690> require<00:07:54.930> pretty<00:07:55.200> much<00:07:55.320> an

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 
that way would require pretty much an

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.500 
that way would require pretty much an
entirely<00:07:55.740> new<00:07:55.919> base<00:07:56.310> game<00:07:56.610> which<00:07:57.270> wouldn't

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:57.510 
entirely new base game which wouldn't

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.240 
entirely new base game which wouldn't
really<00:07:57.630> make<00:07:57.810> any<00:07:57.930> sense<00:07:58.290> and<00:07:58.950> I<00:07:59.040> hope<00:07:59.160> you

00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.250 
really make any sense and I hope you

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.260 
really make any sense and I hope you
