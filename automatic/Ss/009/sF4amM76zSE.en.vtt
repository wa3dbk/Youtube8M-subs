valuable<00:02:47.300> fill<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.930> when<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.320> think<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.739> many

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
valuable fill and when I think that many

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.070 
valuable fill and when I think that many
students<00:02:49.550> at<00:02:49.670> Oxford<00:02:50.030> would<00:02:50.209> say<00:02:50.390> something

students at Oxford would say something

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.229 
students at Oxford would say something
that<00:02:51.380> benefits<00:02:51.620> them<00:02:52.100> by<00:02:52.550> having<00:02:52.820> an<00:02:52.910> Oxford

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
that benefits them by having an Oxford

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.110 
that benefits them by having an Oxford
degree<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:55.160> program<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.610> very<00:02:55.760> good<00:02:55.970> about

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
degree the program is very good about

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.479 
degree the program is very good about
taking<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.840> different<00:02:56.989> places<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.739> it's

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
taking you to different places and it's

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.310 
taking you to different places and it's

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
places before we went through your pc's

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.740 
places before we went through your pc's
and<00:03:12.680> informed<00:03:13.010> by<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.519> getting<00:03:14.390> off<00:03:14.600> and

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
with it I can go forward and not only

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.690

succeed in that system and that's at the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:05:02.050 
succeed in that system and that's at the
