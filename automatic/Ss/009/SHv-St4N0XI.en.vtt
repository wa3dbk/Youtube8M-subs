hello and welcome spin boy here and I'm
going<00:00:04.450> to<00:00:04.540> be<00:00:04.630> showing<00:00:04.810> you<00:00:05.020> how<00:00:05.229> to<00:00:05.260> build<00:00:05.529> a

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:05.589 
going to be showing you how to build a

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.549 
going to be showing you how to build a
monster<00:00:05.980> grinder<00:00:06.450> as<00:00:07.450> you<00:00:07.899> can<00:00:07.960> see<00:00:08.170> we've<00:00:08.379> got

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
monster grinder as you can see we've got

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.520 
monster grinder as you can see we've got
some<00:00:09.360> creepers<00:00:10.360> up<00:00:10.539> here<00:00:10.869> that's<00:00:11.199> just<00:00:11.379> being

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
some creepers up here that's just being

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.410 
some creepers up here that's just being
ground<00:00:11.889> away<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.670> we're<00:00:15.820> getting<00:00:16.059> there

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
ground away and we're getting there

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.240 
ground away and we're getting there
gunpowder<00:00:17.140> dropped<00:00:17.590> in<00:00:17.800> here<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.890> idea<00:00:21.160> is

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
gunpowder dropped in here the idea is

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.160 
gunpowder dropped in here the idea is
that<00:00:21.340> water<00:00:21.700> flows<00:00:22.120> them<00:00:22.390> down<00:00:22.570> here<00:00:22.840> into<00:00:22.960> a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
that water flows them down here into a

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.130 
that water flows them down here into a
magma<00:00:23.530> trap<00:00:24.450> where<00:00:25.450> they<00:00:25.600> don't<00:00:25.780> burn<00:00:25.990> up<00:00:26.020> the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
magma trap where they don't burn up the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.779 
magma trap where they don't burn up the
items<00:00:26.530> they<00:00:26.800> drop<00:00:27.039> them<00:00:27.190> and<00:00:27.310> they<00:00:27.400> flow<00:00:27.610> on

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
items they drop them and they flow on

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.720 
items they drop them and they flow on
out<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.660> collection<00:00:29.050> pit<00:00:29.350> I<00:00:29.619> have<00:00:30.490> currently

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
out to a collection pit I have currently

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.240 
out to a collection pit I have currently
a<00:00:30.910> five<00:00:31.330> of<00:00:31.360> these<00:00:31.750> grinders<00:00:32.529> working

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
a five of these grinders working

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.080 
a five of these grinders working
properly<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.980> get<00:00:36.130> another<00:00:36.340> three<00:00:36.760> on<00:00:36.940> the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
properly and I get another three on the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.260 
properly and I get another three on the
way<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.989> that<00:00:38.399> marks<00:00:39.399> that<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.670> one<00:00:39.820> above<00:00:40.030> is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
way so that marks that the one above is

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.580 
way so that marks that the one above is
working<00:00:40.690> now<00:00:41.320> as<00:00:41.770> you<00:00:41.950> can<00:00:42.010> see<00:00:43.440> it'll<00:00:44.440> just

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
working now as you can see it'll just

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.319 
working now as you can see it'll just
produce<00:00:44.739> items<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.370> drop<00:00:45.520> them<00:00:45.610> out<00:00:45.790> into<00:00:46.059> the

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
produce items and drop them out into the

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.190 
produce items and drop them out into the
main<00:00:46.420> flow<00:00:47.610> alright<00:00:48.610> for<00:00:48.790> starters<00:00:49.239> we<00:00:49.450> have

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
main flow alright for starters we have

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.470 
main flow alright for starters we have
your<00:00:50.320> water<00:00:50.470> flow<00:00:50.829> here<00:00:51.100> I'm<00:00:52.090> going<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.390> take

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
your water flow here I'm going to take

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.010 
your water flow here I'm going to take
the<00:00:52.660> main<00:00:52.870> flow<00:00:53.200> away

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.500 

and<00:00:57.560> as<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.830> see<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.220> water<00:00:58.430> will<00:00:58.970> stop<00:00:59.210> right

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
and as you see the water will stop right

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.790 
and as you see the water will stop right
there<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.990> things<00:01:00.950> will<00:01:01.100> just<00:01:01.130> drop<00:01:01.490> now<00:01:02.800> if

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
there and things will just drop now if

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.150 
there and things will just drop now if
water<00:01:04.070> can<00:01:04.280> flow<00:01:04.460> seven<00:01:04.970> spaces<00:01:05.800> one<00:01:06.800> two

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
water can flow seven spaces one two

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.720 
water can flow seven spaces one two
three<00:01:07.790> four<00:01:08.390> five<00:01:08.840> six<00:01:09.380> seven<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.400> will<00:01:10.430> go<00:01:10.610> in

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
three four five six seven it will go in

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.520 
three four five six seven it will go in
eighth<00:01:10.850> space<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.510> if<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.810> does<00:01:11.990> drop<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:12.410> will

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
eighth space and if it does drop it will

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.710 
eighth space and if it does drop it will
start<00:01:12.710> over<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:13.700> actually<00:01:14.330> goes<00:01:14.479> eight

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
start over this actually goes eight

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.890 
start over this actually goes eight
spaces<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.620> it<00:01:15.740> won't<00:01:15.950> fall<00:01:16.130> down<00:01:16.190> into<00:01:16.610> there

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
spaces so it won't fall down into there

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.030 
spaces so it won't fall down into there
however<00:01:17.900> if<00:01:18.020> what<00:01:18.200> reaches<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.680> edge<00:01:18.800> it'll

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
however if what reaches the edge it'll

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.090 
however if what reaches the edge it'll
still<00:01:19.280> drop<00:01:19.520> things<00:01:20.470> such<00:01:21.470> as<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:21.800> case

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
still drop things such as this case

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.460 
still drop things such as this case
where<00:01:22.400> this<00:01:22.490> is<00:01:22.550> going<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.810> eighth<00:01:23.960> distance

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
where this is going the eighth distance

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.109 
where this is going the eighth distance
the<00:01:24.650> water<00:01:24.860> can<00:01:25.070> go<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:25.729> will<00:01:25.820> just<00:01:25.940> drop

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
the water can go and it will just drop

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.420 
the water can go and it will just drop
things<00:01:26.330> there<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.840> put<00:01:27.740> water<00:01:27.890> there<00:01:28.190> though

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
things there I put water there though

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.950 
things there I put water there though
it'll<00:01:29.300> start<00:01:29.509> pushing<00:01:29.900> everything<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.720> then

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
it'll start pushing everything and then

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.270 
it'll start pushing everything and then
things<00:01:33.200> will<00:01:33.320> fall<00:01:33.470> into<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:33.800> collection

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
things will fall into this collection

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.080 
things will fall into this collection
pit<00:01:35.380> all<00:01:36.380> right<00:01:36.590> now<00:01:36.800> I<00:01:36.830> have<00:01:37.070> one<00:01:37.310> grinder

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
pit all right now I have one grinder

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.820 
pit all right now I have one grinder
that<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.270> built<00:01:38.509> in<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.750> wrong<00:01:39.020> spot<00:01:39.410> so<00:01:39.710> it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
that I built in the wrong spot so it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.340 
that I built in the wrong spot so it
wasn't<00:01:40.160> flowing<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.610> right<00:01:40.790> way<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:41.810> I'm

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
wasn't flowing in the right way so I'm

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.020 
wasn't flowing in the right way so I'm
going<00:01:42.410> to<00:01:42.830> rebuild<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.340> one<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:43.790> I'll<00:01:43.850> show

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
going to rebuild that one and I'll show

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.050 
going to rebuild that one and I'll show
you<00:01:44.119> how<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.270> do<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.540> you're<00:01:44.780> going<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:44.960> need<00:01:45.050> to

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
you how to do it you're going to need to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.450 
you how to do it you're going to need to
magma<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.450> water<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:51.320> additionally<00:01:52.190> you're

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
magma in a water and additionally you're

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.469 
magma in a water and additionally you're
going<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.910> need<00:01:53.119> one<00:01:53.450> ladder<00:01:55.300> problem<00:01:56.300> child

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
going to need one ladder problem child

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.050 
going to need one ladder problem child
is<00:01:56.750> up<00:01:56.899> here

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
is up here

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.219 
is up here
so<00:01:58.659> I<00:01:58.689> built<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:59.049> in<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.259> wrong<00:01:59.680> space<00:02:01.200> yeah<00:02:02.200> I

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
so I built it in the wrong space yeah I

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:14.490 
so I built it in the wrong space yeah I
totally<00:02:02.590> missed<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.070> flow<00:02:03.280> there<00:02:03.549> so<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:14.410> can

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
totally missed the flow there so you can

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.000 
totally missed the flow there so you can
start<00:02:14.680> digging<00:02:15.040> back

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.339

AFK and I've made this two blocks deep

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.590 
AFK and I've made this two blocks deep
so<00:05:09.410> monsters<00:05:09.800> can't<00:05:10.070> get<00:05:10.310> out<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:10.790> unless

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
so monsters can't get out of it unless

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.120 
so monsters can't get out of it unless
they're<00:05:11.810> right<00:05:11.990> here<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:14.860> jumping<00:05:15.860> from<00:05:15.949> this

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
they're right here and jumping from this

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.680 
they're right here and jumping from this
spot<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.610> usually<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:17.300> have<00:05:17.419> to<00:05:17.479> come

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
spot and usually you have to come

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.300 
spot and usually you have to come
against<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.200> current<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:18.710> jump<00:05:18.950> out<00:05:19.070> and

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
against the current to jump out and

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.120 
against the current to jump out and
monsters<00:05:19.669> usually<00:05:19.970> aren't<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.240> smart<00:05:21.130> all

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
monsters usually aren't that smart all

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.800 
monsters usually aren't that smart all
right<00:05:22.400> so<00:05:22.550> I<00:05:22.580> took<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.970> time<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.389> go<00:05:23.510> ahead<00:05:23.720> and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
right so I took the time to go ahead and

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.440 
right so I took the time to go ahead and
mine<00:05:23.990> all<00:05:24.169> this<00:05:24.410> out<00:05:24.620> for<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.130> so<00:05:25.419> you<00:05:26.419> don't

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
mine all this out for you so you don't

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.940 
mine all this out for you so you don't
have<00:05:26.600> to<00:05:26.750> sit<00:05:26.900> here<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.080> watch<00:05:27.500> me<00:05:27.710> do<00:05:27.830> this

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950
