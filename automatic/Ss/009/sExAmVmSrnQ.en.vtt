we've got our real supreme micro loop

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.570 
we've got our real supreme micro loop
he'll<00:02:14.780> actually<00:02:15.080> reduce<00:02:15.830> friction<00:02:16.430> and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
he'll actually reduce friction and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.940 
he'll actually reduce friction and
they're<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.090> 30%<00:02:17.900> it's<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.320> really<00:02:18.770> really

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950

they're the 30% it's a really really
good<00:02:19.250> stuff<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.240> final<00:02:20.720> step<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.560> do<00:02:21.709> is<00:02:21.980> I

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
good stuff the final step that I do is I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.300 
good stuff the final step that I do is I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
take the bearing Lube I work it in one

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.830 
take the bearing Lube I work it in one
thing<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.610> keep<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.940> mind<00:02:26.000> about<00:02:26.300> burying

put<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> little<00:02:33.020> bit<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.440> in<00:02:33.680> there<00:02:33.860> then

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
put a little bit of that in there then

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.630 
put a little bit of that in there then
I'm<00:02:34.850> ready<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.330> reassemble<00:02:35.870> my<00:02:36.290> reel<00:02:36.709> put<00:02:37.520> the

down<00:02:45.739> on<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.340> shaft<00:02:46.640> make<00:02:47.540> sure<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.870> get<00:02:47.989> it

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
down on the shaft make sure you get it
