00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.839 
even with me setting up a day and put a
powder<00:06:14.389> on<00:06:14.539> it<00:06:14.839> so<00:06:15.259> who<00:06:15.409> knows<00:06:15.439> if<00:06:15.620> it<00:06:16.159> would

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
powder on it so who knows if it would

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.779 
powder on it so who knows if it would
have<00:06:16.939> can<00:06:17.120> come<00:06:17.150> out<00:06:17.599> better<00:06:17.779> with<00:06:18.050> on<00:06:18.789> powder

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
have can come out better with on powder

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.550 
have can come out better with on powder
