that<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.070> much<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.790> Sean<00:01:57.270> does<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.840> it's

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that so much the way Sean does that it's

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.800 
that so much the way Sean does that it's
just<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.860> such<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> realistic<00:02:00.149> element<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
just and at such a realistic element to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.270 
just and at such a realistic element to
this<00:02:00.960> series<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.500> why<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> actually

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
this series that's why I actually

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.819 
this series that's why I actually
enjoyed<00:02:03.000> baby<00:02:03.329> steps<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.840> much<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.259> remember

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
enjoyed baby steps so much I remember

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.770 
enjoyed baby steps so much I remember
when<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> was<00:02:05.340> reviewing<00:02:05.640> season<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.329> said

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
when I was reviewing season one I said

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.600 
when I was reviewing season one I said
the<00:02:06.930> reason<00:02:07.079> why<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> love<00:02:07.619> baby<00:02:07.829> steps<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.340> much

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the reason why I love baby steps so much

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.390 
the reason why I love baby steps so much
was<00:02:09.119> because<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.660> was<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.020> realistic<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
was because it was so realistic the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
was because it was so realistic the
development<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.209> characters<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.930> weigh

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
development to the characters to weigh

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.309 
development to the characters to weigh
them

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
them

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.050 
them
matches<00:02:13.650> went<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.489> way<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.760> know

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
matches went to the way you know

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.610 
matches went to the way you know
different<00:02:15.420> characters<00:02:15.930> lost<00:02:16.200> or<00:02:16.349> how<00:02:16.469> they

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
different characters lost or how they

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.300 
different characters lost or how they
won<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:17.159> was<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.730> realistic<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.829> see<00:02:20.040> how

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
won it was so realistic and to see how

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.879 
won it was so realistic and to see how
once<00:02:20.969> again<00:02:21.359> these<00:02:21.689> realistic<00:02:22.230> elements<00:02:22.799> are

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
once again these realistic elements are

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.520 
once again these realistic elements are
playing<00:02:23.219> a<00:02:23.549> major<00:02:23.939> part<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.200> chance

chance against EK a pro player and it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.119 
chance against EK a pro player and it
was<00:03:06.569> kind<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.780> obvious<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.260> mean<00:03:07.439> I<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.680> don't

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
was kind of obvious I mean I I don't

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.949 
was kind of obvious I mean I I don't
know<00:03:08.219> how<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.430> would<00:03:08.609> have<00:03:08.760> felt<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.540> child

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
know how I would have felt if a child

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.659 
know how I would have felt if a child
was<00:03:10.019> able<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.500> face<00:03:10.739> him<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.099> win<00:03:11.370> because

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
was able to face him and win because

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.129 
was able to face him and win because
that<00:03:12.269> would<00:03:12.389> have<00:03:12.419> felt<00:03:12.659> like<00:03:12.689> you<00:03:12.900> would<00:03:12.989> have

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
that would have felt like you would have

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.089 
that would have felt like you would have
progressed<00:03:13.680> way<00:03:13.980> too<00:03:14.040> fast<00:03:14.760> because<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.540> far

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
progressed way too fast because so far

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.559 
progressed way too fast because so far
HLN's<00:03:17.099> progressions<00:03:17.699> fast<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:18.449> it's

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
HLN's progressions fast but it's

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.719 
HLN's progressions fast but it's
believable<00:03:19.049> because<00:03:19.290> he<00:03:20.040> has<00:03:20.129> trained<00:03:20.459> so

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
believable because he has trained so

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.119 
believable because he has trained so
 hard<00:03:21.419> but<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.229> don't<00:03:22.439> think<00:03:22.590> H<00:03:22.799> on<00:03:22.979> at

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
 hard but I don't think H on at

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.439 
 hard but I don't think H on at
the<00:03:23.220> moment<00:03:23.340> should<00:03:23.639> be<00:03:23.699> able<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:24.030> take<00:03:24.239> down<00:03:24.419> a

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
the moment should be able to take down a

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.839 
the moment should be able to take down a
pro<00:03:24.689> player<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:25.229> the<00:03:25.439> status<00:03:25.919> of<00:03:26.069> ek<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:26.579> I'm

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
pro player like the status of ek so I'm

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.969 
pro player like the status of ek so I'm
glad<00:03:27.180> once<00:03:27.959> again<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.470> get<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.680> see<00:03:28.829> these

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
glad once again we get to see these

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.309 
glad once again we get to see these
realistic<00:03:29.340> elements<00:03:29.909> of<00:03:30.030> how<00:03:30.180> he<00:03:30.239> can<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.629> go<00:03:31.139> up

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
realistic elements of how he can I go up

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.830 
realistic elements of how he can I go up
against<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.769> player<00:03:31.979> that's<00:03:32.430> obviously<00:03:33.180> way

his<00:05:06.790> notes<00:05:07.030> and<00:05:07.180> they<00:05:07.240> realize<00:05:07.600> he's<00:05:07.780> figuring

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
his notes and they realize he's figuring

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.870 
his notes and they realize he's figuring
out<00:05:08.260> their<00:05:08.440> tactics<00:05:08.950> but<00:05:09.400> I<00:05:09.460> think<00:05:09.730> this<00:05:09.820> is

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
out their tactics but I think this is

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.210 
out their tactics but I think this is
the<00:05:10.120> first<00:05:10.390> time<00:05:10.630> we<00:05:10.810> have<00:05:10.960> ever<00:05:11.080> seen<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:11.740> baby

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
the first time we have ever seen in baby

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.270 
the first time we have ever seen in baby
steps<00:05:12.370> where<00:05:13.030> someone<00:05:13.420> was<00:05:13.510> able<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:14.280> learn

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
steps where someone was able to learn

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.130 
steps where someone was able to learn
what<00:05:15.550> H<00:05:15.730> on<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.090> doing<00:05:16.300> like<00:05:16.390> he<00:05:16.540> knew<00:05:16.720> h<00:05:16.930> home

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
what H on is doing like he knew h home

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.750 
what H on is doing like he knew h home
was<00:05:17.260> going<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:17.650> be<00:05:17.740> learning<00:05:18.010> as<00:05:18.220> tactics<00:05:18.640> or

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
was going to be learning as tactics or

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.820 
was going to be learning as tactics or
you<00:05:18.880> know<00:05:19.000> using<00:05:19.330> his<00:05:19.870> own<00:05:20.020> tactics<00:05:20.440> against

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
you know using his own tactics against

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.120 
you know using his own tactics against
him<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.250> also<00:05:21.900> actually<00:05:22.900> learned<00:05:23.890> that<00:05:24.100> a

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
him and also actually learned that a

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.220 
him and also actually learned that a
child<00:05:24.520> was<00:05:24.580> manipulating<00:05:25.360> him<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.750> change<00:05:26.080> his

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
child was manipulating him to change his

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.690 
child was manipulating him to change his
tactics<00:05:26.590> like<00:05:26.920> this<00:05:26.980> is<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.370> first<00:05:27.400> time

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
tactics like this is the first time

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.910 
tactics like this is the first time
they've<00:05:27.880> ever<00:05:27.910> seen<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.510> wear<00:05:28.800> something<00:05:29.800> like

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.260 
they've ever seen to wear something like
this<00:05:30.070> has<00:05:30.280> happened<00:05:30.310> where<00:05:30.820> someone<00:05:31.120> was

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
this has happened where someone was

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.840 
this has happened where someone was
being<00:05:31.450> able<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:31.990> think<00:05:32.710> of<00:05:32.890> what<00:05:33.100> HL<00:05:33.490> is<00:05:33.520> going

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
being able to think of what HL is going

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.700 
being able to think of what HL is going
to<00:05:33.940> do<00:05:34.060> next<00:05:34.330> so<00:05:34.900> I'm<00:05:35.020> looking<00:05:35.170> forward<00:05:35.590> to

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
to do next so I'm looking forward to

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.590 
to do next so I'm looking forward to
seeing<00:05:35.860> how<00:05:36.490> this<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:36.760> gonna<00:05:36.850> go<00:05:36.970> because<00:05:37.300> this

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
seeing how this is gonna go because this

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.330 
seeing how this is gonna go because this
might<00:05:37.780> start<00:05:38.170> a<00:05:38.320> really<00:05:38.650> good<00:05:38.800> rivalry

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
might start a really good rivalry

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.900 
might start a really good rivalry
between<00:05:39.790> H<00:05:40.270> on<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:40.990> Alex<00:05:41.950> in<00:05:42.100> the<00:05:42.160> future<00:05:42.790> like

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
between H on and Alex in the future like

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.000 
between H on and Alex in the future like
they<00:05:43.120> might<00:05:43.300> become<00:05:43.510> major<00:05:43.990> rivals<00:05:44.680> because

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
they might become major rivals because

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.250 
they might become major rivals because
at<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.700> moment<00:05:45.730> ain't<00:05:46.450> Sean<00:05:46.690> doesn't<00:05:46.930> really

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
at the moment ain't Sean doesn't really

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.320 
at the moment ain't Sean doesn't really
have<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.890> big<00:05:48.310> rival<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:48.940> mean<00:05:49.090> let's<00:05:49.240> think

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
have a big rival I mean let's think

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.750 
have a big rival I mean let's think
about<00:05:49.540> this<00:05:49.780> I<00:05:49.930> mean<00:05:50.050> he<00:05:50.470> has<00:05:50.620> you<00:05:50.860> not<00:05:51.310> to<00:05:51.550> he

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
about this I mean he has you not to he

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.720 
about this I mean he has you not to he
has<00:05:52.270> her<00:05:52.750> as<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.020> rival<00:05:53.590> but<00:05:53.950> I<00:05:54.070> mean<00:05:54.250> mainly

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
has her as a rival but I mean mainly

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.650 
has her as a rival but I mean mainly
they're<00:05:55.120> gonna<00:05:55.240> be<00:05:55.480> boyfriend-girlfriend

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
they're gonna be boyfriend-girlfriend

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.720 
they're gonna be boyfriend-girlfriend
it's<00:05:56.410> very<00:05:56.650> obvious<00:05:57.160> are<00:05:57.250> gonna<00:05:57.400> get<00:05:57.550> together

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
it's very obvious are gonna get together

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.690 
it's very obvious are gonna get together
so<00:05:58.570> he<00:05:58.810> doesn't<00:05:59.110> really<00:05:59.230> have<00:05:59.530> a<00:05:59.680> rival<00:06:00.460> rival

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
so he doesn't really have a rival rival

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.380 
so he doesn't really have a rival rival
and<00:06:01.030> I<00:06:01.090> wonder<00:06:01.630> if<00:06:02.640> alex<00:06:03.640> is<00:06:03.790> going<00:06:03.880> to<00:06:04.120> be<00:06:04.180> his

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
and I wonder if alex is going to be his

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.910 
and I wonder if alex is going to be his
rival<00:06:04.810> because<00:06:05.110> this<00:06:05.350> is<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.590> first<00:06:05.800> time

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
rival because this is the first time

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.380 
rival because this is the first time
