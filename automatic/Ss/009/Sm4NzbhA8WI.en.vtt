basic<00:02:09.450> construction<00:02:09.990> of<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> pond<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.160> unit<00:02:11.490> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
basic construction of a pond in unit and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.690 
basic construction of a pond in unit and
all<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.570> things<00:02:13.110> around<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.550> order

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
all the things around that but in order

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.060 
all the things around that but in order
to<00:02:14.970> get<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.360> juveniles<00:02:16.170> into<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.530> pond<00:02:16.770> you

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
to get the juveniles into the pond you

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.040 
to get the juveniles into the pond you
have<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.550> nursery

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
have to have a nursery

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.760 
have to have a nursery
thus<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> hatchery<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.290> US<00:02:22.530> there's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
thus a hatchery and so in the US there's

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.770 
thus a hatchery and so in the US there's
a<00:02:22.860> hatchery<00:02:23.160> in<00:02:23.310> Texas<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:24.060> utilize

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
a hatchery in Texas that we utilize

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.770 
a hatchery in Texas that we utilize
there<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.010> there's<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.970> nursery<00:02:27.510> at<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
there and there's a nursery at the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.190 
there and there's a nursery at the
Kinley<00:02:28.080> farm<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:29.120> socking<00:02:30.120> means<00:02:30.480> production

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
Kinley farm and socking means production

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.530 
Kinley farm and socking means production
for<00:02:31.500> us<00:02:31.620> because<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.640> stock<00:02:32.940> heavy<00:02:33.300> you

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
for us because if you stock heavy you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.290 
for us because if you stock heavy you
have<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> lot<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.140> weight<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.550> smaller<00:02:36.000> animals

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
have a lot of weight the smaller animals

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.540 
have a lot of weight the smaller animals
but<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.959> stock<00:02:37.290> light<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.070> larger

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
but if you stock light you have larger

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.949 
but if you stock light you have larger
animals<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.060> we're<00:02:39.150> finding<00:02:39.510> some<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.780> our

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
markets like the larger animal because

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.260

at the end of the season in October your
water<00:03:06.450> temperature<00:03:06.600> are<00:03:06.930> declining<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.010> to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
water temperature are declining and to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.140 
water temperature are declining and to
the<00:03:08.340> same<00:03:08.550> ranges

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the same ranges

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.420 
the same ranges
these<00:03:09.810> animals<00:03:10.290> are<00:03:10.410> subtropical<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.250> cold

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
these animals are subtropical and cold

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.729 
these animals are subtropical and cold
nature<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.090> anything<00:03:12.720> below<00:03:12.930> sixty<00:03:13.560> they're

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
nature so anything below sixty they're

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.160 
nature so anything below sixty they're
in<00:03:13.860> danger<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.519> expiring<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.750> that's<00:03:15.959> the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
in danger of expiring so that's the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.650 
in danger of expiring so that's the
reason<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.620> pick<00:03:17.340> late<00:03:17.910> September<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.510> early

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
reason we pick late September and early

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.800 
reason we pick late September and early
October<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.590> these<00:03:19.739> animals<00:03:20.010> out<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
October to have these animals out of the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.880 
October to have these animals out of the
ponds<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.500> frozen<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.549> on<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.850> market<00:03:24.360> so

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
ponds and frozen in and on the market so

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.740 
ponds and frozen in and on the market so
does<00:03:25.890> harvest<00:03:26.310> time<00:03:26.519> mean<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.060> prawns<00:03:27.360> are

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
does harvest time mean the prawns are

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.690 
does harvest time mean the prawns are
just<00:03:28.019> scooped<00:03:28.470> up<00:03:28.709> kind<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.700> yes<00:03:29.940> kind<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.049> know

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
just scooped up kind of yes kind of know

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.870 
just scooped up kind of yes kind of know
so<00:03:32.700> typically<00:03:33.239> what<00:03:33.420> I'll<00:03:33.570> do<00:03:33.810> about<00:03:34.519> 24<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.670> 30

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
so typically what I'll do about 24 to 30

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.580 
so typically what I'll do about 24 to 30
hours<00:03:36.239> out<00:03:36.390> before<00:03:36.720> I'll<00:03:36.930> start<00:03:37.170> draining

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
hours out before I'll start draining

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.860 
hours out before I'll start draining
water<00:03:37.709> down<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.250> we<00:03:39.000> do<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.299> slow<00:03:39.570> enough

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
water down and we do that slow enough

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.229 
water down and we do that slow enough
that<00:03:40.110> we<00:03:40.230> don't<00:03:40.579> drain<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.700> pond<00:03:41.850> too<00:03:42.030> fast

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
that we don't drain the pond too fast

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.020 
that we don't drain the pond too fast
before<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.900> help<00:03:43.170> gets<00:03:43.440> here<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.579> animal

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
before I help gets here and the animal

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.060 
before I help gets here and the animal
is<00:03:45.150> that's<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.230> pond<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.620> basically<00:03:46.890> going

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
is that's in the pond is basically going

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.650 
is that's in the pond is basically going
to<00:03:47.160> come<00:03:47.519> with<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.760> flow<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.000> water<00:03:48.329> water

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
to come with the flow of water water

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.430 
to come with the flow of water water
comes<00:03:48.959> down<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.500> as<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:51.450> water<00:03:51.660> drops<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.260> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
comes down and as the water drops in the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.319 
comes down and as the water drops in the
flow<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:52.920> water<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.340> pushes<00:03:53.790> them<00:03:53.910> into<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
flow of water it pushes them into the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.600 
flow of water it pushes them into the
catch<00:03:55.230> basin<00:03:55.709> we<00:03:55.769> have<00:03:55.890> people<00:03:56.190> working<00:03:56.340> in

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
catch basin we have people working in

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.949 
catch basin we have people working in
here<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.970> are<00:03:57.120> going<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.360> collect<00:03:57.660> them<00:03:57.780> and
