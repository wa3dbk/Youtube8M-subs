00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.360
 good being with the theme of copying 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:10.740
 music now show how to copy divides 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:14.200
 movies with this program must be 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.620
 53 points many thousands ago but in this 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.440
 They wear pretty good program here 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.180
 we select the file that we are going to 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.220
 copy we can copy from a disk 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.970
 either open this or from an iso file 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.560
 if you have it on the computer 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.280
 to this 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.700
 and we put it once we open here what 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.300
 we can compress with custo radio and 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.570
 lower the size of the video to eat 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.840
 less space I really do not lower it 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.840
 power 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.170
 4 if I win so much if you have not got much 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.050
 space no longer works, nothing happens 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.269
 I guess you can also edit it out 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.640
 the menus changed to the yearned for and if 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.159
 has several audio several subtitles what 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.500
 I can go eliminating like this 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.750
 program is done because sometimes we go 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.820
 to have an original movie one does not 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.600
 You can copy directly to the computer with 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.119
 this program if you can copy it 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.350
 also here I could edit some other 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.830
 things but this is not going to get me 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.830
 Really 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.890
 once when you have chosen without 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.040
 compress not compress from low backup 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.800
 and here to choose how you want the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.650
 image as I go see videos I put 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.860
 made image afterwards for some program 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.930
 he recorded it with black 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.670
 much program to record or what can 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.500
 open the computer directly with 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.170
 example 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.400
 then with the name the good folder 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.780
 It is logical 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.780
 here is the region 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.520
 region end that is ntsc stick to that to 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.799
 each locality could sometimes touch 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.659
 pitchers here to put so that 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.299
 when the film is finished 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.340
 Restart shut down the computer 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.470
 better said by don juan once 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.080
 selected ones accepted such a way 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.360
 because I do not have movie copies 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.870
 here I will leave the page 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.730
 of the program from the original page or 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 simply download a program 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.120
 look on the original page of the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.940
 frames of you know do not download from 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.240
 other pelotudeces pages is very simple 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.790
 the page of the house is here is the 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.590
 manual if you do not want is in Spanish 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.010
 if they understood it well this video whose 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.310
 spirit is explaining I do not know that good 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.310
 it's all
