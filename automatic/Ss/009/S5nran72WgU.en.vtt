now they are testing all their bugs out

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180 
now they are testing all their bugs out
to<00:00:33.870> make<00:00:34.020> sure<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> game<00:00:34.649> runs<00:00:34.890> smoothly

you<00:00:43.230> notice<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:43.890> oscillates<00:00:44.550> right

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
you notice there are oscillates right

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
you notice there are oscillates right
there<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.719> front<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.050> him<00:00:46.200> two<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> them<00:00:46.710> those

oscillating now this shows us that we

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.820 
oscillating now this shows us that we
are<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.110> able<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> spawn<00:01:04.619> the

are going to be able to spawn the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.039 
are going to be able to spawn the
oscillates<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.489> creative<00:01:06.299> mode<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.900> are

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
oscillates in creative mode so they are

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.039

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
defend off creepers that's the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.670 
defend off creepers that's the
oscillates<00:02:35.970> job<00:02:36.210> creepers<00:02:36.930> are<00:02:37.170> naturally

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
oscillates job creepers are naturally

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.250 
oscillates job creepers are naturally
scared<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.220> ocelots<00:02:38.340> they<00:02:38.970> won't<00:02:39.330> come<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
scared of ocelots they won't come in the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.280 
scared of ocelots they won't come in the
radius<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.920> an<00:02:41.430> ocelot<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:42.900> you're<00:02:42.990> hanging

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
radius of an ocelot so if you're hanging

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.810 
radius of an ocelot so if you're hanging
out<00:02:43.380> with<00:02:43.440> ah<00:02:43.590> slits<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.220> good<00:02:44.520> because

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
out with ah slits it's good because

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.600 
out with ah slits it's good because
creepers<00:02:45.360> won't<00:02:45.540> come<00:02:45.660> near<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.990> but<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:46.920> you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
creepers won't come near you but if you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.720 
creepers won't come near you but if you
scare<00:02:47.940> off<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.300> Ocelot<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:49.410> creepers<00:02:50.220> will

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
scare off the Ocelot then creepers will

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.550 
scare off the Ocelot then creepers will
then<00:02:51.000> come<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.390> attack<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.410> good

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
then come and attack you so it's a good

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.990 
then come and attack you so it's a good
thing<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.830> make<00:02:52.920> them<00:02:53.100> your<00:02:53.220> cat<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.760> can't

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
thing to make them your cat so you can't

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.250 
thing to make them your cat so you can't
scare<00:02:54.239> them<00:02:54.390> away<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.630> they<00:02:54.750> hang<00:02:54.930> out<00:02:55.080> with

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
scare them away and they hang out with

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.920 
scare them away and they hang out with
you<00:02:55.410> keep<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> creepers<00:02:56.250> off<00:02:56.550> your<00:02:56.700> tail<00:02:56.930> then

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
you keep the creepers off your tail then

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.850 
you keep the creepers off your tail then
also<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:59.480> find<00:03:00.480> them<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.750> jungle<00:03:01.170> biomes<00:03:01.500> as

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
also just find them in jungle biomes as

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.560 
also just find them in jungle biomes as
you<00:03:02.010> could<00:03:02.160> tell<00:03:02.340> there<00:03:02.580> was<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.730> giant<00:03:03.060> jungle

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
you could tell there was a giant jungle

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.780 
you could tell there was a giant jungle
biome<00:03:03.959> in<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.320> background<00:03:04.739> so<00:03:05.010> they're<00:03:05.610> not

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
biome in the background so they're not

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.110 
biome in the background so they're not
really<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.239> any<00:03:06.390> other<00:03:06.600> biome<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.650> go<00:03:08.280> to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
really in any other biome you just go to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.340 
really in any other biome you just go to
their<00:03:09.270> biome<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.780> then<00:03:09.900> also<00:03:10.080> they<00:03:10.290> do

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
their biome and then also they do

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.120 
their biome and then also they do
