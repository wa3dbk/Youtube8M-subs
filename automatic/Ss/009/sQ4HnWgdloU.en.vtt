00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hey people what is he going back to the new one 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.660
 I'll do a video of myself today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.900
 a road race I mean hereby 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.030
 lamborghini now apologize people like 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.199
 I have to turn off the radio otherwise 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:26.400
 I have to say bye video already 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.320
 that this mistake i have that one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.519
 to forget 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.740
 Today, I'm sure I'll go to number one 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.280
 have been here a long time ago his team 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.160
 quickly completely pimped I got that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.899
 bug wheel of high security program 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.950
 I do not have that either way 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.879
 you have to borrow or buy in the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.980
 internet at the mobile phone costs but one 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.190
 million and yes the money that actually 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:00.559
 not worth 1 million for a car 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.870
 at gta 5 is even expensive because 30 2 realistic 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:09.210
 Realistically so the godfather why costs 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.830
 really so much but well, that's easy 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 Realistically, that's not okay 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.080
 understand but it is a shelf of the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 land service too fast 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.080
 was really paying attention here was 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.600
 as I said in number sure so 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.120
 we are the first derby very difficult 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.710
 actually this approach roads are 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.690
 not so difficult if you do not have one 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.900
 error does occur when you yourselves once 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.160
 then you have already lost everything 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.630
 says and then can later times 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.690
 when it became an emergency situation 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.680
 here the special ability of 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.690
 franklin take is pretty cool 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.420
 and yes 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.580
 I have to concentrate that way , too 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.460
 that is simply pure 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.149
 Concentration thing I can do that now 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.360
 not too extreme style though i am 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.360
 keep talking 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.250
 I also wanted to say the same thing 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.390
 one more small one soon 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.980
 So if we do so, then announcement 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.530
 that judge no, I'll stop 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.380
 Amazon bought a filter and now 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 Come to the point before here was that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.340
 shit babbles 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.379
 there was 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:43.459
 and since it is in top condition it is only in breath 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.739
 and other sounds not like that 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.420
 without stopping because we are not 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.459
 Sounds 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.200
 since I have the television stream so 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.209
 not always so if I'm honest 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.940
 of course I have noisy the know 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:01.790
 modest, I believe then that, of course, 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.959
 I think it's almost the same 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.340
 at the end it pays two minutes to 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.840
 driver 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.620
 but if i do not have the checkpoint 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.620
 would have gotten 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.680
 but it works so now I have the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.260
 power of the country is not fully exploited 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.690
 Yes, and now I'll come back for a moment 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.910
 the topfield so then stop the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.770
 audio quality probably a little 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.690
 so that would be a little bit better 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.590
 probably not when I am 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.880
 but for example, the proven man breathes 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.790
 somehow not 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:50.680
 So we could do so if if 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.680
 so if it seems so worthy 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:02.450
 What 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:04.670
 get all the people here, the 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.790
 happen in the last few seconds 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.209
 got that is loud gdv first place oh 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:15.070
 my god what was it at the end of the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:21.049
 world record is 1 minute 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:23.600
 46 I am amazed now that is 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.849
 two minutes better than me after doing 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.270
 probably killed 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:32.330
 of course not for a loop or no 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.820
 he had a bugatti and yes 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.440
 I do not hold on fully 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.310
 security but probably has 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.710
 becomes more often 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:45.560
 Look at the money opportunity 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:47.690
 got there very nice and yes that 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.570
 what about a video now a lot 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.729
 heavier but I think so , yes 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.990
 then if I video here if it 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.550
 you did not like then either 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.930
 flow and if you are more of me again 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.360
 then just want to see but there 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.800
 leave and comment on any as I do 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.270
 Of course I am also happy 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.680
 and yes, we'll see each other next 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.680
 video and then I say yes
