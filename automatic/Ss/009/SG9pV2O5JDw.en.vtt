out<00:01:22.670> there<00:01:22.850> running<00:01:23.180> maybe<00:01:24.020> set<00:01:24.320> your<00:01:24.470> watch

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
out there running maybe set your watch

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.670 
out there running maybe set your watch
timer<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.880> every<00:01:26.300> five<00:01:26.479> minutes<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:27.229> goes<00:01:27.440> off

well you're out there running and every

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.660 
well you're out there running and every
time<00:01:29.630> your<00:01:29.780> beeper<00:01:30.050> goes<00:01:30.200> off<00:01:30.550> reset<00:01:31.550> that

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
time your beeper goes off reset that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.340 
time your beeper goes off reset that
posture<00:01:32.150> just<00:01:32.300> so<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.570> get<00:01:32.720> used<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:33.050> being<00:01:33.260> in

posture just so you get used to being in
that<00:01:33.380> position<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.100> then<00:01:34.520> maybe<00:01:34.790> for<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
that position and then maybe for the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.700 
that position and then maybe for the
first<00:01:35.420> thirty<00:01:35.690> seconds<00:01:36.140> after<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:36.500> check

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
first thirty seconds after you check

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.770 
first thirty seconds after you check
your<00:01:36.830> posture<00:01:37.090> really<00:01:38.090> focus<00:01:38.450> on<00:01:38.600> your

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
your posture really focus on your

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.930
