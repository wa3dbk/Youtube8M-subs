to<00:01:21.060> spread<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.540> easily<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> may<00:01:23.460> mean<00:01:23.670> for

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to spread more easily so I may mean for

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.700 
to spread more easily so I may mean for
a<00:01:23.970> yellow<00:01:24.750> orange<00:01:25.140> color<00:01:27.049> take<00:01:28.049> lots<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> paint

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
which is to transfer the line-drawing

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.780 
which is to transfer the line-drawing
onto<00:02:09.269> our<00:02:09.360> canvas<00:02:10.159> so<00:02:11.159> we're<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.610> need

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
onto our canvas so we're going to need

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.940 
onto our canvas so we're going to need
our<00:02:11.930> lime<00:02:12.930> drawing<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.409> we<00:02:13.529> printed<00:02:13.859> out

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
our lime drawing that we printed out

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.360 
our lime drawing that we printed out
from<00:02:14.340> our<00:02:14.579> resources<00:02:15.120> folder<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.189> some

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
from our resources folder and some

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.149 
from our resources folder and some
tape<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.349> first<00:02:19.560> thing<00:02:19.709> we're<00:02:19.830> gonna<00:02:19.950> do

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
tape so the first thing we're gonna do

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.960 
tape so the first thing we're gonna do
is<00:02:20.340> tape<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.480> our<00:02:21.629> canvas<00:02:22.670> just<00:02:23.670> find

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
is tape this on to our canvas just find

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.470 
is tape this on to our canvas just find
the<00:02:24.120> corners<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.720> where<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.019> goes<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:27.209> line

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
the corners of where that goes and line

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.130 
the corners of where that goes and line
it<00:02:27.510> up<00:02:27.799> fold<00:02:28.799> it<00:02:29.040> over<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:30.299> tape<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
it up fold it over and tape it on to the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.460 
it up fold it over and tape it on to the
back<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.560> your<00:02:31.680> canvas<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.790> keep<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.269> on

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.759

just<00:03:09.329> going<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.599> put<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.900> our<00:03:10.079> horizon<00:03:10.829> line

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
just going to put in our horizon line

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.880 
just going to put in our horizon line
here<00:03:11.489> where<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> water<00:03:11.970> goes<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.739> some<00:03:13.739> of

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
these mountain Mountain sections you can

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:27.110 
these mountain Mountain sections you can
ignore<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.659> bird<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.879> island<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.940> might

might want to give yourself a little bit

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.909 
might want to give yourself a little bit
of<00:03:35.639> an<00:03:35.730> indication<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.660> where<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.410> this

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
of an indication of where this this

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.990 
of an indication of where this this
little<00:03:38.220> hill<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:40.010> down<00:03:41.010> into<00:03:41.190> here<00:03:41.579> you

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
little hill is and down into here you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.879 
little hill is and down into here you
can<00:03:42.150> also<00:03:42.299> trace<00:03:42.930> down<00:03:43.139> here<00:03:43.440> where<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.650> see

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
can also trace down here where you see

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.199 
can also trace down here where you see
the<00:03:44.010> edge<00:03:44.129> of<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.370> water<00:03:44.549> oh<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:48.030> then<00:03:48.150> we

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
the edge of the water oh and then we

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.509 
the edge of the water oh and then we
also<00:03:48.359> have<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.989> edge<00:03:49.349> of<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.650> cloud<00:03:49.919> up<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.220> up

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
also have the edge of the cloud up to up

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.900 
also have the edge of the cloud up to up
top<00:03:50.790> here<00:03:54.859> okay<00:03:55.859> so<00:03:55.889> we'll<00:03:56.129> just<00:03:56.160> flip<00:03:56.489> this<00:03:56.669> up

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
top here okay so we'll just flip this up

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.300 
top here okay so we'll just flip this up
and<00:03:57.120> we'll<00:03:57.209> make<00:03:57.419> sure<00:03:57.629> that<00:03:57.660> we<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:58.109> see<00:03:58.379> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
and we'll make sure that we can see the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.009 
and we'll make sure that we can see the
main<00:03:59.489> lines<00:03:59.819> of<00:04:00.030> what<00:04:00.150> we're<00:04:00.299> going<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.690> be

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
main lines of what we're going to be

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.610 
main lines of what we're going to be
doing<00:04:01.199> and<00:04:01.650> looks<00:04:01.919> pretty<00:04:02.010> good<00:04:06.530> let's<00:04:07.530> check

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
doing and looks pretty good let's check

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.220 
doing and looks pretty good let's check
I<00:04:08.220> think<00:04:09.209> I'll<00:04:09.329> just<00:04:09.449> put<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.870> little<00:04:10.049> bit

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
I think I'll just put this a little bit

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.699 
I think I'll just put this a little bit
in<00:04:10.349> here<00:04:10.560> too

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
in here too

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.250 
in here too
and<00:04:13.910> that's<00:04:14.910> all<00:04:15.150> we<00:04:15.299> need<00:04:15.510> for<00:04:15.690> right<00:04:15.900> now<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
and that's all we need for right now so

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.750 
and that's all we need for right now so
we're<00:04:16.500> going<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.650> take<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.039> off<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:17.579> don't

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
we're going to take this off we don't

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.979 
we're going to take this off we don't
need<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.090> anymore<00:04:18.680> then<00:04:19.680> we'll<00:04:19.889> remove<00:04:20.099> the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
need that anymore then we'll remove the

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.280 
need that anymore then we'll remove the
line<00:04:21.989> drawing

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
line drawing
