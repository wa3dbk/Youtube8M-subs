00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello and today in this video I bring you one 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.230
 very nice fantasy manicure and very 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.139
 easy we will need transparent enamel 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.080
 to protect our nails from him 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.259
 yellow spots come out and at the end to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.659
 finish our design the enamel 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.569
 white color black color 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:28.169
 silver or gold according this 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:30.779
 we can choose and this is also the 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.190
 base color that we can catch the most 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.260
 we like I have picked a pearly rosita 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.130
 and a toothpick to help us do the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.650
 design 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.560
 we will also need a bit of 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.020
 nail polish remover and cotton 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.360
 any remaining unwanted enamel from 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.850
 our nails as well let's start 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.890
 to start we will clean our 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.080
 nail of any remaining enamel that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.200
 have we will give a layer of enamel 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.930
 transparent and when dry we will give 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.750
 one or two layers of the base color that in 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.850
 this case is the pearly rosita and 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 let dry well 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.780
 with the enamel of the black color we are going to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.509
 make a kind of uve that ends up 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.970
 join the two lines more or less in 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.119
 the center of the nail is worth the same as 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.720
 be higher or lower but be 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.960
 more or less in the middle of the nail 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.399
 try to do it first below well 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 in case we have very very well done very 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.860
 centered you can always go up a little bit 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 more the good line now we fill in the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.520
 bottom part all in black 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.700
 well and let dry well if you see that 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.040
 we get well centered the ub then nothing 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.470
 you do it completely to one side 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.869
 that it is clear that it is on one side and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.240
 it is already filled and it is the same from below 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.000
 all in black 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.490
 now with the help of the toothpick we will take 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.489
 a little bit of the white enamel and we're going to 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.580
 make small dots delimiting the ub 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.530
 up and at the bottom peak you see 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.230
 making a line down 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.520
 trying to make it a straight line of 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.400
 dots 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.130
 now we will do a little bit well chubby 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.190
 with the silver-colored enamel just 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.920
 at the peak of the ub you can take now 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.980
 I have told you a golden color enamel or 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.190
 some glitter what you like or even 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.650
 a sticker or a pebble in the manner of 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.260
 detail you see it looks like it's a 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.740
 neckline and that has the middle zipper 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.950
 open is very nice finally 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.290
 we will review the failures and apply a 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.320
 or two layers of transparent enamel and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.580
 that would be our chic manicure 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.580
 fantasy I hope you liked it 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.580
 goodbye
