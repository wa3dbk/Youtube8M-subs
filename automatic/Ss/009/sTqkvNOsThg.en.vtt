 words fall short just as before 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.069
 What I do wonder is it's the point 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.349
 with these paintings it is that they 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.360
 made under the influence or that it 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.970
 people are someone under the influence of you 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.489

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.319

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.760

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.160
 they keep the tops off their hands 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.870

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.140

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.489

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.139
