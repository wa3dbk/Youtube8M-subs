act as a DSC if it's in storage mode

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.839 
act as a DSC if it's in storage mode
while<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.189> plug<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> into<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> computer

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
while it's you plug it into the computer

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.690 
while it's you plug it into the computer
it<00:00:30.510> locked<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.840> storage<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.859> can't<00:00:32.130> change<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
it locked a storage you can't change it

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
it locked a storage you can't change it
while<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.780> x3<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.320> plugged<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.770> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
while the the the x3 is plugged in so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.959 
while the the the x3 is plugged in so
you<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.130> unplug<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.579> every<00:00:35.730> single<00:00:35.850> time

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
you have to unplug it every single time

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.080 
you have to unplug it every single time
so<00:00:36.840> turning<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> store<00:00:37.590> DAC<00:00:38.129> mode<00:00:38.520> I'm

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
so turning it to store DAC mode I'm

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.750 
so turning it to store DAC mode I'm
gonna<00:00:39.540> plug<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.379> end<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.710> my<00:00:40.829> USB<00:00:41.340> cable<00:00:41.670> right

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
gonna plug one end of my USB cable right

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
gonna plug one end of my USB cable right
here<00:00:41.840> into<00:00:42.840> my<00:00:43.050> Macintosh<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.660> gonna

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
here into my Macintosh and I'm gonna

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.250 
here into my Macintosh and I'm gonna
plug<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> other<00:00:46.320> cable<00:00:46.860> into<00:00:47.579> my<00:00:47.850> file<00:00:48.780> x3

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
plug the other cable into my file x3

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.700 
plug the other cable into my file x3
it's<00:00:49.469> gonna<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:49.860> hard<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.399> got<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.710> so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it's gonna be really hard but got it so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.729 
it's gonna be really hard but got it so
now<00:00:53.570> it's<00:00:54.570> plugged<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
now it's plugged in you can see that the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.630 
now it's plugged in you can see that the
x3<00:00:56.640> screen<00:00:57.120> changes<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.809> DAC<00:00:58.260> mode<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
x3 screen changes into DAC mode so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
x3 screen changes into DAC mode so
there's<00:00:59.820> nothing<00:01:00.090> else<00:01:00.180> plugged<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
there's nothing else plugged in and a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.939 
there's nothing else plugged in and a
new<00:01:01.379> TAC<00:01:01.890> setting<00:01:02.460> mode<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:04.320> computer<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
new TAC setting mode on my computer I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
new TAC setting mode on my computer I
could<00:01:05.010> um<00:01:05.369> Mac<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.150> could<00:01:06.299> open<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.600> audio<00:01:07.049> MIDI

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
could um Mac I could open up audio MIDI

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.390 
could um Mac I could open up audio MIDI
setup<00:01:09.380> as<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:11.700> way<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:13.340> make<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:15.000> get

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
setup as a way to make it so that I get

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.770 
setup as a way to make it so that I get
hundred<00:01:17.400> ninety-two<00:01:17.700> kilohertz<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
hundred ninety-two kilohertz and the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.780 
hundred ninety-two kilohertz and the
moment<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> changed<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.189> x3<00:01:20.400> also

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
moment I changed that the x3 also

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.410 
moment I changed that the x3 also
changes

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
changes

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480

Fisher<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.450> get<00:01:58.540> here<00:01:58.750> now

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.020 

up<00:02:12.780> volume<00:02:14.150> down<00:02:15.150> volume<00:02:16.190> how<00:02:17.190> exciting<00:02:17.909> is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
up volume down volume how exciting is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.399 
up volume down volume how exciting is
this<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.659> screen<00:02:18.900> itself<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
this so in the screen itself we have the

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.770 
this so in the screen itself we have the
volume<00:02:22.409> bass<00:02:23.099> boost<00:02:23.459> I'm<00:02:23.819> gonna<00:02:23.940> holy<00:02:24.450> crow

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
volume bass boost I'm gonna holy crow

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.960 
volume bass boost I'm gonna holy crow
that's<00:02:24.989> big<00:02:25.170> bass<00:02:25.379> boost<00:02:25.680> getting<00:02:26.549> settings

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
that's big bass boost getting settings

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.170
