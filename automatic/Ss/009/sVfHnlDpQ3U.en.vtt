okay<00:00:01.800> in<00:00:01.920> lesson<00:00:02.250> three<00:00:02.490> we<00:00:02.520> will<00:00:02.850> be

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay in lesson three we will be

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.440 
okay in lesson three we will be
discussing<00:00:03.529> intervals<00:00:04.549> intervals<00:00:05.549> all<00:00:06.270> that

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
discussing intervals intervals all that

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.210 
discussing intervals intervals all that
means<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.930> distance<00:00:07.379> between<00:00:07.649> two<00:00:08.099> notes

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
means is the distance between two notes

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.759 
means is the distance between two notes
and<00:00:08.790> I'll<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.510> using<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.110> occasionally<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and I'll be using that occasionally the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.980 
and I'll be using that occasionally the
lessons<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.849> help<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.269> learn<00:00:12.420> some<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
lessons to help you learn some of the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.550 
lessons to help you learn some of the
exercises<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:13.920> let's<00:00:14.820> say<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.560> middle

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
exercises but let's say we have a middle

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.189 
exercises but let's say we have a middle
C<00:00:16.740> here<00:00:17.100> okay<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.390> I'm<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.660> find<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> C<00:00:19.050> in

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
C here okay so I'm going to find a C in

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
C here okay so I'm going to find a C in
the<00:00:19.260> middle<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.619> piano<00:00:20.119> if<00:00:21.119> you're

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the middle of the piano if you're

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.429 
the middle of the piano if you're
playing<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> keyboard

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
playing on a keyboard

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
playing on a keyboard
the<00:00:22.710> C<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> probably<00:00:23.550> going<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:24.060> more<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the C is probably going to be more to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.820 
the C is probably going to be more to
the<00:00:24.689> left<00:00:24.869> instead<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.560> middle<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the left instead of in the middle of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.349 
the left instead of in the middle of
your<00:00:25.949> keyboard<00:00:26.220> unless<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.330> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
your keyboard unless you have a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.490 
your keyboard unless you have a
full-size<00:00:27.660> keyboard

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
full-size keyboard

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
full-size keyboard
anyway<00:00:29.070> find<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.490> seat<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.779> then<00:00:31.590> let's<00:00:32.040> go<00:00:32.219> up

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
anyway find a seat and then let's go up

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.299 
anyway find a seat and then let's go up
remember<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> board<00:00:34.320> means<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
remember up on the board means to the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.110 
remember up on the board means to the
right<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.420> keyboard<00:00:36.870> piano<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.250> seeing<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
right on the keyboard piano so seeing a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.940 
right on the keyboard piano so seeing a
D<00:00:39.270> together<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.230> note<00:00:40.379> C<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
D together so this is the note C and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.069 
D together so this is the note C and
then<00:00:41.489> D<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:41.969> next<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.450> playing

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
then D is right next to it playing

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.340 
then D is right next to it playing
together<00:00:44.120> let's<00:00:45.120> call<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.510> second<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
together let's call it a second the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
together let's call it a second the
distance<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.280> C<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> D<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.390> called

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
distance from this C to the D is called

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.420 
distance from this C to the D is called
a<00:00:48.780> second<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.469> say<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> we'll<00:00:50.010> go<00:00:50.129> up<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
a second so if I say and we'll go up a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.700 
a second so if I say and we'll go up a
second<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.809> whatever<00:00:51.899> you'll<00:00:52.350> know<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.620> just

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
second or whatever you'll know it just

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130 
second or whatever you'll know it just
means<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> very<00:00:53.879> next<00:00:54.180> letter<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:55.020> gonna

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
means to the very next letter I'm gonna

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.630 
means to the very next letter I'm gonna
see<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> Dean<00:00:56.149> alright<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.360> we're<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:58.640> you

see to a Dean alright now we're on you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.970 
see to a Dean alright now we're on you
know<00:00:59.730> still<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> C<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.570> say<00:01:00.840> go<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.680> third

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
know still a C and I say go to the third

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.710 
know still a C and I say go to the third
then<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.120> go<00:01:03.300> from<00:01:03.510> C<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.840> Annie<00:01:05.210> okay<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.570> it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
then you go from C to Annie okay so it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.330 
then you go from C to Annie okay so it
includes<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.260> notes<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.830> can't<00:01:08.130> see

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
includes all the notes if I can't see

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.080 
includes all the notes if I can't see
and<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.970> two<00:01:09.080> three<00:01:10.670> see<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> e<00:01:11.820> as<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and I go one two three see the e as a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.170 
and I go one two three see the e as a
third<00:01:12.420> there's<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.320> third<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.610> thirds<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
third there's a third the thirds have a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.440 
third there's a third the thirds have a
nice<00:01:16.140> sound<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.070> them<00:01:17.220> seconds<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:17.820> dissonant

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
nice sound to them seconds or dissonant

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.760 
nice sound to them seconds or dissonant
this<00:01:19.320> sound<00:01:19.530> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> unrest<00:01:21.200> okay<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this sound kind of unrest okay and it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.960 
this sound kind of unrest okay and it
doesn't<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> seat<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
doesn't have to just be from the seat I

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.600 
doesn't have to just be from the seat I
could<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.390> from<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.689> G<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:25.920> long<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.400> it's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
could go from a G to and as long as it's

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.890 
could go from a G to and as long as it's
the<00:01:26.759> very<00:01:27.000> next<00:01:27.299> letter<00:01:28.610> then<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.420> second

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the very next letter then it's a second

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.170 
the very next letter then it's a second
so<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> D<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> second<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.729> two<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.150> a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
so see the D is a second see two he is a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.340 
so see the D is a second see two he is a
third<00:01:33.619> now<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> next<00:01:34.979> one's<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> fourth<00:01:35.460> C<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> F

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
third now the next one's a fourth C to F

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
third now the next one's a fourth C to F
now<00:01:37.350> fourth<00:01:37.650> kind<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.950> has<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:38.250> open<00:01:38.610> sound<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
now fourth kind of has an open sound to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.390 
now fourth kind of has an open sound to
it<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
it and

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.880 
it and
fifth<00:01:40.580> well<00:01:40.790> as<00:01:40.910> well<00:01:41.120> but<00:01:41.690> CF<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.320> fourth<00:01:42.620> if

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
fifth well as well but CF is a fourth if

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.780 
fifth well as well but CF is a fourth if
you<00:01:43.040> count<00:01:43.250> all<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.460> notes

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
you count all the notes

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.480 
you count all the notes
one<00:01:44.000> two<00:01:44.270> three<00:01:44.600> four<00:01:44.780> CDF<00:01:45.620> that<00:01:46.100> makes<00:01:46.340> a

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
one two three four CDF that makes a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.120 
one two three four CDF that makes a
force<00:01:46.790> I<00:01:47.000> say<00:01:47.180> up<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.510> fourth<00:01:47.840> from<00:01:48.140> se<00:01:48.470> then

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
force I say up a fourth from se then

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.790 
force I say up a fourth from se then
you'll<00:01:49.250> know<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.460> go<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:49.820> far<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:51.560> want<00:01:51.710> to

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
you'll know to go this far you want to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.380 
you'll know to go this far you want to
get<00:01:51.890> used<00:01:52.040> to<00:01:52.160> that<00:01:52.370> feel<00:01:52.730> in<00:01:52.970> your<00:01:53.090> hand

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
get used to that feel in your hand

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.990 
get used to that feel in your hand
before<00:01:54.100> alright<00:01:55.100> next<00:01:55.340> we<00:01:55.520> have<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.640> fifth

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
before alright next we have a fifth

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.600 
before alright next we have a fifth
let's<00:01:56.540> see<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.930> Jesus<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.830> also<00:01:57.980> has<00:01:58.310> kind<00:01:58.400> of

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
let's see to Jesus it also has kind of

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.860 
let's see to Jesus it also has kind of
an<00:01:58.730> open<00:01:59.060> sound<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.800> so<00:02:00.800> C<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.130> G<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> fifth

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
an open sound to it so C to G is a fifth

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.320 
an open sound to it so C to G is a fifth
now<00:02:02.870> I'm<00:02:03.020> going<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.230> go<00:02:03.350> from<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.680> C<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.190> an<00:02:05.150> A

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
now I'm going to go from the C to an A

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.219 
now I'm going to go from the C to an A
that'll<00:02:05.720> be<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> sixth<00:02:07.000> sixth<00:02:08.000> or<00:02:08.210> on<00:02:08.540> there

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
that'll be a sixth sixth or on there

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.920 
that'll be a sixth sixth or on there
they<00:02:09.530> say<00:02:09.740> I'm<00:02:09.800> counting<00:02:10.220> five<00:02:10.930> consonant

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
they say I'm counting five consonant

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.840 
they say I'm counting five consonant
they<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> nice<00:02:12.650> sound<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.400> them<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:13.730> like

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
they have a nice sound to them just like

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.660 
they have a nice sound to them just like
the<00:02:14.090> third<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.990> see<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> six<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.490> want

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
the third so see the a is a six you want

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.920 
the third so see the a is a six you want
to<00:02:16.730> get<00:02:16.820> used<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.270> feeling<00:02:17.570> you're

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.830 
to get used to that feeling you're
rockin<00:02:18.350> C<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.980> one<00:02:19.100> eight<00:02:19.220> six<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.060> then<00:02:20.720> we

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
rockin C to one eight six and then we

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.500 
rockin C to one eight six and then we
want<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.080> do<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.640> 7/7<00:02:22.640> are<00:02:22.760> really<00:02:23.030> dissonant

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
want to do a 7/7 are really dissonant

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.140 
want to do a 7/7 are really dissonant
listen<00:02:23.900> look<00:02:24.020> at<00:02:24.140> C<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.770> B<00:02:24.980> seven<00:02:25.850> months<00:02:26.060> away

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
listen look at C to B seven months away

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.270 
listen look at C to B seven months away
one<00:02:26.510> two<00:02:26.750> three<00:02:27.020> four<00:02:27.260> five<00:02:27.500> six<00:02:27.740> seven<00:02:27.980> we

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
one two three four five six seven we

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.020 
one two three four five six seven we
count<00:02:28.520> them<00:02:28.640> all<00:02:29.200> here<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.320> dissonance

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
count them all here the dissonance

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.310 
count them all here the dissonance
really<00:02:32.030> doesn't<00:02:32.300> go<00:02:32.390> together<00:02:32.540> at<00:02:32.870> all<00:02:32.990> and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
really doesn't go together at all and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.590 
really doesn't go together at all and
sevens<00:02:33.709> can<00:02:33.890> be<00:02:34.070> actually<00:02:34.790> quite<00:02:35.090> beautiful

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
sevens can be actually quite beautiful

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.690 
sevens can be actually quite beautiful
if<00:02:35.720> they're<00:02:35.900> used<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.230> right<00:02:36.440> context<00:02:37.160> so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
if they're used in the right context so

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.510 
if they're used in the right context so
C<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.060> be<00:02:38.240> third<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:38.870> seventh<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.740> then<00:02:40.310> if<00:02:40.430> we

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
C to be third and seventh and then if we

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.490 
C to be third and seventh and then if we
go<00:02:40.640> one<00:02:40.850> more<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:41.270> go<00:02:41.390> from<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.690> seat<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> C

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
go one more we go from a seat to a C

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800 
go one more we go from a seat to a C
which<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.860> an<00:02:42.980> octave<00:02:43.400> which<00:02:44.120> octave<00:02:44.600> just

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
which is an octave which octave just

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.620 
which is an octave which octave just
means<00:02:44.989> an<00:02:45.140> eighth<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:46.550> see<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> season<00:02:47.269> octave

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
means an eighth so see the season octave

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.690 
means an eighth so see the season octave
and<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.560> really<00:02:48.830> won't<00:02:48.980> go<00:02:49.160> any<00:02:49.310> farther<00:02:49.580> than

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
and you really won't go any farther than

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.400 
and you really won't go any farther than
that<00:02:49.790> I'm<00:02:50.060> probably<00:02:50.330> will<00:02:50.540> use<00:02:50.720> any<00:02:50.900> nines<00:02:51.110> or

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
that I'm probably will use any nines or

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.500 
that I'm probably will use any nines or
tens<00:02:51.470> because<00:02:51.890> usually<00:02:52.220> piano<00:02:53.030> music<00:02:53.330> won't

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
tens because usually piano music won't

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
tens because usually piano music won't
go<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:53.810> far

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
go that far

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.190 
go that far
most<00:02:54.860> people's<00:02:55.190> hands<00:02:55.459> are<00:02:55.700> are<00:02:56.209> just

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
most people's hands are are just

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.380 
most people's hands are are just
stretching<00:02:58.010> already<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.580> limit<00:02:58.850> at<00:02:58.940> an<00:02:59.030> octave

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
stretching already to limit at an octave

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.259 
stretching already to limit at an octave
so<00:02:59.540> see<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.870> season<00:03:00.320> octave<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.970> point

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
so see you a season octave and the point

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.270 
so see you a season octave and the point
of<00:03:02.330> this<00:03:02.480> lesson<00:03:02.660> is<00:03:02.900> get<00:03:03.110> used<00:03:03.380> used<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.160> the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
of this lesson is get used used to the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.490 
of this lesson is get used used to the
feel<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.510> different<00:03:06.080> intervals<00:03:06.380> so

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
feel of the different intervals so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.830 
feel of the different intervals so
seconds<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.790> want<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.060> give<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.600> feel

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
seconds you want to give you that feel

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.990 
seconds you want to give you that feel
to<00:03:09.350> in<00:03:09.500> two<00:03:09.709> consecutive<00:03:10.330> pikeys<00:03:11.330> thirds<00:03:13.000> you

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
to in two consecutive pikeys thirds you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.790 
to in two consecutive pikeys thirds you
know<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.510> just<00:03:14.630> play<00:03:14.810> some<00:03:15.019> third<00:03:15.320> used

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
know you can just play some third used

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.550 
know you can just play some third used
to<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.070> fourths<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.000> same<00:03:17.239> thing<00:03:17.860> Vince

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
to that fourths the same thing Vince

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.180 
to that fourths the same thing Vince
the<00:03:20.220> sixth<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.209> Charlie<00:03:21.720> separates<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.950> then

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the sixth and Charlie separates and then

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.100 
the sixth and Charlie separates and then
octaves<00:03:23.670> all<00:03:24.030> right<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:24.959> we<00:03:25.080> can

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
octaves all right and then we can

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.400 
octaves all right and then we can
proceed<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.590> lesson<00:03:26.190> 4
