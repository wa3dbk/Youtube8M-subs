00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.869
 for the little video of the opening of the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.630
 as was the case a little bit 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.039
 everywhere in France for the opening we have 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.480
 had a lot a lot a lot of water 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 that is, it rained during 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.769
 three days that's during the Friday the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.210
 Saturday on Sunday in short it's a 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.309
 little disaster and deluge 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.470
 but with manu we went fishing 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.629
 took our chaos and then we took out 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.370
 fish had fun so it's not 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.900
 very big fish but here are the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 conditions were really not obvious 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.470
 and then actually from the second day there 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 rivers were in flood 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.160
 so we could actually fish 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.090
 weather sensitive
