on<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> wrong<00:02:59.040> sequence<00:02:59.550> for<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.540> p.m.<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.350> what

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
on the wrong sequence for a p.m. so what

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.590 
on the wrong sequence for a p.m. so what
we<00:03:02.489> need<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.299> edit<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.739> change<00:03:05.190> those

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
we need to do is edit and change those

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.380 
we need to do is edit and change those
channels<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.930> manage<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.440> EPM<00:03:08.010> channels<00:03:08.549> so

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
channels to manage the EPM channels so

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.270 
channels to manage the EPM channels so
this<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.810> important<00:03:10.320> step<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.709> do<00:03:10.830> before

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
this is the important step to do before

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.170 
this is the important step to do before
you<00:03:11.459> do<00:03:11.640> any<00:03:11.790> video<00:03:12.180> calibration<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:14.180> for

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
you do any video calibration and for

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.720 
you do any video calibration and for
this<00:03:15.299> case<00:03:15.890> channel<00:03:16.890> one<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.459> LeBron

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
this case channel one is a LeBron

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.310 
this case channel one is a LeBron
channel<00:03:18.480> two<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.690> alvaro

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
channel two is alvaro

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.820 
channel two is alvaro
Channel<00:03:20.160> three<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:21.080> throttle<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.230> Channel

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
Channel three is throttle and Channel

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:40.970 
Channel three is throttle and Channel
four<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.280> rather

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.860 

so<00:03:41.980> again<00:03:42.340> if<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:42.880> hold<00:03:43.060> down<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.240> Enter<00:03:43.840> key

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
so again if you hold down the Enter key

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.380 
so again if you hold down the Enter key
for<00:03:44.410> one<00:03:44.770> second<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.760> get<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.090> list<00:03:46.300> of

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
for one second to get the list of

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.949 
for one second to get the list of
options<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.170> select<00:03:47.800> edit

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.740 

lastly<00:03:55.959> channel<00:03:56.560> 4<00:03:56.860> will<00:03:57.220> be<00:03:57.489> rather<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.390> it

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
lastly channel 4 will be rather and it

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.009 
lastly channel 4 will be rather and it
stays<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.170> same<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:03.640> now<00:04:03.790> set<00:04:04.120> up<00:04:04.150> channel<00:04:04.660> 5

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
stays the same we now set up channel 5

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.180 
stays the same we now set up channel 5
for<00:04:05.680> flight<00:04:05.950> mode<00:04:06.160> as<00:04:06.370> defined<00:04:07.150> by<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.420> APM<00:04:08.190> we

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
for flight mode as defined by the APM we

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.550 
for flight mode as defined by the APM we
had<00:04:09.400> earlier<00:04:10.060> decided<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.110> switch<00:04:11.530> that

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
had earlier decided that the switch that

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.920 
had earlier decided that the switch that
we<00:04:11.890> would<00:04:12.010> like<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.130> use<00:04:12.519> personally<00:04:13.300> is<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
we would like to use personally is the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.039 
we would like to use personally is the
SG<00:04:14.769> switch<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:15.910> for<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.390> example<00:04:16.720> we're

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
SG switch so for this example we're

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.400 
SG switch so for this example we're
going<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.260> switch<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.680> SG<00:04:19.140> for<00:04:20.140> flight

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
going to switch it to SG for flight

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.790 
going to switch it to SG for flight
modes<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:22.270> channel<00:04:22.570> 5<00:04:22.720> switch<00:04:23.110> basically

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
modes the channel 5 switch basically

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.320 
modes the channel 5 switch basically
allows<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.280> change<00:04:24.580> your<00:04:24.820> flight<00:04:24.970> modes

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
allows you to change your flight modes

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.469 
allows you to change your flight modes
for<00:04:25.870> example<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.440> like<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.979> fly<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.669> little

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
for example you like to fly a little

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.240 
for example you like to fly a little
after<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.500> hold<00:04:30.360> also<00:04:31.360> call<00:04:31.570> around<00:04:31.900> or<00:04:32.800> return

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
after to hold also call around or return

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.370 
after to hold also call around or return
to<00:04:33.400> launch<00:04:33.580> again<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.810> could<00:04:34.990> set<00:04:35.200> that<00:04:35.320> up

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
to launch again you could set that up

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.380 
to launch again you could set that up
using<00:04:35.800> channel<00:04:36.640> 5<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.830> finally<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.729> flip<00:04:40.240> out

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
using channel 5 and finally the flip out

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.620 
using channel 5 and finally the flip out
switch<00:04:40.720> which<00:04:41.080> is<00:04:41.110> channel<00:04:41.830> 7<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:43.300> will<00:04:43.510> be

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
switch which is channel 7 this will be

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.630 
switch which is channel 7 this will be
the<00:04:43.750> switch<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.229> use<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.979> return<00:04:45.460> to

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
the switch that you use to return to

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.270 
the switch that you use to return to
launch<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:46.720> can<00:04:46.750> actually<00:04:47.289> use<00:04:47.530> channel<00:04:47.890> 7

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
launch you can actually use channel 7

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.350 
launch you can actually use channel 7
for<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> few<00:04:48.820> other<00:04:48.940> options<00:04:49.870> but<00:04:50.470> we<00:04:50.800> like<00:04:51.039> a

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
for a few other options but we like a

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.420 
for a few other options but we like a
switch<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.690> we<00:04:52.840> could<00:04:53.050> designate<00:04:53.289> to<00:04:54.220> take

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
switch that we could designate to take

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.420 
switch that we could designate to take
your<00:04:54.880> aircraft<00:04:55.330> back<00:04:55.620> when<00:04:56.620> you're<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:57.280> a

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
your aircraft back when you're in a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.909 
your aircraft back when you're in a
panic<00:04:57.580> or<00:04:58.419> if<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.289> have<00:04:59.830> lost<00:05:00.669> orientation<00:05:01.570> I

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
panic or if you have lost orientation I

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.070 
panic or if you have lost orientation I
just<00:05:02.919> want<00:05:03.070> to<00:05:03.160> come<00:05:03.310> back<00:05:03.340> by<00:05:04.210> autopilot<00:05:04.720> you

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
just want to come back by autopilot you

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.000 
just want to come back by autopilot you
want<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.620> flip<00:05:05.770> one<00:05:05.979> switch<00:05:06.310> in<00:05:07.770> takes<00:05:08.770> you

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
want to flip one switch in takes you

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:17.310 
want to flip one switch in takes you
back<00:05:14.280> just<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.430> recap<00:05:15.729> we<00:05:16.000> set<00:05:16.419> up<00:05:16.450> channel<00:05:16.990> 1<00:05:17.140> 2

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
back just to recap we set up channel 1 2

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.540 
back just to recap we set up channel 1 2
3<00:05:17.530> 4<00:05:17.890> channel<00:05:18.490> 5<00:05:18.669> channel<00:05:19.030> 7<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.830> with<00:05:21.039> that<00:05:21.250> we

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
3 4 channel 5 channel 7 and with that we

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.890 
3 4 channel 5 channel 7 and with that we
have<00:05:21.669> completed<00:05:22.090> our<00:05:22.300> basic<00:05:22.870> channel<00:05:24.840> now<00:05:25.840> we

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
have completed our basic channel now we

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.730 
have completed our basic channel now we
can<00:05:26.110> begin<00:05:26.260> to<00:05:26.650> calibrate<00:05:27.070> your<00:05:27.310> radio<00:05:27.820> sticks

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
can begin to calibrate your radio sticks

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.440 
can begin to calibrate your radio sticks
first<00:05:29.740> you<00:05:29.890> need<00:05:30.039> to<00:05:30.160> make<00:05:30.460> sure<00:05:30.490> your<00:05:30.910> APM<00:05:31.360> is

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
first you need to make sure your APM is

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.170 
first you need to make sure your APM is
connected<00:05:31.960> to<00:05:32.140> your<00:05:32.320> mission<00:05:32.800> planner<00:05:33.190> and

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
connected to your mission planner and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.740 
connected to your mission planner and
you<00:05:34.210> turn<00:05:34.990> on<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.260> transmitter

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
you turn on a transmitter

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.650 
you turn on a transmitter
you<00:05:37.590> will<00:05:37.800> begin<00:05:38.040> to<00:05:38.190> move<00:05:38.490> all<00:05:38.820> your<00:05:39.300> sticks

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
you will begin to move all your sticks

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.490 
you will begin to move all your sticks
to<00:05:40.020> your<00:05:40.140> extreme<00:05:40.530> position<00:05:41.070> for<00:05:41.490> example

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
to your extreme position for example

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.370 
to your extreme position for example
move<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.860> awful<00:05:44.280> condenser<00:05:44.850> of<00:05:44.880> the

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
move it to the awful condenser of the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:54.110 
move it to the awful condenser of the
Trotter<00:05:46.380> stick<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:46.980> your<00:05:47.220> stick<00:05:52.670> then<00:05:53.670> move

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
Trotter stick and your stick then move

run<00:06:33.910> some<00:06:34.060> tests<00:06:34.360> on<00:06:34.510> the<00:06:34.810> flight<00:06:35.020> features<00:06:35.560> so

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
run some tests on the flight features so

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.420 
run some tests on the flight features so
this<00:06:37.420> will<00:06:37.720> determine<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:38.620> five<00:06:38.950> months<00:06:39.220> for

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
this will determine the five months for

you<00:06:48.520> can<00:06:48.700> pretty<00:06:48.880> much<00:06:48.970> assign<00:06:49.450> any<00:06:49.720> flight

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
you can pretty much assign any flight

mode to other positions but with some
limitation<00:06:55.060> of<00:06:55.210> course<00:06:55.510> it<00:06:56.110> is<00:06:56.260> recommended

limitation of course it is recommended

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.420 
limitation of course it is recommended
that<00:06:56.920> you<00:06:57.090> assign<00:06:58.090> position<00:06:58.600> one<00:06:59.430> we've

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
that you assign position one we've

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.950 
that you assign position one we've
stabilized<00:07:01.120> mode<00:07:03.210> other<00:07:04.210> than<00:07:04.450> that<00:07:04.600> the<00:07:04.810> rest

you<00:07:05.260> could<00:07:05.440> for<00:07:06.160> example<00:07:06.190> we<00:07:06.790> would<00:07:07.000> assign

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
you could for example we would assign

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.380 
you could for example we would assign
loiter<00:07:07.660> to<00:07:08.080> the<00:07:08.230> second<00:07:08.740> position<00:07:09.220> and<00:07:09.400> then

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390 
loiter to the second position and then

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.760 
loiter to the second position and then
land<00:07:10.840> under<00:07:11.680> that<00:07:11.830> position

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
land under that position
