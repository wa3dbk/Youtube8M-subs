00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.560
 the growth 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.250
 the Minuvian publisher hello today explain the 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.660
 How do you do this beautiful cache? 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.930
 remembering that the waste materials the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.690
 templates is on his site on tv 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.160
 to make this cachepô we go 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:33.140
 need three molds the back mold 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:38.030
 the domain audion the front mold 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:43.879
 each in the imol of 2 to facilitate and the flap 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:48.620
 which will overcome the mold 3 with the mold and 1 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:52.339
 we'll cut once in the blanket one 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.280
 once lining fabric and once in the 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:58.850
 main fabric printed with the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.629
 mold 2 the same thing is once in the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.309
 blanket once in the third and lining 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.110
 printed fabric 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.570
 hence we will overlap blanket mold 1 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.810
 with right side up 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.270
 the mold 2 with right side down 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.800
 or right with right and blanket 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.080
 again and let's sew we'll start 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.390
 here with a kicker 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.910
 Let's sew all over and 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:36.470
 ends with a rewind again and 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:37.820
 Let's turn and let's get settled 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.810
 reserved 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.250
 Let's pass the flap on the flap we'll cut 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.580
 once in the blanket and twice in the fabric 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.180
 for whom the application is to be made 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.700
 it's the moment of the application you already know 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.920
 What is the risk of mold in the third term? 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.370
 leaving a margin 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.740
 we will apply the back of the fabric with 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.929
 iron help 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.840
 once applied us we will cut 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.850
 at risk we take the film earth 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.900
 stick 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.020
 the protective film and apply ok 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.940
 then we'll sew starting here 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.940
 with a back seam all the way around and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.920
 ends with a setback as we are 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.500
 working with curves 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.930
 We need the picotes for the better. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:43.780
 finish I usually use the scissors 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:47.410
 to prick so we 'll say ah and 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.930
 once untapped we center here 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:58.720
 on the front of the basket ok and let's go 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:04.060
 to put on a 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:09.280
 Passing handle cuts a strip with 10 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:13.050
 centimeters by 24 and we're going to 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.440
 we messed up 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.510
 we fold again we pass and fold 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.510
 again and let's sew 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.299
 the lady well together 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:51.620
 when you finish fold in half 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:55.610
 cut in half again and then 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.540
 we will have two panties and put pin 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:04.489
 Here O ago that you can use 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.640
 a cinnamon sticks to support for those who 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.750
 like to do it this way 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:15.410
 ok let's go for the lining with lining 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:20.049
 We'll get sew right with the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.260
 right remembering to leave an opening 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.260
 in the end 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:40.690
 this opening can be between 10 and 12 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:46.570
 centimeters more or less backspace 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.570
 Pull a little and continue to consider 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.870
 trade and ends with a setback 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.720
 here once sewn into the lining 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:07.180
 he will become in this way a pain again 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:11.500
 packages to introduce the liner 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:21.370
 work and we will use this 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:23.980
 opening to tell the opening 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:30.419
 You can close your hand with stitches. 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.419
 invisible or machine we straightening 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.340
 anyone who wishes can give a pass to 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:43.000
 anyone who wants to do it can 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.580
 stitch stitch embroidery wedge here on 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.889
 and also in this part 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.919
 I did not put a handle here because you 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.110
 have another option to hang the 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:58.600
 little cache that is cut 10 centimeters 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:03.700
 of a satin ribbon gives a 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:06.390
 transparency every time you turn the 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.390
 to sew 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.100
 that way you can also hold 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.100
 the caché pud 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:38.520
 just continue working to give a 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.849
 charm to one more cachepô you can 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.240
 put dried flowers 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:47.460
 okay remembering that all the molds and the 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.430
 step-by-step instructions are on the atelier's 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.979
 the magazine finds the other works 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.960
 in the minuano's special pet work magazine 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.189
 and against the other work of 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.770
 patchwork 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.770
 thank you, good work.
