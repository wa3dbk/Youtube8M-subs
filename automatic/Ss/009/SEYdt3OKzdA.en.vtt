hole<00:01:55.259> today<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.130> take<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.490> granted<00:01:56.549> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
hole today we take it for granted that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.060 
hole today we take it for granted that
we<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> big<00:01:57.509> head<00:01:58.110> phone<00:01:58.320> business<00:01:58.680> but

that's that didn't exist at that time so

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.110

we had a percent market share at the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.949 
we had a percent market share at the
time<00:02:05.560> but<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.680> market<00:02:06.979> was<00:02:07.100> very<00:02:07.250> small<00:02:07.520> and

electronics<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.880> always<00:02:20.950> challenging<00:02:21.950> for

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
electronics it's always challenging for

electronics it's always challenging for
an<00:02:23.000> inventor<00:02:23.570> of<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.720> category<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:24.380> also<00:02:24.530> then

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
an inventor of a category but also then

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.600 
an inventor of a category but also then
a<00:02:25.870> basically<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.990> category<00:02:27.440> captain<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.400> stay

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
a basically a category captain to stay

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.790 
a basically a category captain to stay
on<00:02:28.730> top<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.180> especially<00:02:29.930> over<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.530> many<00:02:30.650> years

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
on top and especially over so many years

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.130 
on top and especially over so many years
things<00:02:31.670> are<00:02:31.790> changing<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.660> especially<00:02:32.930> I

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
things are changing and especially I

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.229 
things are changing and especially I
think<00:02:33.200> in<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.530> last<00:02:33.650> five<00:02:33.950> six<00:02:34.190> years<00:02:34.310> with<00:02:34.760> a

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
think in the last five six years with a

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.170 
think in the last five six years with a
lot<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.070> more<00:02:37.070> fashion<00:02:37.400> oriented<00:02:37.610> brands

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
lot of more fashion oriented brands

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.020 
lot of more fashion oriented brands
coming<00:02:38.510> along<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.860> was<00:02:40.070> quite<00:02:40.340> difficult

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
coming along that was quite difficult

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.979 
coming along that was quite difficult
for<00:02:41.360> us<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.780> understand<00:02:42.350> what<00:02:43.130> happened<00:02:43.550> there

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
for us to understand what happened there

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.960 
for us to understand what happened there
we're<00:02:44.989> very<00:02:45.100> scientific<00:02:46.100> very<00:02:46.340> engineering

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
we're very scientific very engineering

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.930 
we're very scientific very engineering
driven<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.620> performance<00:02:49.220> was<00:02:49.430> always<00:02:49.700> first

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
driven so performance was always first

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.210 
driven so performance was always first
quality<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.930> comfort<00:02:51.230> was<00:02:51.530> always<00:02:51.860> first<00:02:52.040> and

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
quality and comfort was always first and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.270 
quality and comfort was always first and
suddenly<00:02:52.580> there<00:02:52.730> comes<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.720> new<00:02:54.260> vector<00:02:54.500> design

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
suddenly there comes a new vector design

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.110 
suddenly there comes a new vector design
and<00:02:55.940> style<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.830> fashion<00:02:57.830> which<00:02:58.610> becomes<00:02:58.970> very

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
and style and fashion which becomes very

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.440 
and style and fashion which becomes very
important<00:02:59.630> so<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.470> had<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:01.000> we<00:03:02.000> didn't<00:03:02.209> want<00:03:02.360> to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
important so we had to we didn't want to

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.380 
important so we had to we didn't want to
just<00:03:02.600> copy<00:03:02.810> what<00:03:02.989> they<00:03:03.170> did<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:04.390> participate

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
just copy what they did and participate

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.270 
just copy what they did and participate
there<00:03:05.570> as<00:03:05.690> well<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.019> we<00:03:06.140> step<00:03:06.650> back<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.130> said

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
there as well so we step back and said

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.220 
there as well so we step back and said
okay<00:03:07.489> what<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.850> Sennheiser<00:03:08.269> approach<00:03:08.600> to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
okay what is the Sennheiser approach to

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.550 
okay what is the Sennheiser approach to
this<00:03:09.350> new<00:03:10.480> consumer<00:03:11.480> need<00:03:11.690> because<00:03:12.019> it's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
this new consumer need because it's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.190 
this new consumer need because it's
undoubtedly<00:03:13.190> there<00:03:13.880> otherwise<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.989> wouldn't

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
undoubtedly there otherwise it wouldn't

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.640 
undoubtedly there otherwise it wouldn't
be<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.320> market<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.890> we<00:03:16.870> came<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.320> something

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
be a market and we came to something

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.620 
be a market and we came to something
which<00:03:18.769> is<00:03:18.890> much<00:03:19.070> more<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.730> our<00:03:20.090> painting<00:03:20.510> much

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
which is much more in our painting much

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.690 
which is much more in our painting much
more<00:03:20.900> true<00:03:21.079> to<00:03:21.230> sign<00:03:21.410> Heiser<00:03:21.620> which<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.549> this

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
more true to sign Heiser which is this

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.270 
more true to sign Heiser which is this
momentum<00:03:23.180> line<00:03:23.780> which<00:03:24.079> is<00:03:24.590> based<00:03:25.160> on

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
momentum line which is based on

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.440 
momentum line which is based on
substance<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.120> style<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.170> audio<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:29.150> I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
substance and style and audio and so I

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.150 
substance and style and audio and so I
would<00:03:29.989> say<00:03:30.140> one<00:03:30.290> step<00:03:30.560> ahead<00:03:30.709> of

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
would say one step ahead of

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.000 
would say one step ahead of
of<00:03:32.550> what<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.360> market<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.780> today<00:03:33.960> we<00:03:34.680> focus

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
of what the market is today we focus

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.150 
of what the market is today we focus
more<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.220> design<00:03:35.550> quality<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:37.160> material

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
more on design quality and material

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.150 
more on design quality and material
which<00:03:38.580> everyone<00:03:38.910> finishes<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:40.440> then<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
which everyone finishes and then the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.560 
which everyone finishes and then the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.200 
season 2013-14 maybe until late late 14
and<00:03:55.590> then<00:03:56.070> we<00:03:56.190> need<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.370> change<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.790> colors<00:03:57.090> as

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
and then we need to change the colors as

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.030 
and then we need to change the colors as
well<00:03:57.240> because<00:03:57.660> these<00:03:57.780> are<00:03:57.960> not<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.350> it's<00:03:58.920> not

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
coming out more and more surround is

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.400 
coming out more and more surround is
finally<00:04:50.190> there<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:51.780> we're<00:04:51.990> thinking<00:04:52.320> about

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
finally there and we're thinking about

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.730 
finally there and we're thinking about
even<00:04:52.890> more<00:04:53.460> spatial<00:04:53.910> formats<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.320> there<00:04:55.710> is

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
even more spatial formats so there is

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.790 
even more spatial formats so there is
obviously<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:57.950> trend<00:04:58.950> of<00:04:59.160> music<00:05:00.060> on<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.330> go

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
obviously a trend of music on the go

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.909 
obviously a trend of music on the go
where<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.980> consumers<00:05:03.080> ready<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.320> also<00:05:04.620> take

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
where the consumers ready to also take

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.480 
where the consumers ready to also take
some<00:05:05.190> compromise<00:05:05.730> on<00:05:05.970> sound<00:05:06.240> quality<00:05:06.720> but

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
some compromise on sound quality but

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.080 
some compromise on sound quality but
that's<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.910> see<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.360> go<00:05:09.990> away<00:05:10.320> an<00:05:10.590> mp3<00:05:11.190> when

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
that's we see that go away an mp3 when

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.420 
that's we see that go away an mp3 when
you<00:05:12.180> first<00:05:12.870> when<00:05:13.290> I<00:05:13.320> first<00:05:13.500> listened<00:05:13.950> to<00:05:14.010> mp3

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
you first when I first listened to mp3

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.610 
you first when I first listened to mp3
and<00:05:14.790> i<00:05:15.030> think<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.450> was<00:05:15.570> in<00:05:15.630> 92<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.410> when<00:05:16.590> i

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
and i think it was in 92 that when i

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.580 
and i think it was in 92 that when i
heard<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.950> first<00:05:17.100> mp3<00:05:17.640> it<00:05:18.270> sounded<00:05:19.230> awful

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
heard the first mp3 it sounded awful

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.519 
heard the first mp3 it sounded awful
today<00:05:19.890> an<00:05:20.130> mp3<00:05:20.400> is<00:05:20.820> a<00:05:21.270> decent<00:05:21.710> format<00:05:22.710> with

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 
today an mp3 is a decent format with

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.609 
today an mp3 is a decent format with
choose<00:05:23.799> a<00:05:23.829> decent<00:05:24.279> bit<00:05:24.369> rate<00:05:24.579> so<00:05:25.229> we<00:05:26.229> don't

00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:26.619 
choose a decent bit rate so we don't

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.579 
choose a decent bit rate so we don't
think<00:05:26.889> that<00:05:27.129> quality<00:05:27.849> is<00:05:28.269> always

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:28.589 
think that quality is always

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:30.989 
think that quality is always
deteriorating<00:05:29.589> substance<00:05:30.429> is<00:05:30.579> really<00:05:30.879> the

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:30.999 
deteriorating substance is really the

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.079 
deteriorating substance is really the
