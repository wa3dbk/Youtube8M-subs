00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.680 

Vox<00:00:38.650> decided<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.250> design<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.700> VR<00:00:40.300> series

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
Vox decided to design the VR series

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.090 
Vox decided to design the VR series
because<00:00:40.960> we<00:00:40.990> really<00:00:41.350> saw<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.560> gap<00:00:41.860> in<00:00:42.010> the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
because we really saw a gap in the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.220 
because we really saw a gap in the
market<00:00:42.490> there<00:00:43.480> are<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.600> lot<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:43.810> guys<00:00:43.960> who

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
market there are a lot of guys who

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.110 
market there are a lot of guys who
couldn't<00:00:44.440> justify<00:00:44.830> maybe<00:00:45.280> to<00:00:45.460> their<00:00:45.580> partners

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
couldn't justify maybe to their partners

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.780 
couldn't justify maybe to their partners
that<00:00:46.870> they<00:00:46.990> spending<00:00:47.620> out<00:00:47.800> on<00:00:48.070> a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
that they spending out on a

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.230 
that they spending out on a
amplifier<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:50.560> we<00:00:50.680> decided<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.130> come<00:00:52.060> up

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
amplifier and so we decided to come up

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.850 
amplifier and so we decided to come up
with<00:00:52.360> an<00:00:52.480> amp<00:00:52.630> that<00:00:52.690> had<00:00:52.930> all<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.140> classic<00:00:53.560> Vox

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
with an amp that had all the classic Vox

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.770
