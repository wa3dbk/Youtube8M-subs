but<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> all<00:01:41.970> speculation<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.530> know

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
but this is all speculation I don't know

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.710 
but this is all speculation I don't know
if<00:01:43.770> that's<00:01:43.950> true<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
if that's true or not so kind of it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.630 
if that's true or not so kind of it
opens<00:01:45.990> up

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
interesting because these toys actually

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.840 
interesting because these toys actually
don't<00:01:54.640> have<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.820> number<00:01:55.680> anyways<00:01:56.680> here<00:01:57.610> we<00:01:57.640> go

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
back here it's just a bunch of

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.830 
back here it's just a bunch of
mechanisms<00:02:47.860> going<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.310> what<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.360> earth<00:02:49.600> does

here<00:04:37.210> though<00:04:37.389> it's<00:04:37.599> really<00:04:38.169> creative<00:04:38.830> better

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
here though it's really creative better

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.249 
here though it's really creative better
than<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.400> Russia<00:04:39.610> RAM<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.120> we<00:04:40.270> got<00:04:40.479> in<00:04:41.050> North

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
than the Russia RAM that we got in North

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.580 
than the Russia RAM that we got in North
America<00:04:41.889> that's<00:04:42.400> for<00:04:42.699> sure

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
America that's for sure

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.810 
America that's for sure
anyway<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:44.650> I'll<00:04:44.949> do<00:04:45.099> a<00:04:45.130> quick<00:04:45.490> size

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
anyway so I'll do a quick size

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.490 
anyway so I'll do a quick size
comparison<00:04:45.849> here<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.050> guys<00:04:47.289> may<00:04:47.470> have

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
comparison here so you guys may have

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.200 
comparison here so you guys may have
remembered<00:04:47.979> these<00:04:48.130> McDonald's<00:04:48.699> toys<00:04:48.910> that<00:04:49.090> we

remembered these McDonald's toys that we

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.420 
remembered these McDonald's toys that we
got<00:04:49.360> in<00:04:49.449> North<00:04:49.570> America<00:04:50.169> they're<00:04:50.860> pretty<00:04:51.220> much

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
got in North America they're pretty much

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.520 
got in North America they're pretty much
the<00:04:51.490> same<00:04:51.699> size<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.539> believe<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.020> or<00:04:53.080> not<00:04:53.229> so

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
the same size and believe it or not so

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.290 
the same size and believe it or not so
that's<00:04:53.710> not<00:04:53.860> too<00:04:54.099> bad<00:04:54.310> do<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.030> want<00:04:55.090> to

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
that's not too bad do you want to

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.870
