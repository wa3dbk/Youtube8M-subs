00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 more area more power 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.190
 more value three good reasons to 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.070
 choose the new supported load 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.230
 aisane diamond kane a model that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.410
 plow tilling specialists have 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.869
 significantly improved 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.820
 duramax load reports and systems 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 improved turnaround are the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.900
 new strengths of the available model 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.750
 naturally in series for the diamond 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.790
 dose additionally equipped with the adjustment 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.650
 hydraulic working width and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.690
 of the hydro matic protection system 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.699
 against stones the diamond plow 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.720
 is the ideal instrument for plowing 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.720
 all types of soils 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.650
 the range includes two models 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.870
 the most important the diamond 12 can 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.520
 accommodate up to nine plinth she is 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.230
 equipped with a load transfer system 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.390
 regulate and a system entirely 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.640
 automatic turnaround with turn 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.180
 control for automatic management of 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.420
 the impound the diamond 11 smaller 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.190
 also accepts 900 at most 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.200
 tilt and mechanical adjustment 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.930
 the postponement of unregulated charges is 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 available as an option a tractor to him 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.899
 alone can not achieve traction 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.610
 perfect of the plow ideally 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.910
 it actively assists him in 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.399
 this task as on the diamond of 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.289
 leyme that the postponement of charges regulate 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.210
 allows you to transfer some of the weight 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.800
 of the plow on the rear axle of the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.780
 tractor 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.640
 this reduces skating increases the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.830
 work speed and all this for a 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.930
 fuel consumption and wear 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.640
 reduced tires 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.160
 the tractor power is thus 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.070
 ideally transformed into energy 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.929
 traction when plowing the wheel 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.849
 back in the groove undergone 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.110
 a much greater constraint than 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.660
 of the wheel on the ground no 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.580
 worked the postponement of charges 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.740
 then just transmit more than 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.479
 weight on that side which balances the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.819
 weight on the entire rear axle 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.600
 an extra asset for the tractor 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.220
 and his driving behavior 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.140
 when the hydraulic system raises 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.400
 the chassis of the plow the report of 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.220
 regulate charges automatically decreases 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.770
 the pressure the rear axle of the tractor 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.720
 is relieved as soon as the angle formed between 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.640
 the tractor and the plow exceeds 60 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.610
 degrees the set is automatically 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.830
 put out of pressure there diamond 12 itself 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.020
 moves with a single swing and easily when 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.340
 reversal at the headland more 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.560
 need to maneuver backwards 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 this would increase the stability of a 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.810
 hitch mostly in the field in 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.810
 slope 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.230
 the diamond 12 presents a novelty on 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.870
 electro-hydraulic adjustment 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.700
 tilting inclination of plowing 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.310
 directly set and memorize since 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.900
 the tractor both towards a double 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.150
 action of the turning system 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.609
 keep the plow exactly in 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.959
 its preset position no longer need beginning 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.790
 turning angle mechanics 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.670
 spring plowing where various soil 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.079
 wet or dry clay or sandy 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.169
 diamond plow really becomes 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.669
 effective in its diamond version v with 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.980
 hydraulic adjustment of the width of 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.599
 job 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.280
 indeed the quality of the plowing depends 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.370
 essentially the relationship between 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.049
 working depth and rewidth 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.569
 the re width is adjusted according to 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.419
 of the soil from the weather and the type of 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.510
 field the technique var it allows to 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.400
 stay flexible permanently with the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.700
 new diamond will everything is possible 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.139
 between 30 and 55 cm so that they width 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.090
 of work the soil got is it 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.280
 sufficiently crumbled where modes are 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.930
 they big enough dia me 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.659
 lets you test your settings 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.310
 Reliably 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.930
 the technique varies remains unbeatable in 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.579
 plowing at an angle plowing 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.579
 impounding or to avoid obstacles 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.599
 the time allotted is it too short the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.750
 simple increase in the width of 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.480
 working from 40 to 55 cm can increase 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.430
 the performance per hectare of 25% on 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.260
 single button press fully 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.889
 equipped with 9.5 working width 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.269
 maximum reaches about 1 6 5 m 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.549
 if the tractor then advances to him 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.660
 kilometers per hour 25 hectares per 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.660
 day are no longer a problem 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.039
 the two models of the diamond plow 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:35.500
 are equipped as standard with bodies of 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:37.840
 Duramax plow with low wear achieved 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.759
 without drilling stamping or milling 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.990
 they can use steel shades 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.210
 the hardest the blades towards evening 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.509
 bow are fixed lifeless this by simple 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.430
 hitch mation on the support mounting 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.710
 without tools that is more than twice 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.960
 faster than on the models agreement 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.330
 life plow it's the cia graffin more 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.539
 hard gives duramax wear parts 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.000
 a performance per hectare 75 % more 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.729
 high as demonstrated by the high school 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.590
 professional of yves their 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.960
 superior longevity increase 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.760
 replacement intervals 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.860
 the farmer can thus concentrate 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:22.539
 on his core business the work of 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.370
 blood other novelty the rased 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.560
 they are adjustable in height without 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.290
 tools via flat strand and stud 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.669
 but that's not the whole angle of 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.830
 penetration of the arast are maybe 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.190
 changed just as quickly and 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.810
 easily via a wedge 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.280
 doubling 6 degrees each time 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.410
 with charging fabric safety
