west<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.709> can<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:27.450> shape<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.690> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
west and you can see the shape of the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.660 
west and you can see the shape of the
spline<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.790> roof<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.260> that's<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.310> shape

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
spline of the roof and that's the shape

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.309 
spline of the roof and that's the shape
of<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.500> plastic<00:02:36.069> so<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.760> air<00:02:37.630> as<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.080> rises

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
of the plastic so the air as it rises

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.610

from heating in the summertime will run

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.670 
from heating in the summertime will run

corner looking at the greenhouse from
this<00:02:57.910> angle<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.480> easier<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.260> see<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.739> shape

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
this angle it's easier to see the shape

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.820 
this angle it's easier to see the shape
of<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:01.980> greenhouse<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.489> way<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:04.830> roof

pitches down into the ground the film

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.240 
pitches down into the ground the film
will<00:03:08.709> open<00:03:09.190> up<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.820> film<00:03:10.060> will<00:03:10.239> actually

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
will open up so the film will actually

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.130 
will open up so the film will actually
not<00:03:12.250> go<00:03:12.760> all<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.030> way<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.600> ground<00:03:13.840> it'll

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
not go all the way to the ground it'll

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.319 
not go all the way to the ground it'll
stop<00:03:14.859> short<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.640> winter<00:03:15.850> time<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.239> will

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
stop short in the winter time it will

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.300 
stop short in the winter time it will
seal<00:03:16.570> off<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.140> ground<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.799> summertime

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.090 
seal off to the ground in the summertime
it<00:03:19.030> will<00:03:19.150> create<00:03:19.390> like<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> venturi<00:03:20.320> opening<00:03:21.010> at

it will create like a venturi opening at

can see it still pretty much a
construction<00:04:42.160> zone<00:04:42.340> over<00:04:42.580> here<00:04:43.410> but<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.740> can

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.700 
length of the greenhouse and that's what
will<00:04:54.130> passively<00:04:55.080> allow<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.140> air<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:57.540> rise

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
will passively allow the air to rise

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
will passively allow the air to rise
convectively<00:04:59.710> inside<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.490> greenhouse

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
convectively inside the greenhouse

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.350 
convectively inside the greenhouse
during<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.300> summer<00:05:01.540> months<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:03.060> exit<00:05:04.060> with

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
during the summer months and exit with

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.230 
during the summer months and exit with
extremely<00:05:05.230> little<00:05:05.650> air<00:05:05.950> flow<00:05:06.340> resistance<00:05:06.730> and

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
extremely little air flow resistance and

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.370 
extremely little air flow resistance and
then<00:05:08.170> that<00:05:09.630> will<00:05:10.630> create<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:11.020> negative

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
then that will create a negative

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.900 
then that will create a negative
pressure<00:05:11.650> on<00:05:12.100> the<00:05:12.220> interior<00:05:12.700> of<00:05:12.730> the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
pressure on the interior of the

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.510 
pressure on the interior of the
greenhouse<00:05:13.390> and<00:05:13.690> pull<00:05:13.930> fresh<00:05:14.380> air<00:05:14.620> in<00:05:14.830> and

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
greenhouse and pull fresh air in and

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.510 
greenhouse and pull fresh air in and
it'll<00:05:16.120> come<00:05:16.300> in<00:05:16.510> from<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.530> southern<00:05:18.100> edge

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
it'll come in from the southern edge

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.120 
it'll come in from the southern edge
down<00:05:19.420> near<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.900> ground<00:05:20.080> with<00:05:20.440> misters<00:05:21.100> and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
down near the ground with misters and

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.390 
down near the ground with misters and
shade<00:05:21.840> so<00:05:22.840> that<00:05:23.050> it's<00:05:23.230> pre<00:05:23.500> cooled<00:05:23.860> and

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
shade so that it's pre cooled and

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.860 
shade so that it's pre cooled and
humidified<00:05:26.430> inside<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.580> greenhouse<00:05:27.870> there

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
humidified inside the greenhouse there

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.030 
humidified inside the greenhouse there
are<00:05:29.050> three<00:05:29.320> deep<00:05:29.500> water<00:05:29.740> culture<00:05:30.010> tables<00:05:32.040> one

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
are three deep water culture tables one

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.850 
are three deep water culture tables one
flood<00:05:33.520> drain<00:05:33.880> or<00:05:34.150> ebb<00:05:34.300> flow<00:05:35.400> media<00:05:36.400> table<00:05:37.860> two

lines of betta buckets and on the far

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.550 
lines of betta buckets and on the far
end<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:43.810> seedling<00:05:44.680> sprouting<00:05:45.220> table<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:46.560> yet

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
end a seedling sprouting table and yet

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.680 
end a seedling sprouting table and yet
to<00:05:47.740> be<00:05:47.890> constructed<00:05:48.580> on<00:05:48.730> this<00:05:49.060> end<00:05:49.390> is<00:05:50.520> the

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
to be constructed on this end is the

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.080 
to be constructed on this end is the
fish<00:05:52.690> Raceway<00:05:53.290> which<00:05:53.560> will<00:05:53.740> be<00:05:53.890> a<00:05:54.160> 20<00:05:54.910> foot

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
fish Raceway which will be a 20 foot

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.770 
fish Raceway which will be a 20 foot
long<00:05:55.360> fish<00:05:55.750> Raceway<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:58.240> there<00:05:58.450> you<00:05:58.600> have<00:05:58.630> it

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
long fish Raceway so there you have it

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.409 
long fish Raceway so there you have it
that's<00:05:59.140> the<00:05:59.410> tour<00:05:59.680> of<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.919> greenhouse<00:06:00.419> ross
