00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.649 
ultramarine keep it pale and this time
same<00:01:28.080> technique<00:01:28.530> worth<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.130> woods<00:01:32.659> partway

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
same technique worth of woods partway

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
same technique worth of woods partway
into<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.259> wash<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.280> brush<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:37.490> soften

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
off here and there now doesn't matter if

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.249 
off here and there now doesn't matter if
you<00:01:40.409> touch<00:01:40.740> into<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> blue<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.600> sky<00:01:45.259> but

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you touch into the blue of the sky but

you touch into the blue of the sky but
what<00:01:46.470> we're<00:01:46.619> trying<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.250> achieve<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> lot<00:01:48.540> of

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
what we're trying to achieve is a lot of

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.010 
what we're trying to achieve is a lot of
movement<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.439> lot<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.710> texture<00:01:50.720> soften<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
movement a lot of texture soften out the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
movement a lot of texture soften out the
bottom<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.740> wash<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.549> we

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
bottom of the wash there so that we

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.609 
bottom of the wash there so that we
don't<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.210> those<00:01:57.360> hard<00:01:57.719> lines<00:01:59.299> and<00:02:00.619> that's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
don't get those hard lines and that's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.530 
don't get those hard lines and that's
great<00:02:01.860> very<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.250> quick

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
great very very quick

I'm<00:02:25.379> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> use<00:02:25.769> quite<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.129> loose<00:02:26.730> technique

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
I'm going to use quite a loose technique

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.830 
I'm going to use quite a loose technique
here<00:02:28.040> because<00:02:29.040> we've<00:02:29.280> got<00:02:29.819> on<00:02:30.120> there<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> lot<00:02:30.810> of

lighter areas I don't try to copy every
single<00:02:48.840> breaker<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:50.389> really<00:02:51.389> try<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.720> get<00:02:52.019> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
single breaker just really try and get a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.339 
single breaker just really try and get a
feel<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.709> what's<00:02:53.190> happening<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.349> suggest

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
feel of what's happening and suggest

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.069 
feel of what's happening and suggest
that<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.340> brush<00:02:56.579> so<00:02:57.239> I'm<00:02:57.359> using<00:02:57.629> full

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
that with the brush so I'm using full

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.589 
that with the brush so I'm using full
brush<00:02:58.319> control<00:02:58.859> here<00:02:59.220> I've<00:02:59.519> got<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.150> I've<00:03:00.540> got

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
brush control here I've got the I've got

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.789 
brush control here I've got the I've got
my<00:03:00.810> finger<00:03:01.139> in<00:03:01.260> contact<00:03:01.709> with<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.859> paper

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
my finger in contact with the paper

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.199 
my finger in contact with the paper
maybe<00:03:04.799> even<00:03:05.040> soften<00:03:05.489> out<00:03:05.609> one<00:03:05.879> or<00:03:05.970> two<00:03:06.000> of

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
maybe even soften out one or two of

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.490 
maybe even soften out one or two of
these<00:03:06.359> shapes<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.019> I'll<00:03:07.079> just<00:03:07.200> take<00:03:07.439> some

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
these shapes so I'll just take some

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.879 
these shapes so I'll just take some
clean<00:03:08.099> water<00:03:08.310> on<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.939> brush<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.680> carry<00:03:10.680> on

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
clean water on the brush and carry on

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:19.520 
clean water on the brush and carry on
with<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.790> technique<00:03:17.810> maybe<00:03:18.810> introduce<00:03:19.290> a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
with the technique maybe introduce a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.740 
with the technique maybe introduce a
little<00:03:19.709> bit<00:03:19.919> of<00:03:20.010> dry<00:03:20.609> brush<00:03:20.879> let's<00:03:21.120> bring<00:03:21.480> some

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
little bit of dry brush let's bring some

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.479 
little bit of dry brush let's bring some
dry<00:03:22.230> brush<00:03:22.440> across<00:03:22.650> there<00:03:22.980> we'll<00:03:23.160> get<00:03:23.250> some

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
dry brush across there we'll get some

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.539 
dry brush across there we'll get some
really<00:03:23.730> lovely<00:03:24.590> textures<00:03:25.590> whether<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
really lovely textures whether the

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:45.000 
really lovely textures whether the
waters<00:03:27.060> running<00:03:27.299> up<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:28.010> beach

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.970 

okay<00:03:45.819> that<00:03:46.000> should<00:03:46.150> do<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.330> for<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.569> sea<00:03:49.980> okay

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
okay that should do it for the sea okay

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.530 
okay that should do it for the sea okay
that<00:03:51.159> although<00:03:51.310> I'm<00:03:51.549> very<00:03:51.580> tempted<00:03:52.209> actually

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
that although I'm very tempted actually

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.570 
that although I'm very tempted actually
to<00:03:52.750> -<00:03:53.140> probably<00:03:53.530> more<00:03:53.799> paint<00:03:54.069> in<00:03:54.220> there<00:03:54.400> but<00:03:54.519> I

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
to - probably more paint in there but I

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.369 
to - probably more paint in there but I
can<00:03:54.610> see<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.299> wash<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.659> actually<00:03:55.959> drying

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
can see that the wash is actually drying

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.070 
can see that the wash is actually drying
off<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.830> that's<00:03:57.819> really<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.330> critical<00:03:58.569> stage

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
off and that's really the critical stage

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.080 
off and that's really the critical stage
don't<00:03:59.560> work<00:03:59.830> back<00:04:00.040> into<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.459> if<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.730> wash<00:04:00.909> is

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
don't work back into it if the wash is

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.470 
don't work back into it if the wash is
drying<00:04:02.280> right<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.489> painting<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.299> nearly

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
drying right this painting is nearly

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.720 
drying right this painting is nearly
finished<00:04:04.750> now<00:04:05.110> we've<00:04:05.379> got<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.950> colors<00:04:06.489> of<00:04:06.610> the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
finished now we've got the colors of the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.930 
finished now we've got the colors of the
beach<00:04:06.940> in<00:04:07.209> there<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.560> as<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.400> said<00:04:09.459> it's<00:04:09.730> really

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
beach in there and as I said it's really

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.000 
beach in there and as I said it's really
important<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.540> put<00:04:10.780> those<00:04:10.930> in<00:04:11.170> before<00:04:11.769> you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
important to put those in before you

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.699 
important to put those in before you
start<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.879> detail<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.690> that's<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.170> next

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
start the detail so that's the next

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.759 
start the detail so that's the next
stage<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.700> get<00:04:16.690> some<00:04:16.900> detail<00:04:17.410> got<00:04:17.680> all

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
stage is to get some detail got all

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.890 
stage is to get some detail got all
these<00:04:17.889> lovely<00:04:18.160> pebbles<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.299> textures<00:04:19.780> on

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
these lovely pebbles and textures on

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.560 
these lovely pebbles and textures on
there<00:04:20.139> I'm<00:04:20.320> going<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.919> work<00:04:21.190> with<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.970> same

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
there I'm going to work with the same

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.430 
there I'm going to work with the same
colors<00:04:22.990> again<00:04:23.289> the<00:04:23.560> French<00:04:24.130> ultramarine<00:04:24.340> and

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
colors again the French ultramarine and

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.860 
colors again the French ultramarine and
some<00:04:26.440> raw<00:04:26.680> Sienna<00:04:27.060> quite<00:04:28.060> strong<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.810> time

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
some raw Sienna quite strong this time

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.129 
some raw Sienna quite strong this time
so<00:04:29.440> more<00:04:30.130> paint<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.639> less<00:04:30.880> water<00:04:31.270> in<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.900> mix

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
so more paint and less water in the mix

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.870 
so more paint and less water in the mix
and<00:04:32.380> for<00:04:32.919> this<00:04:33.160> I'm<00:04:33.430> going<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.699> use<00:04:33.789> a

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
and for this I'm going to use a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.980 
and for this I'm going to use a
stippling<00:04:34.810> technique<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:37.030> just<00:04:37.360> dotting<00:04:37.660> on

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
stippling technique so just dotting on

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.490 
stippling technique so just dotting on
the<00:04:38.260> shapes<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.870> pebbles<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.020> again<00:04:41.289> not

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
the shapes of the pebbles and again not

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.250 
the shapes of the pebbles and again not
copying<00:04:42.070> precise<00:04:42.729> details<00:04:43.300> try<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.930> get<00:04:44.229> a

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
copying precise details try to get a

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.870 
copying precise details try to get a
feel<00:04:44.560> of<00:04:44.590> what's<00:04:45.430> happening<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.120> just<00:04:47.880> wants

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
feel of what's happening and just wants

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.570 
feel of what's happening and just wants
to<00:04:48.910> do<00:04:49.090> its<00:04:49.240> own<00:04:49.330> bit<00:04:50.070> slightly<00:04:51.070> smaller<00:04:51.340> brush

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
to do its own bit slightly smaller brush

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.940 
to do its own bit slightly smaller brush
for<00:04:51.610> this<00:04:51.910> technique<00:04:52.389> we've<00:04:53.320> got<00:04:53.470> smaller

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
for this technique we've got smaller

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.830 
for this technique we've got smaller
details<00:04:54.550> smaller<00:04:55.450> area<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.200> paint<00:04:56.500> in<00:04:56.710> so<00:04:57.520> a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
details smaller area to paint in so a

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.589 
details smaller area to paint in so a
smaller<00:04:58.840> brush<00:04:59.610> all<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.880> time<00:05:01.090> I'm<00:05:01.330> still

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
smaller brush all the time I'm still

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.219 
smaller brush all the time I'm still
using<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.820> wash<00:05:03.820> technique<00:05:04.360> keeping<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.020> wet

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
using the wash technique keeping a wet

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.310 
using the wash technique keeping a wet
edge<00:05:05.470> even<00:05:05.770> though<00:05:05.889> we've<00:05:06.340> got<00:05:06.820> all<00:05:06.970> these

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
edge even though we've got all these

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.110 
edge even though we've got all these
stipple<00:05:08.320> bits<00:05:08.560> in<00:05:08.770> there<00:05:09.010> I've<00:05:09.220> still<00:05:09.639> got<00:05:09.880> a

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
stipple bits in there I've still got a

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:20.270 
stipple bits in there I've still got a
wet<00:05:10.930> edge<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:16.419> I'm<00:05:17.820> really<00:05:18.820> using<00:05:19.630> a

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
wet edge and I'm really using a

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.100 
wet edge and I'm really using a
softening<00:05:21.280> technique<00:05:21.729> now<00:05:21.970> just<00:05:22.300> using<00:05:22.720> some

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
softening technique now just using some

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.360 
softening technique now just using some
clean<00:05:23.380> water<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:27.930> continuing<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.370> stippling

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
clean water and continuing the stippling

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.540 
clean water and continuing the stippling
just<00:05:31.300> helps<00:05:31.539> to<00:05:31.599> soften<00:05:31.990> some<00:05:32.410> of<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.620> shapes

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
just helps to soften some of the shapes

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.870 
just helps to soften some of the shapes
and<00:05:34.860> then<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:36.039> whole<00:05:36.220> thing<00:05:36.550> doesn't<00:05:36.729> look

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
and then the whole thing doesn't look

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:55.780 
and then the whole thing doesn't look
too<00:05:37.240> hard<00:05:37.599> on<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:39.370> surface

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.350 

it's<00:05:56.300> in<00:05:56.480> a<00:05:56.720> thin<00:05:57.680> pin<00:05:57.980> allowing<00:05:58.700> the<00:05:58.940> white<00:05:59.150> of

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
it's in a thin pin allowing the white of

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.210 
it's in a thin pin allowing the white of
the<00:05:59.390> paper<00:05:59.480> to<00:05:59.840> show<00:05:59.870> through<00:06:00.350> but<00:06:00.590> this<00:06:01.010> is

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
the paper to show through but this is

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.760 
the paper to show through but this is
just<00:06:01.550> really<00:06:01.850> to<00:06:01.970> show<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.270> if<00:06:02.660> you<00:06:03.080> forget<00:06:03.500> to

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
just really to show you if you forget to

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.880 
just really to show you if you forget to
reserve<00:06:04.490> any<00:06:04.730> whites<00:06:05.000> or<00:06:05.630> you<00:06:05.930> decide<00:06:06.710> you

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
reserve any whites or you decide you

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.440 
reserve any whites or you decide you
want<00:06:07.040> to<00:06:07.160> add<00:06:07.310> something<00:06:07.760> right<00:06:08.000> at<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.300> end

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
want to add something right at the end

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.530 
want to add something right at the end
then<00:06:09.020> you<00:06:09.470> can<00:06:09.710> use<00:06:10.070> some<00:06:10.100> opaque<00:06:10.640> white<00:06:10.940> now

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
then you can use some opaque white now

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.200 
then you can use some opaque white now
this<00:06:11.750> is<00:06:11.960> straight<00:06:12.950> out<00:06:12.980> of<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.460> tubes<00:06:13.790> very

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
this is straight out of the tubes very

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.180 
this is straight out of the tubes very
very<00:06:14.390> thick<00:06:14.690> just<00:06:15.230> make<00:06:15.440> sure<00:06:15.740> that<00:06:15.770> it's

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
very thick just make sure that it's

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.450 
very thick just make sure that it's
going<00:06:16.490> to<00:06:16.700> stand<00:06:17.180> out<00:06:17.980> okay<00:06:18.980> that's<00:06:19.310> just

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
going to stand out okay that's just

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.580 
going to stand out okay that's just
about<00:06:19.940> finished<00:06:20.330> I<00:06:20.420> think<00:06:20.480> that's<00:06:20.750> great<00:06:21.050> I'll

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
about finished I think that's great I'll

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.790 
about finished I think that's great I'll
put<00:06:21.830> one<00:06:22.040> or<00:06:22.070> two<00:06:22.900> bits<00:06:23.900> on<00:06:24.080> here<00:06:24.290> just<00:06:24.560> to

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
put one or two bits on here just to

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.000 
put one or two bits on here just to
maybe<00:06:25.070> pick<00:06:25.910> up<00:06:26.120> on<00:06:26.330> some<00:06:26.600> of<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:29.260> waves<00:06:30.260> so

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
maybe pick up on some of the waves so

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.710 
maybe pick up on some of the waves so
again<00:06:31.280> if<00:06:31.400> you've<00:06:31.550> missed<00:06:31.880> out<00:06:32.060> one<00:06:32.360> or<00:06:32.480> two<00:06:32.510> of

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
again if you've missed out one or two of

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.620 
again if you've missed out one or two of
these<00:06:33.550> waves<00:06:34.550> then<00:06:34.850> you<00:06:35.000> can<00:06:35.150> put<00:06:35.390> them<00:06:35.540> in

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
these waves then you can put them in

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.460 
these waves then you can put them in
with<00:06:35.780> the<00:06:36.770> white<00:06:37.090> okay<00:06:38.090> that's<00:06:38.330> the<00:06:38.630> painting

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
with the white okay that's the painting

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.770 
with the white okay that's the painting
finish<00:06:39.770> now<00:06:40.010> using<00:06:40.790> washes<00:06:41.300> and<00:06:41.450> brush

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
finish now using washes and brush

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.350 
finish now using washes and brush
strokes<00:06:42.110> together
