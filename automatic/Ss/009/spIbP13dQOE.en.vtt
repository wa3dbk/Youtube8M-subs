arms aren't actually long enough to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.200 
arms aren't actually long enough to
stretch<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.460> let's<00:02:43.120> see<00:02:43.710> here<00:02:44.710> is<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.490> tartan

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.560 
stretch so let's see here is the tartan
twosome<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:47.440> lots<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.550> tartan<00:02:48.940> as<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.180> can<00:02:49.360> see

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
twosome so lots of tartan as you can see

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.250 
twosome so lots of tartan as you can see
but<00:02:50.260> what's<00:02:50.470> super<00:02:50.980> cool<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.610> one<00:02:51.820> is

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
but what's super cool but this one is

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.790 
but what's super cool but this one is
that<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.360> double<00:02:55.660> spinner<00:02:55.930> because<00:02:56.650> it's

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
that it's a double spinner because it's

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.470 
that it's a double spinner because it's
a<00:02:56.860> double<00:02:57.100> race<00:02:57.220> only<00:02:57.400> makes<00:02:57.670> sense<00:02:57.820> so

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
a double race only makes sense so

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.330 
a double race only makes sense so
there's<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.110> turtle<00:02:59.530> arrow<00:02:59.710> that<00:02:59.860> spins<00:03:00.160> and

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
there's a turtle arrow that spins and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.680 
there's a turtle arrow that spins and
then<00:03:00.430> there's<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.640> big<00:03:00.790> coin<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.360> center

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
then there's a big coin in the center

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.050 
then there's a big coin in the center
that<00:03:01.720> spins<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.710> is<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.190> massive<00:03:03.520> metal

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
that spins this is like a massive metal

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.120 
that spins this is like a massive metal
