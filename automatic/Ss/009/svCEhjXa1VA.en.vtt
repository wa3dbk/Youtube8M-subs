it's just like I can't stop touching me
it's<00:06:21.990> so<00:06:22.230> soft<00:06:22.530> I<00:06:22.860> like<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.580> feel<00:06:23.820> of<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.360> cry

like<00:06:24.960> the<00:06:25.110> pearl<00:06:25.410> um<00:06:26.360> but<00:06:27.360> this<00:06:27.480> looks<00:06:27.660> like

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
like the pearl um but this looks like

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.110

wings<00:06:28.290> that<00:06:28.620> I've<00:06:28.770> done<00:06:28.980> reviews<00:06:29.400> on<00:06:29.640> before

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
wings that I've done reviews on before

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.250 
wings that I've done reviews on before
it's<00:06:30.390> definitely<00:06:31.110> not<00:06:31.430> what<00:06:32.430> I<00:06:32.640> thought<00:06:33.180> it

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
it's definitely not what I thought it

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.100 
it's definitely not what I thought it
would<00:06:34.260> be<00:06:34.500> but<00:06:35.010> it's<00:06:35.190> still<00:06:35.400> pretty<00:06:36.080> so<00:06:37.080> pretty

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
would be but it's still pretty so pretty

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.570 
would be but it's still pretty so pretty
maybe<00:06:37.680> it's<00:06:37.860> because<00:06:38.010> of<00:06:38.280> the<00:06:38.340> color

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
maybe it's because of the color

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.490
