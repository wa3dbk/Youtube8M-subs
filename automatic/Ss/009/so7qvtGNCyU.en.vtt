like<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> would<00:01:14.070> normally<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.060> real<00:01:15.270> life

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
like it would normally do in real life

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.440 
like it would normally do in real life
which<00:01:16.140> i<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.710> very<00:01:16.920> amazing<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.759> here

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
which i think is very amazing and here

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.340 
which i think is very amazing and here
in<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.630> cockpit<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.290> looks<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.920> good<00:01:20.159> e<00:01:21.350> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
in the cockpit it looks very good e to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.390 
in the cockpit it looks very good e to
it<00:01:22.770> looks<00:01:23.100> very<00:01:23.400> impressive<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.119> think<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
it looks very impressive but I think and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.690 
it looks very impressive but I think and
yeah<00:01:26.400> let's<00:01:26.820> take<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> off<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> spin<00:01:28.700> anyway

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
yeah let's take it off for a spin anyway

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.539 
yeah let's take it off for a spin anyway
this<00:01:30.000> car<00:01:30.299> has<00:01:30.540> five<00:01:31.670> gears<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.130> very

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
this car has five gears and it is a very

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.270 
this car has five gears and it is a very
very<00:01:35.880> fast<00:01:36.570> car<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.200> actually<00:01:37.380> actually

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
very fast car I was actually actually

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.149 
very fast car I was actually actually
actually<00:01:38.640> surprised<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:40.259> how<00:01:40.439> fast<00:01:40.470> this

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
actually surprised with how fast this

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.480 
actually surprised with how fast this
car<00:01:41.430> actually<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.140> from<00:01:43.920> like

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
car actually is you can get from like

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
car actually is you can get from like
zero<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.229> 100<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.670> about<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.990> 10<00:01:48.990> seconds<00:01:49.470> or

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
zero to 100 in about like 10 seconds or

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
zero to 100 in about like 10 seconds or
something<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:51.030> very

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
something so I think that it's very

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.880 
something so I think that it's very
impressive<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.140> 10<00:01:52.740> seconds<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.399> actually

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
impressive and 10 seconds is actually

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.760 
impressive and 10 seconds is actually
much<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.159> than<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.520> need<00:01:57.259> anyway<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.500> car

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
much more than you need anyway this car

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.819 
much more than you need anyway this car
is<00:01:58.860> actually<00:01:59.009> very<00:01:59.219> difficult<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.450> drive<00:02:00.869> but

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
is actually very difficult to drive but

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.289 
is actually very difficult to drive but
as<00:02:02.250> soon<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.149> learn<00:02:03.390> how<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.320> will<00:02:05.299> it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
as soon as you learn how to it will it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.559 
as soon as you learn how to it will it
will<00:02:06.360> become<00:02:06.689> simpler<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.799> course<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:09.119> yes<00:02:09.330> I'm

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
will become simpler of course so yes I'm

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.020 
will become simpler of course so yes I'm
just<00:02:09.869> whoops<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.849> out<00:02:11.879> on

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
just whoops I'm just going to go out on

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.840 
just whoops I'm just going to go out on
