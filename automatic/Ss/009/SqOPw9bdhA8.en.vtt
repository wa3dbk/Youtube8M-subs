00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.049 

now<00:00:09.320> we're<00:00:09.710> putting<00:00:09.889> the<00:00:10.040> finishing<00:00:10.460> touches

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
now we're putting the finishing touches

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.470 
now we're putting the finishing touches
on<00:00:11.450> the<00:00:12.429> rear<00:00:13.429> motor<00:00:13.730> mount<00:00:15.010> the<00:00:16.480> difficulty

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
on the rear motor mount the difficulty

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.510 
on the rear motor mount the difficulty
is<00:00:19.329> if<00:00:20.329> you<00:00:20.509> want<00:00:20.689> to<00:00:20.720> call<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:20.990> difficult<00:00:21.520> is

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
is if you want to call it difficult is

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.419 
is if you want to call it difficult is
getting<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.830> motor<00:00:24.830> aligned<00:00:25.929> so<00:00:26.929> that<00:00:26.960> it's

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
getting the motor aligned so that it's

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.400 
getting the motor aligned so that it's
properly<00:00:28.429> aligned<00:00:29.210> in<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:29.689> direction

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
properly aligned in this direction

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.970 
properly aligned in this direction
rotationally<00:00:31.449> and<00:00:32.449> then<00:00:32.629> we<00:00:32.780> had<00:00:33.019> to<00:00:34.210> align<00:00:35.210> it

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
rotationally and then we had to align it

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.210 
rotationally and then we had to align it
vertically<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:38.180> know<00:00:38.360> up<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.110> down<00:00:39.260> from<00:00:40.040> the

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
vertically you know up and down from the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.029 
vertically you know up and down from the
ground<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.079> then<00:00:42.079> also<00:00:43.090> how<00:00:44.090> it<00:00:44.300> sits<00:00:44.570> in<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
ground and then also how it sits in the

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.729 
ground and then also how it sits in the
engine<00:00:46.039> apartment<00:00:46.430> left<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.090> right<00:00:47.739> so

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
engine apartment left to right so

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.660 
engine apartment left to right so
everything<00:00:49.340> had<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:49.550> be<00:00:50.949> just<00:00:51.949> right<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.520> so

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
everything had to be just right and so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.670 
everything had to be just right and so
we've<00:00:52.850> got<00:00:53.090> straps<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:53.840> were<00:00:53.989> holding<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:54.559> in

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
we've got straps that were holding it in

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.939 
we've got straps that were holding it in
place<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.420> forth<00:00:56.440> let's<00:00:57.440> see<00:00:57.590> if<00:00:57.649> we<00:00:57.770> can<00:00:57.859> get

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
place so forth let's see if we can get

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.930 
place so forth let's see if we can get
in<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:58.510> let<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.690> see<00:00:59.930> how<00:01:00.320> it's<00:01:00.530> coming<00:01:03.940> so

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
in and let you see how it's coming so

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.960 
in and let you see how it's coming so
what<00:01:05.149> we<00:01:05.269> have<00:01:06.190> is<00:01:07.190> our<00:01:08.140> stock<00:01:09.140> crossmember

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.090 

this<00:01:13.600> was<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.990> crossmember<00:01:14.650> from<00:01:14.920> the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
this was the crossmember from the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.510 
this was the crossmember from the
factory<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:17.470> simply<00:01:17.880> relocated<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:19.590> back<00:01:20.590> from

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
factory we simply relocated it back from

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.510 
factory we simply relocated it back from
where<00:01:21.730> it<00:01:21.820> was<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.590> original<00:01:24.010> factory

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
where it was the original factory

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.890 
where it was the original factory
location<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.640> can<00:01:27.790> see<00:01:28.060> right<00:01:28.300> there<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:30.900> was

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
location you can see right there I was

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
location you can see right there I was
here<00:01:33.240> you've<00:01:34.240> moved<00:01:34.420> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
here you've moved it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.609 
here you've moved it
back<00:01:37.100> all<00:01:39.290> about<00:01:40.290> six<00:01:40.650> inches

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.240 

and<00:01:44.710> then<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.609> crossmember<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.979> now

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
and then that crossmember is now

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
and then that crossmember is now
supporting<00:01:50.520> an<00:01:51.520> angle<00:01:52.000> iron

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.820 

that's<00:01:55.950> mounted<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.580> that<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.530> stock

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
that's mounted to that the stock

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.640 
that's mounted to that the stock
remember

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.180 

and<00:02:04.100> then<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:06.530> is<00:02:06.860> then<00:02:07.580> shock<00:02:08.450> mounted<00:02:09.190> and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
and then that is then shock mounted and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.040 
and then that is then shock mounted and
again<00:02:10.580> they're<00:02:10.790> black<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.450> they<00:02:11.570> don't<00:02:11.780> show

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
again they're black so they don't show

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.560 
again they're black so they don't show
up<00:02:12.080> very<00:02:12.500> well<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:13.120> you'll<00:02:14.120> see<00:02:14.330> there's

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
up very well but you'll see there's

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.540 
up very well but you'll see there's
three<00:02:15.580> shock<00:02:16.580> mounts<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:18.560> mount<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:19.010> top<00:02:19.040> of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
three shock mounts that mount on top of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.250 
three shock mounts that mount on top of
that<00:02:20.410> angle<00:02:21.410> iron<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:23.350> then<00:02:24.350> another<00:02:24.650> one<00:02:26.260> is

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
that angle iron and then another one is

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.900 
that angle iron and then another one is
mounted<00:02:28.420> on<00:02:29.420> top<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.840> them<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.450> then<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.690> one

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
mounted on top of them and then that one

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.010 
mounted on top of them and then that one
mounts<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.320> motor

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.830 

in<00:02:39.440> two<00:02:39.800> positions<00:02:40.270> we're<00:02:41.270> getting<00:02:41.510> ready<00:02:41.630> to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
in two positions we're getting ready to

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.550 
in two positions we're getting ready to
drill<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:44.030> hole<00:02:44.240> on<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.950> right<00:02:45.950> side<00:02:46.010> there

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
drill the hole on the right side there

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.090 
drill the hole on the right side there
let's<00:02:48.560> mount<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.190> motor<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:51.530> strap<00:02:51.860> on

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
let's mount it on the motor the strap on

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.270 
let's mount it on the motor the strap on
the<00:02:52.220> shaft<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.790> just<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.210> keep<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.630> thing<00:02:54.280> from

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
the shaft is just to keep the thing from

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.730 
the shaft is just to keep the thing from
sliding<00:02:55.700> back<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.510> left<00:02:56.750> kinda<00:02:57.470> wanted<00:02:57.710> to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
sliding back to the left kinda wanted to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.940 
sliding back to the left kinda wanted to
go<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.160> way<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.400> little<00:02:58.610> bit<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.740> we've<00:03:00.740> got<00:03:00.920> a

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
go that way a little bit so we've got a

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.520 
go that way a little bit so we've got a
held<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.430> position

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.350 

here's<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.340> view<00:03:08.520> from<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.910> top<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.270> I

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
here's the view from the top so like I

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.410 
here's the view from the top so like I
said<00:03:12.420> these<00:03:12.780> holes<00:03:13.140> weren't<00:03:14.420> horizontally

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
said these holes weren't horizontally

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.080 
said these holes weren't horizontally
across<00:03:15.690> one<00:03:16.170> another<00:03:16.200> which<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.970> know

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
across one another which you know

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.050 
across one another which you know
aesthetically<00:03:19.050> looks<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.820> little<00:03:20.820> better<00:03:21.800> but

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
aesthetically looks a little better but

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.490 
aesthetically looks a little better but
that's<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.510> way<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:27.470> adapter<00:03:28.470> and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that's just the way with the adapter and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.490 
that's just the way with the adapter and
so<00:03:28.770> forth<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.670> way<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.500> turned

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
so forth that's just the way it turned

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.550 
so forth that's just the way it turned
out<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.150> then<00:03:33.920> this<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.030> strapped<00:03:36.380> from<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
out so then this is strapped from the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.370 
out so then this is strapped from the
motor<00:03:38.600> down<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:39.870> angle<00:03:40.080> iron<00:03:42.320> through<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
motor down to this angle iron through a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.300 
motor down to this angle iron through a
shock<00:03:43.770> mount<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:45.209> another<00:03:45.420> piece<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.660> iron

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
shock mount to another piece of iron

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.560 
shock mount to another piece of iron

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
which is bolted to the original

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.280 
which is bolted to the original
crossmember<00:03:49.970> now<00:03:50.970> these<00:03:51.180> will<00:03:51.450> be<00:03:51.480> trimmed

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
crossmember now these will be trimmed

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.880 
crossmember now these will be trimmed
and<00:03:54.830> ground<00:03:55.830> will<00:03:56.610> round<00:03:56.880> off<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.300> corners

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
and ground will round off the corners

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.650 
and ground will round off the corners
clean<00:03:58.890> everything<00:03:59.340> up<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.970> course<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.390> all<00:04:00.480> has

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
clean everything up of course it all has

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.170 
clean everything up of course it all has
to<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.900> painted<00:04:01.580> we're<00:04:02.580> just<00:04:02.820> doing<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
to be painted we're just doing the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.510 
to be painted we're just doing the
fitment<00:04:03.420> right<00:04:03.810> now<00:04:04.820> but<00:04:05.820> that's<00:04:06.060> how<00:04:06.270> this<00:04:06.450> is

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
fitment right now but that's how this is

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.140 
fitment right now but that's how this is
secured<00:04:08.520> on<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:09.440> back<00:04:10.440> end<00:04:11.420> so<00:04:12.420> it's<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.690> simple

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
secured on the back end so it's a simple

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.509 
secured on the back end so it's a simple
design<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:16.580> very<00:04:17.580> effective<00:04:19.160> it'll<00:04:20.160> support

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
design but very effective it'll support

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.670 
design but very effective it'll support
the<00:04:20.760> weight<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.330> motor<00:04:22.580> it'll<00:04:23.580> resist

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
the weight of the motor it'll resist

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.840 
the weight of the motor it'll resist
rotational<00:04:25.680> torque<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:28.020> it's<00:04:28.830> all<00:04:29.070> shock

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
rotational torque and it's all shock

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.930 
rotational torque and it's all shock
mounted<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:30.780> no<00:04:30.960> vibration<00:04:31.620> will<00:04:32.400> transform

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
mounted so no vibration will transform

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.980 
mounted so no vibration will transform
it<00:04:33.300> through<00:04:33.870> our<00:04:35.120> mounting<00:04:36.120> system<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
it through our mounting system to the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.620 
it through our mounting system to the
body<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.410> vehicle<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:39.150> then<00:04:39.300> of<00:04:39.419> course

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
body of the vehicle and then of course

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.460 
body of the vehicle and then of course
there's<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.080> stock<00:04:40.380> mount<00:04:41.690> on<00:04:42.690> the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
there's the stock mount on the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.770 
there's the stock mount on the
front<00:04:45.470> side<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.949> transaxle<00:04:46.479> so<00:04:47.479> there<00:04:47.659> you

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
front side of the transaxle so there you

00:04:47.780 --> 00:05:02.820 
front side of the transaxle so there you
have<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:50.020> here's<00:04:51.020> our<00:04:51.879> rear<00:04:52.879> motor<00:04:53.120> mount

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830
