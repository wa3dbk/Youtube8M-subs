00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello here is the street 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.710
 where all the cars pass 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.970
 the pedestrians 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.970
 there is a car 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.789
 and here is the building where I live 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.759
 Now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.759
 something about the safety of good canada 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.460
 as you can see the street is back if 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.519
 we walked 20 steps or so we arrived 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.500
 to the parking lot and the playground 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.860
 the children where very carelessly 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.190
 we usually leave during all 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.670
 year the bicycles and toys of them 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.670
 of the kids 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.989
 here they walk 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 of the street here as I have seen in 30 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 Steps 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 bikes 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.190
 everywhere 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.700
 as each bicycle of these has 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.039
 a value of more or less 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 and $ 120 when this is new and when 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.570
 is used there some 70 dollars 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.390
 the fact is that those bicycles pass there 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.210
 all year round in winter in summer and 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.240
 nobody steals it, I'm going to show you 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.440
 more time the distance between the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 yard game 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.299
 or the bicycle yard and the street 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.100
 there are 40 meters or so even in 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.100
 this corner there are bicycles too 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.660
 perfectly visible anyone 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.900
 at any time you can simply pass 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.260
 and take them away but they do not because they do not 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.210
 they do it good 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.370
 in many parts of the world they do not 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.690
 in Canada I specifically know that I do not 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.640
 they do simply because it's Canada 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.950
 what does that mean 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.430
 Well, the unemployment figure is not 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.970
 so high there is no culture 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.300
 of theft get easy things and the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.280
 people fear the authorities 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.200
 people are afraid of the police many 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.730
 many young people could 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 just come and steal in these 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.110
 bicycles sell them at 40 dollars and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.050
 get for 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.240
 20 grams of marijuana with that could 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.710
 buy it from 4 or 5 cigarettes 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.160
 marihuana I believe 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.730
 but they do not 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.090
 this is amazing I do not like this 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.700
 at least I know that in my city this does not 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.390
 could you do you leave a bicycle 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.840
 A) Yes 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.120
 and I'll steal you 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.890
 these bicycles carry here this I carry 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.959
 five years so when I arrived 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.960
 was nobody and so far I do not know 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.970
 they have stolen 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.650
 if we go to the other buildings for 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.890
 example those that are behind or these 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.769
 that are behind also behind me in 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.470
 this case at this moment I'm sure 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.640
 that we also find things like that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.250
 bicycles skateboards clippers 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.810
 I do not know any kind of things that 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.810
 they can leave the interpreter in a courtyard 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.260
 nothing wanted to show that this is one of 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.190
 the reasons why this country 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.140
 like so much 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.670
 and I sincerely hope that one day in my 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.560
 country we can have this kind of 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.650
 security and tranquility and 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.650
 trust 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.160
 I do not advise you if you live in Canada 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.239
 des in the open doors many times 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.290
 I leave the door of my apartment 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.459
 open by mistake but above all 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.500
 simply because I do not walk with the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.400
 concern that if that if not 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.400
 I'm going to steal 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.650
 well thats all chau chau chau
