00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
ops - a lot of people love black ops 1

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.600 
ops - a lot of people love black ops 1
but<00:01:36.600> black<00:01:36.750> ops<00:01:36.990> 2<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
but black ops 2 is just like it's the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.490 
but black ops 2 is just like it's the
one<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.000> raised<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> bar<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.990> quality<00:01:40.020> it's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
one that raised the bar for quality it's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.230 
one that raised the bar for quality it's
the<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:41.970> set

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240 
the one that really kind of you know set
the<00:01:42.270> standard<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:42.869> where<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.770> series<00:01:44.100> could

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the standard for where the series could

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
the standard for where the series could
go<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:45.210> can't<00:01:45.390> wait<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.229> they

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
go I just can't wait to see what they

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.230 
go I just can't wait to see what they
can<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.549> three<00:01:47.820> years<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
can do with this three years like you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.200 
can do with this three years like you
know<00:01:48.360> sledgehammer<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> first<00:01:49.590> studio

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
know sledgehammer was the first studio

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.700 
know sledgehammer was the first studio
to<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.570> three<00:01:51.780> year<00:01:51.930> cycle<00:01:52.079> an<00:01:52.290> advanced

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to have the three year cycle an advanced

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.260 
to have the three year cycle an advanced
warfare<00:01:53.070> ended<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.430> being<00:01:53.640> an<00:01:53.759> absolutely

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
warfare ended up being an absolutely

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.670 
warfare ended up being an absolutely
amazing<00:01:54.659> game<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.259> they've<00:01:55.500> done<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
amazing game I think they've done a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.499 
amazing game I think they've done a
great<00:01:55.890> job<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:57.030> they've<00:01:57.329> done<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
great job with it I think they've done a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.450 
great job with it I think they've done a
great<00:01:57.899> job<00:01:57.930> supporting<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.250> their

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
great job supporting it and it's their

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.370 
great job supporting it and it's their
first<00:01:59.700> game<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.570> they've<00:02:00.689> ever<00:02:00.899> made<00:02:01.140> by

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
first game that they've ever made by

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
first game that they've ever made by
themselves<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.219> assisted<00:02:02.790> with

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
themselves like they assisted with

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.429 
themselves like they assisted with
modern<00:02:03.299> warfare<00:02:03.450> 3<00:02:03.659> back<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.200> day<00:02:04.259> but

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
modern warfare 3 back in the day but

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.139 
modern warfare 3 back in the day but
they've<00:02:04.560> never<00:02:04.770> developed<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.520> call<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
they've never developed a call to the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.240 
they've never developed a call to the
game<00:02:06.270> entirely<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.290> themselves<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:07.920> they

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
game entirely by themselves like they

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.710 
game entirely by themselves like they
did<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.520> year<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.209> were<00:02:09.270> able<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.569> make

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720

direction are they gonna take it like

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.950 
direction are they gonna take it like
nobody<00:02:37.620> really<00:02:37.710> knows<00:02:38.520> we<00:02:38.880> could<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.240> further

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
nobody really knows we could go further

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.470 
nobody really knows we could go further
into<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> future<00:02:40.980> where<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.000> pretty<00:02:42.300> much

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
into the future where it's pretty much

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.210 
into the future where it's pretty much
you<00:02:42.600> know<00:02:42.720> like<00:02:42.900> space<00:02:43.260> warfare<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:44.190> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
you know like space warfare like a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.000 
you know like space warfare like a
almost<00:02:45.090> halo<00:02:45.630> ask<00:02:45.930> her<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.380> know<00:02:46.470> Star<00:02:46.740> Trek

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
almost halo ask her you know Star Trek

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.160 
almost halo ask her you know Star Trek
ask<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.520> sense<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:48.270> could<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.870> know<00:02:48.900> could

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
ask in a sense we could you know could

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.590 
ask in a sense we could you know could
follow<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.800> with<00:02:50.580> we're<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.060> know<00:02:51.150> black<00:02:51.360> ops

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
follow up with we're you know black ops

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.450 
follow up with we're you know black ops
2<00:02:51.900> was<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.350> know<00:02:52.440> maybe<00:02:52.620> it's<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.100> around

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
2 was you know maybe it's like around

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.040 
2 was you know maybe it's like around
that<00:02:53.610> same<00:02:53.790> time<00:02:53.850> period<00:02:54.060> maybe<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.540> little<00:02:54.930> bit

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that same time period maybe a little bit

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.480 
that same time period maybe a little bit
more<00:02:55.350> into<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> future<00:02:55.740> than<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.370> it's

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
more into the future than that so it's

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.000 
more into the future than that so it's
kind<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.850> near-future<00:02:57.690> type<00:02:58.080> thing<00:02:58.320> we

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
kind of like a near-future type thing we

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.710 
kind of like a near-future type thing we
