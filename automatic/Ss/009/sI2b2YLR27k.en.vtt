like<00:00:51.540> ahead<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:51.960> DNA<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.400> design<00:00:53.580> of

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
like ahead of the DNA so the design of

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.880 
like ahead of the DNA so the design of
this<00:00:54.000> thing<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.720> unlike<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.229> DNA<00:00:55.589> it's

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this thing is not unlike the DNA it's

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.859 
this thing is not unlike the DNA it's
got<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> same<00:00:56.460> sort<00:00:56.790> of<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.510> talked<00:00:57.750> about

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
got the same sort of we talked about

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:58.850 
got the same sort of we talked about
this<00:00:58.019> i<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.260> know<00:00:58.290> how<00:00:58.379> many<00:00:58.440> times<00:00:58.589> you've

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
this i don't know how many times you've

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.740 
this i don't know how many times you've
got<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> display<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.790> then<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> middle

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
got the display and then in the middle

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.910 
got the display and then in the middle
is<00:01:00.869> the<00:01:00.900> battery<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:01.650> where<00:01:01.830> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
is the battery and that's where the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.250 
is the battery and that's where the
posterior<00:01:02.400> you<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.150> PCB<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> circuit

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
posterior you have the PCB the circuit

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.289 
posterior you have the PCB the circuit
boards<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.710> lets<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.970> cool

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
boards that lets you get really cool

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.080 
boards that lets you get really cool
teardrop<00:01:06.869> effect<00:01:07.340> now<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> see<00:01:08.670> these<00:01:08.820> white

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
teardrop effect now you see these white

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
teardrop effect now you see these white
lines<00:01:09.140> they<00:01:10.140> talk<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> their<00:01:10.680> presentation

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
lines they talk to their presentation

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.670 
lines they talk to their presentation
today<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.390> how<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.660> is<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> single

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
today but how this is actually a single

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800 
today but how this is actually a single
piece<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.010> aluminum<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.300> were<00:01:15.360> able<00:01:15.660> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
piece of aluminum but they were able to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
piece of aluminum but they were able to
mill<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.290> places<00:01:16.620> these<00:01:16.950> white<00:01:17.190> lines<00:01:17.220> have

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
mill out places these white lines have

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.070 
mill out places these white lines have
have<00:01:18.030> something<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.510> with<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.690> intent<00:01:18.990> as

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
have something to do with the intent as

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
have something to do with the intent as
it<00:01:19.230> gets<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> technical<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.580> is

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it gets kind of technical but this is

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
it gets kind of technical but this is
actually<00:01:20.910> all<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.630> piece<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.050> aluminum<00:01:22.500> I've

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
actually all one piece of aluminum I've

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
actually all one piece of aluminum I've
seen<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> process<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.790> used<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.120> it<00:01:24.240> it's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
seen the process that used to do it it's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.840 
seen the process that used to do it it's
really<00:01:24.540> really<00:01:24.780> cool<00:01:24.980> hardware<00:01:25.980> our<00:01:26.190> volume

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
really really cool hardware our volume

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.520 
really really cool hardware our volume
buttons<00:01:27.120> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.050> here's<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.380> power

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
buttons on the right so here's the power

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830 
buttons on the right so here's the power
button<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.480> kind<00:01:30.480> of<00:01:30.540> looks<00:01:30.690> like<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
button now it kind of looks like a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
button now it kind of looks like a
normal<00:01:31.020> power<00:01:31.320> button<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:31.890> also<00:01:32.040> serves

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
normal power button but it also serves

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.800 
normal power button but it also serves
as<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.650> infrared<00:01:34.650> port<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.790> sec<00:01:36.420> TV

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
as the infrared port for this a sec TV

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.720 
as the infrared port for this a sec TV
thing<00:01:37.080> it's<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:37.980> huge<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
thing it's not going to be huge in the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.490 
see it's only a three by four grid it's
very<00:02:59.300> very<00:02:59.540> simple<00:02:59.599> and<00:03:00.050> they're<00:03:00.170> doing<00:03:00.380> that

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500

camera of course is the big deal again a
total<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.890> four<00:04:02.099> megapixels<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:02.939> really<00:04:03.239> I

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
total of four megapixels but really I

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.699 
total of four megapixels but really I
shouldn't<00:04:03.780> even<00:04:03.959> say<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.319> number<00:04:04.470> out<00:04:04.560> loud

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
shouldn't even say that number out loud

shouldn't even say that number out loud
because<00:04:05.129> we're<00:04:05.489> talking<00:04:05.790> ultrapixels<00:04:06.599> here
