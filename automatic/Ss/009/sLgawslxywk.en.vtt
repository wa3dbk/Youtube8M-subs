00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
these are sets of wires is where you're

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.239 
these are sets of wires is where you're
going<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.530> 12<00:00:55.769> volts<00:00:58.129> actually<00:00:59.129> it's

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
going to get your 12 volts actually it's

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:04.070 
going to get your 12 volts actually it's
the<00:00:59.399> longest<00:00:59.760> set<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:02.149> it's<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.480> yellow<00:01:03.749> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the longest set and it's the yellow and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.110 
the longest set and it's the yellow and
I<00:01:04.199> found<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> yellow<00:01:04.980> and<00:01:05.280> black<00:01:05.460> wires<00:01:05.790> where

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
I found the yellow and black wires where

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.500 
I found the yellow and black wires where
I<00:01:06.150> got<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.540> 12<00:01:06.810> volts<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.230> in<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.510> it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
I got my 12 volts from in this one it's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
I got my 12 volts from in this one it's
probably<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> same<00:01:10.230> in<00:01:10.440> most<00:01:10.620> of<00:01:10.920> them<00:01:11.070> these

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
probably the same in most of them these

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.230 
probably the same in most of them these
are<00:01:11.970> pretty<00:01:12.240> standard<00:01:14.869> other<00:01:15.869> than<00:01:16.049> maybe

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
are pretty standard other than maybe

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.569 
are pretty standard other than maybe
Macintosh<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.600> Apple<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.020> something<00:01:19.579> anyway

you've got under large pen set you've
got<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.909> green<00:01:24.210> wire<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.719> this<00:01:24.930> whole<00:01:25.140> pen<00:01:25.409> set

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
got one green wire on this whole pen set

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.240 
got one green wire on this whole pen set
and<00:01:26.899> right<00:01:27.899> next<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> black<00:01:28.950> wire

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and right next to it is the black wire

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.490 
and right next to it is the black wire
there's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> couple<00:01:30.329> there<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.110> use

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
there's a couple there but I just use

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.580 
there's a couple there but I just use
the<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:32.009> next<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:34.320> clip

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the one right next to it you just clip

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
the one right next to it you just clip
those<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.240> two<00:01:36.450> wires<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.930> need

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
those and that's the two wires you need

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.980 
those and that's the two wires you need
right<00:01:37.289> here

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
right here

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.020 
right here
also<00:01:39.990> salvaged<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.710> switch<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
also salvaged this switch out of the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.850 
also salvaged this switch out of the
computer<00:01:42.509> too<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:45.780> show<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.020> how<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.530> how<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
computer too to show you how to how to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.370 
computer too to show you how to how to
use<00:01:47.039> it<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:48.119> problem<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
use it the problem is it's just a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.139 
use it the problem is it's just a
momentary<00:01:49.829> switch<00:01:50.130> which<00:01:50.610> means<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.969> have<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
momentary switch which means I have to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.670 
momentary switch which means I have to
hold<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:52.609> but<00:01:53.750> for<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.930> purposes<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
hold it in but for the purposes of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.870 
hold it in but for the purposes of
showing<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> will<00:01:57.090> work<00:01:58.880> also

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
showing you this that it will work also

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
showing you this that it will work also

way<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:54.489> I'm<00:02:55.489> going<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.700> hold<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.970> switch<00:02:56.180> in

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
way and I'm going to hold the switch in

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.949 
way and I'm going to hold the switch in
I<00:03:01.000> don't<00:03:02.000> know<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.360> can<00:03:02.450> see<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.720> or<00:03:02.840> not

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
I don't know if you can see it or not

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.800 
I don't know if you can see it or not
but<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:07.099> little<00:03:07.370> power<00:03:07.519> lights<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.209> there

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
but the little power lights on there

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.220 
but the little power lights on there
also<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.670> switch<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.239> one<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> LEDs

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
also on the switch is one of the LEDs

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.210 
also on the switch is one of the LEDs
lit<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:15.230> we're<00:03:15.380> going<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.590> hold<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.830> button<00:03:16.100> in

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
lit so we're going to hold the button in

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:25.600 
lit so we're going to hold the button in
and<00:03:16.519> there's<00:03:17.030> our<00:03:17.209> 12<00:03:17.480> volts<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:25.400> that

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
and there's our 12 volts it's that

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.199 
and there's our 12 volts it's that
simple

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
simple

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.539 
simple
they're<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:26.750> 2<00:03:26.989> hours<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.500> clip<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:28.340> put<00:03:28.519> a

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
they're just 2 hours you clip to put a

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.339 
they're just 2 hours you clip to put a
switch<00:03:28.819> on<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.390> could<00:03:29.540> actually<00:03:29.750> jump<00:03:30.170> those

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
switch on you could actually jump those

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.440 
switch on you could actually jump those
2<00:03:30.620> hours<00:03:30.650> together<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.610> just<00:03:31.790> plug<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.269> and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
2 hours together and just plug it in and

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.900 
2 hours together and just plug it in and
put<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:32.780> unplug<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.890> turn<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.580> power<00:03:34.760> on

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
put in unplug it to turn the power on

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.630 
put in unplug it to turn the power on
and<00:03:35.239> off<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.330> simple

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
and off it's that simple

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.310 
and off it's that simple
so<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.890> then<00:03:43.040> all<00:03:43.340> I'm<00:03:43.519> going<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.330> do<00:03:44.480> is

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.259 

unplug<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.650> for<00:03:48.799> now<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.280> let<00:03:49.579> my<00:03:49.730> lead<00:03:49.940> -<00:03:50.090> don't

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
unplug it for now so let my lead - don't

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.949 
unplug it for now so let my lead - don't
touch<00:03:51.489> also<00:03:52.489> this<00:03:52.700> thing<00:03:52.880> has<00:03:53.150> capacitors<00:03:53.780> in

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
touch also this thing has capacitors in

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.569 
touch also this thing has capacitors in
it<00:03:54.079> so<00:03:54.260> won't<00:03:54.380> even<00:03:54.709> once<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:54.950> unplug<00:03:55.370> it

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
it so won't even once you unplug it

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.009 
it so won't even once you unplug it
there's<00:03:55.790> still<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:56.090> little<00:03:58.569> power<00:03:59.569> left<00:03:59.870> in

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
there's still a little power left in

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.210 
there's still a little power left in
them<00:04:00.200> capacitors<00:04:00.859> until<00:04:01.190> it's<00:04:01.340> drained<00:04:01.640> off

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
them capacitors until it's drained off

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.300 
them capacitors until it's drained off
so<00:04:04.220> I'll<00:04:04.280> just<00:04:04.750> that<00:04:05.750> led<00:04:06.260> they<00:04:06.920> don't<00:04:07.100> take

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
so I'll just that led they don't take

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.819 
so I'll just that led they don't take
much<00:04:07.489> power<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:08.000> power<00:04:08.150> those<00:04:08.450> either<00:04:08.750> so

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.120 

eventually<00:04:15.829> there<00:04:16.250> goes<00:04:17.320> now<00:04:18.320> all<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.739> powers

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
eventually there goes now all the powers

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:28.189 
eventually there goes now all the powers
drained<00:04:19.459> out<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:25.010> we'll<00:04:25.160> unhook<00:04:25.520> these

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.100 

and<00:04:29.340> something<00:04:30.340> I'm<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:31.120> know<00:04:31.240> just<00:04:31.570> bundle

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
and something I'm you know just bundle

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.960 
and something I'm you know just bundle
all<00:04:32.260> these<00:04:32.470> wires<00:04:32.770> up<00:04:33.070> here<00:04:33.310> night<00:04:33.729> with<00:04:33.910> a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
all these wires up here night with a

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.320 
all these wires up here night with a
nice<00:04:34.150> little<00:04:34.330> bundle<00:04:34.630> on<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.990> back<00:04:36.180> just<00:04:37.180> put

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
nice little bundle on the back just put

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.280 
nice little bundle on the back just put
some<00:04:37.479> tape<00:04:37.510> across<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:39.720> I'm<00:04:40.720> probably<00:04:40.990> going

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
some tape across it I'm probably going

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.350 
some tape across it I'm probably going
to<00:04:41.350> once<00:04:42.040> I'll<00:04:42.160> get<00:04:42.310> another<00:04:42.400> switch<00:04:42.910> I'm<00:04:43.210> just

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
to once I'll get another switch I'm just

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.450 
to once I'll get another switch I'm just
going<00:04:43.540> out<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.720> switch<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:44.979> front<00:04:45.160> right

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
going out to switch to the front right

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.710 
going out to switch to the front right
here<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:47.880> have<00:04:48.880> me<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.090> neat<00:04:49.300> little<00:04:49.479> power

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
here and have me a neat little power

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.770 
here and have me a neat little power
supply<00:04:50.139> for<00:04:51.070> backup<00:04:51.520> use<00:04:51.820> or<00:04:52.090> for<00:04:52.120> permanent

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
supply for backup use or for permanent

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.920 
supply for backup use or for permanent
use<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:53.970> wouldn't<00:04:54.970> maybe<00:04:55.240> use<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:55.690> on<00:04:55.780> my

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
use on I wouldn't maybe use it on my

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.920 
use on I wouldn't maybe use it on my
best<00:04:56.139> radios<00:04:56.680> but<00:04:57.610> if<00:04:57.729> I<00:04:57.850> had<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.030> little<00:04:58.540> radio

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
best radios but if I had a little radio

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.689 
best radios but if I had a little radio
sitting<00:04:59.320> around<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.740> needed<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.190> little<00:05:00.400> power

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
sitting around and needed a little power

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.350 
sitting around and needed a little power
it<00:05:01.330> would<00:05:01.660> be<00:05:01.720> perfect<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:03.460> I'll<00:05:03.910> post<00:05:04.180> some

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
it would be perfect so I'll post some

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.570 
it would be perfect so I'll post some
links<00:05:04.539> below<00:05:04.840> on<00:05:05.380> some<00:05:05.680> other<00:05:05.919> equipment<00:05:06.220> you

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
links below on some other equipment you

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.370 
links below on some other equipment you
can<00:05:06.760> use<00:05:06.789> along<00:05:07.270> with<00:05:07.300> these<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.990> filter<00:05:08.350> noise

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
can use along with these to filter noise

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.290 
can use along with these to filter noise
and<00:05:09.010> such<00:05:09.190> if<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.520> have<00:05:09.639> any<00:05:09.820> problems<00:05:10.210> with

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
and such if you have any problems with

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.060 
and such if you have any problems with
that<00:05:13.229> for<00:05:14.229> the<00:05:14.320> most<00:05:14.470> part<00:05:14.620> you<00:05:14.919> probably

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
that for the most part you probably

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.840 
that for the most part you probably
won't

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
won't

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.529 
won't
there's<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:17.710> just<00:05:18.190> depends<00:05:18.699> on<00:05:18.789> your<00:05:18.850> radios<00:05:19.330> I

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
there's it just depends on your radios I

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.140 
there's it just depends on your radios I
think<00:05:19.810> maybe<00:05:20.080> not<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.800> HF<00:05:21.280> radios<00:05:21.820> you

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
think maybe not the HF radios you

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.460 
think maybe not the HF radios you
probably<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.660> might<00:05:22.840> have<00:05:23.050> a<00:05:23.080> little<00:05:23.260> more

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
probably you might have a little more

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.779 
probably you might have a little more
noise<00:05:24.780> but<00:05:25.860> instead<00:05:26.860> of<00:05:26.919> throwing<00:05:27.100> stuff<00:05:27.610> away

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
noise but instead of throwing stuff away

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.560 
noise but instead of throwing stuff away
we<00:05:28.180> use<00:05:28.389> it<00:05:30.330> okay

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
we use it okay

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.490 
we use it okay
for<00:05:32.560> demonstration<00:05:33.190> purposes<00:05:33.760> I'm<00:05:34.320> going<00:05:35.320> to

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
for demonstration purposes I'm going to

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.980 
for demonstration purposes I'm going to
go<00:05:35.620> ahead<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:36.010> hook<00:05:36.130> up<00:05:36.340> these<00:05:36.910> two<00:05:37.150> radios<00:05:37.570> to

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
go ahead and hook up these two radios to

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.750 
go ahead and hook up these two radios to
the<00:05:38.110> power<00:05:38.320> supply<00:05:40.349> it's<00:05:41.349> a<00:05:41.620> first<00:05:42.190> off<00:05:42.430> it's

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
the power supply it's a first off it's

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.350 
the power supply it's a first off it's
an<00:05:42.880> ax<00:05:42.940> link<00:05:43.180> odr<00:05:43.780> 605<00:05:44.560> dual<00:05:44.979> band<00:05:47.340> 2<00:05:48.340> meter<00:05:48.580> 70

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
an ax link odr 605 dual band 2 meter 70

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.870 
an ax link odr 605 dual band 2 meter 70
centimeter<00:05:49.750> radio<00:05:50.110> then<00:05:50.919> we've<00:05:51.070> got<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.520> ocv

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
centimeter radio then we've got the ocv

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.710 
centimeter radio then we've got the ocv
and<00:05:55.590> these<00:05:56.590> are<00:05:56.919> the<00:05:57.639> wires<00:05:57.849> it's<00:05:58.389> kind<00:05:58.599> of<00:05:58.630> a

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
and these are the wires it's kind of a

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.180 
and these are the wires it's kind of a
mess<00:05:58.930> but<00:05:59.710> they're<00:05:59.889> all<00:06:00.039> hooked<00:06:00.570> together

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
mess but they're all hooked together

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.150 
mess but they're all hooked together
like<00:06:03.190> they<00:06:03.340> should<00:06:03.520> be<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:05.770> we're<00:06:05.949> going<00:06:06.099> to

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
like they should be and we're going to

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.640 
like they should be and we're going to
power<00:06:06.340> it<00:06:06.460> up

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.439 

all<00:06:13.100> right<00:06:13.370> you<00:06:13.460> see<00:06:13.639> they're<00:06:13.820> both<00:06:13.940> on<00:06:14.210> or

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
all right you see they're both on or

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:24.600 
all right you see they're both on or
anything<00:06:14.720> I<00:06:14.840> already<00:06:15.169> had<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:15.380> power<00:06:15.560> on<00:06:15.830> two

right with it on roll head key that one

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.740 
right with it on roll head key that one
this<00:06:38.180> one's<00:06:38.419> messed<00:06:38.690> up<00:06:40.270> I'm<00:06:41.270> not<00:06:41.449> too<00:06:41.600> wire

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
this one's messed up I'm not too wire

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:57.090 
this one's messed up I'm not too wire
loose

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.040 

my<00:06:58.100> mics<00:06:58.370> messed<00:06:58.670> up<00:06:58.910> on<00:06:59.090> the<00:06:59.270> dual-band<00:06:59.690> so<00:07:00.020> I

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
my mics messed up on the dual-band so I

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.370 
my mics messed up on the dual-band so I
can't<00:07:00.350> really<00:07:00.560> talk<00:07:00.830> on<00:07:01.100> it<00:07:01.130> so<00:07:01.490> I<00:07:01.550> can<00:07:02.380> they

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
can't really talk on it so I can they

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.490 
can't really talk on it so I can they
will<00:07:03.590> keep<00:07:03.800> it's<00:07:04.900> not<00:07:05.900> two<00:07:06.110> meter<00:07:06.380> over

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
will keep it's not two meter over

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.430 
will keep it's not two meter over
they're<00:07:06.740> sticking<00:07:07.100> to<00:07:07.870> feedback<00:07:08.870> tur<00:07:09.110> that

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
they're sticking to feedback tur that

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.310 
they're sticking to feedback tur that
wasn't<00:07:10.340> feedback<00:07:10.730> from<00:07:10.910> the<00:07:11.030> trance<00:07:11.270> from<00:07:12.200> the

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
wasn't feedback from the trance from the

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.090 
wasn't feedback from the trance from the
power<00:07:12.500> supply<00:07:12.890> that<00:07:13.190> was<00:07:14.320> my<00:07:15.320> other<00:07:15.560> radio

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.100 
power supply that was my other radio

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.910 
power supply that was my other radio
right<00:07:16.430> there<00:07:17.410> because<00:07:18.410> they<00:07:18.650> were<00:07:18.710> both

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:18.920 
right there because they were both

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.860 
right there because they were both
sitting<00:07:19.220> on<00:07:19.370> the<00:07:19.490> same<00:07:19.700> station<00:07:20.000> same

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
sitting on the same station same

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:27.580 
sitting on the same station same
frequency<00:07:25.420> but<00:07:26.420> I<00:07:26.480> just<00:07:27.020> wanted<00:07:27.230> to<00:07:27.350> show<00:07:27.530> you

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
frequency but I just wanted to show you

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.920 
frequency but I just wanted to show you
a<00:07:27.770> power<00:07:28.040> and<00:07:28.220> a<00:07:28.250> couple<00:07:28.460> items<00:07:28.700> at<00:07:29.060> once<00:07:29.270> so

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:29.930 
a power and a couple items at once so

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.690 
a power and a couple items at once so
there<00:07:30.230> we<00:07:30.350> go

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:30.700
