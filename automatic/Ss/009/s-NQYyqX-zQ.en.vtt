here<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.770> 3d<00:01:53.399> model<00:01:53.670> basically<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.630> how

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
here we have a 3d model basically of how

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.590 
here we have a 3d model basically of how
this<00:01:55.590> new<00:01:55.770> iphone<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.479> see

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
this new iphone would be you can see

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.090 
this new iphone would be you can see
that<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.960> also<00:01:58.110> replace<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.890> dock

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that they also replace the dock

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.270 
that they also replace the dock
connector<00:01:59.579> with<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.390> smaller<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:01.280> as

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
connector with a little smaller one as

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.830 
connector with a little smaller one as
you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.450> we've<00:02:03.630> heard

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you can see here because we've heard

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.719 
you can see here because we've heard
these<00:02:03.990> rumors<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.439> Apple<00:02:04.799> could<00:02:05.009> go<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
these rumors that Apple could go to a

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.619 
these rumors that Apple could go to a
smaller<00:02:06.170> dock<00:02:07.170> connector<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> future<00:02:08.629> but

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
smaller dock connector in the future but

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.910 
smaller dock connector in the future but
overall<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.530> big<00:02:10.709> thing<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.250> basically<00:02:11.849> that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
overall the big thing is basically that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.180 
overall the big thing is basically that
that<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.760> would<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.209> longer<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.170> also<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.069> it

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
that it would be longer and also that it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.130 
that it would be longer and also that it
would<00:02:16.310> have<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:16.640> metal<00:02:17.030> back<00:02:17.270> on<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.989> other

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
would have this metal back on the other

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.199 
would have this metal back on the other
side<00:02:18.560> basically<00:02:19.040> but<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.459> can't<00:02:19.640> see<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.940> here

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
side basically but you can't see it here

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.750 
side basically but you can't see it here
but<00:02:20.239> in<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:21.080> in<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.560> middle<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.250> back<00:02:22.459> it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
but in the in the middle on the back it

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.080 
but in the in the middle on the back it
would<00:02:22.849> have<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.300> kind<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:23.959> real<00:02:24.640> metal<00:02:25.640> or

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
would have that kind of real metal or

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.780 
would have that kind of real metal or
aluminum<00:02:26.810> or<00:02:27.410> whatever<00:02:27.950> they<00:02:28.160> know<00:02:28.370> reducing

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
aluminum or whatever they know reducing

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.990 
aluminum or whatever they know reducing
I<00:02:29.239> don't<00:02:30.080> think<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.380> would<00:02:30.620> do<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:30.800> okay<00:02:31.730> I

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
I don't think I would do that okay I

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.270 
I don't think I would do that okay I
don't<00:02:32.390> think<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:33.319> would<00:02:33.530> use<00:02:33.739> make<00:02:33.920> device

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
don't think they would use make device

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.400 
don't think they would use make device
taller<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.090> have<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.390> same<00:02:35.569> for<00:02:35.810> writer<00:02:36.080> and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
taller and have the same for writer and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.199 
taller and have the same for writer and
as<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.709> said<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.010> feels<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:37.430> if<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.910> would

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
as I said it feels like if I would

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.660 
as I said it feels like if I would
increase<00:02:38.840> increase<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.590> screen<00:02:39.890> size<00:02:40.340> they

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
increase increase the screen size they

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.250 
increase increase the screen size they
would<00:02:40.880> first<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.480> all<00:02:41.569> make<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.780> new<00:02:41.989> form

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
would first of all make a new form

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.800 
would first of all make a new form
factor<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.890> make<00:02:43.880> like<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> little<00:02:44.300> thinner

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
factor and make like a little thinner

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
factor and make like a little thinner
baby<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.790> then<00:02:47.330> they<00:02:47.569> would<00:02:47.870> basically<00:02:48.290> make

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
baby and then they would basically make

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.259 
baby and then they would basically make
a<00:02:49.250> big<00:02:49.519> screen<00:02:50.890> yes<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.819> I'll<00:02:52.940> make<00:02:53.209> it

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
a big screen yes but I'll make it

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.780 
a big screen yes but I'll make it
extremely<00:02:53.810> much<00:02:54.019> bigger<00:02:54.319> as<00:02:54.709> we<00:02:55.340> haven't<00:02:55.610> seen

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
extremely much bigger as we haven't seen

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.590 
extremely much bigger as we haven't seen
many<00:02:56.299> times<00:02:56.600> basically<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:59.060> sure<00:02:59.480> what

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
many times basically I'm sure what

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.630 
many times basically I'm sure what
happened<00:02:59.780> to<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.290> page<00:03:00.530> right<00:03:00.709> now<00:03:00.769> but<00:03:01.160> it

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
happened to this page right now but it

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.820 
happened to this page right now but it
seems<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.000> disappeared<00:03:02.540> okay<00:03:03.530> that's

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
seems like it disappeared okay that's

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.380 
seems like it disappeared okay that's
