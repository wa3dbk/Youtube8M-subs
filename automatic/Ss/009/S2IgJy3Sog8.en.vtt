have this container right here and this
is<00:02:13.230> what

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
is what

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.600 
is what
you<00:02:14.660> would<00:02:14.900> put<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.740> UM<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.099> would<00:02:16.250> there's<00:02:16.520> a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
you would put the UM you would there's a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.850 
you would put the UM you would there's a
twist-off<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.240> here<00:02:17.390> -<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.840> twist<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.680> top

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
twist-off on here - so you twist the top

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.690 
twist-off on here - so you twist the top
off<00:02:19.099> then<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.330> go<00:02:20.510> ahead<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.930> put<00:02:21.700> squeeze

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
off then you go ahead and put squeeze

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.600 
off then you go ahead and put squeeze
this<00:02:22.970> which<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.660> developer<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.610> step

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
this which is the developer and step

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.949 
this which is the developer and step
number<00:02:25.819> one<00:02:26.380> into<00:02:27.380> here<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.810> go

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
number one into here and then you go

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.960 
number one into here and then you go
ahead<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.680> add<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.819> arm<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:33.410> colorant<00:02:33.970> which

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
ahead and add the arm the colorant which

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.990 
ahead and add the arm the colorant which
is<00:02:35.150> number<00:02:35.300> two<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.560> have<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.580> a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
is number two and so you have this in a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.059 
is number two and so you have this in a
um<00:02:39.940> tube<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.680> more<00:02:42.890> like

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
um tube like that and this is more like

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.150 
um tube like that and this is more like
in<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.400> plastic<00:02:44.300> container<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:44.989> then<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.890> kind

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
in a plastic container and then you kind

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.790 
in a plastic container and then you kind
of<00:02:46.280> just<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.700> ahead<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.360> shake<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.810> up<00:02:47.930> and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
of just go ahead and shake it up and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.220 
of just go ahead and shake it up and
usually<00:02:49.280> when<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.910> here<00:02:50.239> guys<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.840> have

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
usually when I have here guys I have

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.229 
usually when I have here guys I have
clear<00:02:51.590> words<00:02:51.920> but<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.670> one<00:02:53.030> has

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
clear words but I like that this one has

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.699 
clear words but I like that this one has
black<00:02:53.450> gloves<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.959> don't<00:02:54.140> know<00:02:54.200> why<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.410> like<00:02:54.680> it

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
black gloves I don't know why I like it

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.240 
black gloves I don't know why I like it
I<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:54.950> like<00:02:55.420> having<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.510> black<00:02:56.600> glove<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:58.010> I

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
I just like having a black glove and I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.220 
I just like having a black glove and I
guess<00:02:58.459> because<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:59.150> will<00:02:59.330> kind<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:01.989> not<00:03:02.989> show

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
guess because it will kind of not show

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.380 
guess because it will kind of not show
the<00:03:03.470> messiness<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.400> can't<00:03:04.910> really<00:03:05.120> see

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
the messiness so you can't really see

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.690 
the messiness so you can't really see
that<00:03:05.420> dye<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:05.900> everywhere<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.010> basically<00:03:07.430> you

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
that dye is everywhere so basically you

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.520 
that dye is everywhere so basically you
put<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.910> glove<00:03:08.209> on<00:03:08.420> put<00:03:08.780> your<00:03:08.810> finger<00:03:09.260> on<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
put the glove on put your finger on the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.520 
put the glove on put your finger on the
top<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.100> make<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.390> go<00:03:11.720> like<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.080> make<00:03:12.380> sure

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
minutes well that's what I didn't like

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.219

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
when I put this conditioner on it didn't

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.690 
when I put this conditioner on it didn't
feel<00:05:17.320> like<00:05:17.470> it's<00:05:17.680> soft<00:05:17.919> in<00:05:18.070> my<00:05:18.100> hair

feel like it's soft in my hair

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.250 
feel like it's soft in my hair
so<00:05:18.850> like<00:05:19.030> it<00:05:19.180> did<00:05:19.300> not<00:05:19.419> bring<00:05:19.660> my<00:05:19.900> pH<00:05:20.229> balance

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
so like it did not bring my pH balance

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.230 
so like it did not bring my pH balance
back<00:05:20.860> or<00:05:21.010> anything<00:05:21.190> like<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:21.430> comes<00:05:22.090> with

so what I ended up doing was putting

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.750 
so what I ended up doing was putting
this<00:05:27.100> on<00:05:27.310> and<00:05:27.700> for<00:05:28.240> the<00:05:28.630> sake<00:05:28.840> of<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:29.139> kid<00:05:29.760> you

this on and for the sake of the kid you
know<00:05:30.880> kind<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.240> sometimes<00:05:31.570> when<00:05:31.780> you<00:05:31.870> have

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.870 
know kind of sometimes when you have
kids<00:05:32.289> you<00:05:32.410> kind<00:05:32.680> of<00:05:32.740> have<00:05:32.860> to<00:05:32.890> use<00:05:33.250> all<00:05:33.550> of<00:05:33.580> the

kids you kind of have to use all of the
same<00:05:34.090> product<00:05:34.570> I<00:05:34.930> guess<00:05:35.260> they<00:05:35.470> have<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:36.250> end

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610

same product I guess they have the end
result<00:05:37.030> so<00:05:37.660> I<00:05:37.690> put<00:05:37.930> this<00:05:38.050> in<00:05:38.289> but<00:05:38.560> then<00:05:38.740> since<00:05:39.010> I

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
result so I put this in but then since I

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.560 
result so I put this in but then since I
knew<00:05:39.340> that<00:05:39.580> I<00:05:39.789> was<00:05:40.210> going<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.390> have<00:05:40.539> that

knew that I was going to have that

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.930 
knew that I was going to have that
little<00:05:40.900> sensitivity<00:05:41.380> going<00:05:41.770> on<00:05:41.919> I<00:05:42.220> said<00:05:42.700> well
