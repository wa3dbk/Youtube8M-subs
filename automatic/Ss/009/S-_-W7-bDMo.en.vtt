a<00:00:39.059> lot<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> points<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.840> put<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.260> much

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a lot of points they put very much

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.840 
a lot of points they put very much
pressure<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> edges<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:41.610> strip

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
pressure in the edges and it will strip

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.389 
pressure in the edges and it will strip
the<00:00:42.030> bolt<00:00:42.239> instead<00:00:43.110> use<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> quality<00:00:43.710> six-point

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to fill about one and a third of these

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
to fill about one and a third of these
cups<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.880> some<00:01:12.090> point<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.750> during<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
cups so at some point here during the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.420 
cups so at some point here during the
procedure<00:01:13.470> you're<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.250> need<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
procedure you're just going to need to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
procedure you're just going to need to
make<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> swap<00:01:15.030> maybe<00:01:15.659> when<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> first<00:01:16.140> cup<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
make a swap maybe when the first cup is

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.929 
make a swap maybe when the first cup is
about<00:01:16.619> two-thirds<00:01:17.100> full<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:19.549> then<00:01:20.549> simply

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
about two-thirds full and then simply

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:32.740 
about two-thirds full and then simply
pour<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> cup<00:01:22.020> into<00:01:22.380> an<00:01:22.500> oil<00:01:22.680> pan<00:01:22.979> here

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.900 

and<00:01:32.840> as<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.470> last<00:01:33.620> the<00:01:33.950> oil<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.370> draining<00:01:34.670> out

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
and as the last the oil is draining out

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.090 
and as the last the oil is draining out
here<00:01:35.240> it's<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:36.020> good<00:01:36.170> idea<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.470> clean<00:01:36.800> up<00:01:36.980> the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
here it's a good idea to clean up the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.890 
here it's a good idea to clean up the
drain<00:01:37.340> bolt<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.790> just<00:01:37.820> remove<00:01:38.270> any<00:01:38.480> excess

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
drain bolt and just remove any excess

drain bolt and just remove any excess
oil<00:01:39.080> just<00:01:39.830> take<00:01:39.980> a<00:01:40.010> paper<00:01:40.310> towel<00:01:40.580> wipe<00:01:41.510> off<00:01:41.660> the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
oil just take a paper towel wipe off the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.900 
oil just take a paper towel wipe off the
excess<00:01:42.140> oil<00:01:42.350> make<00:01:42.920> sure<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.190> washer<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.700> good

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
and clean it's also a good idea to go

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.840 
and clean it's also a good idea to go
underneath<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.170> bike<00:01:48.350> here<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:48.800> remove<00:01:49.640> any
