their<00:02:58.930> abdomen<00:02:59.410> looks<00:02:59.620> for<00:02:59.770> signs<00:02:59.890> of

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
their abdomen looks for signs of

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.390 
their abdomen looks for signs of
infection<00:03:00.870> obstruction<00:03:01.870> perforation<00:03:02.860> trauma

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
infection obstruction perforation trauma

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.460 
infection obstruction perforation trauma
maybe<00:03:04.000> they<00:03:04.209> have<00:03:04.360> distension<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.050> bruising

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
maybe they have distension and bruising

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.199 
maybe they have distension and bruising
could<00:03:05.770> indicate<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.190> ruptured<00:03:06.580> triple-a<00:03:07.000> and

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
could indicate a ruptured triple-a and

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.970 
could indicate a ruptured triple-a and
their<00:03:07.540> heart<00:03:07.750> make<00:03:08.080> sure<00:03:08.230> they<00:03:08.410> look<00:03:08.770> for

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
their heart make sure they look for

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.949 
their heart make sure they look for
signs<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.310> arrhythmia<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.090> their<00:03:10.420> skin<00:03:10.660> exam

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
signs of arrhythmia and their skin exam

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.690 
signs of arrhythmia and their skin exam
can<00:03:11.140> be<00:03:11.170> really<00:03:11.620> helpful<00:03:11.770> as<00:03:12.070> well<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.520> here

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
can be really helpful as well so here

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.640 
can be really helpful as well so here
you're<00:03:12.880> looking<00:03:13.090> for<00:03:13.270> trauma<00:03:13.540> signs<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.590> a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
you're looking for trauma signs of a

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.680 
you're looking for trauma signs of a
toxidrome<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:16.000> can<00:03:16.150> also<00:03:16.270> check<00:03:16.510> their

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
toxidrome you can also check their

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.449 
toxidrome you can also check their
hydration<00:03:16.989> status<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.709> if<00:03:17.890> they<00:03:18.010> seem<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.340> be

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
hydration status so if they seem to be

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.490 
hydration status so if they seem to be
in<00:03:18.610> shock<00:03:18.910> or<00:03:19.120> check<00:03:19.360> their<00:03:19.540> temperature<00:03:19.690> look

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
in shock or check their temperature look

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.410 
in shock or check their temperature look
for<00:03:20.680> signs<00:03:20.830> of<00:03:20.950> blood<00:03:21.190> loss<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.239> get

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
for signs of blood loss and you can get

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.970 
for signs of blood loss and you can get
past<00:03:22.720> medical<00:03:22.900> history<00:03:23.110> like<00:03:23.709> if<00:03:23.830> they're

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
past medical history like if they're

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.920 
past medical history like if they're
jaundiced<00:03:24.400> or<00:03:24.550> have<00:03:24.640> edema<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.480> can<00:03:25.600> also<00:03:25.720> get

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
jaundiced or have edema you can also get

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.930 
jaundiced or have edema you can also get
some<00:03:25.959> social<00:03:26.410> history<00:03:26.739> here<00:03:26.980> maybe<00:03:27.670> they<00:03:27.820> have

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
some social history here maybe they have

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.880 
some social history here maybe they have
track<00:03:28.180> marks<00:03:28.480> now<00:03:28.900> for<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.200> differential<00:03:29.560> we

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
track marks now for the differential we

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.210 
track marks now for the differential we
use<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.400> mnemonic<00:03:31.050> AEIOU<00:03:32.050> tips<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.950> help<00:03:33.100> us

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
use this mnemonic AEIOU tips to help us

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.740 
use this mnemonic AEIOU tips to help us
think<00:03:33.459> through<00:03:33.580> this<00:03:34.000> really<00:03:34.450> big

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
think through this really big

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.270 
think through this really big
differential<00:03:35.410> for<00:03:35.560> altered<00:03:35.590> mental<00:03:36.130> status

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
differential for altered mental status

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.449 
differential for altered mental status
so<00:03:36.970> here's<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.209> table<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.630> has<00:03:37.780> AEIOU<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.920> off

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
so here's a table that has AEIOU and off

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.830 
so here's a table that has AEIOU and off
to<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.640> side<00:03:39.730> here<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> have<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.420> list<00:03:40.690> of

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
to the side here I have a list of

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.150 
to the side here I have a list of
different<00:03:41.140> testing<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.650> might<00:03:41.800> be<00:03:41.920> helpful

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
different testing that might be helpful

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.729 
different testing that might be helpful
for<00:03:42.459> each<00:03:42.550> of<00:03:42.730> them<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.420> stands<00:03:43.959> for<00:03:44.080> alcohol

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
for each of them so a stands for alcohol

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.650 
for each of them so a stands for alcohol
or<00:03:45.010> ammonia<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.700> meaning<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.150> hepatic

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
or ammonia so meaning a hepatic

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.690 
or ammonia so meaning a hepatic
encephalopathy<00:03:46.980> for<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.430> gonna<00:03:48.519> be

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
encephalopathy for a it's gonna be

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.009 
encephalopathy for a it's gonna be
electrolyte<00:03:49.269> or<00:03:49.480> under<00:03:49.810> current

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
electrolyte or under current

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.509 
electrolyte or under current
abnormalities<00:03:50.650> there's<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.920> lot<00:03:51.100> of<00:03:51.220> different

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
abnormalities there's a lot of different

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.190 
abnormalities there's a lot of different
ones<00:03:51.640> there<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:51.940> can<00:03:52.269> cause<00:03:52.510> altered<00:03:52.900> Mental

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
ones there that can cause altered Mental

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.140 
ones there that can cause altered Mental
Status<00:03:53.230> but<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.459> can<00:03:54.760> think<00:03:54.970> through

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
Status but I you can think through

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.120 
Status but I you can think through
different<00:03:55.209> iatrogenic<00:03:55.840> causes<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:56.769> for

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
different iatrogenic causes so for

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.509 
different iatrogenic causes so for
medication<00:03:57.910> levels<00:03:58.269> or<00:03:58.620> toxicology<00:03:59.620> Oh<00:03:59.830> is

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
medication levels or toxicology Oh is

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.430 
medication levels or toxicology Oh is
gonna<00:04:00.700> be<00:04:00.880> for<00:04:01.180> opioid<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:01.959> for<00:04:02.110> example

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
gonna be for opioid so for example

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.710 
gonna be for opioid so for example
heroin<00:04:02.769> overdose<00:04:03.250> our<00:04:03.489> oxygen<00:04:03.850> meaning

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
heroin overdose our oxygen meaning

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.540 
heroin overdose our oxygen meaning
either<00:04:05.019> just<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.350> primary<00:04:05.739> hypoxia<00:04:06.280> or<00:04:06.370> maybe

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
either just a primary hypoxia or maybe

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.800 
either just a primary hypoxia or maybe
they've<00:04:06.730> had<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:06.880> carbon<00:04:07.209> monoxide<00:04:07.660> exposure

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
they've had a carbon monoxide exposure

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.440 
they've had a carbon monoxide exposure
and<00:04:08.320> you've<00:04:08.920> stands<00:04:09.250> for<00:04:09.519> uremia<00:04:09.880> we<00:04:10.330> can

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
and you've stands for uremia we can

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.050 
and you've stands for uremia we can
check<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.630> b-1<00:04:11.080> level<00:04:11.230> for<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.250> tips<00:04:12.549> part<00:04:13.000> of

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
check a b-1 level for the tips part of

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.759 
check a b-1 level for the tips part of
the<00:04:13.120> mnemonic<00:04:13.510> first<00:04:13.900> part<00:04:14.110> is<00:04:14.170> trauma<00:04:14.530> or

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
the mnemonic first part is trauma or

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.250 
the mnemonic first part is trauma or
temperature<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:16.090> think<00:04:16.600> your<00:04:16.750> infection

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
temperature for I think your infection

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.349 
temperature for I think your infection
so<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:17.590> could<00:04:17.739> just<00:04:17.859> be<00:04:17.979> from<00:04:18.430> urosepsis<00:04:19.000> or

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
so this could just be from urosepsis or

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.789 
so this could just be from urosepsis or
it<00:04:19.450> could<00:04:19.570> be<00:04:19.660> something<00:04:19.870> more<00:04:20.229> central<00:04:20.620> like

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
it could be something more central like

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.409 
it could be something more central like
meningitis<00:04:21.549> or<00:04:21.700> encephalitis

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
meningitis or encephalitis

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.060 
meningitis or encephalitis
for<00:04:23.110> P<00:04:23.320> that's<00:04:23.560> going<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.860> be<00:04:24.039> a<00:04:24.370> psyche

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
for P that's going to be a psyche

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.880 
for P that's going to be a psyche
so<00:04:25.580> maybe<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:25.910> psychosis<00:04:26.570> or<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:27.140> poisoning<00:04:27.770> so

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
so maybe a psychosis or a poisoning so

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.230 
so maybe a psychosis or a poisoning so
there's<00:04:28.070> a<00:04:28.130> lot<00:04:28.250> of<00:04:28.340> different<00:04:28.580> overdoses<00:04:29.120> you

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
there's a lot of different overdoses you

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.270 
there's a lot of different overdoses you
should<00:04:29.420> think<00:04:29.540> about<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:30.080> then<00:04:30.440> under<00:04:30.680> s<00:04:30.860> is

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
should think about and then under s is

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.980 
should think about and then under s is
gonna<00:04:31.460> be<00:04:31.640> seizures<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.630> then<00:04:32.690> they<00:04:32.840> also

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
gonna be seizures and then they also

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.050 
gonna be seizures and then they also
list<00:04:33.380> here<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.950> subarachnoid<00:04:34.280> hemorrhage<00:04:34.910> or

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
list here a subarachnoid hemorrhage or

is<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.250> mnemonic<00:04:46.460> don't<00:04:46.970> so<00:04:47.600> d<00:04:48.110> stands<00:04:48.380> for

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
is this mnemonic don't so d stands for

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.410 
is this mnemonic don't so d stands for
dextrose<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.280> lot<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.610> people<00:04:49.970> even<00:04:50.090> in<00:04:50.330> the

an<00:04:52.400> amp<00:04:52.580> of<00:04:52.790> dextrose<00:04:53.210> if<00:04:53.450> they're<00:04:53.630> altered<00:04:53.960> to

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
an amp of dextrose if they're altered to

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.660 
an amp of dextrose if they're altered to
make<00:04:54.200> sure<00:04:54.470> that<00:04:54.590> that's<00:04:54.710> not<00:04:55.040> just<00:04:55.190> from<00:04:55.580> a

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
make sure that that's not just from a

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.640 
make sure that that's not just from a
hypoglycemia<00:04:56.450> they'll<00:04:57.020> also<00:04:57.140> probably<00:04:57.380> give

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
hypoglycemia they'll also probably give

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.230 
hypoglycemia they'll also probably give
them<00:04:57.770> oxygen<00:04:57.980> and<00:04:58.550> then<00:04:58.910> you<00:04:58.970> could<00:04:59.120> think

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
them oxygen and then you could think

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.910 
them oxygen and then you could think
about<00:04:59.360> giving<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.930> dose<00:05:00.080> of<00:05:00.290> naloxone<00:05:00.440> or

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
about giving a dose of naloxone or

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.590 
about giving a dose of naloxone or
thymine<00:05:01.190> if<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.640> think<00:05:01.820> this<00:05:01.940> is<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.150> patient

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
thymine if you think this is a patient

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.150 
thymine if you think this is a patient
who<00:05:02.660> might<00:05:02.930> have<00:05:03.020> had<00:05:03.170> an<00:05:03.320> overdose<00:05:03.770> or<00:05:04.010> as<00:05:04.130> a

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
who might have had an overdose or as a

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.100 
who might have had an overdose or as a
chronic<00:05:04.370> alcoholic<00:05:04.810> after<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:05.960> you're

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
chronic alcoholic after that you're

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.180 
chronic alcoholic after that you're
gonna<00:05:06.170> start<00:05:06.560> narrowing<00:05:06.890> down<00:05:07.040> your

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
gonna start narrowing down your

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.800 
gonna start narrowing down your

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
differential you can give specific

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.630 
differential you can give specific
things<00:05:09.290> like<00:05:09.380> antibiotics<00:05:09.650> or<00:05:10.310> maybe<00:05:10.550> a

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
things like antibiotics or maybe a

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.280 
things like antibiotics or maybe a
particular<00:05:10.790> antidote<00:05:11.510> a<00:05:11.660> couple<00:05:11.990> of<00:05:12.050> pitfalls

particular antidote a couple of pitfalls

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.840 
particular antidote a couple of pitfalls
to<00:05:12.650> think<00:05:12.920> through<00:05:13.070> for<00:05:13.130> altered<00:05:13.520> Mental

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
to think through for altered Mental

to think through for altered Mental
Status<00:05:13.880> one<00:05:14.690> thing<00:05:14.870> is<00:05:14.990> just<00:05:15.110> really<00:05:15.470> not

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
Status one thing is just really not

Status one thing is just really not
scenario<00:05:16.040> diagnosis<00:05:16.670> too<00:05:16.820> quickly<00:05:17.150> this<00:05:17.330> has

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
scenario diagnosis too quickly this has

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.900 
scenario diagnosis too quickly this has
a<00:05:17.540> huge<00:05:18.170> differential<00:05:19.070> so<00:05:19.490> make<00:05:19.640> sure<00:05:19.670> and

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
a huge differential so make sure and

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.610 
a huge differential so make sure and
think<00:05:20.150> broadly<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.840> don't<00:05:21.110> clamp<00:05:21.410> down<00:05:21.590> on

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
think broadly and don't clamp down on

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.800 
think broadly and don't clamp down on
one<00:05:21.890> idea<00:05:22.220> too<00:05:22.490> quickly<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:23.390> other<00:05:23.510> thing<00:05:23.720> is

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
one idea too quickly the other thing is

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.330 
one idea too quickly the other thing is
failing<00:05:24.140> to<00:05:24.230> get<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.410> good<00:05:24.590> history<00:05:24.950> it's<00:05:25.160> so

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
failing to get a good history it's so

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.070 
failing to get a good history it's so
easy<00:05:25.580> with<00:05:25.790> these<00:05:25.910> patients<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.510> just<00:05:26.690> say<00:05:26.840> oh

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
easy with these patients to just say oh

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.960 
easy with these patients to just say oh
they're<00:05:27.560> altered<00:05:27.950> I<00:05:28.130> can't<00:05:28.430> get<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.580> history

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
they're altered I can't get a history

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.820 
they're altered I can't get a history
don't<00:05:29.660> do<00:05:29.930> that<00:05:30.080> make<00:05:30.350> some<00:05:30.590> phone<00:05:30.800> calls

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
don't do that make some phone calls

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.860 
don't do that make some phone calls
really<00:05:31.490> try<00:05:31.640> to<00:05:31.670> get<00:05:31.910> some<00:05:32.150> history<00:05:32.420> which<00:05:32.690> can

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
really try to get some history which can

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.660 
really try to get some history which can
help<00:05:32.990> you<00:05:33.260> determine<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.800> etiology<00:05:33.950> of<00:05:34.190> this

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
help you determine the etiology of this

help you determine the etiology of this
altered<00:05:34.970> Mental<00:05:35.270> Status<00:05:35.300> so<00:05:35.900> that's<00:05:36.080> it<00:05:36.230> for
