hi<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.730> show<00:00:02.760> you<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.240> do

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hi this is a video to show you how to do

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.930 
hi this is a video to show you how to do
open<00:00:03.780> number<00:00:04.259> line<00:00:04.410> subtraction<00:00:05.250> this<00:00:05.730> is

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
open number line subtraction this is

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.070 
open number line subtraction this is
just<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.270> different<00:00:06.690> way<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> doing

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
just a different way of doing

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.200 
just a different way of doing
subtraction<00:00:07.859> with<00:00:08.130> we're<00:00:09.030> especially

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
subtraction with we're especially

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.919 
subtraction with we're especially
helpful<00:00:09.690> when<00:00:09.960> learning<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:10.980> regroup<00:00:11.929> or

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
helpful when learning how to regroup or

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.079 
helpful when learning how to regroup or
trade<00:00:13.410> when<00:00:13.740> subtracting<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:14.910> gives

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
trade when subtracting and it just gives

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.000 
trade when subtracting and it just gives
a<00:00:15.210> different<00:00:15.570> kind<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.900> visual<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.830> how<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
a different kind of visual for how the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
a different kind of visual for how the
numbers<00:00:17.430> are<00:00:17.550> working<00:00:17.910> together<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.170> have

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
numbers are working together so I have

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.269 
numbers are working together so I have
my<00:00:19.619> problem<00:00:20.010> here<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.390> 347<00:00:21.390> minus<00:00:21.840> 56<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.189> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
my problem here with 347 minus 56 and I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.040 
my problem here with 347 minus 56 and I
have<00:00:23.460> my<00:00:23.609> two<00:00:23.670> numbers<00:00:24.119> set<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> number

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
have my two numbers set up on a number

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.279 
have my two numbers set up on a number
line

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
line

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.169 
line
56<00:00:25.949> down<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:27.140> 347<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> all<00:00:29.820> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
56 down here and 347 and so all this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.520 
56 down here and 347 and so all this
method<00:00:31.489> does<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.759> show<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.200> different<00:00:34.200> jumps

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
method does is show you different jumps

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.420 
method does is show you different jumps
that<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.309> make<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:35.910> down<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.450> 56<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> for

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that you make to get down to 56 so for

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.860 
that you make to get down to 56 so for
example<00:00:38.790> my<00:00:38.910> first<00:00:39.180> jump<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> be

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
example my first jump is going to be

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.780 
example my first jump is going to be
worth<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.379> unit<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> put

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
worth one unit and that's going to put

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.229 
worth one unit and that's going to put
me<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.379> 346<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.129> recording<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.760> jumps<00:00:45.090> up

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
me at 346 so I'm recording my jumps up

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.690 
me at 346 so I'm recording my jumps up
here<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> top<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:47.039> new<00:00:47.250> numbers

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
here at the top and then my new numbers

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.360 
here at the top and then my new numbers
down<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.420> underneath<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.079> number<00:00:49.350> line<00:00:49.530> now

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
down here underneath the number line now

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.889 
down here underneath the number line now
I'm<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> make<00:00:50.879> another<00:00:51.210> jump<00:00:51.449> I'm<00:00:51.690> going

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
I'm going to make another jump I'm going

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.369 
I'm going to make another jump I'm going
to<00:00:51.960> jump<00:00:52.230> 40<00:00:53.100> units<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:56.690> I'm<00:00:57.690> still<00:00:58.020> working

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to jump 40 units and I'm still working

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.520 
to jump 40 units and I'm still working
toward<00:00:58.739> getting<00:00:59.010> down<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.489> 56<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.410> I'm

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
toward getting down to 56 so now I'm

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590 
toward getting down to 56 so now I'm
going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> make<00:01:01.920> another<00:01:02.399> jump<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.180> going

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
going to make another jump and I'm going

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.370 
going to make another jump and I'm going
to<00:01:03.660> jump<00:01:04.019> let's<00:01:04.710> say<00:01:04.949> 200<00:01:05.760> units<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> that's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
to jump let's say 200 units so that's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
to jump let's say 200 units so that's
going<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> put<00:01:07.770> me<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.010> 106<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.400> see

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
going to put me at 106 so now I can see

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.670 
going to put me at 106 so now I can see
that<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> need<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.960> make<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.470> more

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that all I need to do is make one more

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.100 
that all I need to do is make one more
jump<00:01:14.090> or<00:01:15.090> 50<00:01:15.780> units<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.310> 56<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
jump or 50 units to get down to 56 and

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.679 
jump or 50 units to get down to 56 and
as<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:23.189> jumps<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.299> evenly

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
as you can see my jumps are not evenly

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.560 
as you can see my jumps are not evenly
spaced<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.229> obviously<00:01:25.890> 200<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.820> worth<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.360> lot

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
spaced out obviously 200 is worth a lot

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.050 
spaced out obviously 200 is worth a lot
more<00:01:27.600> than<00:01:27.869> 50<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.280> okay<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.909> just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
more than 50 but that's okay it's just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
more than 50 but that's okay it's just
you<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> visual<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you just want to get the visual of

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.929 
you just want to get the visual of
jumping<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> number<00:01:33.960> line<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
jumping down the number line and

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.270 
jumping down the number line and
recording<00:01:35.939> how<00:01:36.240> many<00:01:36.509> jumps<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.200> make<00:01:37.409> so

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
recording how many jumps you make so

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
recording how many jumps you make so
here<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:39.119> jumps<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.200> add<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.680> these

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
here all of my jumps if I add all these

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.149 
here all of my jumps if I add all these
up<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.729> two<00:01:42.000> hundred<00:01:42.390> five<00:01:42.899> tens<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.829> tens

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
up I have two hundred five tens for tens

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.450 
up I have two hundred five tens for tens
one<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.860> put<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.220> those

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
one one and if I put all of those

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.899 
one one and if I put all of those
together<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.180> come<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:49.340> 291<00:01:50.340> which<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
together I come up with 291 which is the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.160 
together I come up with 291 which is the
difference<00:01:51.360> between<00:01:52.280> 347<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.460> 56<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.329> have

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
difference between 347 and 56 I have

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.200 
difference between 347 and 56 I have
another<00:01:55.740> number<00:01:56.100> line<00:01:56.219> set<00:01:56.700> up<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
another number line set up for you just

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.660 
another number line set up for you just
to<00:01:57.540> show<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.560> jump<00:01:59.430> in

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
to show you that you can jump in

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.600 
to show you that you can jump in
different<00:02:00.090> ways<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> again<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
different ways so again I'm going to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.359 
different ways so again I'm going to
start<00:02:02.820> at<00:02:02.880> 347<00:02:03.750> maybe<00:02:04.439> for<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> first<00:02:04.890> jump

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
start at 347 maybe for the first jump

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880 
start at 347 maybe for the first jump
I'll<00:02:05.610> jump<00:02:05.880> down<00:02:06.020> 47<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.560> nice

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
I'll jump down 47 to make this a nice

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.870 
I'll jump down 47 to make this a nice
round<00:02:08.369> number<00:02:08.989> now<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.500> jump<00:02:11.069> down

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
round number now I have to jump down

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.640 
round number now I have to jump down
another<00:02:12.180> amount<00:02:12.600> I'm<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.410> jump

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
another amount I'm just going to jump

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.180 
another amount I'm just going to jump
down<00:02:13.710> fifty<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.450> 250<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.800> can<00:02:17.010> make

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
down fifty to get to 250 and I can make

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.040 
down fifty to get to 250 and I can make
small<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.880> jumps<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.510> until<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.900> get

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
small little jumps like this until I get

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.210 
small little jumps like this until I get
256<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.300> want<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.840> jump<00:02:22.230> down<00:02:22.410> another<00:02:22.710> 50

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
256 so if I want to jump down another 50

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.760 
256 so if I want to jump down another 50
I<00:02:23.250> would<00:02:23.580> get<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.330> 200<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.620> just

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
I would get get to 200 but I'm just

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.710 
I would get get to 200 but I'm just
going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.010> go<00:02:26.190> ahead<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.760> jump<00:02:27.060> down<00:02:27.240> another

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
going to go ahead and jump down another

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.060 
going to go ahead and jump down another
hundred<00:02:28.650> units<00:02:32.480> then<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.320> jump

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
hundred units then I'm going to jump

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.640 
hundred units then I'm going to jump
down<00:02:36.290> another<00:02:37.290> fifty<00:02:37.860> units<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.360> 100

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
down another fifty units to get to 100

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.930 
down another fifty units to get to 100
now<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.710> can<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.190> I'm<00:02:44.460> quickly

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
now I can see that I'm quickly

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.520 
now I can see that I'm quickly
approaching<00:02:45.450> fifty<00:02:45.840> six<00:02:46.550> if<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.760> jump<00:02:48.120> down

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
approaching fifty six if I jump down

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.130 
approaching fifty six if I jump down
another<00:02:49.530> forty<00:02:50.160> units<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:51.480> puts<00:02:51.780> me<00:02:51.990> at

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
another forty units that puts me at

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.530 
another forty units that puts me at
sixty<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.640> then<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.820> know<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.150> difference

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
sixty and then I know the difference

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.410 
sixty and then I know the difference
between<00:02:54.630> sixty<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.470> fifty<00:02:56.160> six<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.700> only<00:02:57.030> four

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
between sixty and fifty six is only four

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.650 
between sixty and fifty six is only four
units<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> again<00:02:59.460> if<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.730> add<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.360> these

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
units so again if I add all of these

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.340 
units so again if I add all of these
numbers<00:03:00.960> up<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> all<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.480> my<00:03:03.660> jumps<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.290> I

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
numbers up that I all of my jumps that I

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.770 
numbers up that I all of my jumps that I
made<00:03:04.650> at<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> top<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.090> would<00:03:06.270> get<00:03:06.450> two

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
made at the top then I would get two

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.650 
made at the top then I would get two
hundred<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.410> ninety<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.420> hope<00:03:09.630> that

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
hundred and ninety one so I hope that

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.990 
hundred and ninety one so I hope that
