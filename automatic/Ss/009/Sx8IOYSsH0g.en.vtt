00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
as for UCC I see on the main board so we

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.979 
as for UCC I see on the main board so we
can<00:03:01.950> support<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.549> that's<00:03:02.790> what<00:03:02.940> UCC<00:03:03.510> unlocked

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
can support it that's what UCC unlocked

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.780 
can support it that's what UCC unlocked
