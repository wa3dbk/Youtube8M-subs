00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello guys this is a replica of a 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.849
 scania that I wanted some time ago and 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.589
 now I decided to make a video a 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.040
 series of videos teaching the step 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:19.160
 step, how to mount this little truck that 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.290
 going to be used here is basically paper 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.690
 wood mdf 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.430
 In this first video I'll teach you how 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.920
 mount a chassis 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:35.060
 So if you like this hobby that 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:38.360
 Face this come with me so here it is 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.310
 the chassis with the black parts i did 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.840
 so to save paper 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:48.380
 I used a paper card or poster here and 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:54.020
 can use the paper another color only that I 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.630
 I think this one gets better here 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.910
 important montage detail 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.840
 before anything else needs to dial 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.750
 with a pen all the folds on the paper 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.609
 Because when you fold the paper, you go. 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.759
 to see that it's much easier to have 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:15.439
 marked there the fold will come out exactly 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:18.020
 where you who do not take a ruler pass a 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.740
 pen with a little strength wherever 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.429
 have the dotted lines do this in the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.429
 two leaves 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:42.080
 Good now that you've marked all the pieces is 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.050
 only cut starts remembering the parts 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.080
 that will use that is the part of the chassis 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.520
 these black parts can leave corner 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.520
 who will later use it too 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:16.730
 so now just fold the paper where it was 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.530
 marked and fold well to glue after 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:27.930
 can see that it has become easier to fold 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:31.319
 because he is now marking the last 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.750
 part that is the collage since you have scored 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:40.019
 folded remembered just necklace 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.959
 I advise you to glue a waiting party 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.230
 if they finish and then put another here 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.989
 in the video I did everything straight but I prefer 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.920
 to dry one part thoroughly 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.920
 put another 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.910
 now only need to fold the sides of the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.800
 spare chassis can be with 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.599
 quinine aid 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.370
 if the part is very easy even more than 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.000
 already marked 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.690
 then fold one after the other 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.690
 is ready 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:27.690
 here I like to use to leave more 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.480
 firm the cart the taste of using in mdf 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.349
 so I 've already cut the size of the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.629
 parts 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.540
 I will leave a measure of each one here in the 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.900
 video but this is optional 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.989
 If you do not want to use it, you do not have to 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.150
 this will make her a lot firmer neighbor 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:52.260
 Then you take the pieces and glue them inside. 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.290
 these parts of mdf do not want to use mdf 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:00.030
 can use a navy a toothpick 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.440
 popsicle I want something cardboard to 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.299
 leave firmer 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.120
 if you do not want to use it either, it's not 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.980
 required but as I said she goes 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:15.359
 It's better if you use something to 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.350
 there let aa firmer piece there before the 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.229
 take off 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.460
 the political mf puts inside the piece 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.470
 measure vice was right if you had to 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.490
 cut some more piece do some 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.710
 adjustment 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.979
 if you have it all right you measured the ok strip 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.770
 Then you pass the glue and put it on again. 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.820
 let it dry well to continue the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.820
 next steps 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:02.389
 the second part of the chassis the same thing 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:04.569
 put the glue put the mdf let dry 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.569
 good 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.320
 ok I have a paper 4 cents per 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.870
 four I do not know if it's difficult at na 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.200
 printing but in any case if you are 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.740
 plays a role four by four and here I 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.210
 I'll have to paste a chassis this part. 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.580
 which is marked with a black dash 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:37.490
 here is the black line that goes 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:40.170
 scroll inside the chassis part 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:44.540
 so you'll paste exactly where 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:48.300
 mark black line at the output of the part 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.700
 passes the glue puts the inner part and 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:56.130
 where the black dash arrives 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:58.530
 You leave me waiting to dry a little and then 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.330
 Are you going to do the same with the other? 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:06.600
 ask the limit is another so black 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.610
 Okay, it's very dry now, I'll get it 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.700
 begin to scroll the small details of the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.340
 chassis than these parts of paper because 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.240
 nor here in the lap that four by 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.650
 four 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.240
 then the lap other menorzinhos 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.460
 trying to leave an equal space between 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.900
 they are in the lap one year points another in the middle 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:36.590
 and two others in the middle of each 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:36.590
 ok then it's made apart from the easy
