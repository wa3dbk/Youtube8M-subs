toward<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.559> flat<00:00:52.980> surface<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.570> printer

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
toward the flat surface that the printer

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.350 
toward the flat surface that the printer
is<00:00:54.930> sitting<00:00:55.379> upon<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.399> now<00:00:56.579> let's<00:00:56.820> attach<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
is sitting upon so now let's attach the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.330 
is sitting upon so now let's attach the
power<00:00:57.539> cord<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:59.660> it<00:01:00.660> snaps<00:01:01.110> securely<00:01:01.680> into

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
power cord and it snaps securely into

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.690 
power cord and it snaps securely into
place<00:01:02.840> one<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.080> nice<00:01:04.259> features<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
place one of the nice features is that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.120 
place one of the nice features is that
it<00:01:06.000> cannot<00:01:06.479> come<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.990> by<00:01:07.200> simply<00:01:07.470> pulling<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
it cannot come out by simply pulling the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
it cannot come out by simply pulling the
cord<00:01:08.630> or<00:01:09.630> by<00:01:09.960> even<00:01:10.260> pulling<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> connector<00:01:11.810> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
cord or by even pulling the connector it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.859 
cord or by even pulling the connector it
uses<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> sleeve<00:01:14.189> process<00:01:15.030> where<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.479> gently

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
uses a sleeve process where you gently

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
uses a sleeve process where you gently
pull<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.530> sleeve<00:01:17.010> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.340> connector

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
pull the sleeve of the connector

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.280 
pull the sleeve of the connector
rearward<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:20.729> unlocks<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.750> connector

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
rearward and that unlocks the connector

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.240 
rearward and that unlocks the connector
from<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> printer

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
from the printer

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.520

Epson did this intentionally to make
sure<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.979> jostling<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.939> moving<00:01:27.869> around<00:01:28.140> in

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
sure that jostling and moving around in

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.010 
sure that jostling and moving around in
the<00:01:28.500> serving<00:01:28.920> area<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.210> disconnect

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the serving area would not disconnect

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.710 
the serving area would not disconnect
the<00:01:31.200> printer<00:01:31.909> now<00:01:32.909> we'll<00:01:33.119> turn<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.509> printer

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the printer now we'll turn the printer

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.789 
the printer now we'll turn the printer
around<00:01:34.140> back<00:01:34.470> into<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> serviceable<00:01:35.700> position

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.260 

now<00:01:40.799> let's<00:01:41.040> talk<00:01:41.250> about<00:01:41.310> powering<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
now let's talk about powering the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.620 
now let's talk about powering the
printer<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:43.140> well<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.130> testing<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
printer on as well as testing it the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.880 
printer on as well as testing it the
first<00:01:45.900> thing<00:01:46.110> we'll<00:01:46.290> need<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.860> course

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
first thing we'll need to do of course

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.149 
first thing we'll need to do of course
is<00:01:47.310> add<00:01:47.640> paper<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> printer<00:01:50.479> as<00:01:51.829> we<00:01:52.829> open

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is add paper to the printer as we open

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.850 
is add paper to the printer as we open
the<00:01:53.280> top<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> way<00:01:54.320> you'll<00:01:55.320> notice<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the top all the way you'll notice the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.450 
the top all the way you'll notice the
position<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:57.180> I'm<00:01:57.390> holding<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> paper

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
position in which I'm holding the paper

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
position in which I'm holding the paper
you<00:01:59.460> want<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> paper<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.180> roll<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.200> out

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
you want the paper to roll up and out

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.449 
you want the paper to roll up and out
toward<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> front<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.390> printer

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.460 

once<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.640> paper<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:11.970> securely<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.840> place

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
once the paper is securely in place

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.259 
once the paper is securely in place
close<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.370> top<00:02:14.930> securely<00:02:16.519> at<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.760> time<00:02:18.030> you

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
close the top securely at that time you

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.220 
close the top securely at that time you
can<00:02:18.450> tear<00:02:18.930> off<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.400> excess<00:02:23.810> now<00:02:24.810> let's<00:02:25.049> move

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
can tear off the excess now let's move

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.140 
can tear off the excess now let's move
on<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.799> testing<00:02:26.280> procedures<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.000> make

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
on to the testing procedures to make

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.699 
on to the testing procedures to make
sure<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> printer<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:27.989> mechanically

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
sure that the printer is mechanically

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.119 
sure that the printer is mechanically
sound<00:02:29.269> first<00:02:30.269> we'll<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.049> test<00:02:31.379> to<00:02:31.739> ensure

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
sound first we'll do a test to ensure

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.039 
sound first we'll do a test to ensure
that<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.849> printer<00:02:33.209> printhead<00:02:33.690> is

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
that the printer printhead is

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.619 
that the printer printhead is
functioning<00:02:34.830> properly<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:36.090> perform<00:02:36.390> this

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
functioning properly and to perform this

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.449 
functioning properly and to perform this
test<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:38.280> hold<00:02:38.549> down<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.000> feed<00:02:39.239> button<00:02:39.540> at

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
test you hold down the feed button at
