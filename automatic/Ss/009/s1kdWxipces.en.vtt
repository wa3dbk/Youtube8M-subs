00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.920 
the last thing is we're going to be
getting<00:01:26.100> some<00:01:26.340> new<00:01:26.490> special<00:01:26.970> packs<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
getting some new special packs now it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
getting some new special packs now it
does<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.380> say<00:01:28.710> new<00:01:29.100> special<00:01:29.640> packs<00:01:29.880> but
