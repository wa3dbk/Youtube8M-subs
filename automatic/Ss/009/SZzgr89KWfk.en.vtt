depending on your setup is this which is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.990 
depending on your setup is this which is
a<00:00:57.329> SATA<00:00:57.780> 2<00:00:58.260> molex<00:00:58.829> power<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> way<00:01:02.370> my<00:01:02.609> set<00:01:02.879> up

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
a SATA 2 molex power the way my set up

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.929 
a SATA 2 molex power the way my set up
is<00:01:03.149> I'm<00:01:03.449> doing<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.320> MacBook<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
is I'm doing this on a MacBook or a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.260 
is I'm doing this on a MacBook or a
laptop<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.890> turn<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.939> drive

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
laptop and if you turn the I have drive

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.050 
laptop and if you turn the I have drive
around<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.810> will<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.350> SATA<00:01:10.770> power<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.610> SATA

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
around you will see SATA power and SATA

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.050 
around you will see SATA power and SATA
data<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.380> you're<00:01:13.650> basically<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.700> take

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
data so you're basically going to take

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
data so you're basically going to take
this<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.960> plug<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> into<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> back<00:01:19.310> just<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this and plug it into the back just like

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.330 
this and plug it into the back just like
that<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:22.140> since<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.280> am<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> laptop<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
that and then since I am on a laptop I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.890 
that and then since I am on a laptop I
also<00:01:26.340> bought<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.360> thing<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:29.990> molex

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
also bought this thing which is a molex

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
also bought this thing which is a molex
power<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.500> adapter<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.040> guess<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
power like adapter I guess and you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.230 
power like adapter I guess and you
basically<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.990> plug<00:01:37.729> these<00:01:38.729> two<00:01:38.790> wires

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
basically just plug these two wires

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.920 
basically just plug these two wires
together<00:01:42.829> just<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.299> DVD

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
together just like that and then the DVD

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.219 
together just like that and then the DVD
drive<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.740> power<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.930> like

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
drive will have power so you can like

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.249 
drive will have power so you can like
eject<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.950> everything<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:51.509> another

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
eject it and everything and another

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.510 
eject it and everything and another
thing<00:01:52.530> you're<00:01:52.649> gonna<00:01:52.740> need<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.490> a

need this you could use any USB 2 SATA
like<00:02:06.320> Hardware<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> guess<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.819> long<00:02:09.030> as

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
like Hardware I guess just as long as

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.029 
like Hardware I guess just as long as
your<00:02:09.750> drive<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.349> detected<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
your drive is like detected and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.790 
your drive is like detected and
everything<00:02:11.780> you're<00:02:12.780> basically<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.290> gonna

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
everything you're basically just gonna

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.580 
everything you're basically just gonna
plug<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.220> into<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.970> extra<00:02:15.390> slot<00:02:15.690> right<00:02:16.320> next

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
plug this into the extra slot right next

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.160 
plug this into the extra slot right next
to<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.800> power<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:19.230> like<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:21.420> then

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
to the power just like that and then

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.230 
to the power just like that and then
your<00:02:22.380> drive<00:02:22.880> should<00:02:23.880> install<00:02:25.340> if<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.820> haven't

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
your drive should install if you haven't

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.810 
your drive should install if you haven't
already<00:02:27.390> installed<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.610> then<00:02:29.610> you're

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
already installed it and then you're
