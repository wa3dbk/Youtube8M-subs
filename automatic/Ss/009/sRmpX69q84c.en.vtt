00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.700 
model 8h L it's left-handed and this is
gonna<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> Adams<00:00:24.390> arm<00:00:25.070> piston<00:00:26.070> upper<00:00:27.710> was

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
gonna be the Adams arm piston upper was

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.990 
gonna be the Adams arm piston upper was
just<00:00:28.920> seen<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.189> my<00:00:29.310> other<00:00:29.460> videos<00:00:29.990> now<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:32.000> far

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
just seen in my other videos now so far

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.690 
just seen in my other videos now so far
the<00:00:33.090> fit<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.750> finish<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.610> really

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the fit and finish of it it's really

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
the fit and finish of it it's really
nice<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> stag<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.750> same<00:00:36.899> thing<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
nice on the stag the same thing as to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.190 
nice on the stag the same thing as to
Adams<00:00:37.590> arms<00:00:38.180> different<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.570> finish<00:00:39.870> here

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
Adams arms different on the finish here

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.180 
Adams arms different on the finish here
is<00:00:40.379> more<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.920> standard<00:00:42.739> 16<00:00:43.739> inch<00:00:43.890> barrel

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
is more like a standard 16 inch barrel

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.690 
is more like a standard 16 inch barrel
this<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.000> more<00:00:45.360> smooth<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.379> more<00:00:47.070> loose<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this is more smooth and more loose I

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
this is more smooth and more loose I
guess<00:00:48.270> he<00:00:48.420> calls<00:00:48.660> shinier<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:50.780> this<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
guess he calls shinier but this is you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.240 
guess he calls shinier but this is you
know<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.469> basic<00:00:52.980> 16<00:00:53.850> inch<00:00:55.820> upper<00:00:56.820> here

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
know like basic 16 inch upper here

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.410 
know like basic 16 inch upper here
difference<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.670> tell<00:00:59.850> us<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
difference as you can tell us you got a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.039 
difference as you can tell us you got a
grill<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.079> stag<00:01:01.730> upper<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.600> not<00:01:03.719> have

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
grill on the stag upper you do not have

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.520 
grill on the stag upper you do not have
one<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.070> ABS<00:01:05.250> arms<00:01:05.549> upper<00:01:06.020> they<00:01:07.020> both<00:01:07.260> are

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
one on the ABS arms upper they both are

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.460 
one on the ABS arms upper they both are
pinned<00:01:08.330> gas<00:01:09.330> box<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.869> one's<00:01:10.080> pending<00:01:10.439> that

out the boat carriers on both of the
piston<00:02:13.030> uppers<00:02:13.330> back<00:02:14.080> here<00:02:14.260> like<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> said<00:02:14.620> this

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
piston uppers back here like I said this

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.700 
piston uppers back here like I said this
is<00:02:15.250> still<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.610> Adams<00:02:15.850> arms<00:02:16.150> back<00:02:16.330> here<00:02:16.710> this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
is still the Adams arms back here this

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.860 
is still the Adams arms back here this
is<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> stack<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.210> one<00:02:22.360> thing<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.660> did

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
is a stack but the one thing I did

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.280 
is a stack but the one thing I did
notice<00:02:23.430> there's<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.550> piston<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.600> it's

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
notice there's a piston on this one it's

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.420 
notice there's a piston on this one it's
a<00:02:26.440> lot<00:02:26.850> thicker<00:02:27.850> all<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.750> way<00:02:28.840> through<00:02:29.430> I'm

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
a lot thicker all the way through I'm

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.920 
a lot thicker all the way through I'm
not<00:02:30.640> sure<00:02:30.880> how<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.330> operates<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.220> haven't

done so I really haven't messed around

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.650 
done so I really haven't messed around
with<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.720> since<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.800> wasn't<00:02:50.920> my<00:02:51.820> upper<00:02:52.060> but

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
with this since it wasn't my upper but

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.120 
with this since it wasn't my upper but
that's<00:02:52.989> one<00:02:53.230> thing<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.500> noticed<00:02:53.770> her<00:02:53.860> off<00:02:53.980> the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that's one thing I noticed her off the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.720 
that's one thing I noticed her off the
bat<00:02:54.340> was<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:55.470> piston<00:02:56.470> there's<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.280> lot

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
bat was the piston there's a lot

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.870 
bat was the piston there's a lot
different<00:02:58.270> than<00:02:58.480> your<00:02:58.540> Adams<00:02:59.380> arms<00:02:59.700> this<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.850> a

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
different than your Adams arms this is a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.000 
different than your Adams arms this is a
lot<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.480> me<00:03:01.600> it's<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:02.020> lot<00:03:02.170> more<00:03:02.350> simpler<00:03:02.739> and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
lot to me it's a lot more simpler and

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.850 
lot to me it's a lot more simpler and
easier<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.340> clean<00:03:05.580> now<00:03:07.410> back<00:03:08.410> here<00:03:08.680> is

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
easier to clean now back here is

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.979 
easier to clean now back here is
charging<00:03:09.190> handles<00:03:09.519> on<00:03:09.850> both<00:03:09.910> this<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
charging handles on both this is a

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.840 
charging handles on both this is a
stacks<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:13.330> Adams<00:03:14.260> arms<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:15.549> about<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
stacks and the Adams arms it's about the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.390 
stacks and the Adams arms it's about the
same<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.360> really<00:03:16.540> don't<00:03:17.140> see<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.410> know<00:03:17.560> quality

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
same I really don't see you know quality

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.890 
same I really don't see you know quality
difference<00:03:19.410> now<00:03:20.410> FAR's<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:24.480> bow<00:03:25.480> carriers

difference now FAR's the bow carriers
this<00:03:26.650> is<00:03:26.830> your<00:03:27.040> Adams<00:03:27.310> arms<00:03:27.930> McGill<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.739> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
this is your Adams arms McGill so the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.940 
this is your Adams arms McGill so the
difference<00:03:30.489> between<00:03:30.519> these<00:03:30.940> two

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.610 

we<00:03:35.950> register<00:03:36.370> Adams<00:03:36.670> arms<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:38.230> one's<00:03:38.470> gonna

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
we register Adams arms this one's gonna

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.370 
we register Adams arms this one's gonna
be<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:40.390> stag<00:03:40.950> big<00:03:41.950> difference<00:03:42.340> between<00:03:42.700> these

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
be the stag big difference between these

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.860 
be the stag big difference between these
definitely<00:03:44.380> different<00:03:44.800> finishes<00:03:45.070> on<00:03:45.400> them

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
definitely different finishes on them

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.900 
definitely different finishes on them
this<00:03:49.470> Adams<00:03:50.470> Arms<00:03:50.740> has<00:03:50.920> more<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.370> slant

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
this Adams Arms has more of a slant

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
right here and then it's smooth all the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.740 
right here and then it's smooth all the
way<00:03:58.030> around

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.560

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
it's kind of weird two slides here and

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.039 
it's kind of weird two slides here and
it's<00:04:12.700> like<00:04:15.060> more<00:04:16.060> cuts<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.450> it<00:04:16.600> on<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.810> side

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
it's like more cuts in it on the side

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.920 

this<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:30.069> little<00:04:30.970> different<00:04:31.360> than<00:04:31.479> Adams

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
this is a little different than Adams

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.140 
this is a little different than Adams
this<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.319> still<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.710> stag<00:04:32.979> here<00:04:35.250> further<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.460> you

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.629 

yeah<00:04:40.150> just<00:04:40.419> goes<00:04:40.720> down<00:04:40.960> more<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.639> slant

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
yeah just goes down more to a slant

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.850 
yeah just goes down more to a slant
right<00:04:42.849> here<00:04:43.240> where<00:04:45.419> it's<00:04:46.419> not<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.289> long<00:04:47.560> as<00:04:47.740> it

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
right here where it's not as long as it

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.020 
right here where it's not as long as it
was<00:04:47.949> slant<00:04:48.250> on<00:04:48.599> the<00:04:49.599> stag<00:04:49.870> both<00:04:50.229> carrier<00:04:51.030> both

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
was slant on the stag both carrier both

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:03.240 
was slant on the stag both carrier both
are<00:04:52.210> spring<00:04:52.509> loaded<00:05:00.060> like<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.240> crews<00:05:02.009> on<00:05:03.009> the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
are spring loaded like the crews on the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.650 
are spring loaded like the crews on the
hands<00:05:03.460> arms<00:05:04.080> stake<00:05:05.970> as<00:05:06.970> you<00:05:07.090> can<00:05:07.210> see<00:05:07.360> has

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
hands arms stake as you can see has

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.430 
hands arms stake as you can see has
nothing<00:05:12.750> like<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.840> have<00:05:13.960> it<00:05:14.080> on<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.259> left

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
nothing like you have it on the left

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:27.270 
nothing like you have it on the left
side<00:05:14.530> take<00:05:14.919> that<00:05:15.099> back<00:05:25.919> so<00:05:26.919> it's<00:05:27.039> pretty<00:05:27.159> much

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
side take that back so it's pretty much

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.950 
side take that back so it's pretty much
the<00:05:27.520> same<00:05:27.550> this<00:05:28.000> is<00:05:28.150> like<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.389> left-handed

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
the same this is like a left-handed

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.439 
the same this is like a left-handed
bulkier<00:05:29.380> your<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:30.370> was<00:05:30.490> my<00:05:30.639> fault<00:05:30.940> so<00:05:31.320> but

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
bulkier your that was my fault so but

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.060 
bulkier your that was my fault so but
like<00:05:34.449> the<00:05:34.599> big<00:05:34.780> major<00:05:34.960> differences<00:05:35.590> I've<00:05:35.860> seen

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070
