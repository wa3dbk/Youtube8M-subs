00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.640
 m 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.490
 yotam years old and energetic father and 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.180
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.919
 new video 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.509
 so this is a little video that I have 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.090
 found in the company of my dear friend 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.000
 david so we were quietly in 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.070
 to make an adventure map so 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.430
 reston and blah blah and in fact we have 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.120
 found a bug is that in fact we put a 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.489
 mike hart there we push him a little and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.700
 when we do that will have to help out 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.510
 so and after once that's it 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.190
 can leave the mind map there and when 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.360
 you have in you go back is in 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.989
 do you respawn right now 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.750
 outside 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.820
 so that's something I found so 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.879
 to do it is very simple so the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.800
 see a door so there's a trick of 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.060
 nine cube and walls around so 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.300
 allow the game nothing more basic 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.550
 the door must be put 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.950
 I will be able to jump the door enough 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.170
 just from the outside so that's 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.940
 we are so we made our little 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.620
 stuff we put a door from outside 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.820
 must not be inside if not 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.920
 it bugged there between the door that is who 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.170
 was screwed from the outside he must have 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.970
 a block of a block where there is 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.960
 strictly nothing so I advise you 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.880
 to put the only one according to you 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.190
 do what you want and after that we 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.780
 will make a small system that will 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.090
 allow to make the ideal speed 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.430
 to be able to put 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.030
 so there is a two three four so 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.080
 there are four simple rails and one 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.780
 accelerator 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.590
 so basically what will propel us 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.670
 strong enough but not too fast for 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.410
 beat in the world slips so 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.630
 approaching ice it can be either a 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.130
 secret room 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.800
 Finally, I do not know of anything done 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.450
 that for that can be what you want 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.360
 so I redo see quickly you do it 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.580
 just put in front of you the advanced one 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.690
 little bit with yourself or click 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.890
 right makes you he has to go out 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.600
 and it's good you're out 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.000
 So then I say you're out 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.950
 but salah 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 it can be very much a 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.910
 great room and then it can be 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.430
 completely what you want so I 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.110
 will try to remove this video with 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.000
 jake fairley hope he's plaid 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.370
 because it's a discovery I finally 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.300
 think i hope to go to me i tell you the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.300
 next at hot holland bikes
