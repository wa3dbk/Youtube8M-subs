00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.169
 dirty girls welcome to this 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.879
 Sunday video in which we 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:11.090
 let's go talk magic towel 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.590
 attention you will tell yourself twice 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.120
 little of my mouth alone man and not in 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.070
 do I do not make your mouth 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.540
 in the sense you and to a share of 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.950
 reality in what I'm going to tell you 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.410
 all the same because it would be con talking 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.539
 something that has nothing to do with 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.760
 the title itself would be a little con so 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.230
 the towel in question and he knew 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.000
 to be orange 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.440
 when you see some more basic 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.780
 except that here it separates and at the bottom 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.539
 it's pal like so down you have 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.139
 you doubt that we put our head in 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:48.139
 know that this towel and eco-friendly 

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:49.670
 economical and efficient effective because 

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:51.739
 that it's a towel not like 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.489
 others it is made of bamboo fiber 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.139
 bamboo bamboo fiber which is a 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.959
 very absorbent meat so that goes 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:02.829
 absorb the excess water that is found 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:06.049
 in your hair well on your hair 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:10.310
 to convey a small hook like that so 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.289
 it will be to tie then she can 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.140
 dry up to four times faster 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.850
 hair but I would say it depends 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.619
 totally hair length 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.750
 let's say you have hair 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.299
 extremely short there yes I'm all to 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.070
 agreed that that then dried four 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.689
 times faster 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.670
 it can go I just think that the 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.170
 hair after chin knew that more 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.460
 it's long and over and hair take 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.500
 in water the more it gets heavier 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.570
 and then take a long time to dry so 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.369
 I would say that it dries pretty much 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.570
 two to three times faster knowing that 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.109
 usually my hair they take 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.390
 about two good hours to dry 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.520
 and sometimes in one hour an hour and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.189
 half it's almost good almost good but 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.609
 it's not 100% good either just a 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.109
 thing 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.999
 so I show you a little bit how 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.850
 so we obviously do but all his 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:58.460
 hair behind like that no no yarn 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.829
 this way you just a level thing 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.310
 sex appeal you lose while on the move 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.350
 unfortunately so darling and here it 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.180
 may not be just a trick because 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.340
 than the fringe if you do not place it well 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.200
 when 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.000
 she wants you will remove the servette 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.739
 you will see a goat that comes out 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.180
 so really be tackling you round in 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.459
 back or be you already laying on 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.750
 your forehead like me and then 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.019
 what I'm doing is that I put my 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.300
 hair behind the ears here I have 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.480
 look really glam like I do 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.060
 so here I am, I put well behind 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.069
 ears and then there are all 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.410
 hair they are behind 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.650
 so I'm going to gather them and I have 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.480
 past the towel from underneath as 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:51.230
 that on the other side 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:56.640
 the same one rolls one sells the towel 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.870
 like these and we will spend in 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.870
 little things that are here 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.200
 so if you're not right now 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.760
 technique it may not hold but 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.340
 normally watch with my length that 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.810
 protrudes at a small stove slightly 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.370
 so what makes you that when 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.730
 even have extremely long hair 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.250
 with 700 m and yeah that's extremely 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.000
 clear 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.680
 generally it's good when we do the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.660
 clean all that you do 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.700
 little things and all that on the other hand if 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.180
 you receive if I were you will avoid 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.920
 still it's not very top 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.959
 otherwise you will tell me what is it 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.510
 give behind we'll show a little 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.560
 little so his side is like this is 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.590
 behind like this here to remove me 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.440
 you can either pulled to remove or 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.370
 tilt your head back and 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.110
 Well, that's it 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.090
 so the stuff you 're going to ask me 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.170
 also the tariff and know where is that 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.000
 I found it's price is 18 euros 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.709
 you're going to tell me it's a little bit 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.019
 dear, but there are still some 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.370
 discounts on this site the site some 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.319
 of you already know that 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.000
 called trends and masts 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.519
 found a lot of products 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.120
 Ecological including carriers of 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.780
 calypso bamboo remover squares 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.760
 cotton really has you all kinds of 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.669
 two materials that may correspond to 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.960
 your skin that are more or less soft 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.289
 really it's very very interesting and 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.080
 besides that it's a little thing 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.090
 ecological are made in a frame 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.820
 reintegration of prisoners in France 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.890
 which means that the detainees do not 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.720
 can have a little bit of money and 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.510
 I think it's not bad 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.860
 just like how to do like 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.020
 something to offer really was not bad 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.030
 at all so really admires you 18 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.770
 euros it's a bit pricey but I have 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.210
 only one and it suits me 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.640
 I'm perfectly all a shampoo 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.620
 the six days so that bah I 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.840
 wrong lava and I turn off the lava 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.190
 and reuse it by cons when I 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.020
 finished washing my hair I have them 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.810
 go out so I try spell well by hand 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.789
 but without the orders I see I press 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.110
 to remove as much water as I can 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.789
 take to have a room is classic 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.320
 to really remove the excess water 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.210
 and then I but this one over 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.190
 I committed I do what I have to do 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.620
 for a good hour jal is this a 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.009
 early and and it's true that even 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.229
 sometimes up to an hour and a half 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.460
 and it's true that it dries up squarely 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.409
 faster especially when it comes to 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.330
 roots the roots all they 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.699
 found at the neck and after 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.409
 you personally have it dry well 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.300
 until then and after it's true that 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.839
 to get to the tips it takes a whole 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.339
 little more time but really 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:38.139
 the towel does not dry your hair 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.999
 because you're going to tell me yes but the 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.589
 towel need to take a lot 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:43.029
 the moisture of the hair it is true that the 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.949
 goal is to absorb a maximum 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.360
 of moisture but it really did not 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.460
 dirty hair and facing him does not 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.039
 lose in shine quality or 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.059
 hydration really have no worries is 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.800
 that this towel in addition to rooms 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:56.139
 is extremely sweet really very 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.699
 beautiful you have the choice between several 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.289
 color you have blue of the green of the 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.210
 white comes in really for all 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.399
 tastes and so the site is called the 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.319
 mast trends no really it's a 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:07.719
 huge time gap I think especially about 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:10.899
 girls who wash their hair at night 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:12.999
 or the morning just before leaving or a 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:14.979
 stuff in the genre really very very 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:18.009
 effective it is a service really to 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:20.229
 to have among the other pavlov games I 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.509
 do not talk about having teeth like 5.5 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.459
 it's useless, it's really very 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.129
 very well it's an investment on the 

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:28.990
 very very very very very long term what 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.819
 which makes that basel and 18 18 euros are 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.979
 quickly profitable because it makes you 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.559
 save a lot of electricity time 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.969
 because of course when you 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:39.189
 use the hair dryer down you 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.959
 use electricity as well as the 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.399
 light because obviously if fénoir 

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:45.009
 down you use light at the same 

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:46.899
 time that I recommend you greatly 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.129
 and whose squares I also tested 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:50.349
 cleansers so if you're interested 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.659

 Hi girls
