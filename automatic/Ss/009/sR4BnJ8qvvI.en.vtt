and then there was the moisturizing
wrench<00:03:26.790> which<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.300> rinse<00:03:27.780> which<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.590> a

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
wrench which is rinse which is just a

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.850 
wrench which is rinse which is just a
daily<00:03:30.110> conditioner<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:33.530> not<00:03:34.530> impressed

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
daily conditioner just not impressed

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.479

with<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.400> either<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.989> best<00:03:37.230> thing<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.830> can

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
with it either and the best thing I can

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.760 
with it either and the best thing I can
say<00:03:38.700> about<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.150> products<00:03:39.540> was<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> smell<00:03:40.200> and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680

probably paid like 20 22 dollars for
them<00:04:31.160> very<00:04:31.880> glad<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.419> didn't<00:04:32.750> go<00:04:32.870> out<00:04:33.020> and
