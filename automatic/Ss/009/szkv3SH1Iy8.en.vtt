 maximum weights for small 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.329
 number of repetitions is the reason I don't want to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 muscles looked soft on stage to me 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.829
 need to show their stiffness their tone 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.680
 this is what the judges expect to see. 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.480
 believe what 's good next question 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.579

 tell about your pre competitive 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.469

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.079
 as regards my diet for 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.180
 a couple of days before the start while all 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.430
 increase the amount of carbohydrates i don't 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.740
 repeat after them the amount of carbohydrates 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.740
 stays the same night before 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.909

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.909
 sweet potatoes 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.700
 sometimes sweet sometimes red normal 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.729
 potatoes in the morning the same meal 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.159
 re stakes potatoes i don't act like 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.740
 all I do not raise the level of carbohydrate 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.049
 i keep the average of all these 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.960
 a few days well, if in grams 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.240
 how much is 100 200 grams in the evening 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.659
 on the eve of the tournament about 100 grams 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.830
 after morning again about a hundred but 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.710
 before the tournament another 80 90 grams well 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.740
 but what about the consumption of water and salt but 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.650
 that a week before the tournament I drink almost 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.350
 11 liters of water then in the middle of the week 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.479
 I drink seven and a half liters per 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.970
 three days before the tournament a little more than three and a 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.280
 half a morning before the performance 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.590
 don't drink principle so as you can see 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.750
 at first it is an incredibly large amount 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.509
 which is gradually reduced to almost 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.879
 failure before the tournament 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.180
 ok many fans look at your 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.110
 photo and think the same is not possible with him 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.209
 very very broad shoulders and just 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.329
 incredibly narrow waist what's your 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.370
 the secret is how to achieve this but if 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.739
 my secret is short in perfect makeup 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.560
 you put it properly and you 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.840
 perfect italy but seriously then a 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.760
 no secret this is merit parents it 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.689
 the genetics of what's wrong with me 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.069
 beautiful genetics want narrow waist 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:44.299
 develop the broadest train 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.120
 quadriceps and your deltas then your 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.370
 waist will be visually less and that's all 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.750
 great secret what's your favorite 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.819
 shoulder exercise 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.220
 these are side lifts to the sides with 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.799
 dumbbells every time I train 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.519
 delta I perform 6 7 approaches in this 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.430
 exercise 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.129
 and for abdominal muscles for abdominal muscles 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.530
 lifting legs in hangs is best for me 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.639
 exercise especially to activate the muscles 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.680
 not for the press 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.010

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.260

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.919
