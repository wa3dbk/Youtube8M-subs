in<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.120> video<00:00:03.389> I'm<00:00:03.540> going<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.750> show<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:03.959> how

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.740 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:04.259> work<00:00:04.560> around<00:00:04.710> some<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.640> problems<00:00:06.330> that

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
to work around some of the problems that

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.509 
to work around some of the problems that
can<00:00:07.049> crop<00:00:07.500> up<00:00:07.560> in<00:00:07.859> meshmixer

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
can crop up in meshmixer

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.400 
can crop up in meshmixer
that<00:00:09.059> might<00:00:09.420> cause<00:00:09.599> problems<00:00:09.780> when<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.260> try

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
that might cause problems when you try

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.860 
that might cause problems when you try
to<00:00:10.440> use<00:00:10.769> your<00:00:11.010> mesh<00:00:11.460> mixer<00:00:11.639> output<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.420> sort<00:00:12.809> of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
to use your mesh mixer output in sort of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.860 
to use your mesh mixer output in sort of
downstream<00:00:13.500> programs<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.269> I've<00:00:15.360> got<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.599> sort

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
downstream programs so I've got our sort

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.120 
downstream programs so I've got our sort
of<00:00:15.900> Bunny<00:00:16.109> here<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> head<00:00:16.710> remove<00:00:17.010> I'm

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
of Bunny here with the head remove I'm

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.429 
of Bunny here with the head remove I'm
going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> drop<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.789> dog<00:00:18.060> head<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:19.050> what

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
going to drop on this dog head and what

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.779 
going to drop on this dog head and what
I'm<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.189> over<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.640> play

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
I'm going to do is go over here and play

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.880 
I'm going to do is go over here and play
with<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.000> tweak<00:00:21.539> our<00:00:21.750> setting<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.800> this

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
with this tweak our setting so what this

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.330 
with this tweak our setting so what this
does<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> changes<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.210> sort<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.830> area<00:00:25.830> over

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
does is it changes the sort of area over

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.179 
does is it changes the sort of area over
which<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> part<00:00:27.119> replaces<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.650> existing

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
which the part replaces the existing

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.630 
which the part replaces the existing
surface<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.289> you've<00:00:31.529> got<00:00:31.679> big<00:00:32.099> skinny

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
surface so if you've got big skinny

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920 
surface so if you've got big skinny
triangles<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> end<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.600> part<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
triangles on the end of your part you

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.389 
triangles on the end of your part you
might<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> increase<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.219> avoid

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
might have to increase this to avoid

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.450 
might have to increase this to avoid
what<00:00:35.700> happens<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:36.960> too<00:00:37.079> small<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.280> can

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
what happens if it's too small so we can

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.610 
what happens if it's too small so we can
simulate<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.570> too<00:00:39.719> small<00:00:39.960> by<00:00:40.170> setting<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
simulate if it's too small by setting a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.000 
simulate if it's too small by setting a
really<00:00:40.739> low<00:00:40.920> value<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:43.200> accept<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.829> we

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
really low value and we we accept and we

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.830 
really low value and we we accept and we
see<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.430> these<00:00:44.550> blue<00:00:44.850> edges<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.600> showing

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
see is all these blue edges are showing

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
see is all these blue edges are showing
up<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.200> mean<00:00:47.100> those<00:00:47.250> blue<00:00:47.489> edges<00:00:47.670> when<00:00:48.149> it's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
up I mean those blue edges when it's

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.580 
up I mean those blue edges when it's
blue<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.840> means<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> boundary

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
blue like that means it's a boundary

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.990 
blue like that means it's a boundary
edge<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.250> down<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> bottom

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
edge just like down here at the bottom

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540 
edge just like down here at the bottom
that's<00:00:51.660> open<00:00:52.079> boundary<00:00:52.410> these<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.219> internal

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that's open boundary these are internal

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
that's open boundary these are internal
boundaries<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.660> clean<00:00:55.289> up

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
boundaries now that we want to clean up

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.689 
boundaries now that we want to clean up
fur<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.770> rid<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.160> let's<00:00:56.309> place<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> where

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
fur get rid of so let's place it where

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.240 
fur get rid of so let's place it where
the<00:00:56.789> stitching<00:00:57.210> basically<00:00:57.809> failed<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:59.100> what

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the stitching basically failed so what

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.590 
the stitching basically failed so what
you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> grab<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> selection

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you can do is you grab the selection

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.039 
you can do is you grab the selection
tool<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.680> select<00:01:02.550> around<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
tool and just select around that and you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
tool and just select around that and you
need<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> race<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.489> lucky<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.939> will

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
need a race and if you're lucky it will

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
need a race and if you're lucky it will
just<00:01:06.299> erase<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.990> replace<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.500> nice<00:01:07.770> clean

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
just erase and replace with a nice clean

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.890 
just erase and replace with a nice clean
piece<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.430> mesh<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.420> it'll<00:01:09.659> give<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
piece of mesh and if not it'll give you

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.950 
piece of mesh and if not it'll give you
this<00:01:10.020> message<00:01:10.380> saying<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> can't<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> it

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
this message saying that you can't do it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.000 
this message saying that you can't do it
what<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.020> means<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> selection

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
what that means is that the selection

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.130 
what that means is that the selection
tool<00:01:14.220> didn't<00:01:14.640> work<00:01:14.760> properly<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
tool didn't work properly because of the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.390 
tool didn't work properly because of the
interior<00:01:16.500> boundary<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.920> problems<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
interior boundary of problems and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.090 
interior boundary of problems and
problems<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.420> what<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.070> rid

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
problems so what you do then to get rid

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.460 
problems so what you do then to get rid
of<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.610> click<00:01:20.729> discard<00:01:21.470> that's

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
of it is you just click discard that's

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.020 
of it is you just click discard that's
going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> make<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.070> hole<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.580> threw

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
going to make a little hole like threw

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.460 
going to make a little hole like threw
away<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.240> those<00:01:24.540> triangles<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
away all those triangles and then you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.190 
away all those triangles and then you
just<00:01:25.650> brush<00:01:25.920> select<00:01:26.720> around<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.290> hole<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
just brush select around the hole and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.490 
just brush select around the hole and
erase<00:01:31.200> again<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.340> get<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.759> clean<00:01:33.299> mesh<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
erase again and you get a clean mesh so

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.039 
erase again and you get a clean mesh so
you<00:01:34.590> clean<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.040> area<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:36.060> basically<00:01:36.509> it's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you clean up that area so basically it's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.719 
you clean up that area so basically it's
all<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:38.159> rid<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.549> these

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
all you have to do get rid of all these

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.390 
all you have to do get rid of all these
little<00:01:38.880> glitches

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
little glitches

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.560 
little glitches
there<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.909> same<00:01:42.150> problem<00:01:44.030> same<00:01:45.030> solution

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
there we go same problem same solution

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.120 
there we go same problem same solution
just<00:01:46.530> drag<00:01:46.829> around<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.220> outside<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.659> erase

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
just drag around the outside and erase

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.289 
just drag around the outside and erase
so<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> clean<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.030> any<00:01:51.180> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so you can do that to clean up any of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.410 
so you can do that to clean up any of
those<00:01:51.450> little<00:01:51.720> blue<00:01:51.899> blue<00:01:52.530> holes<00:01:53.420> another

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
those little blue blue holes another

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.109 
those little blue blue holes another
problem<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.990> happen<00:01:55.729> soak<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.880> another

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
problem that can happen soak up another

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.700 
problem that can happen soak up another
model<00:01:57.420> here<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:02.210> NaN<00:02:03.210> manifold<00:02:03.810> engine<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
model here is NaN manifold engine so

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.590 
model here is NaN manifold engine so
that's<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.520> key<00:02:05.610> load<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:05.969> model<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
that's the key load up your model and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.320 
that's the key load up your model and
you<00:02:06.719> see<00:02:06.899> these<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.170> red<00:02:07.439> dots<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.610> red

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
you see these little red dots and red

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.839 
you see these little red dots and red
edges<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> dots<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> vertices<00:02:10.849> or

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
edges so the dots are the vertices or

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.550 
edges so the dots are the vertices or
sometimes<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.420> happens<00:02:12.599> after<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
sometimes this happens after you do in a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.940 
sometimes this happens after you do in a
race

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
race

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.350 
race
operation<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.580> get<00:02:14.730> an<00:02:14.790> automatical

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
operation you can get an automatical

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.670 
operation you can get an automatical
triangle<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.050> fix<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.920> one<00:02:17.069> yet<00:02:17.280> um<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.780> so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
triangle that fix that one yet um and so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.860 
triangle that fix that one yet um and so
these<00:02:20.250> are<00:02:20.310> areas<00:02:20.580> where<00:02:20.910> there's<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.300> three

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
these are areas where there's like three

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.809 
these are areas where there's like three
triangles<00:02:22.709> connected<00:02:23.069> along<00:02:23.220> an<00:02:23.370> edge<00:02:23.489> which

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
triangles connected along an edge which

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.150 
triangles connected along an edge which
can<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> problem<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.560> again<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.950> same<00:02:26.129> thing

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
can be a problem so again the same thing

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.830 
can be a problem so again the same thing
the<00:02:26.400> same<00:02:26.670> solution<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.330> select<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the same solution you just select the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.710 
the same solution you just select the
area<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.220> erase<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.849> usually<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.300> one<00:02:30.480> that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
area and erase and usually this one that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.420 
area and erase and usually this one that
the<00:02:31.110> problem<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.590> both<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.010> selection

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
the problem of both the selection

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.400 
the problem of both the selection
doesn't<00:02:32.580> happen<00:02:32.819> today<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.080> if<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.260> does<00:02:34.380> you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
doesn't happen today but if it does you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.960 
doesn't happen today but if it does you
do<00:02:34.680> discard<00:02:35.099> or<00:02:35.220> than<00:02:35.310> erase<00:02:35.519> whether<00:02:35.819> I'll

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
do discard or than erase whether I'll

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.759 
do discard or than erase whether I'll
you<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.269> just<00:02:36.420> erase<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:39.230> then<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.440> cleaned

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
you can just erase and then you cleaned

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.070 
you can just erase and then you cleaned
up<00:02:40.920> your<00:02:40.950> non<00:02:41.250> manifold<00:02:41.760> edges<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.930> mesh

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
up your non manifold edges and the mesh

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.400 
up your non manifold edges and the mesh
is<00:02:43.260> ready<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.390> using<00:02:45.390> another<00:02:45.750> program<00:02:45.930> where

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
is ready for using another program where

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.990 
is ready for using another program where
those<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.799> manifold<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.489> might<00:02:47.640> cross

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
those not manifold that just might cross

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.870 
those not manifold that just might cross
the<00:02:48.180> crash<00:02:48.420> or<00:02:48.780> something<00:02:49.110> like<00:02:49.230> that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
the crash or something like that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.900 
the crash or something like that
alright<00:02:50.880> that's<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.330> bye
