00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 project sponsor sapphire 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.120
 sapphire our best recommendations 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.220
 Good day with you again 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.160
 techno-cuisine we continue to experience 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.980
 Fresh urban buildings and next in line with us 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.049
 model with 31 get a bag with 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.880
 set in particular with a rate of 3 seconds 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.090
 half inch compartment and continue 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.519
 Urban s31 review can be considered junior 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.539
 brother s41 which we considered in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.269
 April of this year 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 let's compare and so this time not 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.300
 such a massive door thickness 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 aluminum sheet 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.200
 even smaller door and even easier all the same 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.320
 most interface and two usb audio connectors 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.559
 and 2 and beat 30 of 31 a little less by 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.239
 height 51 51 6 centimeters while 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.649
 case lost one in five inch 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.649
 there are 3 compartments left 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.079
 another loss no built-in reobasa but 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.930
 the power button is still aluminum it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.670
 vilorik on the spot in the same way, there are two 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 version of the urban with a large side 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 transparent window like us or with 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.400
 hues covered with sound-absorbing 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.920
 materials maximum amount 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.810
 6 installed hard drives as in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.740
 the previous case is still possible 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.740
 dismantle baskets 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.950
 landing is done using 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.500
 anti-vibration means if earlier under 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.170
 the video card was set at 3.5 centimeters 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.549
 now 29 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.270
 gtx690 per month like any other 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.159
 modern map except hd 7990 two 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.920
 chips and top of a radius of length i.e. 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.820
 one centimeter will not fit in 41 not 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.650
 weight 31 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.229
 if you do not remove the basket thereby 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.210
 reducing the place under the hard drive 6 to three 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.759
 maximum height for the cooler is the same 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.590
 17 centimeters all models except archon 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.030
 fit in nicely still 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.470
 fit liquid system 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.290
 cooling with a radiator for two 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.909
 fan 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.470
 now we continue the right knitting somewhere 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.420
 gone top 20 centimeter 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.180
 fan maker how to speak 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.500
 do not pay extra for him beat out of 31 if 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.299
 going to use a radiator 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.189
 liquid cooling immediately in the housing 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.770
 and put it in general by default in 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.509
 body front and rear only 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.840
 12-meter fans can add 2 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.239
 before 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.120
 fan and top fan two 14 each 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.610
 and 1 bottom 12 centimeter continuing pro 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.180
 climbing now is not 3 but 2 holes 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.980
 under the hoses 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.269
 Well, at least remove its mesh plugs 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.290
 left and kinnexa castle on 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.299
 the developer nobly left everything 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.299
 anti-dust filters including upper 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.400
 go nowhere and soft 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.019
 anti-vibration substrate under the legs and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.019
 Of course there is cable management plus 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.150
 big cutout backplane 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.610
 what was transmitted was a stripped down version with 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.750
 41 it is ideal for a compact system. 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.030
 liquid cooling 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.780
 our reward is gold and you were arina 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.780
 make sure
