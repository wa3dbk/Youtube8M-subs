00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.439
 this apple is still 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.830
 question 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.639
 spin an apple 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.089
 explanations 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.739
 for this exercise we will need a camera from a computer and a 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:15.599
 women 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.179
 a camera stand to also be useful but not essential 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.480
 the important thing is that the camera remains fixed for nan the whole process 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.379
 first of all you have to find a nice place to run your 

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.560
 Apple 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.830
 take a comfortable position so as not to move the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.040
 like 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.090
 Once your subject is centered, trigger the shot 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.560
 very slightly turned your apple 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.310
 and resume your position 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.170
 to trigger the shooting 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.240
 And so on 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 until you get a total sequence 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 in this case a complete tour of our dear people 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 we must now transfer all the photos to the computer 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.250
 for more details see the technical section of the dvd 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.580
 to facilitate handling 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.950
 put all your photos in one folder 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.740
 by choosing the thumbnail view mode you can see the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.040
 photogram of your future animated sequences 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.370
 at this point you can check the dimensions of your images 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.490
 be careful not to work with others to images that might 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.480
 slow down your computer 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.330
 in a general way it is advisable to manipulate images of 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.660
 less than 1000 pixels wide or two authors 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.950
 for this exercise we will use missed james animation software 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.140
 Free 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 you have to load the software images first 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.870
 for this one import the images from the folder where you have them 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.970
 quit 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 the images were stored in the folder 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.280
 as you can see the images are displayed 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.970
 selected 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.070
 add to the list of a port 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.390
 Hoarseness allows you to change the hold time of a single image 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.760
 poutine his move wins in the software scenario 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.969
 you can preview each image by clicking on the key 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.609
 corresponding 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.019
 apple hat is maintained for three images 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.909
 the software is configured 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.589
 to animate at 24 frames per second 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.589
 the apple is animated at 8 frames per second 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.429
 you can also have an overview of the animation m 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.789
 by clicking on the rainy mode a window opens 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.789
 and you can play other animations 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.279
 you just have to export your animation to the video format of your 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.619
 choice 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.809
 first choose the folder where you want to place your video 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.559
 you can change her name to better recognize her 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.559
 then choose how to compress your video 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.499
 compression is essential 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.499
 to store your videos or to send them on the internet 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.069
 you need to find a compromise between the size and the quality of your video 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.779
 attention depending on the length of your video the recording take a little 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:11.739
 of time 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.609
 your animation is now available in video format in the 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:15.930
 hot folder the day of their life
