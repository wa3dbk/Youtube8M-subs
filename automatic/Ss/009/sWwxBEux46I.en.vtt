chemistry<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.620> big<00:00:37.890> new<00:00:38.190> thing<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.820> they

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
chemistry the big new thing that they

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
chemistry the big new thing that they
brought<00:00:39.149> back<00:00:39.420> an<00:00:39.629> ultimate<00:00:40.050> team<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.379> year

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
brought back an ultimate team this year

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
brought back an ultimate team this year
which<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.850> most<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.210> us<00:00:42.360> never<00:00:42.750> really

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
which to most of us never really

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.880 
which to most of us never really
mattered<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.010> pass<00:00:44.250> altima<00:00:44.820> team<00:00:45.059> game<00:00:45.390> modes

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
mattered and pass altima team game modes

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.229 
mattered and pass altima team game modes
but<00:00:46.890> i<00:00:46.950> think<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.370> year<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> does<00:00:48.000> actually

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
but i think this year it does actually

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.959 
but i think this year it does actually
play<00:00:48.870> somewhat<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.980> role<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.520> i<00:00:50.760> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
play somewhat of a role and i just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.180 
play somewhat of a role and i just
wanted<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.660> opinion<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.350> let<00:00:53.070> me

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
wanted to get your opinion and let me

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.639 
wanted to get your opinion and let me
know<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> noticed<00:00:53.940> any<00:00:54.120> difference<00:00:54.719> once

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
know if you noticed any difference once

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.040 
know if you noticed any difference once
your<00:00:55.829> team<00:00:56.070> has<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.420> higher<00:00:57.420> level<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
your team has a higher level of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.319 
your team has a higher level of
chemistry<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.829> also<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.370> chemistry<00:00:59.820> do<00:01:00.149> you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
chemistry and also what chemistry do you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.080 
chemistry and also what chemistry do you
use<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.870> your<00:01:00.899> team<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.430> touch<00:01:02.579> base<00:01:02.879> on

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
use on your team I kind of touch base on

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850 
use on your team I kind of touch base on
this<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> last<00:01:03.780> episode<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> showed

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
this on the last episode where I showed

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.980 
this on the last episode where I showed
you<00:01:04.979> guys<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> LeSean<00:01:06.060> McCoy<00:01:06.090> card<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.960> i

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you guys the LeSean McCoy card that i

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.700 
you guys the LeSean McCoy card that i
had<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.610> kind<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.729> touched<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.869> fact<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
had and kind of touched on the fact that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
had and kind of touched on the fact that
i'm<00:01:10.890> still<00:01:11.159> toying<00:01:11.400> around<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:11.880> things<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
i'm still toying around with things and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.929 
i'm still toying around with things and
that<00:01:13.290> i<00:01:13.350> may<00:01:13.560> go<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.920> two<00:01:14.130> defensive

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that i may go with two defensive

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.850 
that i may go with two defensive
chemistry's<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> defensive<00:01:16.470> side<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
chemistry's on the defensive side of the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.539 
chemistry's on the defensive side of the
ball<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> ignore<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.750> offense<00:01:19.229> but

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
ball and kind of ignore the offense but

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.859 
ball and kind of ignore the offense but
at<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> same<00:01:20.880> time<00:01:21.090> i<00:01:21.150> don't<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.630> i<00:01:21.720> want

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
at the same time i don't know if i want

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
at the same time i don't know if i want
to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.290> because<00:01:22.500> i<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> team<00:01:23.939> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to do that because i do have a team that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.840 
to do that because i do have a team that
is<00:01:24.210> primarily<00:01:24.680> speedrun<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> i<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.640> tell<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
is primarily speedrun and i can tell you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.960 
is primarily speedrun and i can tell you
as<00:01:27.150> I've<00:01:27.470> gotten<00:01:28.470> my<00:01:28.799> speedrun<00:01:29.159> number<00:01:29.759> up

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
as I've gotten my speedrun number up

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120 
as I've gotten my speedrun number up
there<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.479> 70s<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> 80s<00:01:31.320> I've<00:01:31.710> noticed

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
there to the 70s and 80s I've noticed

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.240 
there to the 70s and 80s I've noticed
that<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> Juke<00:01:33.780> players<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that when I Juke players a lot of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
that when I Juke players a lot of
players<00:01:35.460> missed<00:01:36.000> tackles<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
players missed tackles now you know the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.770 
players missed tackles now you know the
defenders<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.549> are<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:39.000> against<00:01:39.420> me<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
defenders that are going against me and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.300 
defenders that are going against me and
I'm<00:01:40.439> gonna<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.799> over<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I'm gonna go over some of the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.880 
I'm gonna go over some of the
chemistry's<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> i'll<00:01:42.150> start<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
chemistry's and i'll start with the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.030 
chemistry's and i'll start with the
speedrun<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.750> boosts<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.560> run

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
speedrun you know that boosts your run

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.310 
speedrun you know that boosts your run
block<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:48.149> elusiveness<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.200> all

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
block and your elusiveness and we all

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.980 
block and your elusiveness and we all
know<00:01:49.500> elusiveness<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.399> kind<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.149> main

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
know elusiveness is kind of the main

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.380 
know elusiveness is kind of the main
stat<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.399> know<00:01:53.520> works<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
stat that you know works out for you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.819 
stat that you know works out for you
when<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.659> make<00:01:54.840> those<00:01:55.020> jus<00:01:55.290> close<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
when you make those jus close and I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.160 
when you make those jus close and I
definitely<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.640> noticed<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.840> my

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
definitely have noticed that my

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
definitely have noticed that my
elusiveness<00:01:58.710> has<00:01:59.100> gotten<00:01:59.579> better<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.479> know<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
elusiveness has gotten better you know I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
do have shady McCoy he's a 99

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.270

rating<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:05.490> I've<00:02:05.610> noticed<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.030> some<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.390> my

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
rating but I've noticed that some of my

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
rating but I've noticed that some of my
other<00:02:06.750> players<00:02:07.080> are<00:02:07.290> definitely<00:02:07.830> able<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
other players are definitely able to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.510 
other players are definitely able to
make<00:02:08.820> defenders<00:02:09.150> miss<00:02:09.540> now<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.340> I've<00:02:11.340> been

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
make defenders miss now and I've been

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.160 
make defenders miss now and I've been
running<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.000> ball<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.240> lot<00:02:12.600> more<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
running the ball a lot more so I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.190 
running the ball a lot more so I
definitely<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.070> run<00:02:14.550> block<00:02:15.200> increase

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
definitely like the run block increase

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.350 
definitely like the run block increase
so<00:02:16.500> again<00:02:17.130> I'm<00:02:17.280> still<00:02:17.520> toying<00:02:17.820> with<00:02:18.090> things

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
so again I'm still toying with things

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.030 
so again I'm still toying with things
the<00:02:18.600> other<00:02:18.630> option<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.320> I'm<00:02:19.560> thinking<00:02:19.740> about

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the other option that I'm thinking about

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.740 
the other option that I'm thinking about
going<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:21.000> man<00:02:21.390> defense<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.290> run<00:02:22.980> stuff

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
going to is man defense and run stuff

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.080 
going to is man defense and run stuff
the<00:02:24.750> reason<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.170> pick<00:02:25.410> run<00:02:25.680> stuff<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.310> honestly

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the reason I pick run stuff is honestly

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.880 
the reason I pick run stuff is honestly
because<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.540> like<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.780> players<00:02:28.200> better<00:02:28.590> than

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
because I like the players better than

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.130 
because I like the players better than
have<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.220> run<00:02:29.430> stuff<00:02:29.730> chemistry<00:02:30.330> than<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.080> do

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
have the run stuff chemistry than I do

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.860 
have the run stuff chemistry than I do
the<00:02:31.500> pass<00:02:31.740> rush<00:02:32.130> chemistry<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.000> always<00:02:33.450> play

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the pass rush chemistry I always play

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.140 
the pass rush chemistry I always play
man<00:02:34.110> defense<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:35.280> there's<00:02:35.520> no<00:02:35.640> question<00:02:36.120> that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
man defense so there's no question that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.590 
man defense so there's no question that
that<00:02:36.300> will<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.900> one<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.410> my<00:02:38.330> one<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.360> my

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
that will be one of my one of my

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.810 
that will be one of my one of my
chemistry's<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.070> kind<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.640> run

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
chemistry's but I kind of like the run

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.330 
chemistry's but I kind of like the run
stuff<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.140> let<00:02:43.290> me<00:02:43.380> go<00:02:43.500> back<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.950> offensive

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
stuff so let me go back to the offensive

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.770 
stuff so let me go back to the offensive
side<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> ball<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.030> we'll<00:02:45.330> talk<00:02:45.600> about

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
side of the ball and we'll talk about

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.020 
side of the ball and we'll talk about
everything<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:47.100> short<00:02:47.430> pass<00:02:47.670> chemistry

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
everything the short pass chemistry

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.300 
everything the short pass chemistry
boosts<00:02:48.690> your<00:02:48.720> pass<00:02:49.200> blocking<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:49.950> catch<00:02:50.130> in

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
boosts your pass blocking your catch in

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.150 
boosts your pass blocking your catch in

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
traffic the long pass chemistry boosts

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.180

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.050 
elusive pneus on defense your zone
defensive<00:03:10.050> chemistry<00:03:10.680> boost<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.790> play

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
defensive chemistry boost the play

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.850 
defensive chemistry boost the play
recognition<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.900> your<00:03:12.959> defenders<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
recognition of your defenders and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.670 
recognition of your defenders and
there's<00:03:14.250> own<00:03:14.490> defensive<00:03:15.180> skills<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:16.350> man

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
there's own defensive skills the man

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.250 
there's own defensive skills the man
boosts<00:03:17.430> your<00:03:17.459> play<00:03:17.970> recognition<00:03:18.630> skills<00:03:18.900> and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
boosts your play recognition skills and

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.930 
boosts your play recognition skills and
then<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> man<00:03:19.770> defense<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.520> if<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.730> find

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
then the man defense so if you find

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.000 
then the man defense so if you find
yourself<00:03:21.090> playing<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.900> lot<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.620> zone<00:03:22.800> you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
yourself playing a lot of zone you

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.110 
yourself playing a lot of zone you
definitely<00:03:23.459> want<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.670> go<00:03:23.790> with<00:03:23.970> that

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
definitely want to go with that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.660 
definitely want to go with that
chemistry<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.840> vice<00:03:24.989> versa<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:26.130> pass<00:03:26.370> rush

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
chemistry and vice versa the pass rush

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.970 
chemistry and vice versa the pass rush
chemistry<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.390> again<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.870> mainly<00:03:28.230> picked<00:03:28.650> run

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
chemistry and again I mainly picked run

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.060 
chemistry and again I mainly picked run
stuff<00:03:29.310> over<00:03:29.640> past<00:03:29.910> because<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.540> players

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
stuff over past because of the players

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.940 
stuff over past because of the players
but<00:03:32.070> they<00:03:32.220> both<00:03:32.640> pass<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.330> run<00:03:33.570> pass<00:03:34.380> rush<00:03:34.739> and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
but they both pass and run pass rush and

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.270 
but they both pass and run pass rush and
run<00:03:35.100> stuff<00:03:36.020> boosts<00:03:37.020> your<00:03:37.050> block<00:03:37.620> shed<00:03:37.980> and

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
run stuff boosts your block shed and

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.580 
run stuff boosts your block shed and
then<00:03:38.430> with<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.760> pass<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.330> boosts<00:03:39.660> /<00:03:39.810> soup<00:03:40.110> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
then with the pass it boosts / soup and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.800 
then with the pass it boosts / soup and
the<00:03:41.100> run<00:03:41.280> stuff<00:03:41.580> boost<00:03:41.940> tackle<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.630> in<00:03:42.690> my

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
the run stuff boost tackle and in my

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.470 
the run stuff boost tackle and in my
opinion<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.290> think<00:03:43.320> tackling<00:03:44.130> maybe<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.209> little

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
opinion I think tackling maybe a little

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.300 
opinion I think tackling maybe a little
more<00:03:45.690> important<00:03:46.170> than<00:03:46.260> pursue<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.920> could<00:03:47.160> be

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
more important than pursue I could be

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.710 
more important than pursue I could be
wrong<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.730> could<00:03:47.880> have<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> different<00:03:48.510> opinion

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
wrong you could have a different opinion

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.750 
wrong you could have a different opinion
but<00:03:49.440> those<00:03:49.650> are<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.860> boots<00:03:50.130> those<00:03:50.459> can<00:03:50.730> be
