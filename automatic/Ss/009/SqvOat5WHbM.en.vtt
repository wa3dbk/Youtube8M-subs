00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello how are you welcome to all of 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.859
 new to my channel today I'm going to make a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.930
 review that a thousand years ago I come to you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.150
 promising and is the revive of brushes 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.380
 and brushs of samantha chapman of the vial 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.540
 thermals with sister rest youtuber that 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.920
 started 34 years ago and the truth is that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 now he has his own brush line 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.260
 there are very good are sold in the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.240
 top page thermal dotcom I think 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.949
 that I'll find out there I'm not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.020
 sure but I think they had sent only 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.460
 USA and Canada 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.070
 and if they are in Argentina, they can 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.740
 buy on ebay dotcom or on antonio 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.230
 puntocom there are many sellers on ebay 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.060
 that what international shipments do 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.920
 exist in europe in bots after 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.660
 I will also find out in all 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.629
 they sell them in world sea also in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 target in fresh myers in any and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.309
 there are never a lot of places where they go 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.020
 to the gondolas and directly to the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 brushes is spectacular 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.220
 I hope in Argentina demonstrate that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.210
 just to be able to buy things 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.250
 that we are looking for 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.320
 and to begin this review I'm going to start 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.480
 with the core collection has a very 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.430
 nice if we open it 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.980
 we have the four paintbrushes this 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.660
 collection is orange and this case 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.450
 has the peculiarity that what 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.740
 we can leave like this or we do not double here 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.740
 we throw this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.380
 and is thus doubled 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.180
 is possible if we want to support it in the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.280
 desk or on the desk and the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.560
 which it is super convenient time each 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.240
 collection or individual brushes has 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.580
 its color the brushes come with a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.310
 metallic color and this part of zinc and 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.130
 rubber and say shines technician paisa 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.590
 champagne blanket and back for example to 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 freezer cons that is telling us 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.340
 which is for outline this 16 is fabulous 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.910
 It is perfect for contouring the face 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.410
 here the nose we can even use it 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.090
 to place the powder in the dark circles and 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.460
 keep in mind that all the brushes 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.210
 are contagious facts that is clear is 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.550
 a synthetic fiber that 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.240
 actually stimulates animal skin and is 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.100
 fantastic 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.580
 animal senses because that makes 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.440
 be by steve and if it's good this is 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.710
 one of the paintbrushes is great 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.660
 love the style can stop 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.460
 one of the things they say is that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.840
 the paintbrushes of love because they stop 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.580
 the writers 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.790
 then inside the collection we have 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.800
 the point &amp; sound edition rice that this 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 It serves both to throw concealer for 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.700
 apply bases to me I find it a bit 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.540
 little ones to apply the base but 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.950
 well we can use it to also 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.330
 contour the face with product in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.900
 cream put also concealers if not 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.880
 only in the dark circles area but in 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.320
 any this granite that we have 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.590
 we also have to say and achieve this 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.560
 brush is super finite is great 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.520
 for lips they are still super jobs 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.440
 of plotting or also for what they are 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.850
 imperfections correct imperfections 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.530
 you can also use it for the eyes myself 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.130
 I do not recommend it because it's pretty 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.780
 pretty pressed is pretty pretty 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.450
 so I think it 's perfect for the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.660
 lips or to hide imperfections 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.760
 and then we have the bafin grass this is 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.830
 my favorite brush to apply base what 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.110
 what they do is place the base and record 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.230
 distribute those with movements 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.230
 circular 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.210
 very good that the base has as it gives a 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.090
 almost total coverage of the base so 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.150
 is 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.120
 inside the brushes that have this is 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.950
 and said as a favorite then we have the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.260
 pink collection within the collection 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.260
 forced I have this which is the shipping 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.500
 es simulates being fiber optic as the 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.799
 sea ​​brush but it's not fiber optic and 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.489
 what you have is simply had in the 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:07.730
 part of the tips this brush is 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.799
 great if you want to have a finish or 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.319
 aer works with the skin when they place the 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.540
 base if you do not want to use it for 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.880
 base can also be used for the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.260
 blush I use it just for that I 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.260
 love applying blush with this brush 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.440
 then within what is 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.490
 the pink collection we have the setting 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.350
 bar I love let's think for 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.260
 which I used to place the illuminator 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.520
 in the cheeks in the nose in the arch 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.600
 cupid and to place the powder in the 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.420
 dark circles to correct in society 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.190
 this is just what has good is 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.830
 that is not as big as him with his 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.810
 arm and we can better handle those 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.150
 shines and where we want to place it 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.830
 and then as last what I have of the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.750
 collection is 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:06.300
 greengrass that is from the collection 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:09.390
 violet and he dances in works the collection 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.780
 I do not like violet very much, I'm not a fan 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.250
 to not for me in my opinion does not have 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.129
 pensions worth buying 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.060
 they also have one 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:22.580
 inside the violet collection 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.310
 a whole collection armed with 4 or 5 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.460
 brushes but not 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.650
 and that are worth buying the sil 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.650
 English I liked it very much because 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:39.930
 stupid is a brush that has many 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.430
 bristles then we can take shade and 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.280
 place it with taps on the body 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.950
 will be perfect and fine line 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.000
 air ras is a brush 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:55.300
 with a very long finite point 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.570
 that gives me great control over the 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.310
 inah so this is all for today I hope 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.560
