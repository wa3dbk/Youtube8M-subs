00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 but it goes later but look speaking 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.670
 who I'm going to talk to the head 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.589
 it is to camilo montoya that has arrived here 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.120
 with us bricklayer good air is 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.160
 really you have moved here 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.710
 because it takes many days exactly me 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.240
 I have here my shower my sleeping bag and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.560
 basically what I do is that I change 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.060
 a little bit of clothes and we keep going 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.800
 but good today I'm going to present you 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.140
 very funny story and also very 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.609
 didactic because I wanted to learn a little 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.199
 fashionable yes clear because as 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.939
 recently you said that you wanted to be 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.099
 my stylist that only what you dreamed 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 I would not have been a presenter so what 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.830
 it happened very I went to a person's workshop 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.420
 that answers that question that we 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.160
 we all do in these events that I 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.020
 I'll put just arrived rachel 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.760
 we started to see what happened and I 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.879
 I also made my suggestions this was what 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.879
 what happened 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.720
 so the process to get there begins 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.150
 radiant to a carpet photos 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.670
 suggestions tests of colors designs and 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.949
 above all a lot of communication with your 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.809
 stylist this year Claudia has in her 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.329
 hands not only to our beloved russell 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.570
 but also to kimberly two branches already 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.519
 gaby espino for me is very important 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.199
 have a designer for each and 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.020
 when you go to the surcharge it is already a decision 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.600
 between three designers tie leasing and the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.700
 3 try to bring them advances on their 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.470
 Dresses was not easy 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.030
 more or less something in particular that was going to 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.539
 highlight the design you have to invest the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.420
 vivid colors of vivid colors has no 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.970
 has shine gabi goes with the leg 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.640
 open with the shoulders to be 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.619
 covered with pegaditos with more 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.240
 we go now the tests with 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.600
 Rachel I remember that year 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 past was in a target but I was 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 all can not be repeated because it gives you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 fear the white because it scares you 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.880
 color that looks clear where you hit 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.280
 where does the spectacular figure and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.869
 where you see mamacita clear besides the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.610
 white is purity then perfect 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.619
 on carpets will always be the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.500
 criticisms but fortunately for 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.600
 claudia our russell already brings his 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.320
 with the one who passes rachel has the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.320
 great body 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.450
 that is a big woman a beautiful woman 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.060
 a woman is like an Amazon and it is that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.150
 who would not want to be your stylist for the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:21.569
 carpet the thing gets better than this 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:25.140
 design and that the temperature that's why 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.190
 I think of this as a flower I love 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.190
 the ice I love 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 I love it because it has like this part 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 towards the front 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:46.810
 the back to the column to the column 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:49.290
 of your recipe to see one last 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.209
 recommendation for russell 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.739
 plus the silver plus it stays with you 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.599
 especially if you want to dance with 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.010
 chayanne 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.769
 good if I already get 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.599
 finally shoemaker to your shoes and 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.060
 Claudia congratulations because with her 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.640
 work assumes a great responsibility 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.799
 I think you look at the time to go to 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.110
 red carpet and the attitude you have is 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.590
 where people rate you clear more than 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.590
 the dress
