00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
at the same time in too many practices

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.930 
at the same time in too many practices
the<00:03:30.810> team<00:03:31.020> has<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.200> study<00:03:31.440> hall<00:03:31.680> at<00:03:31.770> night<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.910> go
