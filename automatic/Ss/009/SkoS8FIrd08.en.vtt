00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.500
 permanently reduce energy costs and the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 increase real estate value in the long term 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.420
 these were the main reasons for the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.710
 energetic redevelopment of this 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.140
 three-family house in penzberg am 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.789
 Lake Starnberg around the renovation 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.859
 easy and fast as possible 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.000
 decided to economize 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.130
 the builder for the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.130
 high performance wood fiber insulation materials 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.380
 from pattex the house is a typical one 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.989
 Construction from the 60s of the 2 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 has good feelings substance are the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.940
 Building envelope but not yet designed 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.219
 is 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.629
 Here you can do the partec renovation 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.460
 solutions for the roof wall in 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.559
 optionally use the floor area and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.610
 bring the building quickly reliable 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.219
 and just the latest 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.870
 energetic stand in the foreground of the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.090
 renovation is the creation of a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.010
 powerful multifunctional 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.859
 Building envelope in the roof and wall 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.989
 a maximum heat and heat 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 soundproofing offers the pavatex 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 reduce wood fiber boards by their 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.850
 high insulation performance energy consumption 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 of the house to a minimum 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.420
 at first it was made of lightweight boards 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.420
 and a wood paneling existing 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.549
 roof construction by 100 mm thick 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.909
 cover term plus wood fiber insulation panels 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.900
 replaced by the pavatex 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.820
 airtight track mgb 0.02 for the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.549
 permanent protection of the roof and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.549
 improved with a vapor-permeable 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.240
 structure because the damp transport 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.680
 simple flat laying of the two 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.470
 System components save time and money 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.840
 At the same time, the pavatex provides money 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.640
 System solution for optimal 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.290
 insulating effect and thus for the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.530
 long - term reduction of 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.600
 energy costs in the facade area 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.939
 the renovation of external walls in several 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.070
 First , a wooden stand is used 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.259
 construction on the eruption still 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.020
 goats existing external walls mounted 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.890
 the spaces between the wooden construction 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.350
 are then with 120 mm para flex 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.990
 the flexible wood fiber insulation materials 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.840
 agreed 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.720
 train the completion of the wall construction 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.270
 60 mm thick pavatex difu term 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.960
 fiberboard they consist of 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.510
 different layers 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.030
 different density and become 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.400
 mounted directly on the wooden stand 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.530
 at the same time as plaster carrier plates 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.290
 act thats employing one 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.840
 additional payment level off that 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.400
 Ensures time and cost savings for 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.440
 a fast construction progress the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.060
 Advantages of this pavatex system solution 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.700
 lies in the fact that by the on dopplung 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.770
 the exterior facade is particularly simple 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.250
 be insulated quickly and inexpensively 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.980
 can 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.290
 also always given in the old building 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.110
 Unevenness in the facade can be achieved 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.780
 compensate quickly and safely 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.200
 the innovative pavatex city ​​plaster 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.280
 support plates we work thanks to their 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.710
 vapor-permeable breathable 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.720
 structure an excellent damp 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.360
 transport in the outer wall in 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.090
 combination with the flexible wood fiber 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.760
 Insulation material afflecks can be zoe wall 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.010
 balancing wet long term without the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.560
 stabilize the danger of mold growth 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.350
 the breathability of the pavatex 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.420
 fiberboard provides at the same time 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.600
 for a comfortable balanced 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.740
 comfortable climate throughout the house 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.510
 At the same time, the massive 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.910
 insulation of energy consumption significantly 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.500
 reduced here at the construction site will be 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.090
 within a month that the private 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.160
 extremely system solutions for diving 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 Facade a practically necessarily that 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.730
 Building on the energetic latest 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.800
 This means for the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.750
 user for the residents of the building 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.160
 a reduction of energy consumption 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.260
 by more than 50 percent 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.960
 in addition there is the increase in value of 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.670
 The property through the insulated pavatex 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.790
 Building shell safe and durable 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.710
 Protected is the building showing how 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.500
 fast and easy also older ones 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.470
 building with in pavatex system solutions 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.660
 energetically refurbish and insulate 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.720
 With pavatex it pays off several times 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.970
 for the person and the environment for the house 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.220
 reduced energy consumption does not save 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.130
 only cash money but comes through the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.209
 related co2 saving too 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.209
 benefit our environment
