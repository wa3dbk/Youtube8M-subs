00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
terms of the quality of them but you can

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.490 
terms of the quality of them but you can
really<00:01:03.270> tell<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:03.809> actually<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
really tell that they actually put in

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.700 
zombie member who actually read you the
original<00:01:53.100> concept<00:01:53.790> art<00:01:54.000> over<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.049> think

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
original concept art over here I think

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.020 
original concept art over here I think
Bryce<00:01:55.950> through<00:01:56.219> all<00:01:56.399> these<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:56.880> not

blah blah blah blah blah helmet because
i'm<00:02:06.689> definitely<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> butcher<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.770> if

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
i'm definitely going to butcher that if

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.240 
i'm definitely going to butcher that if
i<00:02:07.979> actually<00:02:08.190> say<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.770> originally<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:11.069> you

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
i actually say it so originally if you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.920 
i actually say it so originally if you
look<00:02:11.340> at<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> concept<00:02:11.790> art<00:02:12.030> these<00:02:12.300> are<00:02:12.629> this

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
look at the concept art these are this

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.270 
look at the concept art these are this
one

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
one

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.250 
one
actually<00:02:13.670> has<00:02:13.819> dreadlocks<00:02:14.180> from<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.110> back

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
actually has dreadlocks from the back

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.890 
actually has dreadlocks from the back
side<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.400> those<00:02:16.850> got<00:02:17.060> axed<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:17.870> I

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
side of it and those got axed because I

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.199 
side of it and those got axed because I
think<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.260> technol<00:02:19.209> technological

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
think of technol technological

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.330 
think of technol technological
constraints<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.959> they<00:02:21.410> can<00:02:21.590> really<00:02:21.830> get<00:02:22.130> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
constraints and they can really get the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.880 
constraints and they can really get the
actual<00:02:22.730> particles<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.319> effect<00:02:24.800> that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
actual particles and the effect that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.260 
actual particles and the effect that
they<00:02:25.100> wanted<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.640> dreadlock<00:02:26.030> store

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
they wanted for the dreadlock store

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.260 
they wanted for the dreadlock store
correctly<00:02:26.870> or<00:02:27.620> they<00:02:27.920> didn't<00:02:28.190> even<00:02:28.250> try<00:02:29.209> to

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
correctly or they didn't even try to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.930 
correctly or they didn't even try to
attempt<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.020> get<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.709> work<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.400> they<00:02:31.910> just

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
attempt to get that to work so they just

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.330 
attempt to get that to work so they just
threw<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.480> out<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.810> window<00:02:33.160> pretty<00:02:34.160> much<00:02:34.310> a

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
threw that out the window pretty much a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.750 
threw that out the window pretty much a
wide<00:02:34.550> base<00:02:35.410> helmets<00:02:36.410> okay<00:02:36.770> comes<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.459> slide

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
wide base helmets okay comes the slide

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.180 
wide base helmets okay comes the slide
home<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> little<00:02:38.270> bit<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.650> I'm<00:02:39.770> not<00:02:39.920> really<00:02:40.069> a

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
home a little bit but I'm not really a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.390 
home a little bit but I'm not really a
fan<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.610> one<00:02:40.850> in<00:02:40.940> particular<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.220> that's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
fan of this one in particular so that's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.630 
fan of this one in particular so that's
the<00:02:43.580> blah<00:02:44.060> blah<00:02:44.300> blah<00:02:44.540> helmet<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:46.280> next<00:02:46.519> time

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the blah blah blah helmet the next time

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.040 
the blah blah blah helmet the next time
that<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.850> have<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.269> Rekluse<00:02:47.630> helmet

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
that we have is the Rekluse helmet

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.330 
that we have is the Rekluse helmet
basically<00:02:49.000> recluses<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> spider<00:02:50.890> got<00:02:51.890> six<00:02:52.160> eyes

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
basically recluses a spider got six eyes

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.430 
basically recluses a spider got six eyes
three<00:02:52.820> eyes<00:02:52.940> on<00:02:52.970> both<00:02:53.360> sides<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
three eyes on both sides and you get the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.470 
three eyes on both sides and you get the
little<00:02:54.590> things<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.760> guess<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.030> can<00:02:56.180> call<00:02:56.390> them

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
little things I guess you can call them

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.720 
little things I guess you can call them
over<00:02:56.660> here<00:02:57.160> aside<00:02:58.160> from<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.580> pretty

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
over here aside from that it's pretty

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.570

the helmets um basically the glitch with
all<00:04:13.070> of<00:04:13.160> them<00:04:13.280> is<00:04:13.459> that<00:04:13.880> they<00:04:14.060> all<00:04:14.150> have<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
all of them is that they all have the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.970 
all of them is that they all have the
same<00:04:14.630> stats<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.320> they<00:04:15.380> all<00:04:15.470> derive<00:04:15.799> those

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
same stats and they all derive those

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.759

same<00:04:16.220> stats<00:04:16.489> off<00:04:16.729> of<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.060> tox<00:04:17.359> helmet<00:04:17.810> that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
will be fixed eventually that's not by

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.980 
will be fixed eventually that's not by
design<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.810> there'll<00:04:24.530> be<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:24.740> fix<00:04:24.979> for<00:04:25.190> them
