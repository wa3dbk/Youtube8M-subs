00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello friend I would like you to help me 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.710
 when a problem in my aquarium what 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.500
 it happens is that I have a fish tank of 120 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.840
 liters with three medium Japanese seven 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.910
 zebras three benches the boys and one 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.010
 peacock eel what happens is that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.930
 they have been dying I had a problem 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.270
 of says h tries to cure them with water and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.850
 sun and nothing worth mentioning that I already have 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.430
 heater at 28 degrees and after that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.869
 there has been a wave of dead fish 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.699
 they go to a corner of at the bottom of the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.949
 fish tank and I see them as breathing very 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.870
 fast and the next morning it appears 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 dead that you recommend me to do how 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.890
 I can cure my aquarium as you have times 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.360
 incompatible will be impossible 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.250
 treatment of the white point without 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.079
 die some fish in the first place should 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.910
 extend to single hits on that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.530
 aquarium and the rest of fish in the other 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.820
 aquarium water warmer so 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.680
 right now just like this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.180
 aquarium the easiest for your problem 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.760
 would use some medication 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.649
 commercial that has malachite green and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.180
 medicate according to your instructions put 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.100
 an air pump to have is lack of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.270
 oxygen and that does not happen that it catches and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.340
 cross your fingers 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.140
 rodrigo says hello very good your videos 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.760
 a question what are the plants called 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.230
 that you have in front and thank you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.880
 can teach the plants that I have 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.040
 in front of the aquarium these are the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 Nana beans a variety of the Nubia 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.460
 that grows very little and is usually put 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.790
 the area in front of all the aquariums 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.500
 This is a small cut of a plant 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.840
 call crypto account corin and brown 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.120
 which has a reddish brown color and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.130
 against more lighting there will be greater 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.800
 this color here we have the ball of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.740
 moss and this is a variety of a nubia 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.060
 call to the wta has elongated leaves and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.060
 it's pretty simple to maintain 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.760
 and he asks you hello I wanted to make you a 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.730
 question do I have a pool filter that 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.740
 I no longer use is 2,100 liters and I have a 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.720
 100 liter aquarium could you put 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.280
 this filter to my aquarium I will 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.110
 would replace the filter material of the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.420
 from now thank you very much 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.610
 in principle putting the charges 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.230
 appropriate if it will come but you must also 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.790
 take into account the power with which 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.040
 water will not filter 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.110
 often stressed glove foward question 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.090
 hello jose a week ago I pond 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.760
 broke and I put my four punches in a 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.500
 temporary liters tank suit other 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.030
 goal fish and the other day my golf died and 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.920
 it's new and four hours later 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 my other two golfers died 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.340
 there were two golf and if the largest 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.770
 aquarium you can get is 23 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.410
 liters for them 2 I would like to know how 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.060
 they could improve their quality of life will 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.130
 I have recorded thick diffuser 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.840
 bubbles food with tubey face 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.120
 works that is worm to beef is 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.500
 -used and also with pellets like 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.360
 I can improve the quality of life 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.040
 while I have them there I will have them one year 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.060
 while they were organized another fish tank more 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.500
 big 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.630
 and that the others may have died 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.940
 golf and most likely die 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.100
 for too abrupt changes added to 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.320
 the overpopulation of golf and in so few 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.210
 and this causes the toxic levels of 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.490
 water rise to improve the quality of 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.560
 life of the rest of fish in 23 liters 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.970
 will be impossible if there is no other option and 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.860
 is going to be provisional could you use 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.480
 some plastic container 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.490
 large possible or if not several 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.320
 one containers for each time and for 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.180
 course with your filter and your gravel every 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.190
 one the food you have for them is 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.500
 very well you just have to add 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.050
 some boiled vegetable and live food or 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 frozen david fields hello question 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.340
 some questions first I would like to know 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.380
 how to wash my third 40 liter without 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.060
 have to take out the fish because the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.550
 first that at the same time I died two 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.110
 fish when they were in the bag I saw 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.120
 your video of changing the aquarium water 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.460
 and I wanted to know if after doing that 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.190
 Would you then drop the methylene blue and 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.210
 Normal chlorine anti or depends second 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.220
 I bought a bétera 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.590
 I think that's what it's called is a fish tank like 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.270
 about 4 liters I do not know very well and 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.280
 I would like to know if when I buy a fish 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.960
 instead of taking the fish from the bag 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.090
 to take it in the teapot that does not have 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.770
 filter because then in the sachet do not 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.510
 I can stand firm in one place and I 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.340
 they said not to do it because when 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.840
 you buy a fish, they put it in the bag and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.880
 they leave a little air and that's 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.170
 oxygen and if I put them in the will 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.000
 will not have or continue as in the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.710
 bag or I can do carry on 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.420
 Bétera as if it were his fish tank and 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.610
 put it on the big one when I get home 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.260
 those are my doubts and I hope your help 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.790
 Greetings from Mexico, keep making your 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.670
 videos in truth that help a lot 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.380
 we only have to clean 30% of the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.840
 aquarium more or less once a week 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.810
 without removing the fish from the aquarium taking 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.700
 previously prepared new water 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.960
 throwing only anti chlorine and more or 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.000
 less at our temperature 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.680
 aquarium for when you buy fish os 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.390
 I recommend taking them in the bag that you 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.430
 they give because they are ready for such 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.410
 end and we go isolated so no 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.030
 I recommend that of the will of course 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.190
 we must take as little as possible in 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.350
 get home and once there rinse the 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.210
 bag and put it in the aquarium by throwing a 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.860
 little water of this in the bag every 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.660
 five minutes and in a quarter of an hour more 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.520
 or less we can put the fish in the 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.290
 aquarium and the bag and the water that he had 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.450
 inside we should throw it to avoid 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.790
 infections or other diseases when 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.320
 you finish this has been all maybe you know 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.000
 little but I'm going to prepare some 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560
 more questions for the next video and 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.460
 to see if I answer any more in writing 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.220
 bye 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.230
 thanks for watching my videos here you have 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.110
 some more in case you have not seen them or 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.110
