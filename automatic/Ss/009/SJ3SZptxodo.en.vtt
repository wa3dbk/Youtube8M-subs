appreciate<00:02:44.430> all<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> benefits<00:02:45.180> and

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
appreciate all the benefits and

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.319 
appreciate all the benefits and
efficiencies<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.989> brings<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:47.670> RFID<00:02:48.060> system

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
efficiencies that brings the RFID system

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.270 
efficiencies that brings the RFID system
is<00:02:48.600> very<00:02:48.840> automated<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.769> frankly<00:02:50.250> is

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
is very automated and that frankly is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.340 
is very automated and that frankly is
one<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.700> our<00:02:50.820> large<00:02:51.060> cost<00:02:51.420> savings<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.079> didn't

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
one of our large cost savings we didn't

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.500 
one of our large cost savings we didn't
want<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.739> have<00:02:52.980> teams<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.880> people<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.239> would

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
want to have teams of people that would

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.350 
want to have teams of people that would
only<00:02:54.690> grow<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:55.590> got<00:02:55.739> busier<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:57.209> would

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
only grow as we got busier that would

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.539 
only grow as we got busier that would
have<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.810> manually<00:02:58.320> intervene<00:02:58.980> with<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> bags

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549

would<00:03:56.280> miss<00:03:56.459> their<00:03:56.610> flight<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.060> really<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.870> was

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
would miss their flight so really it was

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.990 
would miss their flight so really it was
a<00:03:57.989> significant<00:03:58.830> savings<00:03:59.310> on<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.610> labor<00:03:59.849> side
