interesting<00:01:09.200> thing<00:01:09.590> about<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:10.009> machine<00:01:10.189> is

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
interesting thing about this machine is

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.069 
interesting thing about this machine is
it's<00:01:10.640> capable<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:11.180> doing<00:01:11.329> more<00:01:11.659> than<00:01:11.869> ground

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
it's capable of doing more than ground

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.929 
it's capable of doing more than ground
thought<00:01:12.409> during<00:01:12.710> our<00:01:12.950> testing<00:01:13.340> with<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:13.670> we

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
thought during our testing with this we

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.670 
thought during our testing with this we
found<00:01:14.149> that<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.540> interacts<00:01:14.990> very<00:01:15.320> well<00:01:15.560> with

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
found that it interacts very well with

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.859 
found that it interacts very well with
asphalt<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.969> lot<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.240> times<00:01:17.450> when<00:01:17.719> you<00:01:17.840> are

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
asphalt so a lot of times when you are

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.590 
asphalt so a lot of times when you are
used<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.439> accessing<00:01:19.039> a<00:01:19.189> underground<00:01:20.119> utility

it's in a city street and you have to go

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.249 
it's in a city street and you have to go
ahead<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:22.880> remove<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.240> asphalt<00:01:23.630> in<00:01:23.899> order<00:01:24.140> to

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
ahead and remove the asphalt in order to

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.389 
ahead and remove the asphalt in order to
get<00:01:24.439> to<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.680> problem<00:01:24.860> you're<00:01:25.100> trying<00:01:25.219> to

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
get to the problem you're trying to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.370 
get to the problem you're trying to
solve<00:01:25.640> well<00:01:26.509> then<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:26.840> leads<00:01:27.079> in<00:01:27.320> the

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
solve well then that leads in the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.840
