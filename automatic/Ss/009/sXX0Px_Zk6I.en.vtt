00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello to all these great places for steve 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.570
 packaged earlier so today I'm going 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.519
 explain to you how to increase the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.330
 your computer's buffer 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.670
 so the buffer is a part 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.220
 of the RAM so the ram that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 is used temporarily for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.939
 exchanges with the hard drives between 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 others so by increasing this memory 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.329
 it will improve reading and writing 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.340
 files on the hard drive so 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.040
 it is valid on windows 7 on windows 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.170
 8 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.530
 you must also have at least 1 giga 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.719
 ram but that's good I think even we do not 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.629
 can not have less than 2 gigas on 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.960
 his good so that's what we do 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.730
 again in reggae so says here 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.149
 the registry editor 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.309
 so here is doing well what I say because 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.860
 that otherwise we can disrupt a lot 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.430
 the computer then the path it takes 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.600
 to follow 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.670
 it is this one is ch'ti local machine 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:20.210
 system that and control 7 control then 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:23.640
 we go down call tac session manager 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.020
 memory manager we stay on memory 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 manager is then here actually he's going 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.490
 have to modify this value of which he 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.369
 most likely you did not have it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.009
 less frozen already created but so if you 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.079
 do not have it you have to create it 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.840
 so to create it I remember did 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.079
 right click in the blank void and we 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.040
 still uses world value 32 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.490
 bit 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.799
 even if we are on 64 bits we 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.820
 we choose the 32 bits so that you create 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.149
 an empty value 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.500
 there you just have to enter that name there 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.299
 so who is in the land of oc 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.210
 always with a capital letter in front 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.549
 every first word every word forgiveness 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.429
 so you created it me I'm ready but 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.140
 this one because we know nothing about you 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.140
 create with that name there once you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.050
 did you create it double click on it 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.440
 so with that name if you put it in 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.250
 hexadecimal is then the value this will be 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.670
 f 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.140
 followed by 4 0 1 2 3 4 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.470
 so here's one time you have this 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.330
 new value in hexadecimal f40 okay 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.459
 increase your buffer and it's okay 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.080
 improve reading and writing 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.200
 your files on your hard drive 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.680
 so that's it for this tutorial 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.680
 the next 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
