00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
that's kind of what this board was I

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.970 
that's kind of what this board was I
went<00:02:33.810> out<00:02:33.900> back<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.140> couldn't<00:02:34.470> think<00:02:34.650> anything

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
went out back I couldn't think anything

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.770 
went out back I couldn't think anything
I<00:02:35.250> might<00:02:35.400> have<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.820> back<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.240> would<00:02:36.360> do<00:02:36.570> for

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
I might have that back that would do for

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.720 
I might have that back that would do for
this<00:02:37.070> this<00:02:38.070> board<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> exact<00:02:39.210> right<00:02:40.020> size

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
this this board is the exact right size

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.760 
this this board is the exact right size
to<00:02:41.730> fit<00:02:41.970> inside<00:02:42.420> there<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.930> against<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.500> wall

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
to fit inside there up against that wall

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.860 
to fit inside there up against that wall
and<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:44.190> even<00:02:44.520> already<00:02:44.850> got<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> reinforced

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
and it's even already got a reinforced

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.410 
and it's even already got a reinforced
corner<00:02:46.290> which<00:02:47.220> would<00:02:47.400> go<00:02:47.550> up<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> corner

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
corner which would go up in the corner

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.690 
corner which would go up in the corner
which<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.170> pulled<00:02:49.560> away<00:02:49.710> up<00:02:50.040> there<00:02:50.220> which<00:02:50.550> will

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
which is pulled away up there which will

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.090 
which is pulled away up there which will
allow<00:02:50.940> me<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.240> shove<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.230> flat<00:02:52.710> against<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
wall for some long screws through that

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.110 
wall for some long screws through that
which<00:02:55.830> will<00:02:56.010> press<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.430> back<00:02:56.640> against<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
which will press that back against the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.050 
which will press that back against the
wall<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.810> come<00:02:58.050> from<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.410> outside

now this wood on the side of here much
George<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.670> think<00:03:09.120> it's<00:03:09.270> kind<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.660> press

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
George I think it's kind of like press

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.600 
George I think it's kind of like press
board<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.500> felt<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:11.010> stuff<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.550> here

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
board it felt like this stuff right here

you've<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:12.720> seen<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.170> much<00:03:13.970> what<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.000> might<00:03:15.209> do

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
you've all seen it much what I might do

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.449 
you've all seen it much what I might do

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
is shove this piece in there and put it

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.810 
is shove this piece in there and put it
back<00:03:17.780> if<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.110> find<00:03:19.290> me<00:03:19.500> another<00:03:19.739> board<00:03:20.160> to
