pistols um in this game I don't find

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.510 
pistols um in this game I don't find
that<00:00:34.050> they're<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.380> powerful<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.040> modern

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that they're very powerful in modern

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.610 
that they're very powerful in modern
warfare<00:00:35.550> two<00:00:36.090> especially<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.230> machine

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
warfare two especially with machine

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
warfare two especially with machine
pistols<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> dual<00:00:38.879> magnums<00:00:39.420> were

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
pistols and like the dual magnums were

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560 
pistols and like the dual magnums were
pretty<00:00:39.809> powerful<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.640> yeah<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> even<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
pretty powerful and yeah and even in

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.040 
pretty powerful and yeah and even in
like<00:00:43.219> cod4<00:00:44.219> again<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.210> desert<00:00:45.570> eagle<00:00:45.809> was

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
like cod4 again the desert eagle was

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
like cod4 again the desert eagle was
pretty<00:00:46.260> powerful<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:47.219> yet<00:00:47.370> again<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.879> in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
pretty powerful but yet again in this in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.360 
pretty powerful but yet again in this in
this<00:00:48.329> game<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.690> find<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.350> they're<00:00:50.219> more

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this game I find that they're more

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.360 
this game I find that they're more
difficult<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.879> aim<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.710> they<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.890> not

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
difficult to aim with and they are not

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
difficult to aim with and they are not
as<00:00:53.640> powerful<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.750> were<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.140> previous

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
as powerful as they were in previous

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.049 
as powerful as they were in previous
game<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> haven't<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.520> asked<00:00:56.760> them<00:00:56.850> so

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
game so I haven't really asked them so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.310 
game so I haven't really asked them so
much<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.480> prefer<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.260> run<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> Strela<00:00:59.039> instead

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
much I prefer to run the Strela instead

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
much I prefer to run the Strela instead
so<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> first<00:01:01.620> pistol<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.789> looking

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so the first pistol going to be looking

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.050 
so the first pistol going to be looking

decently close range and two shots of
the<00:01:27.240> head<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.630> when<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> says<00:01:28.020> two<00:01:28.170> shots<00:01:28.409> to

the head so when it says two shots to
the<00:01:28.560> head<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.890> means<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the head it means because you are at a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.200 
the head it means because you are at a
close<00:01:30.570> range<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.280> hip<00:01:32.490> multiplier<00:01:32.970> would

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
close range and the hip multiplier would

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.800 
close range and the hip multiplier would
be<00:01:34.460> 1.4<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.670> even<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.060> shot<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> head<00:01:36.570> one

be 1.4 so even one shot to the head one

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.630 
be 1.4 so even one shot to the head one
shut<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> body<00:01:37.439> you'd<00:01:38.040> end<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.310> killing

shut up to the body you'd end up killing

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.230 
shut up to the body you'd end up killing
your<00:01:38.729> enemy<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:40.140> gun<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.820> again<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
your enemy this gun is again all the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.420 
your enemy this gun is again all the
pistols<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.840> high<00:01:43.049> mobility<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:43.950> used

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
pistols have high mobility and are used

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.100 
pistols have high mobility and are used
for<00:01:44.579> close-range<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.390> they<00:01:45.960> are

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
for close-range because they are

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.230 
for close-range because they are
basically<00:01:46.409> meant<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.520> finishing<00:01:47.820> off<00:01:47.970> kills

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
basically meant for finishing off kills

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.260 
basically meant for finishing off kills
so<00:01:48.479> yes<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.259> close<00:01:49.439> range<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:50.460> even

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
so yes they are for close range now even

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.819 
so yes they are for close range now even
when<00:01:51.390> off<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.689> gun<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.290> away<00:01:52.500> when<00:01:52.740> you

similar to the ASP the SP does reload

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.130

quicker<00:02:57.700> than<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.090> gun<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:58.360> find<00:02:58.720> much

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
quicker than this gun I find much

quicker<00:02:59.380> than<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.709> gun<00:03:00.030> but<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.420> gun<00:03:01.660> tends

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
quicker than this gun but this gun tends

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.070

to have larger or more attachments than
the<00:03:05.200> SP<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.560> think<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.890> ASP<00:03:06.190> only<00:03:06.370> has<00:03:06.489> dual

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
the SP I think the ASP only has dual

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.970 
the SP I think the ASP only has dual
wield<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.450> one<00:03:07.660> has<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:08.260> bunch<00:03:08.739> more

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
wield this one has a bunch more

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.590 
wield this one has a bunch more
attachments<00:03:09.610> which<00:03:09.760> really<00:03:10.000> makes<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.390> gun

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
attachments which really makes this gun

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.660

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
are an attachment that's not in the SP

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.690 
are an attachment that's not in the SP
so<00:04:20.080> you<00:04:20.140> use<00:04:20.410> one<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.620> these<00:04:20.770> guns<00:04:21.040> or<00:04:21.580> maybe

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
so you use one of these guns or maybe

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.030 
so you use one of these guns or maybe
you<00:04:21.880> do<00:04:22.060> like<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.390> quick<00:04:22.720> reload<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.380> that's

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
you do like the quick reload and that's

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.250 
you do like the quick reload and that's
when<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.400> would<00:04:24.490> use<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.820> ASP<00:04:25.300> all<00:04:25.510> right<00:04:26.140> so

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
when you would use the ASP all right so

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.930 
when you would use the ASP all right so
you<00:04:26.350> see<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.620> recoil<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.190> recoilless<00:04:27.730> kind

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
you see the recoil the recoilless kind

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.310 
you see the recoil the recoilless kind
isn't<00:04:28.060> too<00:04:28.300> drastic<00:04:28.780> at<00:04:28.870> all<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.140> very

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
isn't too drastic at all it's very

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.650 
isn't too drastic at all it's very
little<00:04:29.620> as<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.950> said<00:04:30.010> it's<00:04:30.880> two<00:04:31.150> shots<00:04:31.390> of<00:04:31.510> the

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
yeah so the next gun we're going to be

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.250 
yeah so the next gun we're going to be
looking<00:04:39.220> at<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.580> revolver<00:04:40.240> this<00:04:40.420> gun<00:04:41.050> is<00:04:41.200> the

kill<00:04:56.550> mobility<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.700> good<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.180> this<00:04:58.300> range<00:04:58.570> is

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
kill mobility is good and this range is

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.330 
kill mobility is good and this range is
close<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.140> medium<00:04:59.440> i<00:04:59.530> put<00:04:59.740> medium<00:05:00.130> just

close to medium i put medium just

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.340 
close to medium i put medium just
because<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.730> does<00:05:00.880> have<00:05:01.060> higher<00:05:01.240> powers<00:05:01.660> so

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
because it does have higher powers so

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.960 
because it does have higher powers so
you<00:05:02.440> could<00:05:02.680> kill<00:05:02.890> people<00:05:03.190> at<00:05:03.310> further<00:05:03.520> ranges

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
you could kill people at further ranges

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.910 
you could kill people at further ranges
as<00:05:04.090> well<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:05.110> can<00:05:05.140> unlock<00:05:05.380> this<00:05:05.620> kind<00:05:05.830> of

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
as well and you can unlock this kind of

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.340 
as well and you can unlock this kind of
level<00:05:06.100> 18<00:05:06.430> now<00:05:07.030> specifically<00:05:07.660> about<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:08.140> gun

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
level 18 now specifically about this gun

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.380 
level 18 now specifically about this gun
which<00:05:08.560> makes<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.860> better<00:05:09.040> is<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.580> has<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.150> much

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
which makes it better is it has a much

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.760 
which makes it better is it has a much
higher<00:05:10.420> packet<00:05:10.930> well<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.170> has<00:05:11.290> a<00:05:11.320> higher<00:05:11.560> power

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
higher packet well it has a higher power

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.480 
higher packet well it has a higher power
than<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.040> other<00:05:12.190> two<00:05:12.220> guns<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:14.340> again<00:05:15.340> the

than the other two guns and again the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.680 
than the other two guns and again the
drawback<00:05:15.850> for<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.150> gun<00:05:16.330> would<00:05:16.450> be<00:05:16.570> the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
drawback for this gun would be the

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.180 
drawback for this gun would be the
reload<00:05:17.020> time<00:05:17.050> because<00:05:17.560> it<00:05:17.590> does<00:05:17.830> reload

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
reload time because it does reload

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.230 
reload time because it does reload
individually<00:05:18.820> but<00:05:19.360> there<00:05:19.540> is<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:20.080> reload

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
individually but there is a reload

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.430 
individually but there is a reload
attachment<00:05:22.240> which<00:05:22.390> would<00:05:22.570> be<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.870> speed

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
attachment which would be the speed

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.350 
attachment which would be the speed
reloader<00:05:23.800> which<00:05:24.010> just<00:05:24.310> basically<00:05:24.430> has<00:05:25.330> a

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
reloader which just basically has a

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.060 
reloader which just basically has a
holder<00:05:26.110> for<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.320> bullet<00:05:26.590> so<00:05:26.740> you<00:05:26.830> don't<00:05:26.980> have

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
holder for the bullet so you don't have

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.890 
holder for the bullet so you don't have
to<00:05:27.220> insert<00:05:27.820> one<00:05:28.030> by<00:05:28.150> one<00:05:28.390> you<00:05:28.510> just<00:05:28.540> insert

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
to insert one by one you just insert

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.810 
to insert one by one you just insert
them<00:05:29.080> all<00:05:29.200> at<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.410> same<00:05:29.560> time<00:05:29.620> now<00:05:30.520> has<00:05:30.790> a

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
them all at the same time now has a

them all at the same time now has a
smaller<00:05:31.150> magazine<00:05:31.540> size<00:05:31.750> but<00:05:31.990> yet<00:05:32.110> again<00:05:32.230> you

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
have it a little a little bit more

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.590 
have it a little a little bit more
flexibility<00:05:34.660> and<00:05:34.780> range<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.350> in<00:05:36.310> power

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
flexibility and range and in power

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.360 
flexibility and range and in power

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860 
just two things it'll be basically

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.520 
just two things it'll be basically
explaining<00:07:28.789> them<00:07:29.030> whatever<00:07:29.210> and<00:07:29.599> yeah<00:07:30.259> so

personally<00:07:31.400> in<00:07:31.550> this<00:07:31.699> segment<00:07:32.270> I<00:07:32.539> like<00:07:32.569> or<00:07:33.289> the

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:33.469 
personally in this segment I like or the

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:35.409 
personally in this segment I like or the
best<00:07:33.650> pistol<00:07:33.830> that<00:07:34.550> I<00:07:34.610> find<00:07:34.940> would<00:07:35.150> ever<00:07:35.270> be

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:35.419 
best pistol that I find would ever be

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:39.580 
best pistol that I find would ever be
the<00:07:35.509> Python<00:07:35.870> or<00:07:35.900> the<00:07:36.729> cz-75<00:07:37.729> sees<00:07:38.360> add<00:07:38.690> 75<00:07:39.169> I

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:39.590 
the Python or the cz-75 sees add 75 I

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.320 
the Python or the cz-75 sees add 75 I
don't<00:07:40.039> like<00:07:40.190> the<00:07:40.340> other<00:07:40.460> three<00:07:40.849> they're<00:07:41.180> all

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.330

basically similar very similar and I do

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.339 
basically similar very similar and I do
like<00:07:44.180> the<00:07:44.210> Python<00:07:44.659> because<00:07:44.870> it<00:07:44.960> does<00:07:45.110> have<00:07:45.259> the

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:45.349 
like the Python because it does have the

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:47.350 
like the Python because it does have the
power<00:07:45.500> it<00:07:45.830> usually<00:07:46.280> should<00:07:46.520> be<00:07:46.669> a<00:07:46.699> two<00:07:46.940> shot<00:07:47.150> to

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 
power it usually should be a two shot to

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.170
