our<00:00:28.119> shark<00:00:28.509> range<00:00:28.840> this<00:00:29.079> year<00:00:29.140> is<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.439> little

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
our shark range this year is a little

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.310 
our shark range this year is a little
different<00:00:30.040> than<00:00:30.160> before<00:00:30.419> we<00:00:31.419> incorporated

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
different than before we incorporated

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.709 
different than before we incorporated
our<00:00:32.500> former<00:00:32.950> Eagles<00:00:33.370> into<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.149> shark<00:00:34.420> range

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
our former Eagles into the shark range

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.770 
our former Eagles into the shark range
and<00:00:35.020> we're<00:00:35.380> featuring<00:00:35.590> six<00:00:36.160> sizes<00:00:36.700> with<00:00:37.360> three

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
and we're featuring six sizes with three

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.759 
and we're featuring six sizes with three
completely<00:00:38.320> new<00:00:38.829> shapes<00:00:39.510> 135<00:00:40.739> 150<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:42.269> 165

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
completely new shapes 135 150 and 165

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.229 
completely new shapes 135 150 and 165
looking<00:00:44.769> at<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.039> three<00:00:45.250> bigger<00:00:45.489> sizes<00:00:45.879> you

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
looking at the three bigger sizes you

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.209 
looking at the three bigger sizes you
will<00:00:46.420> notice<00:00:46.809> quite<00:00:47.499> some<00:00:47.800> big<00:00:47.980> differences

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
will notice quite some big differences

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.549 
will notice quite some big differences
to<00:00:48.730> our<00:00:48.850> previous<00:00:49.269> freeride<00:00:49.780> boards<00:00:50.140> the

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
to our previous freeride boards the

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.739 
to our previous freeride boards the
boards<00:00:50.829> are<00:00:50.949> shorter<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.879> outlines<00:00:52.329> are<00:00:52.570> more

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
boards are shorter the outlines are more

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.989 
boards are shorter the outlines are more
compact<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:54.100> pin<00:00:54.309> heads<00:00:54.550> are<00:00:54.760> quite

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
compact and the pin heads are quite

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.110 
compact and the pin heads are quite
drawn<00:00:55.329> in<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.829> pin<00:00:57.039> heads<00:00:57.309> not<00:00:57.760> having

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
drawn in with the pin heads not having

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.360 
drawn in with the pin heads not having
so<00:00:58.300> much<00:00:58.480> area<00:00:58.749> it<00:00:59.379> actually<00:00:59.409> supports<00:00:59.949> the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
so much area it actually supports the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.069 
so much area it actually supports the
driving<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.909> board's<00:01:01.179> dive<00:01:01.449> easier<00:01:01.870> because

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
driving the board's dive easier because

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.290 
driving the board's dive easier because
you<00:01:02.379> don't<00:01:02.559> have<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.829> put<00:01:03.039> so<00:01:03.069> much<00:01:03.429> area<00:01:03.730> into

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
you don't have to put so much area into

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.040 
you don't have to put so much area into
the<00:01:04.390> water<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:05.140> go<00:01:05.290> around<00:01:06.510> another<00:01:07.510> benefit

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
the water to go around another benefit

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.560 
the water to go around another benefit
is<00:01:08.080> once<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:09.070> actually<00:01:09.250> are<00:01:09.580> going<00:01:09.790> you<00:01:10.360> don't

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
is once you actually are going you don't

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.600 
is once you actually are going you don't
have<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:10.900> much<00:01:11.050> drag<00:01:11.409> in<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.710> tail<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.130> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
have so much drag in the tail and the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.050 
have so much drag in the tail and the
board<00:01:12.880> sort<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.300> goes<00:01:13.510> limitless<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.260> speed

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
board sort of goes limitless in speed

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.400 
board sort of goes limitless in speed
the<00:01:16.060> additional<00:01:16.540> width<00:01:16.750> in<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.020> center

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
the additional width in the center

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.530 
the additional width in the center
though<00:01:17.560> gets<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.430> going<00:01:18.640> initially<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.390> this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
though gets you going initially and this

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.510 
though gets you going initially and this
is<00:01:19.660> what<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:19.960> need<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.260> go<00:01:20.440> this<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.770> what<00:01:21.040> free

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
is what you need to go this is what free

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
is what you need to go this is what free
riding<00:01:21.730> is<00:01:21.970> about<00:01:22.300> you<00:01:22.720> want<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.020> get<00:01:23.170> going

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
riding is about you want to get going

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.490 
riding is about you want to get going
that's<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.010> major<00:01:24.370> part<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:25.900> on<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> plane

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
that's the major part get on the plane

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.400 
that's the major part get on the plane
and<00:01:26.800> start<00:01:27.610> moving<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.270> once<00:01:28.960> you're<00:01:29.170> there

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
and start moving and once you're there

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.140 
and start moving and once you're there
there's<00:01:29.710> really<00:01:29.950> no<00:01:30.130> limit<00:01:30.430> in<00:01:30.520> these<00:01:30.730> boards

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
there's really no limit in these boards

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.270 
there's really no limit in these boards
and<00:01:31.360> I<00:01:31.420> think<00:01:31.660> that's<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.990> nice<00:01:32.170> thing<00:01:32.530> they

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
and I think that's the nice thing they

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.700 
and I think that's the nice thing they
feature<00:01:33.580> plane<00:01:34.150> V<00:01:34.390> in<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.660> tail<00:01:34.930> with<00:01:35.680> a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
feature plane V in the tail with a

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.500 
feature plane V in the tail with a
slight<00:01:36.010> double<00:01:36.430> concave<00:01:36.640> up<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.300> nose

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
slight double concave up to the nose

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.600 
slight double concave up to the nose
that<00:01:38.140> makes<00:01:38.380> cutting<00:01:38.650> through<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.070> chop<00:01:39.310> easy

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
that makes cutting through the chop easy

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.900 
that makes cutting through the chop easy
and<00:01:39.940> also<00:01:40.420> gives<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.260> this<00:01:41.410> initial<00:01:41.980> Glide<00:01:42.250> so

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
and also gives you this initial Glide so

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.990 
and also gives you this initial Glide so
all<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.660> all<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:44.050> very<00:01:44.200> compact<00:01:45.130> shape

all in all a very compact shape

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.330 
all in all a very compact shape

boards that phonetic the new sharks were

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.830 
boards that phonetic the new sharks were
designed<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.640> deliver<00:01:51.940> what<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.270> expect<00:01:52.720> from

the freeride board they're easy to say

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.360 
the freeride board they're easy to say
they<00:01:55.690> get<00:01:55.810> quick<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.440> plane<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.950> they're

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
they get quick on the plane and they're

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.550 
they get quick on the plane and they're
