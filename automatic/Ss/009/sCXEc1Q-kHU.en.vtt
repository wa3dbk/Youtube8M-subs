00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 in this short video I will show you 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.630
 how to build three types of small weapons 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.030
 the first with stationery 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.800
 weapon consists of a tube the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.789
 urchin is a pen then in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 practice almost a hole you take 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:50.850
 bullets in then blow it and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:56.340
 tickets succeed well at the second 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.789
 weapon is a little more professional it is 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.859
 constituted always by a pen this 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.260
 it was a piece of pen and this is it 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.619
 that was inside the one you are with 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.820
 inscribes where there is ink then I have 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.619
 put on a rubber band and here is an old one 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.270
 syringe with cap and syringe 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:25.130
 unlike the previous project 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.130
 we will serve as a magazine supply 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.360
 but obviously just a little bit 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.380
 as you can see it can contain many more 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:59.310
 dots this is how it works 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 make your debut then go when I shoot 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:16.170
 back 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:17.720
 a ball goes down obviously not 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:30.270
 we seem to be very powerful 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:31.920
 then and this is what this really is about 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.000
 right a pipe 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.209
 then I think I had it right away 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.209
 pen and then without the same method 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:59.840
 last a bit of okay bullets and yes 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.840
 shoot special now when a bullet 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.770
 at the end of rieti 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:27.090
 ok ok the next video will do on how 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.280
 build a small gun shoots 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.280
 matches or toothpicks bye
