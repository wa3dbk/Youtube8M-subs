and<00:00:23.550> that'll<00:00:23.760> usually<00:00:23.850> last<00:00:24.210> me<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.870> until<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
and that'll usually last me up until the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.410 
and that'll usually last me up until the
next<00:00:25.530> season<00:00:25.800> because<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.120> lean

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
sometimes it can overcook and become a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.630 
sometimes it can overcook and become a
little<00:00:30.510> bit<00:00:30.660> dry<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.530> I<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> grill<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.489> up

if<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.469> feel<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.989> way<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.140> handle<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.680> meat

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
if you feel the way you handle the meat

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.440 
if you feel the way you handle the meat
in<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.010> field<00:02:37.310> greatly<00:02:37.790> influences<00:02:38.269> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
in the field greatly influences the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.780 
in the field greatly influences the
taste<00:02:38.689> if<00:02:39.200> handled<00:02:39.379> correctly<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:40.400> can<00:02:40.579> avoid

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.290 

I<00:02:44.959> think<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.890> best<00:02:46.069> way<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.310> store<00:02:46.610> venison<00:02:47.150> is

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
I think the best way to store venison is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.479 
I think the best way to store venison is
to<00:02:47.480> vacuum<00:02:47.900> seal<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.200> in<00:02:48.440> plastic<00:02:48.920> bags<00:02:49.129> for

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
to vacuum seal it in plastic bags for

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.770 
to vacuum seal it in plastic bags for
