hole there in the quarter panel so then
I<00:00:24.160> put<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.760> antenna<00:00:25.029> and<00:00:25.240> mounted<00:00:25.570> it<00:00:25.689> you

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
I put the antenna and mounted it you

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.790 
I put the antenna and mounted it you
know<00:00:25.990> no<00:00:26.200> big<00:00:26.380> deal

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800

what looks like they chopped off the old
antenna<00:00:32.290> plug<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:33.030> obviously<00:00:34.030> you<00:00:34.390> know

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
antenna plug and obviously you know

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.549 
antenna plug and obviously you know
that's<00:00:34.660> not<00:00:34.780> going<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:34.989> work<00:00:35.140> with<00:00:35.290> this<00:00:35.410> new

whatever tape or heat shrink I generally
prefer<00:01:21.270> heat<00:01:21.630> shrink<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.050> at<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> moment<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
prefer heat shrink but at the moment and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:33.680 
prefer heat shrink but at the moment and
then<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.300> need<00:01:24.300> some<00:01:24.420> zip<00:01:24.630> ties<00:01:24.660> as<00:01:25.020> well

okay so as you can see now I've cut the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.130 
okay so as you can see now I've cut the
end<00:01:36.160> off<00:01:36.280> from<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.850> antenna<00:01:37.120> adapter<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.930> now

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
end off from the antenna adapter and now

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.450 
end off from the antenna adapter and now
what<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.410> have<00:01:38.560> here<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:39.040> you<00:01:39.190> see<00:01:39.220> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
what you have here is you see the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.690 
what you have here is you see the
shielding<00:01:40.000> here<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:41.650> inside<00:01:42.250> behind

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
shielding here and then inside behind

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.430 
shielding here and then inside behind
this<00:01:43.090> pull<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.950> stuff<00:01:45.220> here<00:01:45.580> you'll<00:01:45.790> see<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
this pull this stuff here you'll see the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.410 
this pull this stuff here you'll see the
the<00:01:47.440> inner<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:47.920> our<00:01:48.130> wire<00:01:48.850> inside<00:01:49.180> there's

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
the inner and our wire inside there's

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.820 
the inner and our wire inside there's
very<00:01:49.840> very<00:01:49.960> thin<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:50.500> you're<00:01:50.590> going<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.740> be

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
very very thin so you're going to be

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.870 
very very thin so you're going to be
real<00:01:50.950> careful<00:01:51.220> with<00:01:51.460> this<00:01:51.580> part<00:01:53.580> okay<00:01:54.580> so<00:01:54.670> now

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
real careful with this part okay so now

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.580 
real careful with this part okay so now
you<00:01:54.940> can<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.240> peeled<00:01:55.570> off<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.990> plastic

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
you can see I peeled off the plastic

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.380 
you can see I peeled off the plastic
shielding<00:01:57.040> on<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.220> inside<00:01:57.730> for<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.150> little

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
shielding on the inside for that little

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.230 
shielding on the inside for that little
tiny<00:01:58.600> wire<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.760> didn't<00:02:00.760> want<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.940> be<00:02:01.030> real

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
tiny wire so didn't want to be real

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.850 
tiny wire so didn't want to be real
careful<00:02:01.720> with<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:02.110> kind<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.500> guy<00:02:02.740> we're

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
careful with that kind of that guy we're

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.930 
careful with that kind of that guy we're
going<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.010> end<00:02:03.160> up<00:02:03.190> starting<00:02:03.550> over<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.850> the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
going to end up starting over to the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.580 
going to end up starting over to the
other<00:02:04.090> end<00:02:04.300> and<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.840> same<00:02:04.870> exact<00:02:05.350> thing<00:02:05.470> we're

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
other end and the same exact thing we're

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.370 
other end and the same exact thing we're
going<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.740> be<00:02:05.860> doing<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.810> piece<00:02:08.080> inside

to sire them alright so as you can see
there<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.230> soldered<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:23.890> metal<00:02:24.159> cable<00:02:24.459> there

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
there I soldered that metal cable there

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.420 
there I soldered that metal cable there
and<00:02:24.730> now<00:02:24.819> I'm<00:02:24.879> going<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.030> go<00:02:25.150> ahead<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:25.540> just

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and now I'm going to go ahead and just

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.910 
and now I'm going to go ahead and just
see<00:02:27.430> if<00:02:27.459> I<00:02:27.579> left<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.909> little<00:02:28.120> bit<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.480> I

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
see if I left a little bit of the I

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.280 
see if I left a little bit of the I
guess<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.069> get<00:02:30.250> splinters<00:02:30.579> there<00:02:31.170> I'm<00:02:32.170> going

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
guess you get splinters there I'm going

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.869 
guess you get splinters there I'm going
to<00:02:32.409> wrap<00:02:32.709> those<00:02:32.859> back<00:02:33.069> around<00:02:33.280> there<00:02:33.549> and<00:02:33.790> then

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
to wrap those back around there and then

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.910 
to wrap those back around there and then
tape<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.390> up<00:02:34.510> real<00:02:34.900> nice<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.349> doesn't<00:02:35.680> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
tape it up real nice so it doesn't you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.089 
tape it up real nice so it doesn't you
know<00:02:35.980> come<00:02:36.189> in<00:02:36.280> contact<00:02:36.459> with<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.849> shielding

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
know come in contact with the shielding

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.800 
know come in contact with the shielding
okay<00:02:39.099> so<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.489> got<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.849> taped<00:02:40.090> up<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.569> another

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
okay so I got that taped up and another

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.819 
okay so I got that taped up and another
thing<00:02:40.900> you're<00:02:40.989> going<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:41.140> want<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.409> do<00:02:41.530> which<00:02:41.709> I

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
thing you're going to want to do which I

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.130 
thing you're going to want to do which I
personally<00:02:42.099> do<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.640> just<00:02:43.450> take<00:02:43.659> you<00:02:43.900> know<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
personally do is just take you know the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.770 
personally do is just take you know the
clips<00:02:44.439> off<00:02:44.560> ends<00:02:44.829> of<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.980> zip<00:02:45.159> tie<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:46.510> put

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
clips off ends of a zip tie just put

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.390 
clips off ends of a zip tie just put
them<00:02:46.870> right<00:02:46.989> up<00:02:47.109> against<00:02:47.530> right<00:02:47.920> up<00:02:48.040> against

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
them right up against right up against

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.610 
them right up against right up against
there<00:02:48.489> just<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:48.909> it'll<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.329> nice<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.019> squinted

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
there just so it'll be nice and squinted

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.990 
there just so it'll be nice and squinted
so<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.859> doesn't<00:02:51.129> you<00:02:51.340> know<00:02:51.489> no<00:02:51.609> chance<00:02:51.849> of<00:02:51.970> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
so it doesn't you know no chance of that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.330 
so it doesn't you know no chance of that
bending<00:02:52.389> cuz<00:02:52.510> there's<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.780> thin<00:02:53.019> wire<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.650> you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
bending cuz there's a thin wire so you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.890 
bending cuz there's a thin wire so you
know<00:02:54.430> much<00:02:54.609> bending<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.090> that's<00:02:55.329> not<00:02:55.659> going<00:02:55.810> to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
know much bending on that's not going to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.270 
know much bending on that's not going to
do<00:02:55.989> very<00:02:56.230> good<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:56.560> going<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.769> just<00:02:56.889> you<00:02:57.250> know

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
do very good it's going to just you know

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.129 
do very good it's going to just you know
go<00:02:57.459> ahead<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.700> break<00:02:57.879> so<00:02:58.359> I'll<00:02:58.720> go<00:02:58.840> ahead<00:02:59.019> and

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
go ahead and break so I'll go ahead and

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.039 
go ahead and break so I'll go ahead and
do<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.790> okay<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.150> as<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.269> can<00:03:01.510> see<00:03:01.659> here<00:03:01.870> now

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
do that okay and as you can see here now

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.899 
do that okay and as you can see here now
I've<00:03:02.260> went<00:03:02.560> ahead<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.889> soldered<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:03.670> little

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
I've went ahead and soldered a little

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.119 
I've went ahead and soldered a little
extension<00:03:04.299> key<00:03:04.450> wire<00:03:04.870> from<00:03:05.170> one<00:03:05.439> side<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
extension key wire from one side of the

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.830 
extension key wire from one side of the
shielding<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.670> other<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.629> what<00:03:07.750> I'm

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
shielding to the other and what I'm

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.940 
shielding to the other and what I'm
going<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:07.989> do<00:03:08.139> now<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.439> that's<00:03:08.590> out<00:03:08.769> it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
going to do now that that's out it

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.800 
going to do now that that's out it
together<00:03:09.189> I'm<00:03:09.459> going<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.670> go<00:03:09.760> ahead<00:03:09.879> and<00:03:10.180> give

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
together I'm going to go ahead and give

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.080 
together I'm going to go ahead and give
some<00:03:10.959> extra<00:03:11.170> wire<00:03:11.439> like<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.099> here<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.700> then

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
some extra wire like this here and then

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.849 
some extra wire like this here and then
use<00:03:13.269> that<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.629> wrap<00:03:13.870> all<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.230> way<00:03:14.260> around<00:03:14.349> that

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
use that to wrap all the way around that

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.949 
use that to wrap all the way around that
entire<00:03:15.010> thing<00:03:15.459> there<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.480> know<00:03:16.540> just<00:03:16.810> set

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
entire thing there so you know just set

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.500 
entire thing there so you know just set
them<00:03:17.129> have<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.430> be<00:03:18.639> similar<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.299> how<00:03:19.450> that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
them have it just be similar to how that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.930 
them have it just be similar to how that
shielding<00:03:19.989> was<00:03:20.139> already<00:03:20.440> um<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.489> could<00:03:21.760> leave

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
shielding was already um you could leave

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.640 
shielding was already um you could leave
it<00:03:21.970> like<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.299> is<00:03:22.329> but<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.989> like<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.349> just<00:03:23.500> wrap

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
it like it is but I I like to just wrap

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.500 
it like it is but I I like to just wrap
it<00:03:23.680> around<00:03:23.859> just<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.340> it's<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.849> little<00:03:25.329> more

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
it around just so it's a little more

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.610 
it around just so it's a little more
like<00:03:25.810> it's<00:03:26.260> supposed<00:03:27.129> to<00:03:27.250> be<00:03:28.079> okay<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.319> here's

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
like it's supposed to be okay so here's

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.900 
like it's supposed to be okay so here's
how<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.769> looks<00:03:29.949> like<00:03:30.069> once<00:03:30.250> I've<00:03:30.459> wrapped<00:03:30.730> you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
how it looks like once I've wrapped you

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.789 
how it looks like once I've wrapped you
know<00:03:31.000> some<00:03:31.269> just<00:03:31.870> regular<00:03:32.109> speaker<00:03:32.590> wire<00:03:32.769> I

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
know some just regular speaker wire I

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.050 
know some just regular speaker wire I
just<00:03:33.010> wrap<00:03:33.159> it<00:03:33.190> all<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.459> way<00:03:33.549> around<00:03:33.849> it

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
just wrap it all the way around it

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.879 
just wrap it all the way around it
around<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.480> whole<00:03:34.629> thing<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:34.959> tough<00:03:35.139> you<00:03:35.409> know

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
around the whole thing is tough you know

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.610 
around the whole thing is tough you know
mimic<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.340> was<00:03:36.609> you<00:03:37.209> know<00:03:37.269> Raptor<00:03:38.049> initially

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
mimic I was you know Raptor initially

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:48.559 
mimic I was you know Raptor initially
from<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.799> factory

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
what I've cut which I wrapped it around

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.229 
what I've cut which I wrapped it around
and<00:04:01.989> then<00:04:02.080> when<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.319> like<00:04:03.099> to<00:04:03.190> do<00:04:03.310> when<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.519> have

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
and then when I like to do when I have

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.880 
and then when I like to do when I have
to<00:04:04.390> use<00:04:04.420> electric<00:04:04.810> tape<00:04:04.989> like<00:04:05.140> that<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.409> wrap<00:04:05.590> I

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
to use electric tape like that to wrap I

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.940 
to use electric tape like that to wrap I
put<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.220> zip<00:04:07.209> tie<00:04:07.390> an<00:04:07.569> e<00:04:07.599> on<00:04:07.989> each<00:04:08.620> end<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.890> the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
put a zip tie an e on each end of the

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.009 
put a zip tie an e on each end of the
tape<00:04:09.190> so<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.489> doesn't<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:10.150> know<00:04:10.239> sort<00:04:10.569> doesn't

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
tape so it doesn't you know sort doesn't

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.360 
tape so it doesn't you know sort doesn't
have<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.140> chance<00:04:11.379> to<00:04:11.530> start<00:04:11.739> unraveling<00:04:12.040> with

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
have a chance to start unraveling with

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.789 
have a chance to start unraveling with
the<00:04:12.459> heat<00:04:12.730> stuff<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.569> good<00:04:13.840> good<00:04:14.379> tape<00:04:14.590> so

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
the heat stuff this good good tape so

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.199 
the heat stuff this good good tape so
