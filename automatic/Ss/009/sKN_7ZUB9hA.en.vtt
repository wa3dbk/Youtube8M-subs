from<00:01:45.240> my<00:01:45.510> review<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.260> first<00:01:46.440> purge<00:01:46.770> film<00:01:47.100> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
from my review of the first purge film I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280 
from my review of the first purge film I
actually<00:01:47.550> liked<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.030> quite<00:01:48.150> a<00:01:48.270> bit<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.720> was

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
actually liked it quite a bit I was

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.420 
actually liked it quite a bit I was
surprised<00:01:49.650> by<00:01:49.800> how<00:01:49.830> much<00:01:50.010> I<00:01:50.160> liked<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
surprised by how much I liked it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.430 
surprised by how much I liked it
actually<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:51.480> not<00:01:51.600> only<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.110> felt

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
actually and not only because I felt

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.260 
actually and not only because I felt
that<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.040> very<00:01:53.280> realistic<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:54.120> could

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that it was very realistic and could

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
that it was very realistic and could
actually<00:01:54.510> happen<00:01:54.900> which<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.380> largely<00:01:56.250> what

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
actually happen which was largely what

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.100 
actually happen which was largely what
was<00:01:56.550> so<00:01:56.670> terrifying<00:01:57.210> about<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.660> but<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.050> really

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
was so terrifying about it but I really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
was so terrifying about it but I really
liked<00:01:58.530> Ethan<00:01:58.830> Hawke's<00:01:59.010> performance<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.760> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
liked Ethan Hawke's performance in the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.390 
liked Ethan Hawke's performance in the
film<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:00.330> Lena<00:02:00.720> Headey<00:02:00.979> now<00:02:01.979> that's<00:02:02.250> one

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
film and also Lena Headey now that's one

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.770 
film and also Lena Headey now that's one
of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.520> things<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.790> am<00:02:03.000> type<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.360> concern<00:02:03.660> about

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
of the things I am type of concern about

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
of the things I am type of concern about
with<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.050> sequel<00:02:04.470> though<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.369> was

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
with the sequel though I think it was

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.890 
with the sequel though I think it was
really<00:02:05.670> important<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.270> crucial<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
really important and crucial for that

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.780 
really important and crucial for that
film<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.920> know<00:02:08.070> really<00:02:08.610> well

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
established legit actors in it I think

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.340 
established legit actors in it I think
it<00:02:11.790> added<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.180> sense<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.510> credibility<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
it added a sense of credibility to the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.440

film and they did a very good job in it
Ethan<00:02:15.690> Hawke<00:02:15.780> was<00:02:15.840> very<00:02:16.260> good<00:02:16.500> as<00:02:16.680> he<00:02:17.100> should

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
Ethan Hawke was very good as he should

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
continues to work so I'm a little

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.949 
continues to work so I'm a little

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
generic casting that you see in every

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.790 
generic casting that you see in every

that's gonna make it hard for this to

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.630

you know in roseburg again you know

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.470 
you know in roseburg again you know
actors<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.800> seem<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> little<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.519> above<00:02:48.180> this

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
actors that seem a little bit above this

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.970 
actors that seem a little bit above this
so<00:02:48.660> therefore<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.080> pay<00:02:49.350> attention<00:02:49.769> when<00:02:49.890> they

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
so therefore you pay attention when they

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.009 
so therefore you pay attention when they
make<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.459> kind<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.820> movie<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.630> how<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.930> this

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
make this kind of movie but how is this

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.509 
make this kind of movie but how is this
any<00:02:52.170> different<00:02:52.290> than<00:02:52.650> for<00:02:52.800> instance<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
any different than for instance like the

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.830 
any different than for instance like the
you<00:02:53.760> know<00:02:53.790> The<00:02:53.970> Devil's<00:02:54.300> Due<00:02:54.420> movie<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.810> just

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
you know The Devil's Due movie that just

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.380 
you know The Devil's Due movie that just
came<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:56.190> are<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.550> slew<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.910> other<00:02:57.180> you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
came out and are the slew of other you

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.270 
came out and are the slew of other you
know<00:02:57.420> forgettable<00:02:57.959> horror<00:02:58.260> films<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:59.130> it's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
know forgettable horror films so it's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.190 
know forgettable horror films so it's
unfortunate<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.970> think<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.420> starts<00:03:01.050> to

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
unfortunate I think that that starts to

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.460 
unfortunate I think that that starts to
go<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.070> drift<00:03:02.310> into<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.610> territory<00:03:03.150> here

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
go and drift into that territory here

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.380 
go and drift into that territory here
but<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.500> will<00:03:04.769> say<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.580> really<00:03:06.090> like<00:03:06.269> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
but I will say that I really like the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.789 
but I will say that I really like the
fact<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.720> we're<00:03:06.840> gonna<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:07.140> exploring<00:03:07.530> more

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
fact that we're gonna be exploring more

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.370 
fact that we're gonna be exploring more
of<00:03:08.250> what<00:03:08.489> happens<00:03:08.820> during<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.420> purge<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:10.290> know

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
of what happens during a purge you know

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.470 
of what happens during a purge you know
of<00:03:10.470> course<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.860> action<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.310> contained<00:03:11.760> to

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
of course the action was contained to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.880 
of course the action was contained to
just<00:03:12.510> one<00:03:12.870> house<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.350> first<00:03:13.530> time<00:03:13.769> around

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
just one house the first time around

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.830 
just one house the first time around
which<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.820> think<00:03:15.090> still<00:03:15.480> made<00:03:15.630> for<00:03:15.780> an

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
which I think still made for an

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.970 
which I think still made for an
interesting<00:03:16.200> story<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> think<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.860> can

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
interesting story and I think you can

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.949 
interesting story and I think you can
understand<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.370> from<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.640> budgetary<00:03:18.120> point

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
understand that from a budgetary point

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.360 
understand that from a budgetary point
of<00:03:19.110> view<00:03:19.260> I've<00:03:19.410> made<00:03:19.560> some<00:03:19.709> very<00:03:19.890> cheap<00:03:20.220> to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
of view I've made some very cheap to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.940 
of view I've made some very cheap to
just<00:03:20.400> shoot<00:03:20.700> one<00:03:21.000> house<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:22.080> it's<00:03:22.440> easy<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.830> do

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
just shoot one house and it's easy to do

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.009 
just shoot one house and it's easy to do
it's<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.220> quick<00:03:23.430> shoot<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:24.450> very<00:03:24.720> smart

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
it's a quick shoot it's very smart

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.479 
it's a quick shoot it's very smart
filmmaking<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.739> know<00:03:25.890> from<00:03:26.070> behind<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
filmmaking you know from behind the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.220 
filmmaking you know from behind the
cameras<00:03:26.820> for<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.360> format<00:03:27.660> perspective

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
cameras for the format perspective

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.810 
cameras for the format perspective
because<00:03:28.830> it's<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.130> it's<00:03:29.310> lean<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.700> mean

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
because it's just it's lean and mean

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.699 
because it's just it's lean and mean
filmmaking<00:03:30.330> but<00:03:30.840> here<00:03:31.019> obviously<00:03:31.170> they<00:03:31.590> can

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
filmmaking but here obviously they can

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.080 
filmmaking but here obviously they can
have<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.830> little<00:03:32.040> more<00:03:32.190> money<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.430> play<00:03:32.670> with<00:03:32.700> so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
have a little more money to play with so

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.970 
have a little more money to play with so
they<00:03:33.480> can<00:03:33.630> go<00:03:33.720> out<00:03:33.840> into<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.109> streets<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:34.950> I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
they can go out into the streets so I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.319 
they can go out into the streets so I
think<00:03:35.070> I'm<00:03:35.250> gonna<00:03:35.340> be<00:03:35.459> interesting<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.180> see

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
think I'm gonna be interesting to see

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.360 
think I'm gonna be interesting to see
you<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.840> what's<00:03:37.079> going<00:03:37.380> on<00:03:37.470> elsewhere

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
you know what's going on elsewhere

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.490 
you know what's going on elsewhere
during<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.330> know<00:03:39.420> 12<00:03:39.780> hours<00:03:39.930> we're<00:03:40.349> all

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
during this you know 12 hours we're all

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.339 
during this you know 12 hours we're all
crime<00:03:40.860> including<00:03:41.159> murder<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.790> allowed<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.959> to

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
crime including murder is allowed and to

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.140 
crime including murder is allowed and to
see<00:03:43.470> how<00:03:43.560> different<00:03:43.890> types<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.430> people<00:03:44.730> deal

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
see how different types of people deal

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.490 
see how different types of people deal
with<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.540> know<00:03:45.629> from<00:03:45.780> different<00:03:46.170> walks<00:03:46.290> of

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
with it you know from different walks of

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.350 
with it you know from different walks of
life<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.250> think<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.940> definitely<00:03:47.970> a

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
life so I think that is definitely a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.910 
life so I think that is definitely a
great<00:03:48.540> direction<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.080> take<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.409> sequel<00:03:49.799> in

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
great direction to take this sequel in

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.000 
great direction to take this sequel in
however<00:03:50.909> I<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.450> say<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.989> had<00:03:52.799> some

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
however I have to I say I had some

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.649 
however I have to I say I had some
concerns<00:03:53.370> even<00:03:53.580> with<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.879> first<00:03:54.120> film<00:03:54.420> but

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
concerns even with the first film but

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.600 
concerns even with the first film but
now<00:03:54.989> even<00:03:55.200> as<00:03:55.530> we<00:03:55.560> going<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.040> second<00:03:56.430> film

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
now even as we going to the second film

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.000 
now even as we going to the second film
I<00:03:56.849> do<00:03:57.150> wonder<00:03:57.629> about<00:03:57.659> the<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.470> know<00:03:58.530> social

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
I do wonder about the you know social

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.559 
I do wonder about the you know social
responsibility<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.790> making<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.180> movie<00:04:00.420> like

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
responsibility of making a movie like

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.899 
responsibility of making a movie like
this<00:04:00.599> because<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.140> do<00:04:01.200> feel<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.250> seems<00:04:02.579> so

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
this because I do feel that it seems so

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.059 
this because I do feel that it seems so
likely<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.450> happen<00:04:03.659> and<00:04:04.170> there<00:04:04.530> are<00:04:04.769> such

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
likely to happen and there are such

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.250 
likely to happen and there are such
anger<00:04:05.459> issues<00:04:05.790> these<00:04:05.970> days<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:07.019> know<00:04:07.110> with

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
anger issues these days you know with

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.930 
anger issues these days you know with
the<00:04:07.349> economy<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.099> you<00:04:08.250> know<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.700> know<00:04:08.790> the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
the economy and you know you know the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.569 
the economy and you know you know the
99%<00:04:09.780> versus<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.200> 1%<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.859> know<00:04:10.920> Occupy<00:04:11.370> Wall

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
99% versus the 1% you know Occupy Wall

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.080 
99% versus the 1% you know Occupy Wall
Street

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.119 
Street
I<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.540> feel<00:04:12.720> there<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.049> lot<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.440> anger<00:04:13.650> I

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
I just feel there is a lot of anger I

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.710 
I just feel there is a lot of anger I
think<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.700> Internet<00:04:15.060> does<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.239> lot<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.569> help

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
think the Internet does a lot to help

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.800 
think the Internet does a lot to help
you<00:04:16.350> know<00:04:16.440> drum<00:04:16.949> it<00:04:17.070> up<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.370> know<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.820> fan<00:04:18.660> the

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
you know drum it up you know and fan the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.460 
you know drum it up you know and fan the
flames<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:20.669> just<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.060> worry<00:04:21.389> about<00:04:22.169> maybe

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
flames and I just I worry about maybe

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.400 
flames and I just I worry about maybe
presenting<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:23.130> as<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:23.639> a<00:04:24.229> alternative<00:04:25.229> or

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
presenting this as a as a alternative or

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.500 
presenting this as a as a alternative or
a<00:04:25.440> way<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:25.979> do<00:04:26.190> handle<00:04:26.580> things<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:27.030> would<00:04:27.360> hate

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
a way to do handle things I would hate

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.570 
a way to do handle things I would hate
to<00:04:27.570> see<00:04:27.750> any<00:04:27.900> copycat<00:04:28.410> crimes<00:04:28.949> come<00:04:29.250> off<00:04:29.400> of

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
to see any copycat crimes come off of

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.640 
to see any copycat crimes come off of
this<00:04:29.729> I<00:04:29.880> think<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.389> actually<00:04:30.650> literally

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
this I think that actually literally

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.890 
this I think that actually literally
scares<00:04:31.979> me<00:04:32.190> about<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:32.970> film<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.660> think

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
scares me about this film and I think

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.279 
scares me about this film and I think
that<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.800> very<00:04:35.100> fine<00:04:35.370> line<00:04:35.430> for<00:04:35.789> the<00:04:36.000> purge

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
that it's a very fine line for the purge

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.960 
that it's a very fine line for the purge
franchise<00:04:37.289> at<00:04:37.470> this<00:04:37.590> point<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.979> walk<00:04:38.190> from

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
franchise at this point to walk from

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.189 
franchise at this point to walk from
being<00:04:39.180> believable<00:04:39.510> enough<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:40.110> that's

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
being believable enough that that's

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.140 
being believable enough that that's
partially<00:04:40.680> makes<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.130> compelling<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:42.000> maybe

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
partially makes it compelling to maybe

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.210 
partially makes it compelling to maybe
stepping<00:04:42.570> over<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.900> line<00:04:43.169> into<00:04:43.500> real<00:04:44.190> world

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
stepping over the line into real world

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.490 
stepping over the line into real world
application<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.240> then<00:04:45.330> as<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.720> said<00:04:45.930> being<00:04:46.110> you

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
application and then as I said being you

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.860 
application and then as I said being you
know<00:04:46.639> irresponsible<00:04:47.639> as<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.789> film<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:48.599> think

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
know irresponsible as a film so I think

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.879 
know irresponsible as a film so I think
that's<00:04:48.990> really<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.229> question<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.740> hope<00:04:49.830> the

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
that's really a question that I hope the

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.700 
that's really a question that I hope the
filmmakers<00:04:50.370> are<00:04:50.460> asking<00:04:50.849> themselves<00:04:51.710> because

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
filmmakers are asking themselves because

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.250 
filmmakers are asking themselves because
you<00:04:52.860> know<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.450> anarchie<00:04:54.450> happens<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.169> know
