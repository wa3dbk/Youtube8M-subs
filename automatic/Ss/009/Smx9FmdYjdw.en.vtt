muscle and what I've got for you today

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.480 
muscle and what I've got for you today
is<00:00:20.150> a<00:00:20.570> very<00:00:21.110> interesting<00:00:21.680> version<00:00:22.160> of<00:00:22.279> power

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
is a very interesting version of power

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.820 
is a very interesting version of power
start<00:00:22.790> lactic<00:00:23.119> acid<00:00:23.420> training<00:00:23.750> now<00:00:24.140> this

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
start lactic acid training now this

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.430 
start lactic acid training now this
version<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.580> done<00:00:25.849> using<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.810> bench<00:00:26.990> pressing

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
version is done using the bench pressing

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.189 
version is done using the bench pressing
and<00:00:27.949> bands<00:00:28.460> it's<00:00:28.970> a<00:00:29.060> reverse<00:00:29.359> band<00:00:29.630> beds<00:00:29.900> press

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
and bands it's a reverse band beds press

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.140 
and bands it's a reverse band beds press
but<00:00:30.770> for<00:00:30.980> power<00:00:31.160> started<00:00:31.490> like<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.850> Kazon

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
but for power started like the Kazon

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.390 
but for power started like the Kazon
training<00:00:32.480> no<00:00:32.750> basically<00:00:33.739> this<00:00:33.980> is<00:00:34.129> a<00:00:34.160> great

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
training no basically this is a great

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.950 
training no basically this is a great
fat<00:00:34.610> loss<00:00:34.820> technique<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:35.449> it's<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.629> great<00:00:35.809> way

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
fat loss technique and it's a great way

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.530 
fat loss technique and it's a great way
to<00:00:36.280> preserve<00:00:37.280> strength<00:00:37.820> while<00:00:38.150> training<00:00:38.420> for

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
to preserve strength while training for

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.680 
to preserve strength while training for
fat<00:00:38.780> loss<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.910> first<00:00:40.910> sets<00:00:41.330> you're<00:00:41.480> going<00:00:41.600> to

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
fat loss the first sets you're going to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.560 
fat loss the first sets you're going to
do<00:00:41.809> is<00:00:42.640> 20-plus<00:00:43.640> reps<00:00:43.969> you're<00:00:44.270> going<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:44.510> go

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
do is 20-plus reps you're going to go

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.030 
do is 20-plus reps you're going to go
for<00:00:44.780> power<00:00:44.899> you're<00:00:45.140> getting<00:00:45.350> over<00:00:45.440> speed<00:00:45.829> and

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
for power you're getting over speed and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.530 
for power you're getting over speed and
you're<00:00:46.670> really<00:00:46.790> going<00:00:46.969> to<00:00:47.030> try<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:47.239> crank<00:00:47.420> out

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
you're really going to try and crank out

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.150 
you're really going to try and crank out
as<00:00:47.660> many<00:00:47.780> reps<00:00:48.020> as<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.260> possibly<00:00:48.620> can

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
as many reps as you possibly can

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.670 
as many reps as you possibly can
now<00:00:49.489> I've<00:00:49.969> got<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.329> band<00:00:50.510> on<00:00:50.719> here<00:00:50.930> it's<00:00:51.500> going

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
now I've got the band on here it's going

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.470 
now I've got the band on here it's going
to<00:00:51.739> stretch<00:00:52.040> as<00:00:52.460> I<00:00:52.610> lower<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.940> weight<00:00:53.090> and

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
to stretch as I lower the weight and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.729 
to stretch as I lower the weight and
that's<00:00:53.899> going<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.079> help<00:00:54.200> take<00:00:54.410> up<00:00:54.559> some

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
that's going to help take up some

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.830 
that's going to help take up some
resistance<00:00:55.100> at<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.340> bottom<00:00:55.610> now<00:00:55.850> as<00:00:56.059> I<00:00:56.239> press

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
resistance at the bottom now as I press

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.020 
resistance at the bottom now as I press
the<00:00:56.960> bar<00:00:57.140> up<00:00:57.350> that's<00:00:58.100> when<00:00:58.370> then<00:00:58.670> kind<00:00:58.969> of

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
the bar up that's when then kind of

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.689 
the bar up that's when then kind of
tracks<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.930> take<00:01:00.649> some<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:00.980> weight<00:01:01.070> and

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
tracks and take some of the weight and

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:02.740 
tracks and take some of the weight and
you<00:01:01.730> can<00:01:01.910> put<00:01:02.030> some<00:01:02.149> of<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.270> weight<00:01:02.360> back<00:01:02.570> on

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
you can put some of the weight back on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.510 
you can put some of the weight back on
you<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.379> it's<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.739> really<00:01:03.949> really<00:01:04.070> good<00:01:04.369> way<00:01:04.489> to

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
you so it's a really really good way to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.859 
you so it's a really really good way to
follow<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.030> strength<00:01:05.330> curve<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.720> bench

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
follow the strength curve the bench

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.630 
follow the strength curve the bench
press<00:01:06.110> exercise<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.280> what<00:01:07.399> I've<00:01:07.490> got<00:01:07.520> here

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
press exercise so what I've got here

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.730 
press exercise so what I've got here
simple<00:01:08.149> events<00:01:08.509> we've<00:01:08.750> got<00:01:08.869> 315<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.590> bar

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
simple events we've got 315 in the bar

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.380 
simple events we've got 315 in the bar
that's<00:01:10.340> going<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.640> give<00:01:10.729> me<00:01:10.820> some<00:01:10.970> assistance

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
that's going to give me some assistance

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.490 
that's going to give me some assistance
out<00:01:11.539> of<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.690> bottom<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.110> remove<00:01:12.229> that

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
out of the bottom and remove that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.260 
out of the bottom and remove that
assistant<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.039> they<00:01:13.190> come<00:01:13.340> with<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.520> top<00:01:13.729> so

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
assistant so they come with the top so

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.760 
assistant so they come with the top so
it<00:01:14.869> really<00:01:15.049> allows<00:01:15.260> me<00:01:15.290> to<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.500> little<00:01:15.619> be

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
it really allows me to a little be

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.929 
it really allows me to a little be
exercised<00:01:16.159> very<00:01:16.400> effectively

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
exercised very effectively

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.330 
exercised very effectively
now<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.990> power<00:01:18.170> start<00:01:18.380> lactic<00:01:18.710> acid<00:01:19.010> training

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
now the power start lactic acid training

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.640 
now the power start lactic acid training
we're<00:01:20.060> going<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.270> do<00:01:20.330> is<00:01:20.450> set<00:01:20.659> very<00:01:20.960> high<00:01:21.320> reps

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
we're going to do is set very high reps

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.649 
we're going to do is set very high reps
to<00:01:21.799> 20<00:01:22.070> plus<00:01:22.310> reps<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:22.909> then<00:01:23.450> I'm<00:01:23.540> gonna

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
to 20 plus reps and then I'm gonna

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.960 
to 20 plus reps and then I'm gonna
arrest<00:01:23.869> 20<00:01:24.200> seconds<00:01:24.560> in<00:01:25.189> that<00:01:25.430> first<00:01:25.729> 20

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
arrest 20 seconds in that first 20

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.640 
arrest 20 seconds in that first 20
seconds<00:01:26.299> rest<00:01:26.479> I'm<00:01:27.020> actually<00:01:27.170> gonna<00:01:27.380> peel<00:01:27.619> off

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
seconds rest I'm actually gonna peel off

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.740 
seconds rest I'm actually gonna peel off
a<00:01:28.100> plate<00:01:28.700> off<00:01:28.850> either<00:01:29.030> side<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:29.330> that's<00:01:29.630> going

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
a plate off either side so that's going

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.690 
a plate off either side so that's going
to<00:01:29.810> drop<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.049> weight<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.290> 225<00:01:30.830> while<00:01:31.520> still

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
to drop the weight to 225 while still

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.940 
to drop the weight to 225 while still
keeping<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.030> bands<00:01:32.330> on<00:01:32.479> there<00:01:32.659> now<00:01:33.290> at<00:01:33.830> that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
keeping the bands on there now at that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.840 
keeping the bands on there now at that
point<00:01:34.009> I'm<00:01:34.400> going<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.580> cry

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
point I'm going to cry

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.999 
point I'm going to cry
as<00:01:34.970> many<00:01:35.150> more<00:01:35.330> reps<00:01:35.510> as<00:01:35.689> I<00:01:35.750> can<00:01:35.960> again<00:01:36.320> I'm

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
as many more reps as I can again I'm

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.950 
as many more reps as I can again I'm
gonna<00:01:37.159> stay<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.430> way<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:38.180> keep<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.509> cranking

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
gonna stay that way and keep on cranking

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.280 
gonna stay that way and keep on cranking
out<00:01:38.990> more<00:01:39.700> as<00:01:40.700> maybe<00:01:40.939> rough<00:01:41.119> as<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.330> can<00:01:41.509> sets<00:01:41.840> on

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
out more as maybe rough as I can sets on

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.440 
out more as maybe rough as I can sets on
20<00:01:42.590> seconds<00:01:42.950> rest<00:01:43.130> until<00:01:43.400> I've<00:01:43.520> got<00:01:43.670> ten<00:01:43.909> total

good<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.360> like<00:04:51.539> to<00:04:51.689> guess<00:04:51.839> the<00:04:51.959> build-up<00:04:52.259> and

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
good I like to guess the build-up and

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.389 
good I like to guess the build-up and
using<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.539> bands<00:04:54.719> like<00:04:54.899> this<00:04:55.069> really<00:04:56.069> lets<00:04:56.279> it

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:56.399 
using the bands like this really lets it

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.519 
using the bands like this really lets it
grind<00:04:56.639> up<00:04:56.759> those<00:04:56.939> reps<00:04:57.179> I<00:04:57.539> really<00:04:58.289> get<00:04:58.409> that

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529 
grind up those reps I really get that

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:24.250 
grind up those reps I really get that
