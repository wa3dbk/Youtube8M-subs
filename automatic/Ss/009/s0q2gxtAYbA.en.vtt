00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.500
 Mr. together I show you today 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:05.980
 again with the omega now becomes the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.480
 speed measurements in the vehicle 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.280
 that's why the video is on 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.769
 a bit shaky and relatively loud 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.880
 noise like you see me 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:19.179
 right here on the highway and tarot 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.260
 we can see about 130 on the 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.280
 format 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.140
 and we try that now 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.580
 Trace and everything he has to do 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.779
 it needs here in my middle the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.790
 display the kilometer 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.950
 if we are exactly one kilometer long 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.190
 have to measure by the time or the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.200
 calculate speed and then 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.350
 can read it on the outer ring here 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.059
 with so-called tags meter and that 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.430
 I passed 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.460
 now press the button 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.150
 once we have 100 75 pommer 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.560
 have reached five kilometers 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.010
 and that looks like this 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.679
 and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.280
 you say now we have the 175 5 in here 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.340
 the stand bottom center right 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.900
 and as soon as we reach the 176 5 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.210
 I'll go back here 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.210
 and this little second hand or 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.320
 the big second hand will stop 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 and then only the speed 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.890
 read off 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.290
 176 2 is the stand 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.290
 3 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.370
 4 and 5 and I press fabric and there 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.570
 if we have current speed 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.020
 we now here on the second hand 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.550
 look and down here on the taxi 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.540
 tenants we see here about 120 125 km hs 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.250
 just in between 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.710
 and if we get out of the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.910
 Thematically we have according to tarragona one 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.700
 speed of 130 km h and year 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.930
 is already very good exactly 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.090
 of course the taboo again the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.560
 ask how exactly does that indicate because loud 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.330
 eu law must have the taboos in 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.050
 germany or at all in the eu 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.580
 Action 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.460
 Accordingly, that's quite a 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.500
 good number we have achieved and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.630
 in my opinion, also quite accurately 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.890
 So for such a small measurement the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.750
 Now that was done here 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.750
 already very nice so much water
