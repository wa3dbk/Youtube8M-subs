on there and then let it sit and really
kind<00:01:54.399> of<00:01:54.519> work<00:01:55.090> on<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.450> oil<00:01:55.989> stain<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:56.440> this<00:01:56.560> is

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
kind of work on the oil stain so this is

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.869 
kind of work on the oil stain so this is
a<00:01:56.709> pretty<00:01:56.890> old<00:01:56.979> stain<00:01:59.580> all<00:02:00.580> right<00:02:00.670> for

a pretty old stain all right for
comparison<00:02:01.450> we've<00:02:01.629> got<00:02:01.780> my<00:02:01.899> white<00:02:02.500> spot<00:02:02.830> here

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
comparison we've got my white spot here

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.979 
comparison we've got my white spot here
and<00:02:03.399> then<00:02:03.849> I'm<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.060> travel<00:02:04.390> carburetor<00:02:04.810> cleaner

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
and then I'm a travel carburetor cleaner

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.020 
and then I'm a travel carburetor cleaner
over<00:02:05.319> here<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.649> see<00:02:05.769> how<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.039> does<00:02:06.250> in<00:02:06.759> this

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
over here and see how it does in this

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.609 
over here and see how it does in this
spot<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:07.539> side<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.959> a<00:02:07.989> little<00:02:08.170> darker<00:02:08.500> just

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
spot this side is a little darker just

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.199 
spot this side is a little darker just
because<00:02:08.860> it's<00:02:09.009> wet<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:09.519> side<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.729> dry<00:02:09.970> so

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
because it's wet but this side is dry so

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.250 
because it's wet but this side is dry so
I'm<00:02:10.269> gonna<00:02:10.330> spray<00:02:10.569> some<00:02:10.599> carburetor<00:02:11.080> clean

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.940 

you<00:02:19.550> rinse<00:02:19.909> it<00:02:20.060> off<00:02:23.530> all<00:02:24.530> right<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
you rinse it off all right this is the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.880 
you rinse it off all right this is the
after<00:02:25.340> shot<00:02:25.549> of<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.989> EZ<00:02:26.989> op<00:02:27.200> oven<00:02:27.470> cleaner<00:02:27.709> so

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
you can see a little bit of an outline

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.390 
you can see a little bit of an outline
there<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.680> didn't<00:02:30.920> get<00:02:30.980> rid<00:02:31.129> of<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.250> whole

there so I didn't get rid of the whole
thing<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:31.940> from<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.840> distance<00:02:33.459> better<00:02:34.459> than<00:02:34.640> it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
thing but from a distance better than it

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.670 
thing but from a distance better than it
was<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.269> then<00:02:35.599> if<00:02:35.690> we<00:02:35.780> go<00:02:35.900> over<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.319> stain

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680

the goop is still pretty Brown
carburetor<00:02:47.269> cleaner<00:02:47.480> turned<00:02:48.079> out<00:02:48.200> much

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
carburetor cleaner turned out much

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.600 
carburetor cleaner turned out much
better<00:02:48.590> especially<00:02:48.920> when<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.280> compare<00:02:49.430> it

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
better especially when you compare it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.360 
better especially when you compare it
with<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> outlying<00:02:50.769> regular<00:02:51.769> concrete<00:02:52.160> here

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
with the outlying regular concrete here

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.490 
with the outlying regular concrete here
than<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.760> natural<00:02:53.120> color<00:02:53.299> of<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.049> looks

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
than the natural color of it so looks

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.949 
than the natural color of it so looks
like<00:02:54.560> carburetor<00:02:54.980> cleaner<00:02:55.129> is<00:02:55.430> your<00:02:55.579> best<00:02:55.730> bet

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
it's just kind of toxic and you make

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.030 
it's just kind of toxic and you make
sure<00:02:59.870> we're<00:02:59.989> goggles<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.530> don't<00:03:00.680> get<00:03:00.799> it<00:03:00.950> all

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
sure we're goggles and don't get it all
