00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.079
 george 5.0 versus Rodonorte the g 9444 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.010
 hot then the blind man has now revised for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.379
 you can choose the best that goes 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420
 adapt more to your taste for what 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.770
 this round the bike x trail now that it has been 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.110
 created by me 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.879
 follows the link in the video editing for 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.829
 each street video and its respective 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.520
 download links 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.890
 so let's go guys then this is it, let's go 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.539
 start the review right? 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.030
 Let's take a look at what these 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.560
 two rounds to offer to us 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 arriving here we can see where it goes 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.130
 the g4 engine already has the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 on the screen 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.890
 the spain was here we already have a button 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.020
 that the negative point of this is 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
 that the screen is a little smaller 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.720
 With you, you may be seeing this 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.509
 digital button too take the buttons 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.040
 screen that had a lot of screen space 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.619
 while here on the street the gold powder 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.750
 that we have normal rice as an actor in 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.600
 other sources 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.270
 both come with all applications 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.549
 there is no lack here coming here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.329
 we have a target is transparent and work 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.770
 poc is also you composed with thread the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.320
 high and transparent 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.619
 we also see all of them come with the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.860
 factory applications and both also 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.180
 are based upon official gemol 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.250
 Let's see here the droid is not here 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.530
 we also see that the oe will 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.429
 come up with the two if they vote kanakia vote 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.640
 I forgot to turn on wifi here already provide 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.209
 love pop and here in motogp is calling 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.220
 It is now also running good is 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.890
 Let's take a look now at the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.360
 memory this system is not pop we have 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.520
 today slaughter 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.510
 as well as in motogp 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.780
 all of them 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.480
 both are in this image we will see now 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.230
 here on android send the look of aquino 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.300
 android 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.860
 here we have the android kitkat 444 and here 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.330
 the Andrew version where there have the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.760
 boxing zero point 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.459
 if you are choosing one of the two bases 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.260
 and nobody of course you chose where 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.680
 can grow much more updated with 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.660
 android 5.0 which is higher than the 44 directory 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.810
 of the active motogp in question 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.540
 cells retain both the memory 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.590
 301 is able 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.480
 there is a positive point of deontology 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.660
 it would be because as it was created 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.970
 recently by me she has the biggest 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.579
 After jumps and updated that I 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.440
 I updated downloaded and this will update 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.910
 your pop blog which is an honor that is a 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.350
 little older 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.170
 Let's have a look at that one. 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.079
 performance in the processor of the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.709
 two on the automotive day we have 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.230
 we have a processor of 1,100 megahertz and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.299
 In love pop we also have a 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.620
 processor of 100 megahertz then 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.540
 we see that here the two on the agenda 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.730
 both of them have a nice design 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.340
 while from pop to design a 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.980
 little more white ac in the motogp we have 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.420
 a little darker black design can 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.530
 maybe serve here 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.670
 Now, let's go to the part of the language that 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.630
 I think you do not stay a little 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.720
 disappointed with motogp clothing on the 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.490
 motogp but only 21 Spanish that this 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.380
 already have much rubbers 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.940
 advantage of this street while in the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.580
 rondon where pop we have several languages 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.170
 including Brazilian Portuguese, which 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.660
 comes embedded in one's own hand 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.040
 Well, in the language issue, we see that 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.020
 oni pop wins again good as it already 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.630
 I said all of them are and the rest are all 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.750
 they have all the applications is not 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.400
 However, nothing is missing from Rodonorte. 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.000
 genre in Portuguese 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.010
 the android is a little lower 444 but it is 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.900
 more up-to-date with pop 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.130
 have the android a little better and in 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.720
 Portuguese 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.630
 they all found application is 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.520
 nothing is missing we can win the 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.050
 message application that we have the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.870
 android l keyboard while here 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.030
 we have android and normal similar 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.740
 You already know the lg 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.380
 however the ak messaging application 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.720
 dogar hall the way it is updated a little 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.250
 It's one more negative point here on 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.710
 bike has the point that the buttons 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.080
 has taken up a lot of screen space and 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.000
 consequently glass as a keyboard that 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.770
 This can annoy a lot of people. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.430
 nothing to bother when writing 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.510
 but it is a bit in the middle that is annoying 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.190
 ball in the end you do not 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.330
 choose what is best for you and this 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.340
 is the android if it is the language if the exam and 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.470
 You'll end up choosing there. 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.600
 both have 2,100 mega processor 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.730
 hertz or a little today you can 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.790
 both are those of mexico today the apae 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.360
 participation of more 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.630
 how much in Portuguese while 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.910
 arquitete the motogp is Spanish and 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.640
 motogp the most up-to-date applications 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.000
 with very similar design but the order 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.270
 point has the applications a little more 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.400
 ancient 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.830
 So you choose there, I get better. 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.210
 You, that's it, well, the review of 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.110
 today was this and I hope you have 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.940
 liked 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.830
 if you like your link below 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.170

 to confer partner channels to 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.900
 video direction 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.590
 I understand great tutorials for 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.210
 droid 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.730
 so this is it people are impossible in
