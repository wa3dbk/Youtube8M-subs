just read an interesting article about a

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.550 
just read an interesting article about a
few<00:00:02.460> people<00:00:02.659> mentioning<00:00:03.659> that<00:00:03.840> their<00:00:04.080> Xbox

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
few people mentioning that their Xbox

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.610 
few people mentioning that their Xbox
ones<00:00:04.859> have<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> weird<00:00:05.549> white<00:00:05.970> filmy<00:00:06.690> substance

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
ones have a weird white filmy substance

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.570 
ones have a weird white filmy substance
off<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.460> top<00:00:08.700> vent<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.450> console<00:00:10.580> also

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
off of the top vent of the console also

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.240 
off of the top vent of the console also
a<00:00:11.880> oily<00:00:12.690> substance<00:00:13.290> has<00:00:13.500> also<00:00:13.769> been

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
a oily substance has also been

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.070 
a oily substance has also been
discovered<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.089> ventilation<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
discovered on the ventilation of the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.120 
discovered on the ventilation of the
Xbox<00:00:16.379> one

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
Xbox one

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.460 
Xbox one
my<00:00:18.029> thoughts<00:00:18.359> are<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.990> really<00:00:19.560> don't<00:00:19.770> know

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
my thoughts are I really don't know

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.509 
my thoughts are I really don't know
looking<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.800> pictures<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
looking at the pictures of the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.730 
looking at the pictures of the
motherboard<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.630> doesn't<00:00:25.019> seem<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
motherboard it doesn't seem like it

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.980 
motherboard it doesn't seem like it
really<00:00:25.890> could<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.340> been<00:00:26.490> caused<00:00:26.910> by<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.599> blown

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
really could have been caused by a blown

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.310 
really could have been caused by a blown
capacitor<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> here's<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> few<00:00:29.789> reasons<00:00:29.970> why

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
capacitor and here's a few reasons why

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
capacitor and here's a few reasons why
for<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.640> after<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.790> capacitor<00:00:33.510> blows

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
for one after our capacitor blows

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.959 
for one after our capacitor blows
usually<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.950> console<00:00:35.370> will<00:00:35.520> cease<00:00:35.730> to

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
usually the console will cease to

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
usually the console will cease to
function<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:37.079> seen<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.800> televisions

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
function I have seen this on televisions

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.610 
function I have seen this on televisions
where<00:00:38.610> people<00:00:39.180> explain<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> television

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
where people explain that the television

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
where people explain that the television
just<00:00:40.860> keeps<00:00:41.040> shutting<00:00:41.309> off<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.120> open<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
just keeps shutting off on them open it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
just keeps shutting off on them open it
up<00:00:42.930> sure<00:00:43.590> enough<00:00:43.829> there's<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.160> blown<00:00:44.399> cap

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
up sure enough there's a blown cap

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.950 
up sure enough there's a blown cap
inside<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.829> yeah<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.969> eases<00:00:48.420> around<00:00:48.750> but

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
inside and and yeah it eases around but

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.549 
inside and and yeah it eases around but
it's<00:00:49.140> never<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> real<00:00:49.860> spray<00:00:50.809> second<00:00:51.809> there's<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it's never a real spray second there's a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's never a real spray second there's a
metal<00:00:52.980> plate<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.879> covering<00:00:54.390> every

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
metal plate that is covering every

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.660 
metal plate that is covering every
aspect<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.789> vent<00:00:57.030> except<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.100> area

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
aspect of the vent except for the area

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.770 
aspect of the vent except for the area
where<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.629> fan<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
where the fan is and you can see in the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.440 
where the fan is and you can see in the
photos<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.640> course<00:01:05.670> thank<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
photos this is all of course thank to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.670 
photos this is all of course thank to
you<00:01:06.510> brought<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> by<00:01:07.170> um<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.740> fix<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.820> I

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
you brought to you by um I fix it but I

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.039 
you brought to you by um I fix it but I
really<00:01:10.680> can't<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.130> how<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:12.270> console<00:01:12.810> would

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
really can't see how the console would

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
really can't see how the console would
have<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.619> problem<00:01:14.100> such<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.939> just

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
have a problem such as this and just

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.719 
have a problem such as this and just
just<00:01:15.810> logically<00:01:16.470> speaking<00:01:16.650> based<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.460> how<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
just logically speaking based on how the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.749 
just logically speaking based on how the
console<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.479> assembled<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.369> where

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
console is assembled I don't see where

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.749 
console is assembled I don't see where
the<00:01:21.600> fluid<00:01:21.869> could<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> areas<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the fluid could get in the areas and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
the fluid could get in the areas and
indicated<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> photos<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> people

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
indicated in the photos that the people

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.719 
indicated in the photos that the people
have<00:01:26.009> taken<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.439> possible<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.400> something

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
have taken is it possible that something

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.630 
have taken is it possible that something
blew<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.560> spraying<00:01:31.979> yeah

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
blew in there and and is spraying yeah

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.310 
blew in there and and is spraying yeah
there's<00:01:32.909> always<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.270> possibility<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.049> mean<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
there's always that possibility I mean a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.280 
there's always that possibility I mean a
capacitor<00:01:35.159> I've<00:01:36.000> seen<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.720> fair<00:01:36.960> share<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
capacitor I've seen my fair share of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.160 
capacitor I've seen my fair share of
blown<00:01:37.650> capacitors<00:01:38.450> but<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:40.490> don't<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:42.170> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
blown capacitors but I don't see how it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.139 
blown capacitors but I don't see how it
could<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.680> gotten<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.430> ventilation

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
could have gotten into that ventilation

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.719 
could have gotten into that ventilation
it<00:01:45.570> doesn't<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.200> doesn't<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.770> make<00:01:47.070> sense<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it doesn't it doesn't just make sense so

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.020 
it doesn't it doesn't just make sense so
maybe<00:01:48.630> these<00:01:49.290> people<00:01:49.680> are<00:01:49.829> trying<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.490> start<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
maybe these people are trying to start a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.590 
maybe these people are trying to start a
hoax<00:01:51.299> maybe<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.229> don't<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.610> based<00:01:54.329> off<00:01:54.540> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
hoax maybe I don't know but based off of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.660 
hoax maybe I don't know but based off of
my<00:01:55.610> expertise<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:58.079> consul's

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
my expertise in the consul's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.550 
my expertise in the consul's
construction<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.420> doesn't<00:02:00.840> seem<00:02:01.020> likely<00:02:01.320> that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
construction it doesn't seem likely that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.889 
construction it doesn't seem likely that
it<00:02:01.920> was<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> blown<00:02:02.520> cap<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:03.240> again<00:02:03.659> they

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
it was a blown cap because again they

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.340 
it was a blown cap because again they
said<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.619> stopped<00:02:05.520> using<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.509> whatever<00:02:06.960> after

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
said it stopped using or whatever after

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.199 
said it stopped using or whatever after
they<00:02:07.979> turned<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.340> off<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> still

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
they turned it off but it still

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.040 
they turned it off but it still
functions<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:10.830> know<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.310> cat<00:02:11.520> blows<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
functions you know if a cat blows a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.270 
functions you know if a cat blows a
capacitor<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> very

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
capacitor is a very

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.950 
capacitor is a very
important<00:02:15.280> piece<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.880> motherboard<00:02:16.390> if<00:02:16.720> a

important piece of the motherboard if a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.880 
important piece of the motherboard if a
capacitor<00:02:17.530> goes<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:19.030> will<00:02:19.240> cease<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.540> function

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
capacitor goes it will cease to function

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.510 
capacitor goes it will cease to function
you<00:02:21.700> know<00:02:21.820> I've<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.840> not<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:24.370> not

something that you can afford to lose a

something that you can afford to lose a
cap<00:02:26.260> or<00:02:26.440> two<00:02:26.590> every<00:02:27.010> part<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.580> motherboard

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
cap or two every part on a motherboard

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.270 
cap or two every part on a motherboard
is<00:02:28.360> important<00:02:28.900> whether<00:02:29.620> or<00:02:29.770> not<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.040> want<00:02:30.220> to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
is important whether or not you want to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.210 
is important whether or not you want to
believe<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.360> true<00:02:31.780> they're<00:02:32.530> built<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.130> a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
believe so it's true they're built in a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.340 
believe so it's true they're built in a
point<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.670> any<00:02:33.880> one<00:02:34.240> part<00:02:34.540> fails<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.200> whole

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
point that any one part fails the whole

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.060 
point that any one part fails the whole
 will<00:02:36.100> die<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:37.240> just<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.690> way<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.070> so

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
 will die it's just the way it is so

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.730 
 will die it's just the way it is so
