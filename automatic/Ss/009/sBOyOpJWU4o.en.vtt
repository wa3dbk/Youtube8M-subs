00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:08.630 
so with these gold nuggets you can
actually<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.929> grab<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.500> put<00:02:08.129> them<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
actually just grab and put them in a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.660 
actually just grab and put them in a
full<00:02:09.030> Square<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.660> receive<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.800> ingot<00:02:11.489> or

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
full Square to receive one ingot or

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.339 
full Square to receive one ingot or
diamond<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:14.209> for<00:02:15.209> all<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.599> put<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.080> it

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
diamond so for all that we put in it

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.260 
diamond so for all that we put in it
doesn't<00:02:16.890> give<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.010> too<00:02:17.340> too<00:02:17.520> much<00:02:17.550> back<00:02:18.030> which

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
doesn't give you too too much back which

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.090 
doesn't give you too too much back which
i<00:02:18.390> think<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.720> good<00:02:18.960> thing<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.860> doesn't

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
i think is a good thing and it doesn't

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.030 
i think is a good thing and it doesn't
make<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.490> mod<00:02:20.760> 2<00:02:21.150> 20<00:02:21.420> p<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.320> it's<00:02:22.470> still<00:02:22.740> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
make the mod 2 20 p but it's still a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.690 
make the mod 2 20 p but it's still a
very

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
very

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.960 
very
is<00:02:23.959> implement<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.319> Minecraft<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.489> think<00:02:26.790> it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
is implement to Minecraft and I think it

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.880 
is implement to Minecraft and I think it
would<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.150> very<00:02:27.540> useful<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.620> were<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.830> use

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
would be very useful if you were to use

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.640 
would be very useful if you were to use
this<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.370> survival<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.209> right<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.500> it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
this in survival all right so this is it

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.009 
this in survival all right so this is it
for<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> recycle<00:02:32.550> items<00:02:32.910> plus<00:02:33.239> mod<00:02:33.569> if<00:02:33.900> you
