00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the headset if you see in my previous

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.380 
the headset if you see in my previous
video<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.259> has<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.829> gold<00:01:35.390> headset

Chris King now we'll replace it with
blue<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.740> reason<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.340> just

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
blue and the reason for that is just

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
blue and the reason for that is just
stands<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.479> too<00:01:42.659> much<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.110> basically<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.979> just

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
stands out too much so basically we just

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
stands out too much so basically we just
change<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.460> color<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.320> headset<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.930> now

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
bike when we first got it was the old

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.470 

a<00:03:45.790> fork<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:49.450> very<00:03:50.050> hard<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.680> look<00:03:51.099> for<00:03:51.160> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
a fork it's very hard to look for a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.020 
a fork it's very hard to look for a
carbon<00:03:52.480> fork<00:03:52.900> for<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.260> size<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.030> frame

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
carbon fork for this size of the frame

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.050 
carbon fork for this size of the frame
or<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.989> pipe<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:57.040> accepts<00:03:57.989> 650cc<00:03:58.989> wheels<00:04:00.060> the

reason<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.390> got<00:04:01.540> red<00:04:01.810> ones<00:04:02.050> or<00:04:02.170> not<00:04:02.230> because<00:04:02.620> I

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
reason I got red ones or not because I

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.740 
reason I got red ones or not because I
haven't<00:04:02.890> seen<00:04:03.099> any<00:04:03.220> black<00:04:03.489> ones<00:04:03.760> with<00:04:04.030> with

full<00:04:25.570> carbon<00:04:26.340> fork<00:04:27.340> yeah<00:04:27.910> laughing<00:04:28.560> because

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
full carbon fork yeah laughing because

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.280 
full carbon fork yeah laughing because
the<00:04:29.830> original<00:04:30.220> one<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.639> a<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:31.180> didn't<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.080> did

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
the original one is a I didn't I did

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.620 
the original one is a I didn't I did
some<00:04:32.410> research<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.919> original<00:04:33.280> fork<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:34.330> a

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
some research the original fork is a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.469 
some research the original fork is a
still<00:04:35.520> exactly<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.760> same<00:04:36.850> as<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.300> other

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
still exactly the same as the other

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.900 
still exactly the same as the other
frame<00:04:37.810> set<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.470> frame<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.280> frame<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.610> alloy

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
frame set the frame the frame is alloy

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.540 
frame set the frame the frame is alloy
because<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:40.840> thought<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.260> fork<00:04:42.040> is<00:04:42.160> alloy<00:04:42.340> as

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
because I thought the fork is alloy as

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.950 
because I thought the fork is alloy as
well<00:04:42.729> but<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.270> was<00:04:43.479> wrong

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
well but I was wrong

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.770 
well but I was wrong

the saddle still the same oh and also we
end<00:05:17.080> up<00:05:17.260> replacing<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:19.919> pedals<00:05:21.389> that's<00:05:22.389> got

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
end up replacing the pedals that's got

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.420 
end up replacing the pedals that's got
the<00:05:24.060> dura-ace<00:05:25.060> now<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:26.440> previous<00:05:26.830> one<00:05:27.039> was

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
the dura-ace now the previous one was

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.260 
the dura-ace now the previous one was
the<00:05:27.820> look<00:05:28.590> it<00:05:29.590> had<00:05:29.830> a<00:05:29.860> look<00:05:30.310> carbon<00:05:30.789> blade<00:05:31.000> and

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
the look it had a look carbon blade and

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.490 
the look it had a look carbon blade and
the<00:05:31.870> reason<00:05:32.169> we<00:05:32.289> replaced<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:32.800> was<00:05:33.160> because

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
the reason we replaced that was because

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.500 
the reason we replaced that was because
my<00:05:35.610> son<00:05:36.610> couldn't<00:05:36.970> get<00:05:37.090> out<00:05:38.820> easily<00:05:39.820> he

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
my son couldn't get out easily he

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.719 
my son couldn't get out easily he
struggles<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.080> bit<00:05:41.110> getting<00:05:41.470> out<00:05:41.650> of<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.919> look

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
struggles a bit getting out of the look

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.270 
struggles a bit getting out of the look
because<00:05:43.660> it's<00:05:43.900> not<00:05:44.080> adjustable<00:05:44.500> it's<00:05:44.979> the<00:05:45.160> one

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
because it's not adjustable it's the one

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.909 
because it's not adjustable it's the one
