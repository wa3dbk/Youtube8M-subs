00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:53.100 

well<00:00:45.970> I<00:00:46.150> tried<00:00:47.310> to<00:00:48.310> restart<00:00:49.150> it<00:00:52.020> I've<00:00:53.020> done

well I tried to restart it I've done
that<00:00:53.470> about<00:00:53.670> five<00:00:54.670> or<00:00:54.850> six<00:00:55.060> times<00:00:56.160> same<00:00:57.160> thing

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400

that about five or six times same thing
keeps<00:00:57.640> on<00:00:57.820> happening<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.600> definitely<00:01:02.260> the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
keeps on happening that definitely the

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.370 
keeps on happening that definitely the

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
problem might glitch somewhere I guess I

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.150 
problem might glitch somewhere I guess I
have<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.740> return<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.400> Apple<00:01:07.090> shop<00:01:08.160> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.840 

all<00:01:18.460> up<00:01:18.760> such<00:01:19.060> this<00:01:19.950> expensive<00:01:20.950> piece<00:01:21.820> of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850
