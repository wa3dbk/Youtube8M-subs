00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.400
 most of the characters in 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.620
 animation that you see in movies or in 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.930
 series is built with very elements 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.540
 simple as they are square circles and 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.900
 triangles today we're going to make the face of 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:31.910
 a character with a circle like this 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.910
 and using a plastic cup 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.480
 we have made a circle we divide it 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.309
 investigate read the horizontal 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.740
 and now here on this edge we put the 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.740
 edge of the glass 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.880
 OK 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.660
 then yes I want 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.660
 also centered 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.560
 a little less central 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 second circle 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.840
 now here we can make one more circle 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.759
 small from here between the two 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.759
 between the two circles we do 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.480
 one smaller 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.480
 OK 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.220
 this is the ears 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:52.680
 and now up here we do 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.280
 another circle another circle and here another 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.280
 circle 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.520
 and now here 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.510
 we put the center or leaving as 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.850
 this margin 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.850
 affirms another circus 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.040
 wrong 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.310
 as if this were one I'm this out the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.460
 pupil 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.460
 The pupil 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.209
 and now that we make another circle 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.330
 OK 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.080
 here we make another smaller circle 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.450
 for the pupils and another here 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.830
 here another 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.750
 or another 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.000
 or another 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.440
 and another 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.430
 and it's worth 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.430
 and now here 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.130
 we can divide it 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.340
 and now with a good marker we can 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.120
 we also have to do here good 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.120
 a rectangle 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 and other 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.340
 As you can see, it is already appreciated that we have done 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.810
 one face let's do it now go over it 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.260
 with the marker so that what we did 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.260
 best 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.310
 this is the nose 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.190
 it's the mouth 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.220
 are the teeth 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.220
 language 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.989
 is 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.989
 the pulse more sea I have 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.360
 here would be the brea 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.470
 we can make some stripes and for what 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.470
 always the ear 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.490
 now here we can make a straight 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.280
 the straight line 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.280
 it was here 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.550
 if we have the hair that we passed the eyebrow 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.660
 ah 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.480
 to 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.380
 ah 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.130
 ah 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.789
 ah 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.020
 and finished 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.180
 Well I hope you liked it

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:06.009
 You want me to try to answer and
