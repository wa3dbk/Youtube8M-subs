us watch interest ring is a few things
first<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.110> it's<00:00:22.710> tungsten<00:00:23.310> tungsten<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.540> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
first of all it's tungsten tungsten is a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.740 
first of all it's tungsten tungsten is a
fantastic<00:00:25.230> material<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:26.730> metal<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.180> very

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
fantastic material the metal is very

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.859 
fantastic material the metal is very
very<00:00:28.020> shiny<00:00:28.890> very<00:00:29.700> very<00:00:29.910> scratch<00:00:30.239> resistant

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
very shiny very very scratch resistant

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.920 
very shiny very very scratch resistant
it's<00:00:31.739> darker<00:00:32.369> than<00:00:32.399> steel<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.210> also<00:00:33.329> heavier

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
it's darker than steel it's also heavier

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.420 
it's darker than steel it's also heavier
than<00:00:34.110> steel<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.500> these<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.770> heavy<00:00:34.950> watches

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
than steel so these are heavy watches

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.220 
than steel so these are heavy watches
but<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.270> looks<00:00:36.570> cool<00:00:36.660> because

some decoration on there it has a power

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.440 
some decoration on there it has a power
reserve<00:00:55.290> indicator<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.610> well<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:57.090> addition<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
reserve indicator as well in addition to

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.510 
reserve indicator as well in addition to
the<00:00:57.600> time<00:00:57.840> there's<00:00:58.410> also<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.829> different<00:00:59.310> model

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the time there's also a different model

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.600 
the time there's also a different model
which<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> m-28<00:01:01.290> which<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.250> exact

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
which is the m-28 which is the exact

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.090 
which is the m-28 which is the exact
same<00:01:02.640> watch<00:01:03.239> except<00:01:04.199> there's<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.220> date<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
same watch except there's the date so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.800 
same watch except there's the date so
the<00:01:08.100> numerals<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> little<00:01:09.270> bit<00:01:09.420> different

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the numerals are a little bit different

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
the numerals are a little bit different
so<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> 12<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.130> 3<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.550> 6th

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
so if you see here the 12 the 3 the 6th

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520 
so if you see here the 12 the 3 the 6th
and<00:01:12.060> 9<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.330> larger<00:01:12.840> than<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> other<00:01:13.290> ones

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and 9 are larger than the other ones

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.100 
and 9 are larger than the other ones
it's<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.640> bit<00:01:14.760> rearranged<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> 3

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it's a little bit rearranged and the 3

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.420 
it's a little bit rearranged and the 3
is<00:01:16.229> smaller<00:01:16.409> than<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> other<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.130> there's<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
is smaller than the other one there's a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.810 
is smaller than the other one there's a
small<00:01:18.030> circular<00:01:18.990> date<00:01:19.290> hole<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
small circular date hole so this is a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.340 
small circular date hole so this is a
little<00:01:21.060> bit<00:01:21.150> more<00:01:21.270> cleaner<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.810> without<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
little bit more cleaner one without the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.670 
little bit more cleaner one without the
date<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.610> has<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:23.790> date<00:01:24.680> really

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
date that one has the date really

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.649 
date that one has the date really
depends<00:01:26.190> on<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
depends on on what you are I have it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.410 
depends on on what you are I have it
right<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.799> tungsten<00:01:29.130> bracelet<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
right now on the tungsten bracelet it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.730 
right now on the tungsten bracelet it
also<00:01:30.630> comes<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:32.000> shell<00:01:33.000> leather<00:01:33.740> strap

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
also comes with a shell leather strap

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.580 
also comes with a shell leather strap
and<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.700> pretty<00:01:35.880> thick<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.210> nice<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and it's pretty thick and nice and of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.490 
and it's pretty thick and nice and of
course<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.130> rubber<00:01:39.000> strap<00:01:39.450> as<00:01:39.720> well<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.320> think

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
course a rubber strap as well I think

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920 
course a rubber strap as well I think
the<00:01:40.710> pin<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.100> flew<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.760> there<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:42.720> comes

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the pin just flew out there it comes

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.270 
the pin just flew out there it comes
with<00:01:43.049> pins<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
with pins for all of them I like that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
with pins for all of them I like that
it's<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.119> pin<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it's not just one pin and the the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.750 
it's not just one pin and the the
buckles<00:01:46.440> if<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.770> tell<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.280> buckles<00:01:47.640> are

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
buckles if you can tell the buckles are

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.789 
buckles if you can tell the buckles are
also<00:01:47.880> tungsten<00:01:48.510> which<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.619> really

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
also tungsten which is really really

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.080 
also tungsten which is really really
nice

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
nice

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.600 
nice
in<00:01:51.270> terms<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.049> wearability<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.490> know

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
in terms of wearability this is you know

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.330 
in terms of wearability this is you know
this<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> part<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> M<00:01:55.650> collection<00:01:56.220> so

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this is a part of the M collection so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.070 
this is a part of the M collection so
it's<00:01:56.460> 44<00:01:56.939> millimeters<00:01:57.479> wide

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
it's 44 millimeters wide

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's 44 millimeters wide
I<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:58.920> illumise<00:01:59.159> fantastic<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.880> have<00:01:59.909> to
