00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 when it comes to football men 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.179
 they think for once with their hearts and they 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.190
 let go by their emotions bet 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.110
 bwin the best bet for the world 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.030
 bets for Spain in its first match 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 And if you lose against Holland, we'll give you back 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.230
 your bet so that you return to play each 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410
 second is a final 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.109
 bwin as we approach the day to be great 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.010
 day when Spain debuts in Brazil-2014 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.730
 and also against Holland the runner-up of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.090
 the latest edition 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.760
 in Brazil and I'm talking here with some 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.129
 mates of tn and that they see 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.160
 very well very well to spain 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.670
 the question also I four years ago 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.290
 I do not see any reason for not one 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.900
 can you say there is not so much hunger that already 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.110
 they have won it is true that some 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.900
 Barça football have not had their best 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.930
 season although it is true is that 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.220
 we all remember iniesta as the hero 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.200
 from South Africa he went to South Africa in a 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.930
 dubious moment 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.310
 had had a season 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.550
 of 2009/2010 lame with injuries and 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.300
 he came to south africa at sea ​​and harsh now 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.550
 I think he finished level 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.920
 frankly skin being the best player 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.800
 fc barcelona therefore we see him 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.619
 I'm in good shape and I think the 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.990
 footballers when the time comes 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.360
 the final one oil like this one 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.560
 They are very plugged in and I tell them 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.770
 about him 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.170
 but of the tenth sergio bouquets that is the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.600
 last section of the season was therefore 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.390
 that went out in frankly not 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.030
 I think when we talk about that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.899
 our group is a hard group with chile 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.869
 to holland also australia but with 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.429
 Dutch chili are very difficult rivals 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.220
 Well, I think the group, above all, is 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.649
 difficult for these two teams has 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.789
 holland had to face a 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.640
 team that knows what Spain is going 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.390
 sure about his understanding of the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.230
 matches there is always that question 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.530
 sansó nine or nine towers finished the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.110
 season in a pretty good way and 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.750
 diego costa are the alternatives 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.900
 to make 19 the village gourmand since 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.900
 scored a pair of goals against 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.720
 Salvador I do not see him as 9 will see the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.280
 forward explored a band 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.650
 preferably the left so that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.359
 between his right leg but I think 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.209
 that the question of sanz are nine 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.790
 factories 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.360
 it will depend on whom the opposing team 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.489
 has as central I think that if 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.769
 Vicente gets the two central 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.959
 that has the opposite team are 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.049
 gamers who likes to get the ball 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.299
 played from behind will put a 9 for 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.810
 to bother you in jos is fine then 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:09.379
 to disturb the exit if these two are 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.569
 more you came or plugs to those stoppers 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.569
 These are not so good with the feet 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.810
 but if they are combative I think they will play 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.180
 with false 'nine' so then these 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.180
 two has no one to stick with and no 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.879
 they have nobody to mark and we leave the 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.299
 more awkward in quotes with the ball 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.519
 in the I think there will be a 9 or not in 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.790
 function to a bit of how are the 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:38.000
 opposing team centers because before 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.760
 of first stake against controlling xxi 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.700
 I see Spain playing with a 9 a 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.540
 bother to leave from behind the team 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.450
 Dutch 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.540
 but I'm very, very optimistic about 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.319
 the possibilities of Spain to start 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.319
 with the victory 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 yes 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.310
 and good
