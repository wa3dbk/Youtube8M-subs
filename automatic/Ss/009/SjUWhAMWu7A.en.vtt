00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.540
 Now we will move a percussion patient higher up in the bed. 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.340
 Helga, who lies here, has paralysis on the left side, and has the right side fresh, - 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.220
 - so she can help and push off with her right leg. 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.100
 The first thing we have to do is raise the bed higher - 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.320
 - for the sake of our own backs. 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.520
 That's right. 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.240
 The way we move Helga higher up, is to grab the scraper that lies beneath the back of Helga, - 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.140
 - And take the other hand under her shoulder. 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.120
 When we take the hand under the shoulder, we push it with a flat hand, under and down to the shoulder blade about. 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.140
 And then we lift her higher up in the bed. 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.520
 One, two, three, and ... - 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.440
 - like that! There Helga has recovered well and well higher up in the bed. 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.940
 The first thing we have to do is raise the bed. 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.340
 - Tell me when it's right, there. 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.800
 And then we take and raise the head end, so that Helga sits in bed, before we push her out on the bed edge. 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.400
 Then I take a good hold of Helga's hand, and the other behind my back, - 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.180
 - while Kim takes a good hold of her feet. 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.980
 And then we count to three and get her out. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.360
 One two Three. 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 - You're sitting there. - I'm sitting here, me. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 Like that! Now I lower the bed again for Helga to get ground contact with her feet, - 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.780
 - so it's easier to move, and it's easier for us to get to when the head end is gone. 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.960
 So, we must also put on Helga's shoes, so that her feet do not slip when we move on her. 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.960
 Now we are going to get Helga into the wheelchair. 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.380
 Here's a grip we use all the time. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.460
 It provides good support both for the patient and for me, as a nurse. 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.200
 Kim will stand and watch the lame side, mostly underneath, just as Helga gets up, - 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.560
 - so she has a support function there. 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.700
 It is important that Kim supports the sick side, so that no shoulder is pulled out of the joints, - 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.780
 - or that the knee comes out of its position. 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.340
 - That way, you can get up, - 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.580
 - there, and find the balance. 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.460
 - Do you have the balance? 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.020
 Yes, then I take and change grip and take under Helga's arm, and Helga grabs the chair. 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.140
 There, and then we twist her around. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.400
 - And there you are. - Here's old. 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.440
 Now we have put Helga into the wheelchair - 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.140
 - and should put on the footrests and make her better in the chair. 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.140
 So, also the foot there. 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.360
 Now we have got on the footrests, and the next thing we should do now, - 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.980
 - is to make sure that Helga sits properly and straightens her in the chair. 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.560
 Then we have to make sure that the chair is locked and that the brakes are on. 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.680
 - Then you lean forward, and then you can push yourself in, Helga. 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.440
 - Like that! 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.840
 - You're fine. 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.920
 Thanks to Helga who was the patient
