00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
game works really well it is a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.100 
game works really well it is a
free-to-play<00:01:14.430> title<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.240> means<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
free-to-play title that means that you

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.780 
free-to-play title that means that you
know<00:01:16.229> there<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> in-app<00:01:16.950> purchases<00:01:17.549> there

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
know there is the in-app purchases there

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.120 
know there is the in-app purchases there
but<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.750> particularly<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.950> go

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
but you don't particularly have to go

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
but you don't particularly have to go
with<00:01:20.340> them<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:21.330> in-app<00:01:21.540> purchases<00:01:21.900> are

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
with them the in-app purchases are

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.109 
with them the in-app purchases are
basically<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.530> flexed<00:01:22.979> weaponry<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.970> on

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
basically are flexed weaponry and so on

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.260 
basically are flexed weaponry and so on
and<00:01:24.420> yeah<00:01:25.020> there's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.580> pay

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and yeah there's a little bit of a pay

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.030 
and yeah there's a little bit of a pay
to<00:01:27.330> win<00:01:27.630> formula<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.890> because

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
to win formula going on here but because

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.969 
to win formula going on here but because
it's<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.549> an<00:01:29.759> MMO<00:01:30.479> style<00:01:30.900> game<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.350> such<00:01:31.740> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
it's not an MMO style game as such it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.550 
it's not an MMO style game as such it's
not<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.610> player<00:01:33.030> versus<00:01:33.509> player<00:01:33.560> doesn't

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
not a player versus player doesn't

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.319 
not a player versus player doesn't
really<00:01:34.890> matter<00:01:35.189> quite<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.700> much<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
really matter quite so much think of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.359 
really matter quite so much think of
this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> diablo<00:01:38.009> 3

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this is more of kind of like a diablo 3

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
this is more of kind of like a diablo 3
style<00:01:38.700> game<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.119> obviously<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> third

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
style game but obviously in a third

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230 
style game but obviously in a third
person<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.890> works<00:01:41.250> incredibly<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
person it works incredibly well and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.719 
person it works incredibly well and
there's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.509> lot<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> fun<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.579> my<00:01:44.579> only

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
there's a lot of fun here my only

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
there's a lot of fun here my only
criticism<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.110> more<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
criticism and this is really more of a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.260 
criticism and this is really more of a
choice<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.920> designers<00:01:47.700> when<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.210> were

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
choice with designers when they were

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.819 
choice with designers when they were
creating<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> world<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.049> thing<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.619> feel<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
creating the world is thing can feel a
