00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:09.780
 Look at this very mean 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.990
 normal aerated concrete house but this is it with 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:20.670
 mind so on really now you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:28.440
 You will learn everything as you think it is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:35.670
 what is this white heap but for this 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:42.140
 wonderful home these heaps this 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:47.090
 stuff is not rubbish it is 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:51.769
 building material of this house yes yes 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.640
 this house is made of waste 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:02.549
 production of aerated concrete represent on 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.570
 aerated concrete poet enterprise goes from move 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.590
 waste goes 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.900
 go all sorts of nonsense 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:15.380
 chipped off blocks and so on and here from 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.380
 of these fragments from this waste 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:25.170
 some person decided to build 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.590
 imagine a big house this house has the size 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.079
 approximately according to my words here is a worker 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:38.090
 which was there 10 by 12 and he is absolutely 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.370
 there is all made of waste 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.410
 aerated concrete production 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.330
 Perhaps they can be at all 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.610
 giveaways can be worth it 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:55.970
 I don't know any real penny 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 amazing but by the way the stairs 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.980
 an interesting decision is beautiful by the way 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.980
 this one would not be stitched up 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.530
 and will remain but I when it is closer 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:13.290
 the whole thing considered it turned out that these 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.610
 pillars this with without that cement pipes and i 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.220
 probably wrong said no 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.090
 asbestos cement is shorter asbestos 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.610
 Anna's asbestos I don't know 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.640
 understanding with without it is harmful it can not be 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.310
 use indoors it is only for 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.840
 exterior it is somewhere there 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.720
 hidden and here is a staircase made at home from 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:44.180
 these pipes they are concreted on them they 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:47.430
 used so far and this is the second floor here 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.650
 here just the sun is more light 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.070
 more much better visible structure 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.070
 much better visible structure wall walls 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.170
 so now here 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:14.189
 Kapets I do not even know Kapets or super 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.189
 but no words and this is the second floor friends 2 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.930
 that is probably either a man of genius 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.129
 either a weirdo because well in a different way 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.680
 no way to name this whole thing 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:34.569
 see yes here we see everywhere 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.650
 monolithic beams probably it is 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.690
 some kind of spatial frame frame 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.519
 of this building on which probably all 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.370
 load and distributed 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:53.430
 and the walls it might just be like 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:55.750
 filler but dunno fig knows it 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.709
 here it is, this beam here these 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.319
 spatial as spatial 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.519
 skeleton reinforced concrete beam and this is the same 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.000
 poured on the spot well, in general, here is 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:14.910
 interesting house I drove by 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.039
 stopped couldn't just drive past 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.729
 surprisingly amazing what they can 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.740
 people what imagination is capable of 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:28.590
 Waste aerated concrete production 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.590
 make everything a big apartment building
