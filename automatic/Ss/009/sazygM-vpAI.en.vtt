00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.320
 hello I 'm life I'm part of 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.079
 movement to return that is what it says 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.889
 from padova and today i will show you how to drive 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.889
 produce the vegetable nut 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.730
 There are 2 ingredients for this recipe 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.090
 carrots 200 g of celery a courgette a 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.970
 fairly large onion about 20 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.640
 basil and sage leaves two 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.800
 rosemary sprigs and also wishing of 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.320
 parsley mint can be used 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.910
 vegetables and choice of seriousness also of the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.680
 fennel you can finance 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.410
 put knowing that the flavor anyway 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.720
 the vegetables will change once 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.239
 the armed that need to start a 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.159
 chop finely and put them in 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.619
 this case the steel 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.239
 after which the telecom tuzio of oil is the 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.420
 salt 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.949
 we have 150 grams of salt is not convenient 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.750
 put more who less should be 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.930
 equivalent to one third of the weight of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.790
 vegetables for two reasons first because the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.400
 salemi accesse could stay on 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:18.799
 bottom and second because too much to stay 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:20.720
 that of altering the taste of the tago the 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.270
 happy degrowth movement al 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.050
 national movement subdivisions circles 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.540
 territorial 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.500
 I am part of that of Padua I 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.190
 I deal with self-production 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.690
 movement is based on the principle that the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.640
 congress development is not always 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.160
 these a positive meaning is that the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.900
 wellness cannot be assessed 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.060
 via the GDP of a country 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.370
 among the various things he proposes 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.760
 movement is the replacement of the 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.310
 goods with self-production instead of of 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.270
 what we actually need if 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.979
 this is a qualitative improvement 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.650
 has a gradation of pollution of the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:05.700
 waste of costs and resources that 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:10.670
 we use to produce now we cut 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:16.380
 also the zucchini sage leaves 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.020
 programs fragment we add too 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.140
 the basil about twenty leaves o 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.140
 even more if you like to hear a lot 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.140
 favor 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:42.620
 we also hope the onion we add 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.620
 therefore suitable 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.820
 there is something about salt too 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.659
 at this point we put the pot on 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.190
 fire 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.450
 leave them for an hour or so there is no need 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.450
 of the genius of water because precisely 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.580
 water after leaving on the fire 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.409
 vegetables for tufted we put them in 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.610
 mixer 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.980
 we close and then put back the 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:21.769
 pot until certainty after 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:24.859
 that the procedure is almost cut one 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.599
 once you've found a place 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:33.109
 put on the fire but time until 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.780
 it dries up if the water 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.989
 after that it is ready to go to the phase 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.959
 of conservation we can put it i 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.750
 sterilized glass boys 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.530
 previously or also in 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.269
 aluminum containers the mind in 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.120
 thirst freezer because you freeze them 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.359
 there is no senate in large quantities 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.280
 the glass people had to be put back 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.650
 to put them under moso because second 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.120
 serve for six eight months thanks to a 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.829
 own piece of salt 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:07.480
 however if you don't have to trust you can 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:07.480
 however, doing it is very important to us 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:16.450
 technical hurry done so much
