00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.429
 because the connection video and and indeed 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.009
 traded it again today to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.570
 a graphics card a very special one 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:23.420
 company vtx 3d this is the edition xtra 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.760
 the number 9 270 iks with two gigabytes 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.990
 graphics memory agreed that here so 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:37.320
 supports directx 11 directx 11 2 pc 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.850
 Pastor is the union French 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.219
 Italian Italian Russian German 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 Turkish German Portuguese and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.739
 Spanish and German is what's on it 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.680
 powered by a on the edge of the 1970s 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.190
 iks gpu with a 256 bit 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.120
 memory interface shader model 5.0 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 through the full support of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.620
 directx 11 2 that could be too 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.309
 in fact it does not mean that at all 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.439
 opened 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.630
 I'll open it for the first time and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.299
 I'm curious almost everything is in it and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.700
 how the graphics card will look like 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.420
 vtx 3d I had so far none 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.920
 only graphics card in hand 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.640
 Of course, I'm also very interested in that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.320
 as looks from the outside 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 what can you do with everything what 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 Here the scope of supply with it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.290
 other graphics card manufacturers i know 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.939
 yes, but before de 3d is absolutely me 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.009
 I ordered the whole new one 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.759
 maybe you have it in the focus video 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.290
 foreseen at caseking in the form of one 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.180
 test order 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.100
 Packed today is the whole lot 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.010
 good because that is different 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.950
 the radeon r 1970 eex has now tasted 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.110
 and 11 64 euro 90 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.730
 yes and there she is already in red 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.780
 held 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.640
 at least the heat sink to the red 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.760
 this is the first page 2 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.710
 Foam spacer underneath 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:13.510
 hides ok a driver the cd 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:17.350
 I take rtx 3d but i think so 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.650
 better the drivers from the internet then 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.360
 here quick installation light one 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.490
 quick installation guide how 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.760
 you install a graphics card correctly 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.540
 I already have a few videos 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.640
 turned down 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.709
 Of course, the next one will come now too 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.750
 Clear and then we have it here once 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.020
 an adapter russians are one of dvi 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.540
 on vga or vice versa 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.220
 who knows , I wore it again more exactly 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.860
 for now let's look only times 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.290
 chose the graphics card so what here 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.120
 in red first time on it is this 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.200
 Product needs an external 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.040
 power supply 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.670
 Please close the electric cable of the network 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.630
 device of your system that the engine 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.280
 also ready 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.840
 that should be done at instant 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.570
 installation of this graphics card 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.370
 no case so forget the side 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:19.570
 Let's see that for connections 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:22.060
 it was necessary here just why it was completely 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.950
 just first house and as always when it is 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.459
 Do not forget to pack so nicely 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.840
 namely that earth and I do that 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.209
 graphics card equal first here on 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.209
 This carton did not happen that much 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.050
 so once the earth 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.050
 I'm also looking forward to the benchmarks 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.310
 Of course I will now too 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.560
 few benchmarks do that to her 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.690
 about how powerful is to 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.370
 example, this graphics card is the same 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.099
 Such a passionate Wow player 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.340
 Of course I will also wow with it 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.750
 clearly play what is currently stopping me 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.310
 a little bit here is the packaging 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.970
 damaged is not bad 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.040
 through the graphics card by known 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.459
 you just have to try that somehow 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.459
 get out 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:23.590
 this is expected on the front page 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:29.229
 us a form show a shapely red 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.090
 heat sink and a small plastic 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.660
 sticker we in the best first 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.220
 agree 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.200
 otherwise it looks a bit 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.150
 Dirty so do not forget about it here 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.150
 a little plastic please do 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.700
 from the graphics card has the graphics card 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.900
 a fan a relatively large one 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.720
 heatsink and we see here 28 mm 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.960
 completely relegated on one side 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.550
 go through here sitting in the middle 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.750
 the fan and here on the other 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.539
 They also go through the page again 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.220
 means the whole heatsink is 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.990
 crossed with these two big ones 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.389
 heatpipes we are really pretty 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.190
 big so in the back you can see the 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.690
 Power connections needed in 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:14.380
 in this case there are two 6 pin connections 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.639
 here and here a power supply needs this 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.650
 definitely support 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.150
 sometimes there are cables you can get 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.210
 Buy yourself in this case 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.389
 Unfortunately there were no cables here 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.270
 that is who a power supply should be this 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.720
 Cables definitely have big ones 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.450
 heat sink you see looks great with pipes 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.780
 a relatively big fan I am 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:42.550
 looking forward to the volume 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.950
 that's it from unboxing the vtx 3d radio 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.740
 nr 9 200 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.930
 I bought it at caseking 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.370
 to say more 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.390
 and now I will be the next 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.970
 install new computer 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.040
 will soon be available again new series and 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.980
 then I'm curious what this 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.280
 erasing again did not do them 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.350
 Make sure you are there when you 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.600
 the video has fallen leaves one 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.470
 comment on a thumbs up or 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.260
 below 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.620
 depending and see you at 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.530
 next video on and hcv some of 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.180
 you do not know the manufacturer but 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.610
 the distributor or dealer 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.610
 caseking is not completely unknown
