a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.770> bit<00:00:55.980> softer<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.270> work

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
a little bit softer so that you can work

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.930 
a little bit softer so that you can work
with<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.379> bow<00:00:58.559> dr<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.430> hit<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> heat

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
with it or your bow dr you hit the heat

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.070 
with it or your bow dr you hit the heat
underneath<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.340> when<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> come<00:01:03.000> out

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
underneath and then when you come out

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.940 
underneath and then when you come out
see<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> pop<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.739> back<00:01:04.769> in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.529 

I<00:01:11.060> tend<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> use<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:13.049> flat<00:01:13.350> iron<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:14.539> several

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
I tend to use the flat iron from several

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.249 
I tend to use the flat iron from several
inches<00:01:15.750> out<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:18.270> reason<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
inches out and the reason I do that is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.700 
inches out and the reason I do that is
so<00:01:19.469> that<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.219> don't<00:01:20.780> flatten<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.079> roots

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.499 

you<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.789> part<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.329> going

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to go all the way to the root and come

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.789 
to go all the way to the root and come
out<00:01:29.429> so<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.539> we<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.990> polished<00:01:31.530> right

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
out so that we get that polished right
