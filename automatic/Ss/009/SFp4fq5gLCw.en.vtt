00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.799
 We talk about cars with lots of fun 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.799
 welcome to the island of rockstars 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.730
 hello and welcome to the voice 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.590
 over cars and today there is another 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 because I'm the new one yesterday 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.390
 Mazda 2 drove it from the end 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 february 2015 trade 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.930
 From the outside, the new five-door looks 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 mazda2 quite sporty with his after 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.289
 reared greenhouse and the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.449
 horizontal line from the headlights 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.219
 up to the tail lights the headlights 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.510
 even sit deep next to the grille 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.910
 and are highest in the two 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.860
 equipment line in full led available 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.170
 the grown mazda2 is now four 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.090
 meter six long 149 high and with 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 outside mirror 198 wide 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.530
 He has a turning circle of 9 4 meters 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.930
 So again to the city flitzer the now 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.789
 larger wheelbase of 2 750 and the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.039
 optimized interior enable the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.570
 a lot of knees and front and passenger 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.610
 shoulder clearance and the back 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.219
 he should have a larger field of vision 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 small criticism is the driver's seat 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.059
 adjusted to a height of eg 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.750
 Then it will be back then already 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.939
 a little closer 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.560
 the trunk holds regular 280 liters 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.659
 in folded rear seats what in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.939
 60 relatively fit 40 possible 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.350
 then up to 950 liters pure that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.689
 but only if you have the mazda2 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.100
 completely up to the roof forms the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.580
 empty weight of our test car here 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.560
 is 1050 kilograms is allowed 530 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.509
 kilograms are loaded so much 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 The facts of the interior are clear 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.630
 arranged in control elements for the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.350
 drivers and controls for the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.270
 co-driver 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.159
 The surfaces themselves have a high quality 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.390
 and processed well five 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.159
 interior concept in four 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.750
 Equipment lines are possible and all 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.460
 four have an extensive 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 standard equipment from the center line 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.280
 For example, there is the air conditioning and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 a sport leather steering wheel and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.740
 leather shift knob is then also series that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.479
 system mcd connect is from the exclusive 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.860
 line on board with him you can everywhere 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.360
 a paired smartphone on 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.020
 various infotainment services 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.310
 access 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.899
 unfortunately we could not do that here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.549
 Try the handsfree function 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.140
 we could use that and external 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.390
 then music player went 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.520
 also via the so-called eco display 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.490
 you get information about the efficiency of cars 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.509
 optional is also that mazda sd 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.069
 navigation system integrates the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.989
 standard equipment of the sports line 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.860
 includes exactly this 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.610
 display 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.290
 what to use the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.210
 infotainment system is needed 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.530
 Alternatively, you can also per 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.420
 voice control or via one 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.280
 Rotary switch make the selection 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.740
 also standard in this line 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.900
 are an automatic climate control 16 inch and 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.880
 chrome tailpipes the optional new 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.550
 head up displays already from the mazda3 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.660
 can is called active 3d display that is 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.250
 The information does not become direct 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.020
 the disc mirrored but also so 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.390
 a small plastic disk above 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.440
 the steering wheel extends optional technology 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.660
 Package are available assistant systems 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.790
 such as an unpacked help 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.090
 change a track and 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.709
 lane departure warning a 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.510
 high-beam assistant and a cd 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.220
 emergency brake function ensures this 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.470
 for example in city traffic up to one 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.270
 speed of 30 km / h for that 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.040
 the vehicle can brake automatically 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.600
 Let's go to the motors Mazda 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.370
 itself offers two engines rows 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.680
 four-cylinder gasoline engine with a displacement 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.739
 from 1 to 5 liters and with a performance 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.360
 range between 75 90 or 115 ps and 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.620
 a new developed series 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.690
 Four-cylinder diesel is still available 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.940
 the same capacity and a performance 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.580
 of 105 ps the gasoline consume ever 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 after engine power between 45 and 4.9 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.170
 liter loudly the diesel fuel is attached 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.350
 3.4 liters per 100 kilometers were supposed to be 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.030
 emit just 89 grams CO2 per kilometer 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.560
 All motors are standard with one 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.900
 equipped start-stop system and the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.549
 115 ps gasoline has the addition 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.320
 recover the braking energy 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.810
 depending on the engine and engine power 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.150
 the mazda needs 2 87 to 12,1 seconds 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.650
 for the standard sprint from 0 to 100 km 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.130
 h is the top speed 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.780
 between 171 and 200 km h as standard 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.390
 are five or six-speed manual 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.260
 installed and only at 90 ps gasoline can 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.060
 you optionally the new one 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.900
 six-speed automatic get the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.610
 award-ask 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.970
 Let's go with the over the front wheels 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.950
 powered 75 hp petrol from 12 1790 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.420
 euro but depending on the equipment you can 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.019
 Of course, this value also goes up 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.000
 correct 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.430
 in the highest trim line so 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.500
 the sportsline is the 105 ps diesel 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.200
 remains 19 1390 euro 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.910
 my conclusion mazda makes a lot of things right 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.950
 while the other manufacturers are in the 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.230
 downsizing robust dueling remains 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.790
 Her capacity trump is the new Mazda 2 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.320
 in my opinion the nicest little one 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.480
 Bank of the mazda of all time because under 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.489
 the predecessors were far from us 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.020
 not so attractive or he drives 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.970
 also really good steering is now 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.430
 not so direct but for the classic 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.580
 The suspension is comfortable 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.990
 Voted 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.039
 Brakes can be finely dosed 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.509
 By the way, there are the following 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.220
 disc brakes and back is still 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.810
 tumbled we could do the manual 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.729
 five- speed gearbox tester features 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.050
 short circuit paths of course you have to 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.400
 Motor also a bit at speed 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.060
 if you go there to overtake 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.379
 wants to start 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.270
 but that's all really possible here 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.949
 The seats are perfectly in order 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.289
 comfortable and provide enough lateral support 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.330
 Unfortunately , only the bike in the 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.050
 height adjust what I miss one 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.879
 backup camera 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.110
 I honestly can not understand 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.789
 that in the mazda2 so much 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.500
 But there are technical knick knacks 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.849
 that his camera has been omitted 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.590
 unfortunately was waived on one 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.180
 central armrest on a lighting in the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.490
 Fund and also on the anti-trap 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.080
 the windows and if I as a driver 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.000
 the windows rear, for example 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.530
 lock or for the passenger 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.360
 then I can not do it myself either 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.069
 open close that's all 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.150
 Trifles in the reason completely the 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.370
 mazda2 really good 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.169
 how do you like him? 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.580
 The comments I would be happy 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.800
 also about a like either for me 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.750
 or for the mazda2 and of course 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.069
 if you subscribe to this channel until 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.960
 next time it's called voice 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.960
 over cars and that 's it
