00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.950

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:27.020
 so the coach is commenting on me 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.550

 and this I'm going to show you what 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.239
 we need to have is to be already installed and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.739
 we have no idea you just can not 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.510
 to install site search there videos 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.269
 on the internet there is ok we get in like this 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.430
 we wait for it to finish loading here 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.719
 it usually takes a little bit 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.609
 that it does not take me long for them to 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.600

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.589
 very short what I want to show you this 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.059
 let's install 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.799
 some good things we are going to add 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.909
 a source and we're going to install one thing 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:09.640

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:28.539
 50 62 132 and I put it 123 here there was a 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:32.599
 small then a small error error 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:36.910

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.680
 ok this is the description for 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.740
 that the same mistake that happened to me does not happen 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.860
 to me 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.840
 ready look here is 15 of 24 19 of 24 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:54.169

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.000

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.580
 be already has to be empty organize 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.210
 be empty like when I got this 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.040
 and it said that it went in 10 there to element and 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.290
 I was already connected 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.080
 Nothing, that's all they see in the 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.759
 server list 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.160
 at this moment I do not think that it puts me 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.950
 why 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.980
 It is very very loaded and it will not leave me 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.760
 get me but if we get when it's 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.930
 in 10 or in a player or between those and 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.060
 fast we have to get in and we 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.360
 load the world quickly so it's 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.360
 full 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:37.080
 quickly and if we do not leave and that's 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:40.080
 everything is the meta mister I already know 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.080
