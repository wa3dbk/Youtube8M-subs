 Russell is indirectly saying that

 'resident evil' 7 could actually be 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.520

 the fans since returning to survival 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:01.099
 useful in some way what's important here 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.439
 is that all the fans of 'resident evil'
