overall i would rate the product well i
got<00:01:27.450> nine<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> 10<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.310> does

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
got nine out of 10 because it does

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.520 
got nine out of 10 because it does
recording<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> wee<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> weird<00:01:30.659> format<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
recording a wee a weird format but it
