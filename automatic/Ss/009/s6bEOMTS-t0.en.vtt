00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 and today we will learn how to 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.879
 feed well in summer 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 Now let's talk about summer food. 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.470
 for the summer because we 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.100
 Can you understand that, it 's very interesting. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.990
 is that the concept of summer it is vacation 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.840
 is a concept of totally relaxing in the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.840
 diet and personal forget totally have 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 beginning then I pray for the love of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.360
 God is always like fruit vegetables and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.430
 vegetables do not forget them everyday 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.820
 because they will protect against diseases 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 and others will leave a general well-being 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.700
 person 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.250
 this is what can not be missing in addition 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.250
 hydration adaptation in the summer I think 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.010
 is the good is said always be with water juice 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.600
 natural coconut water has to have the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.129
 hydration on a daily basis 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.680
 When you talk about these foods 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.690
 people have to eat every day or at least 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.300
 one day at least one day does not have much 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.979
 adventure nia propose that organization 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.979
 indicates that it has five 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.880
 servings of fruit vegetables or 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.409
 vegetables 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 so we always say do not like 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.170
 lots of vegetables vegetables do not like much 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.890
 of the vegetable goes to the fruit and in the day sum 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.680
 five 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.040
 preferably do not repeat from there you will 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.920
 have to color in your diet 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.619
 we should avoid this time of year 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.960
 and the ideal is not to consume many 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.970
 fried processed foods 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.490
 have a lot of sodium mainly because 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.710
 in summer it has more body and food 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.299
 contains too much sodium causes more swelling and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.549
 You look like you've put on a 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.040
 A little bit, it's just fat. 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.729
 retention of liquid that bond as in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.020
 summer beyond the fruit of greenery what 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.140
 people can eat in terms of 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.470
 a little more substantial feed 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.969
 ideally to have at least one 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.350
 full meal 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.049
 the full meal is a dish 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.189
 healthy healthy dish half of the plate 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.520
 salad vegetables vegetable group been the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.970
 more colorful better 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.090
 and a quarter of the face carbohydrate dish 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.090
 rice beans 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.920
 potato noodles that is a quarter of a 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.129
 dish and a quarter of the protein dish 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.489
 be a steak a chicken size palm 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.489
 of hand 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:35.049
 paulo six of them of the form a little bit 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.910
 Now you talk about this 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.299
 summer because they are less hungry 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.940
 operating more stimulus from the center 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.980
 society , the brain's hunger center is 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.870
 very interesting that after finishing the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.940
 exercise many people do over 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 exercise do not in any way the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.069
 Exercise usually elapsed person 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.950
 not hungry because it takes time and rural 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.420
 already a swimming I felt very hungry 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.790
 because it does not take as much temperature 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.769
 body when it extends elevates 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.360
 body temperature the center of 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.950
 satiation stimulated 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:13.000
 so you do not have much hunger 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:15.000
 interesting is that you think I'm going to do it 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.889
 It's great for dieting. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.709
 now I 'm going to talk about senninha too 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.989
 say whether it is true that beer it 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.389
 who was at the edge of the beach, she 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:31.420
 problem that accompanies the beer is 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:33.280
 truth depends on how much is the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.170
 appetizer which is usually the appetizer 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.780
 that the bp del core company he has 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.060
 hard insurance for delaying absorption 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.639
 of the alcohol then a great function of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.829
 appetizer to slow the absorption of alcohol 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.290
 not to climb snows is not well 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.609
 band then you do not have fat in 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.359
 policy it is fulfilling the function 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.889
 him and he's fat he fattening 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.720
 so the problem is the goal is 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.269
 quantities and neighbors who always 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.340
 ask patients how much you remember 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.660
 What did you say you did not remember about the kiss? 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.150
 To get that lady who 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.739
 it stays on the ceiling, it will not be 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.840
 same function 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:15.019
 to have to switch is a beer 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.389
 water punch or beer is fine 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.370
 duo will now hear another 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.889
 problem in summer is too much congestion 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.040
 people are afraid to eat and then 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.990
 diving in the sea or in the 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.060
 happens even really big 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.639
 physical exercise problem 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.470
 if you're like something all the flow 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.389
 blood will have your stomach 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.310
 from that moment you to do 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.380
 an exercise that changes the blood flow 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.310
 for legs and arms to perform the 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.010
 exercise 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.930
 now if you've just finished eating food 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.290
 It will stop there so it will not be a good 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.080
 exercise and neither does the food go well 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.850
 then to exercise in which one 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.160
 light meal 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.120
 if it is a light meal you can take 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.610
 There is no problem 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.010
 can now swim the problem if you eat 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.660
 something that is the appetizer with something 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.330
 And you can swim. 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.220
 it is usually dropped what the pt 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.770
 disagreed and we will handle in the summer 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.590
 he feels less hungry but we also 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.479
 likes these subjects and I do not 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.910
 I forget, but the palm of the hand gets this. 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.690
 The monkey is going to get on well with me. 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.690
 appreciate
