00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.680 
though it really lengthens them and adds
that<00:01:34.890> Cheryl<00:01:35.310> Cole<00:01:35.550> touch<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> know

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
that Cheryl Cole touch to it if you know

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.410 
that Cheryl Cole touch to it if you know
what<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.870> mean<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.340> wand<00:01:38.550> on<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.850> mascara<00:01:39.210> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
what I mean the wand on this mascara is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
what I mean the wand on this mascara is
actually<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.870> lot<00:01:40.020> thinner<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.530> carries<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:40.830> bit

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
actually a lot thinner and carries a bit

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
actually a lot thinner and carries a bit
more<00:01:41.190> product<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.360> great<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.930> adding

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
more product which is great for adding

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.750 
more product which is great for adding
the<00:01:43.320> length<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.950> lashes<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
the length to the lashes because it

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.610 
the length to the lashes because it
means<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.510> lash<00:01:46.020> gets<00:01:46.350> coated

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
means that all of the lash gets coated

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.620 
means that all of the lash gets coated
in<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.979> product<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.580> because<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.270> bristles

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
in the product and because the bristles

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
in the product and because the bristles
are<00:01:48.720> short<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.260> means<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.830> lashes<00:01:50.490> can

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
are short it means that the lashes can

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.400 
are short it means that the lashes can
actually<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.120> right<00:01:51.360> into<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> product<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
actually get right into the product and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.980 
actually get right into the product and
I<00:01:53.250> will<00:01:53.400> show<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:54.000> coat<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.330> this<00:01:54.660> in<00:01:54.870> a
