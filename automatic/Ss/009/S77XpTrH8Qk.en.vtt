00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.100
 ah 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.180
 Now I'm Raquel and I'm going to show you some 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.820
 vegetable soy burgers the 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.310
 ingredients may vary there are people 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.810
 who see more vegetables there are less 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.720
 we live another way is that I do them 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.269
 we usually need soy 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.980
 textured is this is protein from 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.289
 soybeans that sell it so dehydrated the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.930
 you can find in herbalists and in 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:38.270
 dietetic stores mushrooms 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:41.120
 eggs carrot garlic some pipes 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.310
 sunflower in this case are raw seeds 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.470
 of sesame parsley dry oil this is 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.800
 chickpea flour flour 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.879
 I make chickpeas, crushing chickpeas 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:00.850
 but we also need oil pan 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.850
 grated salt and water 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.060
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.530
 moisturize it to textured soy 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.860
 So what we do is that the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.970
 take in a bowl and add water 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 boiling is for you to have a measure 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.460
 of soybean by two measures of water 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.859
 what we are going to do is arrive 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.929
 Gently with some ingredients 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.140
 The first thing we will add is the 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:42.240
 carrot that we have scratched so that we 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.240
 last easy then eat it 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.479
 ah 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.530
 we add the bass that we have also 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.530
 analyzed 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.759
 yes 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.840
 and now we add that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.220
 You see how they have sucked all the water that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.690
 we have added it but need a 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.820
 little bit of cooking actually made it 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.800
 we will add a little more water if 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.680
 we see that they are very dry now that 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.410
 we had about 5 or 6 minutes 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 suffering at low heat in the pan what 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.400
 let's move on to an egg 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.250
 well, we've let the 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.720
 mass is more like this as it could be 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.010
 eat but how do we want to form 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.060
 burgers what we're going to do is 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.060
 add a couple of all 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.580
 and now the removal 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.690
 the treatment that we have to give 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.130
 now it's like we do some 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.470
 normal veal burgers and if 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.780
 you eat only that they stay a little longer 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.770
 wet and you have to add more bread 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.850
 grated 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.920
 little by little up here 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.540
 you see that it has a consistency that 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.160
 can work well with your hands 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.160
 it always decreases 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.739
 As you can see, it has gotten thick and is no longer 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.340
 go as liquid as before and now it 's 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.450
 matter of catching to go doing 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.069
 functions keep doing 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.069
 we choose with clean hands 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.990
 you can also wet a little bit the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.880
 hands if you see that 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.340
 that his hits a lot and it would be a matter of 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.890
 pass it through the flour and squeeze well that 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.370
 Do not leave an excess of flour on the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.370
 hamburger 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.090
 now it's simply frying them 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.040
 the abundant oil for us to stay 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.900
 crispy because as we said before 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.660
 the dough is already made 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.610
 then we heat some oil 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.660
 olive in a pan 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.500
 we hope it costs a lot 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.400
 temperature to take this layer 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.450
 President 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.450
 abroad 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.840
 one of them we have and chang we pass them to 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.410
 a paper to an absorbent paper for 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.920
 eliminate the excess oil and ya 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.600
 we can enter 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.340
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.380
 encourage them to do them because they do not result 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.380
 nothing difficult and take advantage
