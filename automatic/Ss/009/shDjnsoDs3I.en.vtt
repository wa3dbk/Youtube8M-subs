00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.399
 for many a harley davidson 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.720
 it can be a radical chopper image 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.880
 from the one we found in easy 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.530
 rider or a custom touring to 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.370
 the American like a magnificent 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.740
 electra glide 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.780
 but in 2014 a harley davidson it can 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.640
 to be really a brand new bike 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.660
 very different and that's why 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.350
 today we will introduce you 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.070
 the new street 750 in the vicinity 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.570
 from madrid 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.510
 harley davidson is a builder 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.300
 leader in the field of custom but 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.590
 like any good builder he needs 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.119
 to post growth 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.939
 the US market is relatively 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.780
 saturated the European market is a bit in 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.280
 so berne 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.590
 harley davidson needs to find 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.230
 solutions what why he designed this 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.060
 motorcycle in the United States where she will be 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.500
 also assembled to provide the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.200
 American market but it will also be 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.710
 assembled in a manufacturing unit 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.080
 Indian to supply the Indian market 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.990
 which shows him a strong demand and a 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.960
 strong growth and it's also the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.540
 harley davidson street 750 assembled in 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.790
 india who will take the boat for 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.500
 to feed the European markets 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.500
 we will present this bike 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.620
 this new harley davidson street 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.720
 750 uses a brand new engine there 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.580
 is called revolution x and it is 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.890
 water cooled look at it huge 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.810
 radiator here it is at the level of 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.010
 the aesthetics we do not have at all 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.720
 same aesthetic as the engines 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.170
 sporster where the big touring of cherhal 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.790
 and davidson 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.470
 he displays seven hundred fifty 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.600
 cubic centimeters there are also in 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.910
 five cubic centimeters but we'll have 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.890
 certainly not in europe and it displays 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.800
 60 newton-meters of torque so that's 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.880
 a more modern engine than the majority 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.950
 harley davidson engine 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.780
 so it will pass more easily 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.490
 standards what why of course harley 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.690
 davidson finally opted for a 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.820
 liquid cooling 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.560
 the overall quality of the bike is pretty 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.600
 satisfactory with the presence when 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.040
 even a lot of metal so it is 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.850
 rather well although at the level of 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.470
 finishing details 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.540
 there is a little bit of work still 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.950
 looked at the beam there it's not very 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.790
 happy at the level of ergonomics it's 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.130
 rather a good surprise 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.870
 the seat is very low 7 109 mm we put 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.790
 feet on the ground very easily 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.590
 the guide is not too wide it is 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.420
 quite raised we have a position of arms 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.830
 who is relatively relaxed and the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.330
 foot rest are not arranged very 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.750
 forward as sometimes on some 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.820
 analysts 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.470
 harley davidson so in fact we have a 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.900
 fairly natural ergonomics that promotes 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.209
 the grip it will be pretty good 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.380
 for the targeted clientele, in particular 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.380
 beginners and beginners 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.810
 here we rolled in the streets 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.849
 congested with madrid and in 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.590
 surrounding mountains so we did well 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.910
 identify road behavior is 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.640
 dynamic of this new harley 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.220
 davidson street 750 so first of all 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.640
 what we are seeing is the ease of 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.030
 conduct 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.629
 the grip low seat height 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.730
 natural ergonomics 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.080
 the engine that really does not pose a problem 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.730
 problem with driving with 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.250
 flexible soft clutch box controls 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.470
 easy to grasp 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.269
 so that's pretty good it makes it easier 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.549
 task to discover this new bike 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.959
 but this bike does not have the character 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.489
 actually guy and harley davidson 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.410
 that we know until then the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.880
 engine start did not like anything 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.460
 particular there is no vibration 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.139
 for example we do not have this noise either 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.889
 of gearbox short we do not have 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.600
 really everything that characterizes 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.550
 the universe of a harley davidson 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.440
 classic so it loses a bit in 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.120
 characters on the other hand what we notice 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.400
 is that the bike is very homogeneous 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.270
 finally in the image of his engine that 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.169
 is modern who quickly takes his 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.260
 accelerations that accelerates so 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.550
 linear progressive and much more is this 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.590
 that they are much faster than 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.020
 the harley davidson sportster 883 by 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.370
 example but this engine is finally 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.919
 homogeneous between flexibility and 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.330
 availability at low and mid revs 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.910
 performance in the image of the party 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.870
 cycle because the bike is very healthy she 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.820
 is stable at high speed 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.500
 she is very agile in town or in 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.300
 turn portions go more accurate 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.979
 also in his placement much more 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.349
 that a sportster sas is almost assured 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.599
 so it's a bike that will be easy to 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.970
 taken in hand and who will have enough 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.919
 of overall performance between enters the 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.750
 engine and chassis to accompany 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.849
 a progression and it is favorable to 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.580
 beginners like the fact that she will be 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.440
 homologated at 2 on the other hand what we 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.740
 appreciate less is that there is no 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.990
 drop 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.800
 it's not even planned in the program and 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.800
 that would be a bit of a pity 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.190
 if you want to learn more 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.760
 on the full test of this new 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.060
 street 750 harley davidson of a new 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.010
 kind 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.990
