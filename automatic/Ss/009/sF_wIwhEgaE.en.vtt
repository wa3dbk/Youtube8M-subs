00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
trimmer aside you won't be needing that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.830 
trimmer aside you won't be needing that
and<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.540> ahead<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:53.840> kinda

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and you can just go ahead and kinda

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.390 
and you can just go ahead and kinda
Kreesha<00:01:55.140> folds<00:01:55.680> in

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.770 

and<00:02:02.400> then<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> texturize<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.600> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and then to texturize that this is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.950 
and then to texturize that this is
obviously<00:02:04.400> bigger<00:02:05.400> than<00:02:05.670> our<00:02:05.790> folders<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.930> I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
obviously bigger than our folders what I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.050 
obviously bigger than our folders what I
did<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.440> just<00:02:07.500> simply<00:02:07.740> folded<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.580> folder

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
did is I just simply folded it in folder

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.690 
did is I just simply folded it in folder
the<00:02:09.179> top<00:02:09.390> down<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.869> create<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> square<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.979> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the top down to create a square and I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.030 
the top down to create a square and I
inserted<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.540> into<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.959> folder<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.860> might

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
inserted it into the folder you might

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.710 
inserted it into the folder you might
have<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.340> crank<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.730> little<00:02:15.000> bit<00:02:15.120> harder<00:02:15.450> but<00:02:15.569> it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
have to crank a little bit harder but it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.690 
have to crank a little bit harder but it
does<00:02:15.930> go<00:02:16.200> through<00:02:16.250> okay<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.459> then<00:02:17.550> you'll

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
does go through okay and then you'll

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
does go through okay and then you'll
have<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:18.630> texture<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:20.540> once<00:02:21.540> you've

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
have your texture on that once you've

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.390 
have your texture on that once you've
done<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.770> one<00:02:22.950> that's<00:02:23.130> already

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
done that and I have one that's already

done that and I have one that's already
done<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.790> feel<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> little<00:02:24.450> bit<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.810> Julia

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
done I feel a little bit like Julia

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.600 
done I feel a little bit like Julia
Child's<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.220> that's<00:02:26.340> already

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
and take your snips and you're just

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.199 
and take your snips and you're just
going<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.320> snip<00:02:31.610> along<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.760> sides<00:02:33.500> like<00:02:34.500> that

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
going to snip along the sides like that

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.970 
going to snip along the sides like that
just<00:02:36.209> up<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.720> middle<00:02:37.019> line<00:02:37.380> flip<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.950> the

the same thing over here so now you've

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.180 
the same thing over here so now you've
got<00:02:44.550> flaps<00:02:45.120> like<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.690> oops<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.950> didn't

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
got flaps like that oops and I didn't

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.440 
got flaps like that oops and I didn't
grab<00:02:47.310> my<00:02:47.519> stay<00:02:47.730> part<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.209> do<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.360> with

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
grab my stay part we can do it with

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.120 
grab my stay part we can do it with
adhesive<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.709> where<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.890> little

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
adhesive now this is where a little

creative license you can your what
you're<00:02:54.209> going<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.540> you're<00:02:54.600> going<00:02:54.720> to

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.910 
you're going to do is you're going to
take<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.989> sides<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.530> you're<00:02:55.680> going<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.830> bring

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
take the sides and you're going to bring

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.410 
take the sides and you're going to bring
them<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> can<00:02:56.670> make<00:02:56.819> your<00:02:56.970> basket

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
them in and you can make your basket

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.660 
them in and you can make your basket
taller<00:02:57.690> by<00:02:57.989> pulling<00:02:58.319> them<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.560> real<00:02:58.739> high<00:02:58.950> you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
taller by pulling them in real high you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.280 
taller by pulling them in real high you
can<00:02:59.850> make<00:03:00.030> them<00:03:00.209> more<00:03:00.239> shallow<00:03:00.690> by<00:03:00.959> pulling

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
can make them more shallow by pulling

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.600 
can make them more shallow by pulling
them<00:03:01.440> out<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.920> side<00:03:02.130> it's<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.519> be

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
them out to the side it's going to be

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.810 
them out to the side it's going to be
totally<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:04.010> let's<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.220> ahead<00:03:05.310> and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
totally up to you and let's go ahead and

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.210 
totally up to you and let's go ahead and
just<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> ease<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.140> showing<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.070> today

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
just for the ease of showing you today

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.240 
just for the ease of showing you today
let's<00:03:08.549> use<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> dimensional<00:03:09.360> for<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:10.250> so

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
let's use a dimensional for this then so

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.250 
let's use a dimensional for this then so
let's<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:11.670> put<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> dimensional<00:03:12.540> here<00:03:12.959> a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.960 

stapler<00:03:16.260> usually<00:03:17.010> my<00:03:17.130> preferred<00:03:17.579> tool<00:03:17.790> just

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
stapler usually my preferred tool just

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.310 
stapler usually my preferred tool just
to<00:03:18.090> hold<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.390> edge<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.750> basket<00:03:19.200> together

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
to hold the edge of the basket together

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.880 
to hold the edge of the basket together
but<00:03:19.709> we'll<00:03:19.829> use<00:03:19.980> dimensionals<00:03:20.610> for<00:03:20.760> now

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
but we'll use dimensionals for now

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.020 
but we'll use dimensionals for now
everybody<00:03:22.890> can<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.130> use<00:03:23.280> your<00:03:23.430> adhesive<00:03:23.700> of

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
everybody can just use your adhesive of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.240 
everybody can just use your adhesive of
choice<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:25.170> I'm<00:03:25.320> just<00:03:25.440> going<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.680> pull<00:03:25.860> mine<00:03:26.070> in

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
choice so I'm just going to pull mine in

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.220 
choice so I'm just going to pull mine in
so<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.700> have<00:03:27.000> an<00:03:27.299> edge<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.600> looks<00:03:28.049> like

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
so that I have an edge that looks like

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.110 
so that I have an edge that looks like
that<00:03:28.530> around<00:03:29.459> here<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.970> other<00:03:30.150> side<00:03:32.120> and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
that around here to the other side and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.819 
that around here to the other side and
we'll<00:03:33.450> put<00:03:33.630> our<00:03:33.750> little<00:03:33.959> dimensionals<00:03:34.530> down

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.039 

and<00:03:40.829> again<00:03:41.070> same<00:03:41.370> thing<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.970> kind<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.810> making

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
and again same thing just kind of making
