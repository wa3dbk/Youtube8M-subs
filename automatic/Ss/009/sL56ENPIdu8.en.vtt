00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050 

many<00:00:00.510> of<00:00:00.659> you<00:00:00.780> asked<00:00:01.020> how<00:00:01.770> I<00:00:01.800> work<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.520> tension

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
many of you asked how I work the tension

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.110 
many of you asked how I work the tension
in<00:00:03.300> my<00:00:03.720> left<00:00:03.959> hand<00:00:04.380> when<00:00:04.589> I'm<00:00:04.740> crocheting<00:00:05.339> and

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
in my left hand when I'm crocheting and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.830 
in my left hand when I'm crocheting and
it's<00:00:06.930> hard<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.440> show<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:07.830> camera<00:00:08.730> how<00:00:09.660> I'm

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
it's hard to show on camera how I'm

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.249 
it's hard to show on camera how I'm
running<00:00:10.170> my<00:00:10.320> tension<00:00:10.860> through<00:00:11.160> my<00:00:11.900> hand<00:00:12.900> and

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
running my tension through my hand and

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.820 
running my tension through my hand and
actually<00:00:14.360> my<00:00:15.360> fingers<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:16.049> closed<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.590> like

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
actually my fingers are closed up like

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.769 
actually my fingers are closed up like
this<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.550> even<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> camera

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
this so even if I have a camera

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.010 
this so even if I have a camera
underneath<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:20.039> hard<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.550> show<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.840> is

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
underneath it's hard to show so this is

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.320 
underneath it's hard to show so this is
what<00:00:22.199> happens<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.789> crochet<00:00:24.119> hook

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
what happens so this is the crochet hook

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.390 
what happens so this is the crochet hook
pulling<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> yarn<00:00:25.289> through<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.890> control

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
pulling the yarn through and I control

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.349 
pulling the yarn through and I control
it<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.900> use<00:00:28.170> these<00:00:28.439> three<00:00:28.800> fingers

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
it like this I use these three fingers

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.089 
it like this I use these three fingers
just<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.750> would<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.349> sewing<00:00:31.710> machine

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
just like you would in a sewing machine

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.979 
just like you would in a sewing machine
when<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.579> tension<00:00:32.940> sometimes<00:00:33.540> it's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
when you have tension sometimes it's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.069 
when you have tension sometimes it's
looser<00:00:34.440> sometimes<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.219> tighter<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:36.079> use

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
looser sometimes it's tighter I use

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.959 
looser sometimes it's tighter I use
these<00:00:37.380> three<00:00:37.739> fingers<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.340> control<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
these three fingers to control the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.729 
these three fingers to control the
tension<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.570> sometimes<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.230> may<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.620> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
tension so sometimes I may want it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
tension so sometimes I may want it
looser<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.309> I'll<00:00:41.399> let<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.610> run<00:00:41.910> through<00:00:41.940> freely

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
looser so I'll let it run through freely

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.930 
looser so I'll let it run through freely
like<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.379> sometimes<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.640> want<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
like that and sometimes I want it

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.930 
like that and sometimes I want it
tighter<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:46.440> pulling<00:00:47.190> my<00:00:47.430> fingers<00:00:47.760> down

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
tighter and this pulling my fingers down

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
tighter and this pulling my fingers down
like<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> pulls<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
like that you can see that pulls it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.900 
like that you can see that pulls it
tight<00:00:50.219> or<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.660> may<00:00:52.110> loosen<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.710> these<00:00:53.250> last<00:00:53.550> two

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
tight or I may loosen up these last two

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.029 
tight or I may loosen up these last two
fingers<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.840> let<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> run<00:00:55.620> through<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
fingers and just let it run through that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.000 
fingers and just let it run through that
one<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.520> am<00:00:57.090> using<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.570> creases<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.140> my<00:00:58.500> fingers

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
one I am using the creases in my fingers

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.139 
one I am using the creases in my fingers
and<00:00:59.750> using<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:02.100> control<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> tension

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and using that to control the tension

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.950 
and using that to control the tension
and<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.320> various<00:01:05.630> tensions<00:01:06.630> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and so I can do various tensions this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.500 
and so I can do various tensions this
way<00:01:07.310> sometimes<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.760> might<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.210> something

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
way sometimes I might want something

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170 
way sometimes I might want something
looser<00:01:10.220> sometimes<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.369> might<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> tighter

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
looser sometimes I might want it tighter

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.200 
looser sometimes I might want it tighter
and<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> sewing<00:01:15.060> machine

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
and so it's just like a sewing machine

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.350 
and so it's just like a sewing machine
and<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:17.070> make<00:01:17.280> your<00:01:17.430> work<00:01:17.580> looser<00:01:18.119> or

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and so you can make your work looser or

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.890 
and so you can make your work looser or
tighter<00:01:19.189> just<00:01:20.189> by<00:01:20.670> using<00:01:20.880> your<00:01:21.060> fingers<00:01:21.659> just

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
tighter just by using your fingers just

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.179 
tighter just by using your fingers just
like<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:24.990> hoping<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.770> will<00:01:25.950> help

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
like that so I'm hoping this will help

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.420 
like that so I'm hoping this will help
some<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.670> who<00:01:27.299> wonder<00:01:27.540> how<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.250> run<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
some of you who wonder how I run the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
some of you who wonder how I run the
yarn<00:01:29.729> through<00:01:29.970> my<00:01:30.210> hand<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
yarn through my hand and this is how I

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
yarn through my hand and this is how I
do<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.420> crocheting<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.380> going

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
do it so if I'm crocheting it's going

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.140 
do it so if I'm crocheting it's going
over<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.100> finger<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.159> then<00:01:38.159> it's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
over this finger like this and then it's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.060 
over this finger like this and then it's
hidden<00:01:39.479> back<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.920> I'm

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
hidden back here and then I'm

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.210 
hidden back here and then I'm
controlling<00:01:41.640> my<00:01:43.430> thread<00:01:44.430> or<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.119> yarn<00:01:45.509> and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
controlling my thread or my yarn and

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.620 
controlling my thread or my yarn and
then<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.369> running<00:01:47.549> through<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.090> fingers

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
then it's running through these fingers

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.800 
then it's running through these fingers
just<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.790> use<00:01:51.000> them<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.390> control

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
just like that and I use them to control

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:02.220 
just like that and I use them to control
the<00:01:52.380> tension<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.979> my<00:01:53.130> work

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.650 

you

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.720 

you
