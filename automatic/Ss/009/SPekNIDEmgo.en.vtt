00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
doing the pulling the other one holding

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
doing the pulling the other one holding
the<00:00:47.910> camera<00:00:48.149> itself<00:00:48.600> basically<00:00:49.469> wanted<00:00:49.860> we

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the camera itself basically wanted we

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.580 
the camera itself basically wanted we
just<00:00:50.100> pop<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.430> out<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.930> slide<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> down

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
just pop it out here you slide it down

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.459 
just pop it out here you slide it down
like<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.120> just<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> give<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.539> an<00:00:55.079> idea<00:00:55.230> what

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
like so just to give you an idea what

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.689 
like so just to give you an idea what
the<00:00:55.500> clips<00:00:55.770> look<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> back<00:00:56.340> side<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the clips look like on the back side you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.189 
the clips look like on the back side you
can<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.059> there's<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.449> bottom<00:00:57.600> clip<00:00:57.989> right

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
can see there's the bottom clip right

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.100 
can see there's the bottom clip right
there<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:59.520> clips<00:00:59.789> into<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.090> portion<00:01:00.840> here

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
there just clips into this portion here

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.349 
there just clips into this portion here
and<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> top<00:01:02.100> side<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.149> see

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and as for the top side here you can see

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.389 
and as for the top side here you can see
they're<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.890> pointing<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> upwards

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
they're kind of pointing on the upwards

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.920 
they're kind of pointing on the upwards
direction<00:01:05.520> here<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.360> why<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.539> can't

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
direction here which is why you can't

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
direction here which is why you can't
pull<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.229> from<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> top<00:01:07.680> side<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.090> slide

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
pull it from the top side and I do slide

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.289 
pull it from the top side and I do slide
into<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> two<00:01:10.080> slots<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:12.000> when

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
into the two slots up here now when

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.560 
into the two slots up here now when
putting<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.380> mirror<00:01:13.650> back<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.240> what<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> want

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
putting the mirror back in what you want

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.550 
putting the mirror back in what you want
to<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.729> could<00:01:17.729> push<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.439> mechanism<00:01:19.439> all

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to do is I could push the mechanism all

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
to do is I could push the mechanism all
the<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.820> from<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> top

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the way down so you can see from the top

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
the way down so you can see from the top
side<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:21.840> how<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> slide<00:01:22.350> these<00:01:22.560> two<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
side here how to slide these two in and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.670 
side here how to slide these two in and
then<00:01:23.880> once<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.450> these<00:01:24.600> two<00:01:24.659> slid<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.200> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
then once you have these two slid in it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
then once you have these two slid in it
just<00:01:25.830> simply<00:01:26.189> snaps<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.060> afraid<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
just simply snaps in don't be afraid to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.120 
just simply snaps in don't be afraid to
put<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.659> pressure<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.140> these<00:01:28.350> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
put a little pressure on these this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.890 
put a little pressure on these this
mirror<00:01:29.759> somewhat<00:01:30.060> durable<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.750> put<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
mirror somewhat durable so you can put a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.539 
mirror somewhat durable so you can put a
little<00:01:31.020> pressure<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.590> it'll<00:01:32.009> snap<00:01:32.310> them

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
little pressure and then it'll snap them

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.730 
little pressure and then it'll snap them
here<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.720> removing<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> plug<00:01:34.380> itself

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
here now it's removing the plug itself

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.190 
here now it's removing the plug itself
simply<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
simply what you do is here is just a
