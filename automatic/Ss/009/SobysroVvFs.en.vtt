00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.259
 today 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.120
 good 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 Y 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.769
 adriÃ¡n ochoa today will teach us to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.690
 prepare a rice with coconut milk and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.420
 let's see the ingredients 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.820
 a cup of glutinous rice and for 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.260
 rice sauce we use half a cup of 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.020
 coconut milk a quarter teaspoon 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.970
 of salt one and a third tablespoons of 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.040
 refined sugar a tommy mango 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.050
 moderately mature and cut in 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.840
 small squares and we reserve a part for 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.090
 leave it in julienne to decorate for the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.830
 Rice topping is a quarter cup 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.650
 of coconut milk an eighth of 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.320
 teaspoon of salt one and a half tablespoon 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.180
 of refined sugar half a teaspoon of 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.890
 cornstarch and a quarter of 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.970
 teaspoon of sesame previously 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.800
 toasted we have in the 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.070
 ingredients half a cup of rice 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.290
 glutinous that is the same rice that 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.659
 we use to make sushi 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:08.110
 and previously soak it we go in water 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.260
 to cover it so that it is already outside 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.890
 out softening what life is between 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.320
 half an hour 30 minutes and this dessert is 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.870
 good to do it not with a lot of time 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.820
 anticipation but at the moment and not 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.460
 recommends bringing the fridge because 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.860
 It gets really hard when we have the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.210
 robot 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.130
 previously soaked then we take them 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.380
 to drain, we pay it a little and the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.360
 then we take a vaporizer if 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.950
 you have vaporizer that is the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.619
 same of vegetables and that can serve them 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.570
 and if we can not use a pot where 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.340
 we have the water 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.280
 then we will take this 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.909
 drainer cited the lid or we put it 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.909
 to warm up 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.860
 and they get covered because this is not going to have 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.110
 never in contact with water always goes 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.330
 to be steamed already when we have it already 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.310
 the cooking that is that they passed the 20 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.619
 minutes and that you already see that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.050
 it's been a rice I paste everything but 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.840
 just as hard we're going to take it to a bowl 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.540
 let's make the milk we're going with 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.970
 to soak the rice then the one that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.190
 It will look like as you hit the middle 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.190
 cup of coconut milk 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.290
 even this we need it that we want 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 is simply to give it a cooking with the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.460
 sugar and salt what we are going to do is 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.840
 then add the rice when it 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.160
 you are ready for her impregnated 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.160
 soak and add 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.060
 refined salt and sugar 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.580
 we dissolve 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.580
 As I tell you, this does not have to boil 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.790
 when this is already dissolved and the rice 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.830
 we already have it previously 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.830
 cooked what I told them right now 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.310
 We take it to a bowl where we can 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.310
 we 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.880
 to download 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.650
 we add this milk that we 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.860
 we just did then this is going to 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.860
 stay 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.800
 It will catch you as all the flavor does not 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.680
 we can cover it with a rag so that this 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.940
 let's say that it continues to conserve steam and 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.040
 keep eating all the juices and we 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.200
 we can help with a cover so that 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.260
 this one is not going to leave us and we're going to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.660
 do the topping which is one more sauce 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.530
 thick 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.290
 we do not get the quarter cup of milk 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.680
 of coconut this we are going to take 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.180
 boil we put the tris of salt that was 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.310
 the one we were talking about right now to highlight 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.310
 taste of refined sugar 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.550
 and we add the spoonful 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.030
 half 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.010
 and let's dissolve we have starch 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.040
 where he's going to make us 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.650
 put more special sauce then 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.940
 we are going to see this not serving and when 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.250
 we grass us let's see 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.920
 previously we are going to dissolve the 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.720
 starch corn or cornstarch like you the 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.870
 know then we have 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.580
 coconut milk boiling and you 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.190
 add the corn starch as they 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.800
 I say previously dissolved to avoid 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.980
 that lumps are formed here already gives us 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.780
 as texture as an external salsite 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.310
 which is the one that we are going to cover in the 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.620
 now we have rice 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.190
 then look, we have the rice here 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.650
 I hit you and take the stew 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.810
 and we are going to help then already to 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.750
 to serve it we are going to help with some 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.910
 spoons but for this recipe too 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.310
 we have then the mango 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.540
 toned that we can then go 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.650
 mixing a little bit with this 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.650
 and go adding 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.120
 we are going to help 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.129
 from another car to be able to put the 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.389
 high 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:26.389
 and decorate 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.040
 so here we have 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:42.569
 the previously roasted sesame seed gives it a 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.569
 good taste watching raw but toasted 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.629
 and as you adriana teaches us to decorate 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.879
 the plate with the ingredients that we're going 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.039
 to use that part in the preparation 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:59.780
