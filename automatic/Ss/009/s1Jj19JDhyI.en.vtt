00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
love on Xbox so I'm not really sure how

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.759 
love on Xbox so I'm not really sure how
it's<00:00:46.030> going<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.210> make<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.420> easier<00:00:46.780> maybe<00:00:47.440> like

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
it's going to make it easier maybe like

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:48.779 
it's going to make it easier maybe like
it<00:00:47.920> will<00:00:48.010> give<00:00:48.129> you<00:00:48.219> a<00:00:48.250> clearer<00:00:48.699> understanding

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
it will give you a clearer understanding

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.829 
it will give you a clearer understanding
so<00:00:49.660> if<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:49.960> buy<00:00:50.140> 800<00:00:51.100> or<00:00:51.190> 1600<00:00:51.609> or<00:00:52.120> 4000

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
so if you buy 800 or 1600 or 4000

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.450 
so if you buy 800 or 1600 or 4000
Microsoft<00:00:53.260> Points<00:00:53.440> or<00:00:53.679> ever<00:00:53.829> you<00:00:53.920> buy<00:00:54.160> and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
Microsoft Points or ever you buy and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.540 
Microsoft Points or ever you buy and
something<00:00:55.210> then<00:00:55.390> cost<00:00:55.600> like<00:00:55.809> 500<00:00:56.170> or<00:00:56.769> 300<00:00:57.100> or

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
something then cost like 500 or 300 or

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.369 
something then cost like 500 or 300 or
whatever<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:57.969> costs<00:00:58.300> maybe<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.170> just<00:00:59.199> means

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
whatever it costs maybe it just means

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.840 
whatever it costs maybe it just means
it'll<00:00:59.739> be<00:00:59.829> clearer<00:01:00.249> so<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:00.550> know<00:01:00.670> exactly

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
it'll be clearer so you know exactly

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.250 
it'll be clearer so you know exactly
what<00:01:01.300> you're<00:01:01.420> spending<00:01:01.629> on<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:02.079> purchase

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
what you're spending on that purchase

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.840 
what you're spending on that purchase
but<00:01:02.920> I'm<00:01:02.980> not<00:01:03.129> sure<00:01:03.309> how<00:01:03.429> it<00:01:03.489> will<00:01:03.550> make<00:01:03.730> it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
but I'm not sure how it will make it

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.040 
but I'm not sure how it will make it
easier<00:01:04.239> we'll<00:01:04.420> have<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.659> wait<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:04.870> see<00:01:04.960> if

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
easier we'll have to wait and see if

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.570 
easier we'll have to wait and see if
there's<00:01:05.350> anything<00:01:05.560> else<00:01:05.740> they<00:01:05.920> do<00:01:05.980> with<00:01:06.340> that

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
will automatically change that to money

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.249 
will automatically change that to money
that<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.670> equal<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.420> value<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.780> those<00:01:55.960> or

that is equal to the value of those or

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.109 
that is equal to the value of those or
maybe<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.590> little<00:01:56.829> bit<00:01:56.920> extra<00:01:57.189> so<00:01:57.759> I<00:01:57.789> don't<00:01:58.000> know

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
maybe a little bit extra so I don't know

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.910

if<00:01:58.299> like<00:01:58.479> if<00:01:58.750> you've<00:01:58.990> got<00:01:59.289> like<00:01:59.439> a<00:01:59.469> random

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
if like if you've got like a random

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.139

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
just like a solid number like a solid

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.719 
just like a solid number like a solid
figure<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.350> don't<00:02:05.469> really<00:02:05.799> know<00:02:05.920> how<00:02:06.490> they

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
figure I don't really know how they

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.800 
figure I don't really know how they
gonna<00:02:06.880> round<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.210> up<00:02:07.299> or<00:02:07.509> if<00:02:07.630> they're<00:02:07.780> just

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
gonna round it up or if they're just

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.240 
gonna round it up or if they're just
gonna<00:02:07.990> give<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.259> like<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> exact<00:02:08.860> thing<00:02:09.130> as

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
gonna give you like the exact thing as

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.790 
gonna give you like the exact thing as
close<00:02:09.520> as<00:02:09.700> they<00:02:09.850> can<00:02:10.350> Microsoft<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.470> tend<00:02:11.710> to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
close as they can Microsoft to tend to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.170 
close as they can Microsoft to tend to
be<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> bit<00:02:12.070> stingy<00:02:12.280> sometimes<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.030> they're

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
be a bit stingy sometimes so they're

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.120 
be a bit stingy sometimes so they're
probably<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.720> try<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.200> give<00:02:15.040> you
