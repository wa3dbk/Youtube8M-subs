activated<00:00:12.080> so<00:00:13.080> i<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> RGB<00:00:14.309> star<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.059> this

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
activated so i have a RGB star in this

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.730 
activated so i have a RGB star in this
garage<00:00:16.529> silhouette<00:00:17.270> is<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.810> first<00:00:19.050> team<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
garage silhouette is the first team and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.509 
garage silhouette is the first team and
then<00:00:19.920> third<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.970> my<00:00:21.720> horn<00:00:21.990> blaster<00:00:22.650> don't

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
then third is my horn blaster don't

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.189 
then third is my horn blaster don't
necessarily<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.240> use<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.689> an<00:00:24.840> angel

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
necessarily have to use it with an angel

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.970 
necessarily have to use it with an angel
but<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:26.189> goes<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.730> good<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.000> music<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
but that goes really good with music a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
but that goes really good with music a
fourth<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.250> fifth<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:31.640> my<00:00:32.640> carousel<00:00:33.390> horses

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
fourth and fifth is my carousel horses

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.209 
fourth and fifth is my carousel horses
let's<00:00:34.829> use<00:00:35.070> some<00:00:35.570> three<00:00:36.570> RGB<00:00:37.200> channels<00:00:37.649> each

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
let's use some three RGB channels each

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.830 
let's use some three RGB channels each
and<00:00:38.730> then<00:00:39.629> my<00:00:41.629> RGB<00:00:43.280> arches<00:00:44.280> themselves<00:00:44.850> so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and then my RGB arches themselves so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.209 
and then my RGB arches themselves so
here's<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.670> little<00:00:47.670> sample<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> my<00:00:48.649> star<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:50.160> my

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
here's a little sample of my star in my

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.889 
here's a little sample of my star in my
silhouette<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:53.010> star<00:00:53.309> itself<00:00:53.430> only<00:00:53.910> uses<00:00:54.390> for

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
silhouette the star itself only uses for

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
silhouette the star itself only uses for
RGB<00:00:55.350> channel<00:00:56.120> on<00:00:57.289> the<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.649> fireworks<00:01:02.129> below

RGB channel on the the fireworks below

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.329 
RGB channel on the the fireworks below
uses<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> 27<00:01:03.750> channel<00:01:04.110> board<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:04.589> i<00:01:04.920> use<00:01:05.129> all

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
uses a 27 channel board which i use all

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.640 
uses a 27 channel board which i use all
nine<00:01:05.610> channels<00:01:06.200> on<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.560> board<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:09.500> make<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
nine channels on that board to make it

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
nine channels on that board to make it
look<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.270> shooting<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.390> into<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.780> sky

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
look like it's shooting up into the sky

look like it's shooting up into the sky
and<00:01:14.000> in<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.240> silhouette<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.860> RGB

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and in my silhouette I have to RGB

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.210 
and in my silhouette I have to RGB

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
it's RGB as well as there's three

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.640 
it's RGB as well as there's three
channels<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.920> yeah<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.450> didn't<00:01:33.720> use

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
channels the yeah I really didn't use

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.790 
channels the yeah I really didn't use
all<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> colors<00:01:35.430> i<00:01:35.580> could<00:01:35.760> use<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.480> a<00:01:36.800> horn

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
all the colors i could use with a horn

so here's my carousel horses and I have
three<00:01:59.640> RGB<00:02:00.090> channels<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.720> each<00:02:00.870> horse<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.740> for

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
three RGB channels on each horse one for

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
three RGB channels on each horse one for
the<00:02:03.080> outline<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.290> horse<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
pole and then all my RGB arches did a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.870 
pole and then all my RGB arches did a
little<00:02:16.740> bit<00:02:16.860> different<00:02:17.310> i'm<00:02:17.520> not<00:02:17.670> using

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
little bit different i'm not using

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.410 
little bit different i'm not using
plastic<00:02:18.450> light<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.990> found<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.190> lawn<00:02:21.150> edging

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
plastic light I found this lawn edging

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.580 
plastic light I found this lawn edging
down<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:22.050> lowes<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:23.400> has<00:02:23.730> some<00:02:24.180> holes<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
down at lowes that has some holes in the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.360 
down at lowes that has some holes in the
in<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.860> edging<00:02:26.520> where<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.060> RGB<00:02:27.990> nodes<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.680> go

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
in the edging where the RGB nodes can go

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.090 
in the edging where the RGB nodes can go
right<00:02:29.610> into<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:31.110> hole<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.709> makes<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
right into the the hole so it makes a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.020 
right into the the hole so it makes a
perfect<00:02:32.900> perfect<00:02:33.900> arch<00:02:34.370> size<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> arches
