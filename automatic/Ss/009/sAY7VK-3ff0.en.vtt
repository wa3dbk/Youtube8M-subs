mean Holland has benefited a lot I mean
not<00:02:09.360> even<00:02:09.509> was<00:02:09.720> always<00:02:10.050> known<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.770> best<00:02:11.009> of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
not even was always known as the best of

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.630 
not even was always known as the best of
the<00:02:11.190> West

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the West

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the West
it's<00:02:12.030> also<00:02:12.360> counts<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:12.960> something<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:14.660> since

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
it's also counts for something and since

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.160 
it's also counts for something and since
then<00:02:15.840> okay<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.260> had<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.410> good<00:02:17.340> chess<00:02:18.270> culture

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
then okay we had a good chess culture

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.840 
then okay we had a good chess culture
and<00:02:19.290> history<00:02:19.620> like<00:02:19.920> we<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> two<00:02:20.730> most

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
and history like we have the two most

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.760 
and history like we have the two most
especially<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.420> wagons<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.990> which<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.590> always

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
especially of wagons a which is always

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.230 
especially of wagons a which is always
like<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.150> biggest<00:02:24.510> chess<00:02:25.320> first<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.650> all

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
like the the biggest chess first of all

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.660 
like the the biggest chess first of all
so<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> think<00:02:27.720> that's<00:02:27.990> very<00:02:28.200> important<00:02:28.830> for<00:02:28.860> for

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
so I think that's very important for for

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.040 
so I think that's very important for for
Dutch<00:02:29.850> chastened<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:31.670> maybe<00:02:32.670> now<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.840> each

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
Dutch chastened and maybe now on each

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.930 
Dutch chastened and maybe now on each
gear<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.520> can<00:02:35.520> step<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.850> up

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
gear we can can step it up

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.090 
gear we can can step it up
do<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.600> have<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> favorite<00:02:39.260> game<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.920> you've

of<00:06:58.100> interesting<00:06:58.669> ideas<00:06:58.850> and<00:06:59.389> I<00:07:00.050> think<00:07:00.320> we

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
of interesting ideas and I think we

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.790 
of interesting ideas and I think we
should<00:07:00.560> give<00:07:01.100> him<00:07:01.250> a<00:07:01.340> chance<00:07:01.610> and<00:07:02.320> it's<00:07:03.320> it<00:07:03.530> I

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
should give him a chance and it's it I

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.550 
should give him a chance and it's it I
think<00:07:04.070> it<00:07:04.160> would<00:07:04.280> benefit<00:07:04.669> chess<00:07:05.479> a<00:07:05.780> lot<00:07:06.380> but

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
think it would benefit chess a lot but

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.100 
think it would benefit chess a lot but
most<00:07:07.250> people<00:07:07.550> are<00:07:07.669> afraid<00:07:07.759> with<00:07:08.150> a<00:07:08.180> for<00:07:08.750> change

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
most people are afraid with a for change
