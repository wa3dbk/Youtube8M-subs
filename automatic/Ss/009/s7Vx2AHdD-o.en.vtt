going to want it to because you can take
more<00:00:58.710> damage<00:00:58.910> you'll<00:00:59.910> hopefully<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.300> taking

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
more damage you'll hopefully be taking

this<00:01:00.750> damage<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.289> well<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> won't<00:01:03.870> have

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this damage as well but you won't have

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.940 
this damage as well but you won't have
that<00:01:04.019> damage<00:01:04.530> bonus<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.040> help<00:01:05.250> kill<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> faster

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
that damage bonus to help kill it faster

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
that damage bonus to help kill it faster
and<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.130> basically<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.000> two<00:01:09.270> differences

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and that's basically the two differences

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.320 
and that's basically the two differences
between<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.290> armors<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:11.189> both<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.580> degrade

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
between the armors they both to degrade

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
between the armors they both to degrade
if<00:01:12.659> you've<00:01:12.780> got<00:01:12.930> 99<00:01:13.140> sniffing<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.070> cheaper

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
if you've got 99 sniffing it's cheaper

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
if you've got 99 sniffing it's cheaper
to<00:01:14.460> fix<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.970> they're<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.780> overly<00:01:16.170> expensive

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to fix them they're not overly expensive

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.289 
to fix them they're not overly expensive
to<00:01:16.770> fix<00:01:18.290> 12<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> lot<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.100> prefer<00:01:20.400> taller<00:01:20.909> just

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
to fix 12 is a lot I prefer taller just

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
to fix 12 is a lot I prefer taller just
because<00:01:21.600> how<00:01:21.810> easy<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> come<00:01:22.710> by<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
because how easy it is to come by you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
because how easy it is to come by you
can<00:01:23.549> buy<00:01:23.700> talk<00:01:23.970> when<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> grand<00:01:24.479> exchange<00:01:24.720> for

any of it you can get it back straight
away<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.430> money<00:01:29.640> where's<00:01:30.210> Tetsu<00:01:30.659> took<00:01:30.900> me

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
away with money where's Tetsu took me

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
away with money where's Tetsu took me
over<00:01:31.140> six<00:01:31.500> months<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> plate<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
over six months to get all the plate and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.190 
over six months to get all the plate and
you<00:01:33.210> need<00:01:33.390> 90<00:01:33.720> smithing

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
you need 90 smithing

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.039 
you need 90 smithing
so<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.430> was<00:01:36.579> a<00:01:36.610> lot<00:01:36.789> of<00:01:36.850> workers<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.509> tattoo

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
so it was a lot of workers to get tattoo

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.469 
so it was a lot of workers to get tattoo
but<00:01:38.890> at<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.310> same<00:01:39.610> time<00:01:39.670> if<00:01:40.060> you're<00:01:40.210> doing

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
but at that same time if you're doing

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.850 
but at that same time if you're doing
the<00:01:40.570> high<00:01:40.750> level<00:01:40.960> bossing<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.680> are

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860

tanking<00:01:42.549> all<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> time<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:44.079> you<00:01:44.890> know

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
tanking all the time then you know
