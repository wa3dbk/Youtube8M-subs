00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.090
 the weight of the structure being cooked 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.650
 today but looking forward 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.869
 meanwhile I can not say how much I 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.869
 I hope it is a long time ahead. 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.110
 that one always worked in the house 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.360
 so I was going to get through there 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:45.519
 Atelier is and since that time, he is a 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.269
 cohabitation with fires 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.940
 chemistry 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:53.019
 I started making a call and 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.339
 realize that intuition does not bring 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.409
 important 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.809
 She works very hard with the intention if I 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.820
 I believe in the project 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:06.100
 I have to figure out uses the arguments 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.940
 to convince other people why 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.940
 they are guard 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 8 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:34.179
 the magazine is doing a poll with 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.789
 20 people on what each one the plate 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.770
 more children are paulo by each one speaks 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.079
 one thing when it came my turn to 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.520
 three centers and morumbi ee heliopolis 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.390
 I was seen as he thought more 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.090
 puppies did not say it was the difference 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.500
 guiding the community is much better than 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.929
 I do not like it 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.399
 we could talk to him to see if 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:03.780
 he could could is give us a hand 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:13.930
 to make my children better 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:18.819
 I do not work together anymore. 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.739
 you are a double responsibility is not 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.799
 help is responsibility 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.019
 if you touch I will roll 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.060
 Let's start thinking, this is it. 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.880
 even if we want 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.370
 We do not want anything down the drain, right? 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.769
 we like to discuss discuss all this 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.260
 It's okay, here we go. 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.109
 to discuss 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.870
 I usually talk bad skin you draw 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:47.650
 its lines reflect a lot of what people 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.720
 either by our people because it is a thing 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.250
 We think we have to do it. 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.739
 for the person 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.739
 else you bring her along 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.890
 first was the color heliopolis that has 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.620
 an incredible community participation 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.810
 This in me personally was a 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.280
 wonderful thing 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.790
 each inhabitant curve discrimination and 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.280
 the pole seed started that street 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.220
 happened that she was cleared of the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.040
 two lots and kissed only this one 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.310
 schools all safe 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.030
 then the cars park just by the side 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.940
 out 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.480
 here is one of the following 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.480
 teachers 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.910
 a lot is a very special thing he does not 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.210
 does nothing that comes only from baby's head 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.390
 he sits he makes the proposal 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:50.070
 he listens to the people he was discussing then 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.070
 much the importance of his touch 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.760
 Then I started doing the first 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.200
 and the question arose to me to do the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.959
 stronghold 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.079
 I already started talking to my personal friend. 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.430
 can talk like this but read the world 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.480
 inside coffers right? 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.069
 is redundant in the chic neighborhoods there 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.569
 you do not have chic neighborhood in 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.030
 aesthetic that can be in 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.150
 anywhere and 10 anywhere 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.400
 you can not touch the rounds 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.550
 who know space when opening space 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.039
 the first time with family and 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.759
 community to have this gross insight 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:36.030
 and a very big light that was one thing 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:39.090
 Brazilian right very strong colors I 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.770
 I call thus only thing commitment or 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.169
 that clear blue river color that does not 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.220
 had no commitment or very cream 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.039
 of course not 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.340
 They are strong colors and studious of my 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.340
 future 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:10.520
 besides happiness I think this 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.520
 It helped him ok, he already has identity. 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.389
 My dream is to do a project tomorrow. 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.669
 It is designing tomorrow and next project 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.630
 fight for a city that is more 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.710
 egalitarian 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.600
 that is why this pole and the reduced 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.530
 examples of which architecture and 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.200
 urbanism 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.050
 are seeds of a city more 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.180
 egalitarian rounds could be 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.090
 perfectly built in the new village 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.800
 Conception in the village madalena 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.800
 but it's 15 o'clock 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.110
 O
