personalities<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.989> point<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.590> felt<00:00:35.250> like

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
personalities at that point I felt like

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.220 
personalities at that point I felt like
I<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.640> gonna<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> linebacker<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.750> dad<00:00:36.989> would

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I was gonna be a linebacker so dad would

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
I was gonna be a linebacker so dad would
come<00:00:37.379> out<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.890> dev<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.430> say<00:00:38.550> hey<00:00:38.699> if

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
come out there and dev just say hey if

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.400 
come out there and dev just say hey if
you're<00:00:39.420> gonna<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.660> ready<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.989> play<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.170> just

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410

go<00:00:40.500> run<00:00:40.680> into<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.040> tree<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.580> that

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
go run into that tree over there that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.830

would get you ready to play I like to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.479 
would get you ready to play I like to
challenge<00:00:46.199> my<00:00:46.320> mind<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.769> couple<00:00:46.949> years<00:00:47.280> ago<00:00:47.400> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
challenge my mind a couple years ago I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.119 
challenge my mind a couple years ago I
started<00:00:47.910> reading<00:00:48.059> Einstein<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.930> dummies<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
started reading Einstein for dummies and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.710 
started reading Einstein for dummies and
just<00:00:50.580> because<00:00:50.879> I've<00:00:51.000> always<00:00:51.300> been<00:00:51.420> fascinated

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
just because I've always been fascinated

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.310 
just because I've always been fascinated
by<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:53.370> cosmos<00:00:53.879> looking<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.809> at<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:54.989> stars

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
by the cosmos looking up at the stars

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
by the cosmos looking up at the stars
and<00:00:55.650> so<00:00:56.519> Einstein<00:00:56.909> kind<00:00:57.479> of<00:00:57.570> decoded<00:00:58.080> all<00:00:58.199> that

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and so Einstein kind of decoded all that

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.810 
and so Einstein kind of decoded all that
with<00:00:58.589> gravity<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.100> his<00:00:59.370> theory<00:00:59.699> of

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
with gravity and his theory of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.090 
with gravity and his theory of
relativity<00:01:00.299> and<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.839> and<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:02.010> know

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
relativity and all that and so you know

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
relativity and all that and so you know
you're<00:01:02.250> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.489> hearing<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.909> accent<00:01:03.750> going

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you're kind of hearing my accent going

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.700 
you're kind of hearing my accent going
there's<00:01:04.170> no<00:01:04.379> way<00:01:04.530> you've<00:01:04.710> read<00:01:04.890> Einstein<00:01:05.519> but

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
there's no way you've read Einstein but

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.250 
there's no way you've read Einstein but
you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.180> study<00:01:09.479> things<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.020> love

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
you know I like to study things I love

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:27.340 
you know I like to study things I love
to<00:01:10.409> learn

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.100

work<00:01:53.340> my<00:01:53.490> way<00:01:53.670> back<00:01:53.909> into<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.390> position<00:01:54.630> where<00:01:54.960> I

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
work my way back into a position where I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.810 
work my way back into a position where I
can<00:01:55.200> play

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.910 

at<00:01:59.300> that<00:01:59.540> moment<00:01:59.720> we<00:02:00.050> had<00:02:00.080> had<00:02:00.320> our<00:02:00.500> second

child Elijah Elijah has a fall as most
babies<00:02:04.850> do<00:02:05.060> but<00:02:05.300> he<00:02:05.930> he<00:02:06.470> gets<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.100> bump<00:02:07.370> on<00:02:07.490> his

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
babies do but he he gets a bump on his

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.999 
babies do but he he gets a bump on his
head<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.000> doesn't<00:02:08.360> go<00:02:08.479> away<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.679> stays

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
head that doesn't go away and it stays

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.850 
head that doesn't go away and it stays
there<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.940> actually<00:02:11.330> grows<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:12.590> first

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
there and it actually grows the first

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.430 
there and it actually grows the first
doctor<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.310> we<00:02:13.400> go<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> says<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.270> tumor

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
doctor that we go to says it's a tumor

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.570 
doctor that we go to says it's a tumor
and<00:02:15.530> what<00:02:16.010> took<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.490> long<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.790> get<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:16.970> us

it's for my soul what in the world did

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.390 
it's for my soul what in the world did
he<00:02:22.950> do<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.810> deserve<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.170> or<00:02:25.530> what<00:02:25.710> did<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.070> -

go so to be able to come in and play

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.960

that<00:04:11.520> freely<00:04:12.060> after<00:04:12.660> after<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.440> kind<00:04:13.710> of<00:04:13.800> a

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
that freely after after that kind of a

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.490 
that freely after after that kind of a
year<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.000> think<00:04:15.330> that's<00:04:15.540> why<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.810> was<00:04:16.140> able<00:04:16.260> to

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
year I think that's why I was able to

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.699 
year I think that's why I was able to
play<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:16.950> freely<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:18.120> because<00:04:18.600> when<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.560> go

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
play so freely is because when you go

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.990 
play so freely is because when you go
through<00:04:19.739> something<00:04:20.280> like<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:20.700> puts<00:04:20.910> it

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
through something like that it puts it
