00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.040 
big shot and we lost Scarlets
puck-moving<00:03:13.340> ability<00:03:14.000> but<00:03:14.180> we<00:03:14.240> added<00:03:14.630> honka

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
puck-moving ability but we added honka

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.830 
puck-moving ability but we added honka
so<00:03:15.709> I'd<00:03:16.670> say<00:03:16.880> we<00:03:17.090> are<00:03:17.180> still<00:03:17.420> doing<00:03:17.540> pretty

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
so I'd say we are still doing pretty

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.840 
so I'd say we are still doing pretty
good<00:03:18.020> for<00:03:18.080> ourselves<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.830> having<00:03:19.340> gram<00:03:19.550> black

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
good for ourselves and having gram black

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.030 
good for ourselves and having gram black
back<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:21.020> help<00:03:21.170> us<00:03:21.320> on<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.560> first<00:03:21.740> power-play

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
back to help us on the first power-play

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.810 
back to help us on the first power-play
unit<00:03:22.300> doesn't<00:03:23.300> hurt<00:03:23.780> us<00:03:23.930> either<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.860> think

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820
