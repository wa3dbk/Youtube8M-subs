creep<00:00:19.500> up<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> bottom

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.510 

I<00:00:29.020> only<00:00:30.020> put<00:00:30.850> 1/2<00:00:31.850> cup<00:00:31.910> instead<00:00:32.450> of<00:00:32.660> 3/4<00:00:33.200> cup

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
I only put 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.960 
I only put 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup
like<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.670> recipe<00:00:35.060> called<00:00:35.270> for<00:00:35.570> because<00:00:39.970> plus

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
like the recipe called for because plus

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.490 
like the recipe called for because plus
I'm<00:00:41.120> thinking<00:00:41.450> once<00:00:41.630> I<00:00:41.750> add<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.080> blueberries

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
I'm thinking once I add the blueberries

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.340 
I'm thinking once I add the blueberries
in<00:00:47.530> that'll<00:00:48.530> add<00:00:48.830> a<00:00:48.860> lot<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.720> liquid<00:00:50.720> to<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.989> as

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
in that'll add a lot of liquid to it as

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.840 
in that'll add a lot of liquid to it as
it<00:00:51.530> cooks<00:00:51.739> down<00:00:51.860> I<00:00:54.340> think<00:00:55.340> that's<00:00:55.489> about<00:00:55.580> good

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
it cooks down I think that's about good

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.670 
it cooks down I think that's about good
I<00:00:56.090> think<00:00:56.360> that<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:56.780> good<00:00:59.500> blueberries<00:01:00.500> in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
I think that is good blueberries in

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.580 
I think that is good blueberries in
probably<00:01:03.680> put<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.159> heat<00:01:04.430> up<00:01:05.320> get<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.350> ugly

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
probably put the heat up get that ugly

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.160 
probably put the heat up get that ugly
one<00:01:06.890> over<00:01:07.070> there<00:01:07.190> which<00:01:07.520> one<00:01:07.760> oh<00:01:08.000> it's<00:01:08.870> just

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
one over there which one oh it's just

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.930 
one over there which one oh it's just
have<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.409> skin<00:01:09.740> split<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.370> was<00:01:10.520> fine<00:01:10.700> before

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
have the skin split it was fine before

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:22.390 
have the skin split it was fine before
yeah<00:01:11.930> sure<00:01:12.260> yeah<00:01:12.770> I'll<00:01:13.520> take<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.729> up

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.760 

I<00:01:28.870> imagine<00:01:29.870> this<00:01:29.960> will<00:01:30.080> have<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.350> cook<00:01:30.530> down

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
I imagine this will have to cook down

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.200 
I imagine this will have to cook down
substantially<00:01:32.830> so<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:33.890> think<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.160> needs<00:01:34.340> sure

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
substantially so you think it needs sure

00:01:35.210 --> 00:02:02.719 
substantially so you think it needs sure
sure<00:01:41.980> bit<00:01:42.980> of<00:01:43.010> sugar

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
