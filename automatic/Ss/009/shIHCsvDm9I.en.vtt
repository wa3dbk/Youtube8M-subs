00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

so<00:00:00.780> out<00:00:00.930> of<00:00:00.960> curiosity<00:00:01.199> we<00:00:01.740> decided<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.159> run<00:00:02.250> an

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
so out of curiosity we decided to run an

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.670 
so out of curiosity we decided to run an
experiment<00:00:02.840> we<00:00:03.840> were<00:00:03.959> curious<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.410> see

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
experiment we were curious to see

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.619 
experiment we were curious to see
whether<00:00:04.950> it<00:00:05.279> mattered<00:00:05.700> how<00:00:05.970> many<00:00:06.000> starting

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
whether it mattered how many starting

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.900 
whether it mattered how many starting
tunnels<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:06.960> dug<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.589> ants<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.760> did

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
tunnels you dug for the ants so we did

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.970 
tunnels you dug for the ants so we did
was<00:00:09.090> got<00:00:09.269> two<00:00:09.510> identical<00:00:09.690> setups<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.500> we

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
was got two identical setups and we

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.280 
was got two identical setups and we
started<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.460> one<00:00:12.179> star<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.630> tunnel<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.080> one

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
started with one star to tunnel in one

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.860 
started with one star to tunnel in one
and<00:00:13.500> four<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> other<00:00:14.549> these<00:00:15.330> are<00:00:15.630> our

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
and four in the other these are our

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.470 
and four in the other these are our
results<00:00:16.340> hi<00:00:17.340> I'm<00:00:17.609> Michael<00:00:17.789> without<00:00:18.270> an<00:00:18.390> ant

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
results hi I'm Michael without an ant

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:30.050 
results hi I'm Michael without an ant
farm<00:00:18.539> let's<00:00:19.500> talk<00:00:19.680> about<00:00:19.800> ants

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 

so<00:00:30.630> here's<00:00:30.810> our<00:00:30.960> first<00:00:31.109> group<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.680> if<00:00:32.279> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
so here's our first group and if you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.110 
so here's our first group and if you
notice<00:00:32.550> um<00:00:33.050> these<00:00:34.050> ones<00:00:34.379> have<00:00:34.590> dug<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.879> new

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
notice um these ones have dug this new

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.530 
notice um these ones have dug this new
tunnel<00:00:36.450> here<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.430> this<00:00:38.430> tunnel<00:00:38.879> here<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
tunnel here and this tunnel here and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
tunnel here and this tunnel here and
along<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.470> bottoms<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:40.920> kind<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.160> expanded

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
along the bottoms they kind of expanded

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.010 
along the bottoms they kind of expanded
them<00:00:41.790> out<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> little<00:00:42.090> bit<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.690> didn't<00:00:42.930> do

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
them out a little bit but they didn't do

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.160 
them out a little bit but they didn't do
too<00:00:43.170> much<00:00:43.199> besides<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:44.720> also<00:00:45.720> it's<00:00:45.930> worth

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
too much besides that also it's worth

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.170 
too much besides that also it's worth
noting<00:00:46.470> that<00:00:46.710> these<00:00:47.129> ads<00:00:47.400> when<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.820> added<00:00:47.970> them

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
noting that these ads when we added them

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.210 
noting that these ads when we added them
to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.330> farm<00:00:48.690> were<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.530> eager<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.100> get

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
to the farm were not eager to get

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.579 
to the farm were not eager to get
started<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.730> away<00:00:50.790> they<00:00:51.330> kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.750> were<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
started right away they kind of were a

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.799 
started right away they kind of were a
little<00:00:52.710> bit<00:00:52.860> docile<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:53.760> treated<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> holes

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
little bit docile and treated the holes

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
little bit docile and treated the holes
that<00:00:55.019> we<00:00:55.110> had<00:00:55.230> dug<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.400> was<00:00:56.519> all<00:00:56.640> they

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that we had dug like it was all they

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.030 
that we had dug like it was all they
needed<00:00:56.790> if<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.659> notice<00:00:58.019> for<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.739> most<00:00:58.890> part

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
needed if you notice for the most part

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.640 
needed if you notice for the most part
all<00:00:59.519> they<00:00:59.879> did<00:01:00.120> was<00:01:00.150> come<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> already

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
all they did was come down the already

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.729 
all they did was come down the already
made<00:01:02.010> tunnels<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.869> dig<00:01:03.869> either<00:01:04.110> straight<00:01:04.530> up

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
made tunnels and dig either straight up

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980 
made tunnels and dig either straight up
or<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.940> off<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.360> side<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.659> little<00:01:06.869> bit

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
or just off to the side a little bit

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.170 
or just off to the side a little bit
it's<00:01:07.860> kind<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.760> thought<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.150> had

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
it's kind of like they thought they had

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.630 
it's kind of like they thought they had
enough<00:01:09.570> room<00:01:09.750> already<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> they're<00:01:10.439> just

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
enough room already and they're just

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.010 
enough room already and they're just
kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> expanding<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> give<00:01:12.600> himself<00:01:12.750> more

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
kind of expanding to give himself more

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.230 
kind of expanding to give himself more
area<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> sleep<00:01:13.950> something<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.790> noted<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
area to sleep something we noted that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090 
area to sleep something we noted that
may<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.659> cause<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> them<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.619> digging<00:01:16.979> as

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
may be the cause of them not digging as

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.980 
may be the cause of them not digging as
much<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:18.150> because<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.570> were<00:01:18.689> four

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
much is that because there were four

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.560 
much is that because there were four
well-made<00:01:19.740> tunnels<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.310> begin<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.760> they<00:01:21.330> may

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
well-made tunnels to begin with they may

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
well-made tunnels to begin with they may
have<00:01:21.780> registered<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.770> being<00:01:22.979> enough

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
have registered that as being enough

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.670 
have registered that as being enough
space<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.450> begin<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> cause

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
space for them to begin with and cause

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440 
space for them to begin with and cause
them<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.100> less<00:01:26.280> eager<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.820> expand<00:01:27.360> their

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
them to be less eager to expand their

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
them to be less eager to expand their
area<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> you've<00:01:28.530> noticed<00:01:28.799> all<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> matter

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
area and you've noticed all the matter

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.100 
area and you've noticed all the matter
on<00:01:29.460> top<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.000> they've<00:01:30.119> displaced<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.930> may

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
on top that they've displaced that may

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.810 
on top that they've displaced that may
have<00:01:31.290> something<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> other<00:01:32.100> one

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.090 

you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.969> see<00:01:35.999> here<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.950> only

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you can see here with this one we only

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.480 
you can see here with this one we only
dug<00:01:38.429> one<00:01:38.789> starting<00:01:39.210> time<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> begin<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
dug one starting time to begin with and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.529 
dug one starting time to begin with and
as<00:01:41.490> soon<00:01:41.609> as<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.820> put<00:01:41.969> the<00:01:42.060> answer<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.479> they

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
as soon as we put the answer and they

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.840 
as soon as we put the answer and they
basically<00:01:42.869> got<00:01:43.109> to<00:01:43.289> work<00:01:43.499> and<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:44.310> went

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
basically got to work and they went

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.849 
basically got to work and they went
ahead<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.299> created<00:01:45.719> this<00:01:45.869> tunnel<00:01:46.289> here

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
ahead and they created this tunnel here

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.700 
ahead and they created this tunnel here
all<00:01:47.819> along<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> side<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:49.289> ones<00:01:49.469> at<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
all along the side these ones at the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.440 
all along the side these ones at the
sides<00:01:49.979> something<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.969> we<00:01:51.090> thought<00:01:51.299> was

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
sides something that we thought was

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.599 
sides something that we thought was
really<00:01:51.719> neat<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.069> patterns<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
really neat is that the patterns that

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:54.859 
really neat is that the patterns that
they're<00:01:53.850> doing<00:01:53.999> here<00:01:54.329> are<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.569> lot<00:01:54.810> more

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
they're doing here are a lot more

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.020 
they're doing here are a lot more
intricate<00:01:55.499> than<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.740> previous<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
intricate than the previous one this

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.700 
intricate than the previous one this
could<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.109> with<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.409> fact<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
could be to do with the fact that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.109 
could be to do with the fact that
there's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.159> more<00:01:59.189> open<00:01:59.340> space<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.999> them

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
there's a lot more open space for them

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.809 
there's a lot more open space for them
to<00:02:00.329> build<00:02:01.139> in<00:02:01.409> their<00:02:01.530> own<00:02:01.679> patterns<00:02:02.189> whereas

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
to build in their own patterns whereas

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:03.770 
to build in their own patterns whereas
the<00:02:02.939> other<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.359> had<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> limited

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the other one they had a limited

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.330 
the other one they had a limited
structure<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.679> was<00:02:04.710> built<00:02:05.009> into<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
structure and it was built into a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.279 
structure and it was built into a
certain<00:02:05.549> block<00:02:05.909> what's<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> thing<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.229> we

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
certain block what's the thing that we

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.620 
certain block what's the thing that we
should<00:02:07.439> note<00:02:07.590> about<00:02:07.770> these<00:02:08.009> ants<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:09.479> we

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
should note about these ants is when we

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.600 
should note about these ants is when we
put<00:02:09.840> these<00:02:10.080> ones<00:02:10.319> into<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> colony<00:02:11.069> they

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
put these ones into the colony they

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.699 
put these ones into the colony they
immediately<00:02:12.510> got<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.020> work<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.500> started

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
immediately got to work and started

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.910 
immediately got to work and started
digging<00:02:13.890> unlike<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.850> other<00:02:15.209> ones<00:02:15.709> we<00:02:16.709> think

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
digging unlike the other ones we think

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
digging unlike the other ones we think
this<00:02:17.040> could<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.310> something<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.730> with<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
this could have something to do with the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.970 
this could have something to do with the
fact<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.209> there<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.750> lot<00:02:19.290> more<00:02:19.319> room<00:02:19.740> for

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
fact that there is a lot more room for

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
fact that there is a lot more room for
them<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.220> expand<00:02:20.580> into<00:02:20.910> giving<00:02:21.540> them<00:02:21.569> more

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
them to expand into giving them more

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.140 
them to expand into giving them more
leeway<00:02:22.020> for<00:02:22.170> intricate<00:02:22.740> designs<00:02:23.160> as<00:02:23.430> well<00:02:23.819> as

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
leeway for intricate designs as well as

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.490 
leeway for intricate designs as well as
the<00:02:24.270> fact<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.540> they<00:02:24.720> had<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> little<00:02:25.200> limited

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the fact that they had a little limited

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.080 
the fact that they had a little limited
amount<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.920> space<00:02:25.980> underground<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.850> begin

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
amount of space underground to begin

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.540 
amount of space underground to begin
with<00:02:27.319> making<00:02:28.319> them<00:02:28.470> more<00:02:28.590> eager<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.100> expand

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
with making them more eager to expand

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.380 
with making them more eager to expand
their<00:02:29.730> tunnels<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.700> results<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.270> our

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
their tunnels so the results of our

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.510 
their tunnels so the results of our
experiments<00:02:33.930> are<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:35.069> one<00:02:35.190> at<00:02:35.310> four

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
experiments are this the one at four

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.940 
experiments are this the one at four
tunnels<00:02:35.760> while<00:02:36.120> more<00:02:36.390> structured<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.680> ants

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
tunnels while more structured the ants

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.789 
tunnels while more structured the ants
were<00:02:37.980> less<00:02:38.220> eager<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.640> start<00:02:38.790> digging<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.799> it

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
were less eager to start digging and it

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.800 
were less eager to start digging and it
gives<00:02:41.129> them<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.549> lot<00:02:41.790> less<00:02:41.970> room<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.299> expand

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
gives them a lot less room to expand

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.460 
gives them a lot less room to expand
into

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
into

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
into
their<00:02:43.650> tunnels<00:02:43.920> become<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> lot<00:02:44.340> less

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
their tunnels become a lot less

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.360 
their tunnels become a lot less
intricate<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.020> with<00:02:46.170> one<00:02:46.470> tunnel<00:02:46.740> they

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
intricate the one with one tunnel they

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.730 
intricate the one with one tunnel they
got<00:02:47.520> busily<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.060> work<00:02:48.240> right<00:02:48.600> away<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.170> they

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
got busily to work right away and they

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.350 
got busily to work right away and they
immediately<00:02:50.040> started<00:02:50.940> digging<00:02:51.210> their<00:02:51.330> own

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
immediately started digging their own

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.470 
immediately started digging their own
intricate<00:02:51.870> patterns<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.330> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
intricate patterns and we think that it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.240 
intricate patterns and we think that it
gives<00:02:54.840> them<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:55.020> lot<00:02:55.140> more<00:02:55.350> room<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.710> expand<00:02:56.040> so

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
gives them a lot more room to expand so

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.100 
gives them a lot more room to expand so
if<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.550> prefer<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.180> more<00:02:57.300> structured<00:02:57.780> method

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
if you prefer the more structured method

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.320 
if you prefer the more structured method
then<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:59.220> probably<00:02:59.430> better<00:02:59.700> off<00:02:59.820> with<00:03:00.060> for

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
then you probably better off with for

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.410 
then you probably better off with for
starting<00:03:00.660> cuddles<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.590> for<00:03:02.460> us<00:03:02.550> we<00:03:03.060> prefer

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
starting cuddles but for us we prefer

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.830 
starting cuddles but for us we prefer
and<00:03:03.690> recommend<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:05.100> starting<00:03:05.340> tunnel<00:03:05.840> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
and recommend the one starting tunnel so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.480 
and recommend the one starting tunnel so
after<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.200> first<00:03:07.230> day<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.920> having<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> ants

in the hill we came in the next morning
and<00:03:10.950> decided<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.880> run<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.210> camera<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:12.630> three

and decided to run the camera for three
hours<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.320> take<00:03:13.470> care<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.770> time<00:03:13.920> lapse<00:03:14.100> for
