00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.620
 but fourth so 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.620
 I 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.539
 because today I brought you an audi r8 v8 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:25.020
 producing 424 horsepower and 317 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.670
 pounds of torque now with what car 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.670
 could compete this machine 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.710
 well this is a porsche 997 twin-turbo 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.110
 which has 473 horsepower and 457 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 pounds of torque both cars are game 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 win drive 1 weighs less than the other 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.050
 that competition is relatively 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.860
 couple of course the problem is that I can not 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.860
 approve both cars 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.170
 yes 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.980
 why are you looking at me here is one of 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.980
 the parts 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.570
 although we have a 9 9 7 and a r8 one of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.210
 the most interesting things about this 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.069
 battle is that the audi created this car and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.130
 he conceptualized it to be able to compete 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.899
 against the 911 of the porsche so that in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.710
 How much do you want me to give you the peel in the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.850
 white or in the blue 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.850
 We will find 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.290
 and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.410
 not that in which you want them to have 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.209
 what you want them to have is that you 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.390
 I will win in this that I will win 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.290
 in the other I'm going to win you review 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.290
 you did not beat me 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.950
 the first two changes of that car and 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.620
 they scared me 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.090
 I said the car your photo level I do not 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.620
 I really did not expect that kind of 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.530
 response of removing faces from a start 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.380
 spectacular is because he sees 8 to be 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.150
 expanded that is the key applies the 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.860
 horse of power and as they are was wheel 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.630
 drive the two will respond to the east 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.580
 be turbo in what the turbos charge and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.050
 open then it's a process a little bit 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.540
 more leisurely and for Latinos 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.540
 now when they open they really open 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.230
 let's brake 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.849
 love 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.909
 series won me again as a car 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.950
 ah 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.989
 good that you beat me in braking 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.300
 it was good for now we have the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.300
 true test the half mile 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.739
 well my people as always the best 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.039
 cars in one place 66 testing 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.039
