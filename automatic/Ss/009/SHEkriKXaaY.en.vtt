00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
s3 so I'm just gonna turn this down a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
s3 so I'm just gonna turn this down a
bit<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:09.799> now<00:01:10.799> I'm<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.790> gonna<00:01:11.909> turn

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
bit first of all now I'm just gonna turn

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.399 
bit first of all now I'm just gonna turn

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this so you can see this a bit better

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.399 
this so you can see this a bit better
now<00:01:16.860> basically<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.810> would<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> normal

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
