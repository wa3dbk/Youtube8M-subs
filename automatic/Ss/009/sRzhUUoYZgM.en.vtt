tablet crunch they wanted to dig a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.599 
tablet crunch they wanted to dig a
little<00:00:15.540> bit<00:00:15.690> deeper<00:00:15.990> into<00:00:16.260> these<00:00:16.470> issues<00:00:16.920> what

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
little bit deeper into these issues what

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.000 
little bit deeper into these issues what
was<00:00:17.730> interesting<00:00:17.970> during<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> conversation

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
was interesting during the conversation

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.050 
was interesting during the conversation
they<00:00:20.010> told<00:00:20.279> me<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.490> they<00:00:20.760> were<00:00:20.820> actually

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
they told me that they were actually

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.160 
they told me that they were actually
having<00:00:21.420> problems<00:00:21.960> there<00:00:22.650> at<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.340> CBS<00:00:23.760> radio

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
having problems there at the CBS radio

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.450 
having problems there at the CBS radio
studios<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.560> guess<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.890> their<00:00:26.039> offices

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
studios and I guess in their offices

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.580 
studios and I guess in their offices
there's<00:00:27.119> multiple<00:00:27.630> wireless<00:00:27.900> routers

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
there's multiple wireless routers

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.370 
there's multiple wireless routers
throughout<00:00:29.369> their<00:00:29.580> building<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.320> they<00:00:31.320> were

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
throughout their building and they were

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.900 
throughout their building and they were
saying<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.949> some<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.309> routers<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.790> can

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
saying that some of the routers they can

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.350 
saying that some of the routers they can
get<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.149> fine<00:00:33.420> some<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.410> they<00:00:34.590> can't<00:00:35.360> so

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
get on fine some of them they can't so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.290 
get on fine some of them they can't so
what<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.230> people<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.800> situation<00:00:38.300> it's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
what do people do in that situation it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
what do people do in that situation it's
a<00:00:39.329> great<00:00:39.540> point<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.230> something<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.590> haven't

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
a great point it's something I haven't

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.310 
a great point it's something I haven't
thought<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.149> commercial<00:00:42.480> or<00:00:42.809> an<00:00:42.930> office

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
thought of in a commercial or an office

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.790 
thought of in a commercial or an office
or<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> campus<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.559> two<00:00:46.559> things

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
or a campus if you will the two things

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.580 
or a campus if you will the two things
come<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> mind<00:00:47.430> number<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.870> more<00:00:49.440> than

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
come to mind number one is more than

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590 
come to mind number one is more than
likely<00:00:49.800> there's<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> server<00:00:50.610> such<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.270> windows

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
likely there's a server such as windows

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.450 
likely there's a server such as windows
server<00:00:51.809> 2008<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.219> manages<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> IP

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
server 2008 that manages all of the IP

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
server 2008 that manages all of the IP
addresses<00:00:56.460> there's<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> lease<00:00:57.300> pool<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
addresses there's like a lease pool and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
addresses there's like a lease pool and
the<00:00:58.980> server<00:00:59.280> will<00:00:59.489> distribute<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.239> IP

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the server will distribute the IP

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
the server will distribute the IP
addresses<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> wireless<00:01:01.680> routers<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
addresses to the wireless routers the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
addresses to the wireless routers the
wireless<00:01:03.359> routers<00:01:03.809> will<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.170> distribute

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
wireless routers will then distribute

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.830 
wireless routers will then distribute
the<00:01:04.920> IP<00:01:05.070> addresses<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.000> devices<00:01:06.630> as

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the IP addresses to the devices as

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
the IP addresses to the devices as
they're<00:01:07.049> picking<00:01:07.380> up<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> network<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:09.000> my

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
they're picking up the network so my

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.870 
they're picking up the network so my
first<00:01:09.510> thought<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.049> turn<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> server

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
first thought is to turn to the server

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
first thought is to turn to the server
environment<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> fire<00:01:13.140> wall<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.770> in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
environment or the fire wall that's in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.109 
environment or the fire wall that's in
between<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.970> server<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:16.110> routers<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
between your server and your routers and

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
between your server and your routers and
simply<00:01:18.119> reset<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.689> either<00:01:18.990> assign<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> new

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
simply reset that either assign a new

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
simply reset that either assign a new
new<00:01:20.549> set<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.880> IP<00:01:21.030> addresses<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.720> new<00:01:22.080> lease<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
new set of IP addresses a new lease of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
new set of IP addresses a new lease of
IP<00:01:22.680> addresses<00:01:23.869> set<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> new<00:01:25.170> dns<00:01:25.710> set<00:01:26.640> new<00:01:26.880> name

IP addresses set a new dns set new name
servers<00:01:27.659> more<00:01:28.350> than<00:01:28.500> likely<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.250> DHCP<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
servers more than likely the DHCP you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.440 
servers more than likely the DHCP you
can<00:01:30.630> reset<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.140> DHCP<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.220> some<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.210> I'm

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
can reset the DHCP so some are there I'm

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.690 
can reset the DHCP so some are there I'm
certainly<00:01:33.780> not<00:01:33.930> an<00:01:34.049> expert<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.650> Windows<00:01:35.100> or

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
certainly not an expert with Windows or

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.929 
certainly not an expert with Windows or
domain<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.390> server<00:01:36.659> 2008<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.700> people<00:01:38.700> who<00:01:38.790> are

domain or server 2008 but people who are

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.700 
domain or server 2008 but people who are
experts<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.750> exactly<00:01:39.869> what<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
experts will know exactly what to do and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.319 
experts will know exactly what to do and
I<00:01:40.979> would<00:01:41.130> say<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> would<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.000> point<00:01:42.180> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I would say that would be your point of

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.880 
I would say that would be your point of
focus<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.170> reset<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.210> DHCP<00:01:46.079> server<00:01:46.439> if

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
focus is to reset the the DHCP server if

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.670 
focus is to reset the the DHCP server if
windows<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:48.060> windows<00:01:48.659> server<00:01:48.869> 2008<00:01:49.470> is

windows if windows server 2008 is
actually<00:01:50.250> managing<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.390> distribution<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> IP

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
actually managing the distribution of IP

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
actually managing the distribution of IP
addresses<00:01:52.619> number<00:01:53.340> too<00:01:53.549> much<00:01:54.540> more

cumbersome<00:01:55.229> solution<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.360> people<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.420> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
cumbersome solution is people are just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.539 
cumbersome solution is people are just
going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.170> around<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
going to have to go around to all the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.160 
going to have to go around to all the
wireless<00:01:59.939> routers<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
wireless routers that you have and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.859 
wireless routers that you have and
simply<00:02:01.890> reset<00:02:02.250> them<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.909> know<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.630> logged

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
simply reset them you know get logged

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.649 
simply reset them you know get logged
into<00:02:04.079> them<00:02:04.320> actually<00:02:04.770> i<00:02:05.250> could<00:02:05.610> probably<00:02:05.659> sit

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
into them actually i could probably sit

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.889 
into them actually i could probably sit
on<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.259> IP<00:02:07.619> domain<00:02:08.220> or<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:08.970> Network<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
on one IP domain or in that Network and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.960 
on one IP domain or in that Network and
each<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> routers<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.310> their<00:02:11.700> own<00:02:11.760> IP

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
each of the routers have their own IP

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.280 
each of the routers have their own IP
address<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.629> from<00:02:12.870> one

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
address so from one

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.350 
address so from one
puter<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.799> would<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.340> able<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.519> access<00:02:14.730> every

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
puter I would be able to access every

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.390 
puter I would be able to access every
single<00:02:15.659> router<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.920> entire<00:02:17.189> building

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
single router and the entire building

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.179 
single router and the entire building
and<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.269> just<00:02:18.420> simply<00:02:18.629> go<00:02:18.870> through<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.439> reset

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
and you just simply go through and reset

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.220 
and you just simply go through and reset
security<00:02:20.790> or<00:02:20.969> reset<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.340> flush<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.989> cash

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
security or reset the flush the the cash

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.619 
security or reset the flush the the cash
that's<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.829> router<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.310> reset<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.269> so

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
that's in the router and reset it so

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.199 
that's in the router and reset it so
that's<00:02:28.260> actually<00:02:28.469> not<00:02:29.219> as<00:02:29.370> cumbersome<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.939> as

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
that's actually not as cumbersome of as

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.990 
that's actually not as cumbersome of as
I<00:02:30.390> was<00:02:30.540> thinking<00:02:30.900> previously<00:02:31.829> because<00:02:32.040> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I was thinking previously because you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.059 
I was thinking previously because you
can<00:02:33.150> probably<00:02:33.390> access<00:02:34.049> all<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.319> routers<00:02:34.769> just

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
can probably access all the routers just

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.399 
can probably access all the routers just
from<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.400> computer<00:02:35.640> or<00:02:36.000> one<00:02:36.120> laptop<00:02:36.359> so<00:02:36.840> those

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
from one computer or one laptop so those

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.679 
from one computer or one laptop so those
are<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.590> two<00:02:37.650> places<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.370> i<00:02:38.400> would<00:02:38.609> start<00:02:38.849> be

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
are the two places that i would start be

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.390 
are the two places that i would start be
interested<00:02:40.109> to<00:02:40.200> hear<00:02:40.230> your<00:02:40.439> thoughts<00:02:40.889> people

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
interested to hear your thoughts people

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.009 
interested to hear your thoughts people
who<00:02:41.489> are<00:02:41.549> much<00:02:41.730> more<00:02:41.909> knowledgeable<00:02:42.389> with

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
who are much more knowledgeable with

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.690 
who are much more knowledgeable with

dhcp or a tcp/ip and windows server what

dhcp or a tcp/ip and windows server what
you<00:02:47.849> think<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.420> solutions<00:02:49.049> might<00:02:49.859> be<00:02:50.189> for

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
you think the solutions might be for

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.119 
you think the solutions might be for
people<00:02:51.930> who<00:02:52.049> are<00:02:52.139> having<00:02:52.349> connect<00:02:52.799> Wi-Fi
