00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
so not that long ago guys I did an

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.080 
so not that long ago guys I did an
unboxing<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.650> liquid<00:00:11.099> armor<00:00:11.309> invisible

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
unboxing of the liquid armor invisible

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.330 
unboxing of the liquid armor invisible
nano<00:00:12.480> coating<00:00:13.049> tech<00:00:13.290> screen<00:00:13.679> protector<00:00:14.190> and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
nano coating tech screen protector and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.670 
nano coating tech screen protector and
what<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> said<00:00:15.179> was<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.480> at<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.440> time<00:00:16.650> I

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
what I said was that at the time I

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.410 
what I said was that at the time I
didn't<00:00:17.100> really<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.490> way<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> validate

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
didn't really have a way to validate

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.529 
didn't really have a way to validate
whether<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.500> stuff<00:00:19.770> works<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.340> not<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.150> what

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
whether this stuff works or not so what

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.090 
whether this stuff works or not so what
it<00:00:21.689> claims<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> liquid

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
it claims is that with the liquid

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.550 
it claims is that with the liquid
coating<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.880> basically<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.720> spray<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
coating you basically just spray it on a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800 
coating you basically just spray it on a
screen<00:00:25.949> wipe<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.090> direction<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
screen wipe it in one direction and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.710 
screen wipe it in one direction and
leave<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.380> 24<00:00:29.010> hours<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.340> cure<00:00:29.820> or<00:00:30.090> even<00:00:30.630> I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
leave it for 24 hours to cure or even I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440 
leave it for 24 hours to cure or even I
think<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.349> uh<00:00:32.210> whatever<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.390> not

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
think it's just uh whatever it's not

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.319 
think it's just uh whatever it's not
that<00:00:33.809> long<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.440> dry<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.430> 24<00:00:35.880> hours<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that long to dry and then 24 hours to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.780 
that long to dry and then 24 hours to
cure<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.290> will<00:00:37.469> make<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.829> screen<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
cure and it will make your screen up to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
cure and it will make your screen up to
2<00:00:39.750> times<00:00:39.989> stronger<00:00:40.350> than<00:00:40.680> traditional<00:00:40.829> screen

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
2 times stronger than traditional screen

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369 
2 times stronger than traditional screen
protectors<00:00:41.969> which<00:00:42.660> sounds<00:00:42.989> pretty<00:00:43.170> good

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
protectors which sounds pretty good

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
protectors which sounds pretty good
right<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.860> unless<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.250> validate<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> then

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
right but unless you validate it then

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.049 
right but unless you validate it then
it's<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.600> claim<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> box<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:47.010> slick<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
it's just a claim on a box so slick and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.139 
it's just a claim on a box so slick and
I<00:00:48.180> came<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.840> an<00:00:48.960> experiment<00:00:49.500> today<00:00:50.149> where

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
I came up with an experiment today where

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330 
I came up with an experiment today where
we're<00:00:51.300> taking<00:00:51.449> two<00:00:51.840> dummy<00:00:52.140> foams<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.160> these

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
we're taking two dummy foams so these

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
we're taking two dummy foams so these
are<00:00:53.610> blackberry<00:00:54.480> curve<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.020> BlackBerry

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
are blackberry curve in a BlackBerry

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.340 
are blackberry curve in a BlackBerry
Bold<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> we're<00:00:56.489> gonna<00:00:56.610> drag<00:00:57.000> them<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.750> string

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
Bold and we're gonna drag them on string

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.700 
Bold and we're gonna drag them on string
behind<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.219> motorcycle<00:01:00.230> we're<00:01:01.230> gonna<00:01:01.350> drag

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
behind my motorcycle we're gonna drag

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.210 
behind my motorcycle we're gonna drag
them<00:01:01.949> screen<00:01:02.340> side<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.559> I<00:01:04.559> wrote<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
them screen side down and I wrote on the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.280 
them screen side down and I wrote on the
backs<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> our<00:01:06.930> liquid

can read it oh cool and this is our
control<00:01:11.580> group<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> bold<00:01:13.110> has<00:01:13.439> been

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
control group one so the bold has been

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
control group one so the bold has been
coated<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.100> liquid<00:01:14.549> armor<00:01:14.729> three<00:01:15.270> days<00:01:15.479> ago

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
coated with liquid armor three days ago

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.380 
coated with liquid armor three days ago
and<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.590> curve<00:01:16.979> has<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.850> been<00:01:18.060> coated<00:01:18.270> with

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and the curve has not been coated with

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
and the curve has not been coated with
liquid<00:01:18.840> armor<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.259> all<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.890> we're<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
liquid armor at all so we're going to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980 
liquid armor at all so we're going to
tie<00:01:20.400> these<00:01:20.460> down<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.210> we're<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.720> drag

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
tie these down and we're going to drag

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.880 
tie these down and we're going to drag
them<00:01:22.229> down<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> end<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:25.080> if

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
them down to the end of this and see if

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
them down to the end of this and see if
there's<00:01:26.220> actually<00:01:26.430> any<00:01:26.759> difference<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
there's actually any difference in the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
there's actually any difference in the
scratched<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.619> Ness<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.340> screens<00:01:29.670> when

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
know why this always happens it must be

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.929 
know why this always happens it must be
slick<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:47.100> every<00:01:47.340> time<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.549> film

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
