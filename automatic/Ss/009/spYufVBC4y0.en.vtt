 Hello in this article show how to use Windows 7 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:15.239
 certain symbols up here 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.699
 Gingst take the EU and the eventual date we can hide for 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.789
 Windows Vista Windows XP against already online and this is now from 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.999
 Minus 7 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.089
 in Windows 7 10 the configuration settings I say it 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.300
 easier to reach as with Windows XP / Windows Vista 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.820
 because here you can just be on this 2 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.620
 if he is driving is to confess 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.610
 or click on "Customize" 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.680
 what are you doing here 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.750
 the appropriate window, of course, it is synonymous if here again 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 investing our TAS bar will not make BZ Aspar able to do that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.280
 then we do not have an info section Caligiuri ladder anymore but simply 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.940
 the point 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.090
 info area in the fit afford rider 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.890
 Köhli clicks on "Customize" again 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.500
 customize which icons will display notifications about area or 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.220
 we are back again 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 Now we can turn back to each page with interest like each symbol 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 appropriate behavior patterns set so for example here again 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.770
 I do not really need the guests of the 1, that's why I want it back on and on 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.170
 if you are icon to hide notification then it will not be anymore 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.250
 appropriate 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.180
 Of course I can do some with each other again 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.910
 Of course, I can disable System Symbols and Deactivate Sing along 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.510
 just like and click on this link level 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.340
 Activate or deactivate the system screed then I come here in Nice 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.420
 Steam symbols as the name suggests, so the tour should be displayed 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.920
 yes or no the volume whether the should be displayed yes and so 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.140
 continue and so on power supply is for laptops they refer to the 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.860
 Sage with battery interesting 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.640
 since desktop pc sun valley united generally not with a battery operated 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.200
 become 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.750
 IZ power supply here just disabled and makes the maintenance center can 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.130
 turn it on and off 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.240
 and then 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.180
 im OK on epd-tour then also have the function Staber Behavior for 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.259
 Symbolism is therefore practically the ranch to report MIS dragged and to 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.810
 Default setting 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.069
 we were still the point always all symbols and accompanied in 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.249
 BZ who show on the Tosca edge 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:18.069
 that is, if we activate this hook we would have split it then 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.859
 all icons are displayed as you can see on the top right «Me 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.969
 activate the door again so now is disabled 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.759
 I also did not have the opportunity to hire them 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:33.629
 So always do it out so you can stop it and that's the whole thing 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.079
 For Windows 7 is in principle easy to achieve than on the Vista with them so 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.599
 Windows XP and then it's already been Sunday 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.939

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.369

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.439

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.449
 there you have to 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.469
