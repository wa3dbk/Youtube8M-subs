00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.980
 Can you hear Ozzy is a disease? 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.880
 caused by a virus called 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.770
 Robinho 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.160
 is one of the most serious and 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.400
 frequently extremely contagious that 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.919
 reach the wrong dogs that do not have 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.189
 still have your complete vaccination plan 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.349
 The contagion of this disease is 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.220
 contact with other animals 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.130
 contaminated or simply contact 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.980
 with sun zones I passed the parks and 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.570
 public gardens where I've been 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.570
 animal plants and the first symptoms 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.420
 did not flee for about four to six days 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.149
 after the infection and the animal begins with 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.059
 stand apart first 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.589
 begins to show vomiting and a few days 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:02.739
 then they begin to lose hassli quinas 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:06.190
 to evolve and risky increasingly used 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.470
 and finally the board even this picture 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.990
 quickly leads to dehydration and 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.110
 inevitable - the death of the animal 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.900
 it is therefore essential that the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.470
 hospitalization so that it can be 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.900
 to start treatment 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.670
 in this case will be only one of the symptoms 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.500
 since there are no treatments 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.009
 to change the world. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.950
 so the treatment consists of giving time 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.170
 to the dog's immune system to 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.909
 that produced antibodies were then 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.530
 against this disease 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.549
 some days of training are 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.159
 necessary for that healing to occur in 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.040
 some cases it is even necessary to resort to 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.340
 to blood and plasma transfusions 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.979
 despite a very serious illness with the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.219
 treatment , about 80% of the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.560
 dogs can fully recover 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.590
 it is important and essential that prevention 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.719
 if you make a saint your plan that you 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.719
 I soon found it more cool.
