channel if you still subscribe to that i

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:20.279

probably wouldn't have many videos out
just<00:01:20.530> probably<00:01:20.709> because<00:01:21.069> this<00:01:21.219> laptop<00:01:21.459> just

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
just probably because this laptop just

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.389 
just probably because this laptop just
does<00:01:22.509> not<00:01:22.719> run<00:01:23.049> any<00:01:23.319> games<00:01:23.859> which<00:01:24.159> kind<00:01:24.369> of

i also get a lot of death so that is the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.060 
i also get a lot of death so that is the
main<00:02:45.400> reason<00:02:45.430> why<00:02:45.820> macadie<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.300> low<00:02:46.860> its<00:02:47.860> low

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
main reason why macadie is low its low

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.620 
main reason why macadie is low its low

way<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.180> end<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.800> for<00:03:14.800> youtube<00:03:15.130> videos

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430

that<00:03:15.580> is<00:03:15.670> absolutely<00:03:15.970> useless<00:03:16.240> because<00:03:16.600> you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
that is absolutely useless because you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.080 
that is absolutely useless because you
can't<00:03:17.050> really<00:03:17.200> use<00:03:17.470> half<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.250> gameplay<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:18.940> what

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
can't really use half a gameplay so what

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.400 
can't really use half a gameplay so what
I<00:03:19.120> tend<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.420> do<00:03:19.570> is<00:03:19.600> just<00:03:19.750> leave<00:03:19.960> and<00:03:20.260> just

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
I tend to do is just leave and just

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.840 
I tend to do is just leave and just
pretty<00:03:20.740> much<00:03:20.860> cycle<00:03:21.310> through<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:21.550> lobbies

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
pretty much cycle through the lobbies

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.790 
pretty much cycle through the lobbies
until<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.600> get<00:03:22.750> one<00:03:22.900> that's<00:03:22.990> just<00:03:23.260> started<00:03:23.620> you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
until I get one that's just started you

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.380 
until I get one that's just started you
know<00:03:23.890> which<00:03:24.070> could<00:03:24.250> take<00:03:24.430> 10<00:03:24.820> games<00:03:25.090> or<00:03:25.330> it

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
know which could take 10 games or it

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.480 
know which could take 10 games or it
could<00:03:25.690> take<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.050> know<00:03:26.080> one<00:03:26.350> or<00:03:26.470> two<00:03:26.620> that's

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
could take you know one or two that's

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.250 
could take you know one or two that's
one<00:03:27.820> of<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.940> reasons<00:03:28.270> one<00:03:28.390> win-loss<00:03:28.750> ratio<00:03:29.110> is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
one of the reasons one win-loss ratio is

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.680 
one of the reasons one win-loss ratio is
low<00:03:29.470> my<00:03:30.190> 409<00:03:30.610> score<00:03:31.060> per<00:03:31.180> minute<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.480> think<00:03:31.570> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
low my 409 score per minute I think the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.960 
low my 409 score per minute I think the
last<00:03:31.870> time<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.200> made<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.440> video<00:03:32.709> like<00:03:33.040> this<00:03:33.100> my

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
last time I made a video like this my

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.290 
last time I made a video like this my
score<00:03:34.300> per<00:03:34.420> minute<00:03:34.660> was<00:03:34.780> maybe<00:03:35.160> 450<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.760> it's

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
score per minute was maybe 450 so it's

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.910 
score per minute was maybe 450 so it's
changed<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.750> bit<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.560> know<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:38.800> gone

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
changed a bit but you know it's gone

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.140 
changed a bit but you know it's gone
down<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.459> know<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:39.760> should<00:03:39.790> have<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.030> live

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
down but you know we should have to live

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.790 
down but you know we should have to live
of<00:03:40.270> that<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.510> play<00:03:40.660> team<00:03:41.140> deathmatch<00:03:41.170> a<00:03:41.650> hell

deathmatch we've got 350 4 wins and your
notice<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.660> think<00:04:23.169> all<00:04:23.290> these<00:04:23.470> win-loss<00:04:23.860> ratios

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
notice I think all these win-loss ratios

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.970 
notice I think all these win-loss ratios
are<00:04:24.640> all<00:04:24.880> below-<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.200> set<00:04:26.350> from<00:04:26.500> sticks<00:04:26.800> and

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
are all below- it set from sticks and

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.490 
are all below- it set from sticks and
stones<00:04:27.220> which<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.730> don't<00:04:28.510> know<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.600> paid<00:04:29.080> for<00:04:29.110> at

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
stones which I don't know I paid for at

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.930 
stones which I don't know I paid for at
least<00:04:29.650> four<00:04:29.919> three<00:04:30.250> games<00:04:30.430> which<00:04:30.640> ain't<00:04:30.790> too

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
least four three games which ain't too

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.420 
least four three games which ain't too
bad<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.960> yeah<00:04:32.140> I<00:04:32.380> delay<00:04:32.740> this<00:04:32.890> is<00:04:33.039> a<00:04:33.130> lot<00:04:33.280> like

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
bad so yeah I delay this is a lot like

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.930 
bad so yeah I delay this is a lot like
it<00:04:33.550> adds<00:04:33.669> up<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:33.850> 1.1<00:04:34.570> k<00:04:35.530> wins<00:04:36.250> or<00:04:36.520> ever<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:36.760> don't

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
it adds up to 1.1 k wins or ever I don't

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.730 
it adds up to 1.1 k wins or ever I don't

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
know three injured 50

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.279 
know three injured 50
250<00:04:39.310> was<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.669> bus<00:04:39.849> like<00:04:40.199> 700<00:04:41.199> 600<00:04:41.729> 600<00:04:42.729> 750<00:04:43.479> ad

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
250 was the bus like 700 600 600 750 ad

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.360 
250 was the bus like 700 600 600 750 ad
tonight<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.590> doesn't<00:04:44.740> look<00:04:44.860> like<00:04:45.009> it<00:04:45.130> adds<00:04:45.250> a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
tonight it doesn't look like it adds a

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.480 
tonight it doesn't look like it adds a
bit<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:46.210> probably<00:04:46.479> must<00:04:46.690> do<00:04:47.220> that's<00:04:48.220> what<00:04:48.340> game

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
bit it probably must do that's what game

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.029

concussions a lot of grenades which is

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.969 
concussions a lot of grenades which is
kind<00:05:25.960> of<00:05:25.990> surprising<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.650> didn't<00:05:26.889> really

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
kind of surprising I didn't really

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.279 
kind of surprising I didn't really
expect<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.370> see<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.699> many<00:05:27.849> actually<00:05:28.300> we<00:05:29.139> have

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
expect to see that many actually we have

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.800 
expect to see that many actually we have
got<00:05:29.530> oh<00:05:30.000> we're<00:05:31.000> doing<00:05:31.120> fairly<00:05:31.389> good<00:05:31.599> I<00:05:31.630> guess

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
got oh we're doing fairly good I guess

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.570 
got oh we're doing fairly good I guess
we've<00:05:32.110> got<00:05:32.229> grenade<00:05:32.590> kills<00:05:32.979> fire<00:05:33.310> so<00:05:33.520> we

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
we've got grenade kills fire so we

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.820 
we've got grenade kills fire so we
completely<00:05:33.880> finish<00:05:34.150> that<00:05:34.330> obviously<00:05:35.080> c4s<00:05:35.680> not

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
completely finish that obviously c4s not

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.439 
completely finish that obviously c4s not
too<00:05:36.009> many<00:05:36.190> use<00:05:36.460> but<00:05:36.699> a<00:05:36.729> lot<00:05:36.909> of<00:05:36.940> kills<00:05:37.240> about

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
too many use but a lot of kills about

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.360 
too many use but a lot of kills about
one<00:05:37.870> in<00:05:37.990> every<00:05:38.110> three<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:38.830> we<00:05:38.919> throw<00:05:39.099> we<00:05:39.220> get

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
one in every three that we throw we get

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.649 
one in every three that we throw we get
a<00:05:39.400> kill<00:05:39.610> which<00:05:39.759> is<00:05:39.880> pretty<00:05:40.000> decent<00:05:40.210> quite<00:05:40.630> a

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
a kill which is pretty decent quite a

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.649 
a kill which is pretty decent quite a
good<00:05:41.099> statistic<00:05:42.099> and<00:05:42.820> I'm<00:05:43.030> a<00:05:43.090> scorestreaks
