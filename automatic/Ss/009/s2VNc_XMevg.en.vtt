materials tutorials let me show how to

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.900 
materials tutorials let me show how to
use<00:00:05.370> custom<00:00:05.640> maps<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.690> UVW<00:00:07.589> mapping<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:08.790> here

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
use custom maps and UVW mapping so here

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.430 
use custom maps and UVW mapping so here
I've<00:00:09.000> got<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.150> terrace<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.780> wood<00:00:09.990> deck<00:00:10.200> then

change my camera view so I can see it at

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.060 
change my camera view so I can see it at
a<00:00:14.490> little<00:00:14.670> higher<00:00:15.109> point<00:00:16.109> here<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:16.920> gonna

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
a little higher point here it's gonna

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.099 
a little higher point here it's gonna
work<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> wood<00:00:17.670> deck<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
work on the wood deck and it's just a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.330 
work on the wood deck and it's just a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.859 
editor and I want to add a custom map to
it<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.460> I'm<00:00:29.519> gonna<00:00:29.580> rename<00:00:30.029> my<00:00:30.269> material<00:00:30.720> here

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it so I'm gonna rename my material here

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.790 
it so I'm gonna rename my material here
to<00:00:30.990> wood<00:00:31.170> deck<00:00:32.300> go<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.540> pro<00:00:33.809> materials<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
to wood deck go to my pro materials and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.630 
to wood deck go to my pro materials and
I'm<00:00:34.890> gonna<00:00:34.980> use<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> hardwood<00:00:35.910> Pro<00:00:36.570> material

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
I'm gonna use the hardwood Pro material

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.100 
I'm gonna use the hardwood Pro material
that<00:00:38.640> way<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:39.030> take<00:00:39.180> advantage<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that way I can take advantage of the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.750 
that way I can take advantage of the
different<00:00:40.290> options<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
different options in there for the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.060 
different options in there for the
glossiness<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.629> such<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.710> under<00:00:43.860> base

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
glossiness and such so under base

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
glossiness and such so under base
hardwood<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.180> gonna<00:00:45.329> click<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> none

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
hardwood I'm gonna click on the none

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.100 
hardwood I'm gonna click on the none
button<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.059> then<00:00:48.059> select<00:00:48.239> bitmap<00:00:48.629> from

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
button here and then select bitmap from

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.830 
button here and then select bitmap from
my<00:00:49.260> material/map<00:00:49.829> browser<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.760> then<00:00:51.629> grab

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
my material/map browser and then grab

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
my material/map browser and then grab
the<00:00:52.260> cedar<00:00:52.530> fence<00:00:52.800> material<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.579> this

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the cedar fence material in this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.510 
the cedar fence material in this
instance<00:00:54.410> now<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.620> material<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.399> know

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
instance now this material I don't know

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.840 
instance now this material I don't know
the<00:00:56.670> exact<00:00:57.090> real-world<00:00:57.660> size<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> I'm

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the exact real-world size of it so I'm

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
the exact real-world size of it so I'm
going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> apply<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> wood<00:01:01.559> deck

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
going to apply that to the wood deck

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.399 
going to apply that to the wood deck
preview<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.789> viewport<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.260> see

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
preview in my viewport and you can see

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.219 
preview in my viewport and you can see
the<00:01:04.530> tiling<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> off<00:01:05.689> it<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.869> doesn't<00:01:07.200> look

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the tiling is off it just doesn't look

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.000 
the tiling is off it just doesn't look
like<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.909> different<00:01:09.439> sections<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.770> wood

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
like the different sections of that wood

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.410 
like the different sections of that wood
so<00:01:11.369> I'm<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> turn<00:01:11.760> off<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.180> real-world

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
so I'm going to turn off the real-world

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
so I'm going to turn off the real-world
scale<00:01:13.049> since<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> size

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
scale since I don't know what the size

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.929 
scale since I don't know what the size
of<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> images<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.580> then<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.729> under

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
of it of the images and then go under

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.359 
of it of the images and then go under
box<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.570> under<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.810> modify<00:01:19.470> parameter<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
box here under my modify parameter and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
box here under my modify parameter and
I'm<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> turn<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.689> real-world<00:01:22.259> map

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
I'm going to turn off the real-world map

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.020 
I'm going to turn off the real-world map
size

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
size

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.340 
size
there's<00:01:24.030> mapping<00:01:24.479> coordinates<00:01:24.840> already

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
there's mapping coordinates already

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.920 
there's mapping coordinates already
generated<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.400> takes<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.090> image<00:01:27.689> file

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
generated so it takes that image file

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.499 
generated so it takes that image file
and<00:01:28.229> maps<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> surface

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
and maps it to the surface

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.240 
and maps it to the surface
now<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:30.780> under<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> material<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
now here under the material I'm going to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520 
now here under the material I'm going to
change<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> tiling<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.270> four<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.930> two

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
change the tiling to four and two

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
change the tiling to four and two
so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.040> tiling<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> X<00:01:36.180> Direction<00:01:36.630> V<00:01:36.659> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so you tiling is the X Direction V is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
so you tiling is the X Direction V is
the<00:01:37.170> Y<00:01:37.680> direction<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> work

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the Y direction and you have to work

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730 
the Y direction and you have to work
with<00:01:39.329> those<00:01:39.479> settings<00:01:39.960> four<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.530> will

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
with those settings four and two will

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.859 
with those settings four and two will
work<00:01:40.860> pretty<00:01:41.130> good<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.030> then

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
work pretty good on this one and then

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.569 
work pretty good on this one and then
I'm<00:01:42.960> gonna<00:01:43.049> change<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.320> surface<00:01:43.950> finish<00:01:44.369> so

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
I'm gonna change my surface finish so

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.160 
I'm gonna change my surface finish so
it's<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.030> glossy<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.720> gonna<00:01:45.869> make<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it's not so glossy I'm gonna make it a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's not so glossy I'm gonna make it a
satin<00:01:46.530> finish<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:48.000> could<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.329> other<00:01:48.450> things

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
satin finish and I could do other things

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.960 
satin finish and I could do other things
like<00:01:48.840> add<00:01:49.140> bumps<00:01:49.560> bump<00:01:50.100> map<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> stuff<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
like add bumps bump map and stuff to it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.870 
like add bumps bump map and stuff to it
which<00:01:51.119> we'll<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.869> our<00:01:52.170> next<00:01:52.770> material<00:01:53.430> this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
which we'll do on our next material this

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.719 
which we'll do on our next material this
one<00:01:54.060> I'll<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.329> keep<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.869> those<00:01:55.049> settings

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
one I'll just keep with those settings

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.340 
one I'll just keep with those settings
so<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.030> work<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> terrace<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
so now I'm gonna work on the terrace and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.010 
so now I'm gonna work on the terrace and
the<00:01:59.009> terrace<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.579> editable<00:01:59.909> mesh<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.899> it's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the terrace is an editable mesh so it's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.959 
the terrace is an editable mesh so it's
probably<00:02:01.350> had<00:02:01.500> boolean<00:02:02.130> subtractions<00:02:02.759> done

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
probably had boolean subtractions done

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.630 
probably had boolean subtractions done
on<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> different<00:02:03.659> things<00:02:03.810> done<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
on it different things done to it I

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.160 
on it different things done to it I
create<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> new<00:02:05.850> material<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.509> I'll<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.020> call

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
create a new material and I'll just call

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.969 
create a new material and I'll just call
this<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.500> Terrace<00:02:08.220> tile<00:02:09.379> this<00:02:10.379> time<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> want<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
this one Terrace tile this time I want a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.420 
this one Terrace tile this time I want a
ceramic

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
ceramic

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.830 
ceramic
material<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.209> I'm<00:02:13.299> going<00:02:13.540> there<00:02:13.599> Pro

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
material so I'm going there Pro

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.119 
material so I'm going there Pro
materials<00:02:14.409> and<00:02:14.680> ceramic<00:02:17.310> select<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.579> one

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
materials and ceramic select that one

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.569 
materials and ceramic select that one
and<00:02:21.129> then<00:02:21.280> under<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.730> color<00:02:22.659> reflectance

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
and then under the color reflectance

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.009 
and then under the color reflectance
section<00:02:24.579> here<00:02:24.849> I'm<00:02:25.150> gonna<00:02:25.299> put<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.629> custom

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
section here I'm gonna put the custom

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.349 
section here I'm gonna put the custom
map<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:26.439> that<00:02:26.560> slot<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.159> I<00:02:27.700> click<00:02:27.939> on<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.209> gray

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
map in that slot so I click on the gray

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.410 
map in that slot so I click on the gray
box<00:02:28.390> there<00:02:28.900> at<00:02:29.079> bitmap<00:02:29.879> and<00:02:30.879> I'm<00:02:31.090> gonna<00:02:31.180> use<00:02:31.389> my

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
box there at bitmap and I'm gonna use my

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.619 
box there at bitmap and I'm gonna use my
tile<00:02:32.170> cast<00:02:32.560> jpg<00:02:33.159> here<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.060> has<00:02:34.120> some<00:02:34.420> design

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
tile cast jpg here so it has some design

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:42.119 
tile cast jpg here so it has some design
to<00:02:35.049> it<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:39.540> now<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.780> particular<00:02:41.139> material<00:02:41.920> I

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
to it and now this particular material I

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.369 
to it and now this particular material I
dunno<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:42.939> physical<00:02:43.450> size<00:02:43.719> that<00:02:44.079> image

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
dunno what physical size that image

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.860 
dunno what physical size that image
represents<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:46.000> use<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.419> real<00:02:46.629> world

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
represents so I can use the real world

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.690 
represents so I can use the real world
scale<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.439> this<00:02:47.560> instance<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.489> I'm<00:02:48.549> going<00:02:48.669> to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
scale in this instance so I'm going to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.970 
scale in this instance so I'm going to
keep<00:02:48.849> real<00:02:49.150> world<00:02:49.389> scale<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:50.019> there<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.470> I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
keep real world scale on there and I

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.659 
keep real world scale on there and I
know<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> size<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.939> it<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:54.280> going<00:02:54.579> to

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
know that the size of it is going to

00:02:54.669 --> 00:03:00.479 
know that the size of it is going to
equal<00:02:54.790> 3<00:02:55.319> meters<00:02:56.319> by<00:02:56.769> 2<00:02:57.219> meters<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> know

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
equal 3 meters by 2 meters so I know

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.250 
equal 3 meters by 2 meters so I know
that<00:03:00.639> exact<00:03:01.180> shape<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.659> can<00:03:01.810> add<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.079> there<00:03:04.260> now

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
that exact shape I can add it there now

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.050 
that exact shape I can add it there now
the<00:03:05.319> terrace<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:05.950> an<00:03:06.099> editable<00:03:06.400> mesh<00:03:06.489> it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
the terrace is an editable mesh it

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.550 
the terrace is an editable mesh it
doesn't<00:03:07.389> automatically<00:03:07.840> have<00:03:08.079> mapping

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
doesn't automatically have mapping

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.949 
doesn't automatically have mapping
coordinates<00:03:08.950> assigned<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.719> I<00:03:10.780> have<00:03:10.900> to

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
coordinates assigned to it so I have to

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.690 
coordinates assigned to it so I have to
add<00:03:11.109> a<00:03:11.139> UVW<00:03:11.379> map<00:03:11.980> too<00:03:12.219> to<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.639> object<00:03:14.609> so<00:03:15.609> I'm

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
add a UVW map too to the object so I'm

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.280 
add a UVW map too to the object so I'm
gonna<00:03:15.819> go<00:03:15.909> down<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.329> UVW<00:03:16.569> map<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.319> that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
gonna go down to a UVW map and that

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.689 
gonna go down to a UVW map and that
mapping<00:03:20.290> I'm<00:03:20.560> gonna<00:03:20.739> keep<00:03:20.889> planar<00:03:21.340> because<00:03:21.639> it

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 
mapping I'm gonna keep planar because it

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.909 
mapping I'm gonna keep planar because it
is<00:03:21.819> a<00:03:21.849> flat<00:03:22.150> surface<00:03:22.389> I<00:03:22.810> don't<00:03:23.650> need<00:03:23.799> to

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
is a flat surface I don't need to

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.250 
is a flat surface I don't need to
customize<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.790> tile<00:03:25.030> settings<00:03:25.479> here<00:03:25.780> because

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
customize the tile settings here because

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.110 
customize the tile settings here because
I'm<00:03:26.409> using<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.829> real-world<00:03:27.099> map<00:03:27.609> size<00:03:27.639> so

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
I'm using the real-world map size so

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.729 
I'm using the real-world map size so
I'll<00:03:28.180> just<00:03:28.299> make<00:03:28.449> sure<00:03:28.599> that's<00:03:28.750> checked<00:03:28.930> if<00:03:29.680> I

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
I'll just make sure that's checked if I

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.589 
I'll just make sure that's checked if I
unchecked<00:03:30.189> it<00:03:30.310> I'd<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.790> add<00:03:30.939> tiling

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
unchecked it I'd have to add tiling

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.199 
unchecked it I'd have to add tiling
values<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.109> there<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:36.220> now<00:03:36.370> I'll<00:03:36.639> apply<00:03:36.819> that

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
values in there so now I'll apply that

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.159 
values in there so now I'll apply that
material<00:03:38.879> preview<00:03:39.879> it<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.060> my<00:03:40.120> viewport<00:03:40.540> and

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
material preview it in my viewport and

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.080 
material preview it in my viewport and
the<00:03:41.680> size<00:03:41.979> of<00:03:42.189> it<00:03:42.310> worked<00:03:42.669> out<00:03:42.819> well

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
the size of it worked out well

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.059 
the size of it worked out well
but<00:03:43.959> notice<00:03:44.290> though<00:03:44.439> on<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.650> side<00:03:44.859> of<00:03:44.979> the

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
but notice though on the side of the

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.280 
but notice though on the side of the
pool<00:03:45.280> here<00:03:45.549> I<00:03:45.579> have<00:03:45.759> that<00:03:45.909> small<00:03:46.329> bit<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.750> tile

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
pool here I have that small bit of tile

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.199 
pool here I have that small bit of tile
I<00:03:47.409> just<00:03:47.799> want<00:03:47.979> to<00:03:48.040> offset<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.669> material<00:03:49.180> a

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
I just want to offset that material a

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.699 
I just want to offset that material a
little<00:03:49.389> bit<00:03:49.629> so<00:03:49.870> I'm<00:03:49.930> gonna<00:03:50.049> go<00:03:50.139> back<00:03:50.349> into<00:03:50.590> the

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
little bit so I'm gonna go back into the

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.879 
little bit so I'm gonna go back into the
material<00:03:51.069> editor<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:52.650> notice<00:03:53.650> here<00:03:53.799> I<00:03:53.859> have

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.249 
material editor and notice here I have
an<00:03:54.099> offset<00:03:54.549> setting<00:03:55.000> for<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:55.419> material<00:03:55.989> and

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
an offset setting for that material and

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.719 
an offset setting for that material and
I'm<00:03:56.530> gonna<00:03:56.680> offset<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:57.250> just<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.489> little<00:03:57.609> bit

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:57.729 
I'm gonna offset it just a little bit

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.020 
I'm gonna offset it just a little bit
and<00:03:58.090> I'm<00:03:58.569> experimenting<00:03:59.079> with<00:03:59.379> values<00:03:59.680> again

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
and I'm experimenting with values again

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:09.479 
and I'm experimenting with values again
so<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.090> found<00:04:01.449> out<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:01.810> minus<00:04:02.229> 0.2<00:04:08.220> m/s<00:04:09.220> tire

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
so I found out that minus 0.2 m/s tire

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.839 
so I found out that minus 0.2 m/s tire
map<00:04:09.909> across<00:04:10.509> that<00:04:10.720> surface<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:12.579> that's<00:04:12.699> how

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
map across that surface and that's how

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.969 
map across that surface and that's how
you<00:04:12.909> can<00:04:13.090> make<00:04:13.560> materials<00:04:14.560> fit<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.739> little

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
you can make materials fit a little

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.759 
you can make materials fit a little
better<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:16.019> then<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.049> don't<00:04:17.259> want<00:04:17.409> the<00:04:17.500> finish

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
better and then I don't want the finish

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.110 
better and then I don't want the finish
to<00:04:17.889> be<00:04:17.979> super<00:04:18.250> glossy<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.849> I'm<00:04:18.909> gonna<00:04:19.000> make

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
to be super glossy so I'm gonna make

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.759 
to be super glossy so I'm gonna make
that<00:04:19.299> satin<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.019> don't<00:04:20.169> want<00:04:20.409> a<00:04:20.440> lot<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.650> the

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
that satin and I don't want a lot of the

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.920 
that satin and I don't want a lot of the
light<00:04:21.010> bouncing<00:04:21.729> off<00:04:21.849> of<00:04:22.000> there<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.300> I'm<00:04:22.810> also

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
light bouncing off of there and I'm also

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.400 
light bouncing off of there and I'm also
going<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.169> add<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.349> bump<00:04:23.710> map

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
going to add a bump map

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.860 
going to add a bump map
so<00:04:25.160> under<00:04:25.340> custom<00:04:25.760> map<00:04:25.940> under<00:04:26.150> bumps<00:04:26.600> gonna

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
so under custom map under bumps gonna

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.630 
so under custom map under bumps gonna
hit<00:04:26.990> none<00:04:27.200> click<00:04:28.010> on<00:04:28.160> bitmap<00:04:28.520> again<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:31.430> go

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
hit none click on bitmap again and go

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.170 
hit none click on bitmap again and go

stay flat pure white would be the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.810 
stay flat pure white would be the

and<00:04:49.490> high<00:04:49.580> bump<00:04:49.900> sighs<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:51.170> got<00:04:51.290> to<00:04:51.320> do<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.560> 3<00:04:51.770> by

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
and high bump sighs I got to do the 3 by

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.220 
and high bump sighs I got to do the 3 by
2<00:04:51.980> meters<00:04:52.460> again<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.060> add<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.300> offset<00:04:53.450> so<00:04:54.110> it

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
2 meters again and add the offset so it

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.110 
2 meters again and add the offset so it
matches<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.710> other<00:04:54.830> tile<00:04:55.220> because<00:04:55.670> this<00:04:55.880> tile

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
matches the other tile because this tile

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.150 
matches the other tile because this tile
is<00:04:56.270> basically<00:04:56.720> if<00:04:57.230> you<00:04:57.320> want<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.530> say<00:04:57.680> on<00:04:57.860> top

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
is basically if you want to say on top

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.430 
is basically if you want to say on top
of<00:04:58.400> or<00:04:58.730> in<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.030> same<00:04:59.330> location<00:04:59.930> as<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.110> other

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.900 
of or in the same location as the other
tie<00:05:00.950> ox<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.520> same<00:05:01.700> material<00:05:03.820> here<00:05:04.820> I'm

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
tie ox it is the same material here I'm

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.040 
tie ox it is the same material here I'm
just<00:05:04.970> going<00:05:05.120> to<00:05:05.210> double<00:05:05.540> click<00:05:05.570> on<00:05:05.930> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
just going to double click on the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.860 
just going to double click on the
material<00:05:06.140> slot<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:07.130> see<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:08.120> tile<00:05:08.390> pattern

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
material slot to see the tile pattern

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.600 
material slot to see the tile pattern
right<00:05:09.080> now<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.590> amount<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.920> bump<00:05:10.220> is<00:05:10.400> very

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
right now and the amount of bump is very

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.790 
right now and the amount of bump is very
small<00:05:11.060> we're<00:05:11.450> just<00:05:11.630> barely<00:05:11.900> able<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.380> see<00:05:12.680> it

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
small we're just barely able to see it

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.650 
small we're just barely able to see it
so<00:05:13.160> I<00:05:13.190> want<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.490> amount<00:05:13.850> to<00:05:13.970> be<00:05:14.090> higher<00:05:14.330> and

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
so I want the amount to be higher and

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.870 
so I want the amount to be higher and
again<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.080> value<00:05:15.470> you<00:05:15.560> have<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.830> work<00:05:15.980> with<00:05:16.190> I'm

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
again a value you have to work with I'm

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.300 
again a value you have to work with I'm
gonna<00:05:17.060> go<00:05:17.150> at<00:05:17.270> 0.7<00:05:18.020> not<00:05:18.440> real<00:05:18.620> noticeable<00:05:19.250> in

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
gonna go at 0.7 not real noticeable in

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.830 
gonna go at 0.7 not real noticeable in
the<00:05:19.340> image<00:05:19.640> here<00:05:20.030> but<00:05:20.120> as<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.420> work<00:05:20.600> on<00:05:20.690> that

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
the image here but as you work on that

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.060 
the image here but as you work on that
on<00:05:20.960> your<00:05:21.080> projects<00:05:21.560> you'll<00:05:21.680> see<00:05:21.830> quite<00:05:22.010> a

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
on your projects you'll see quite a

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.060 
on your projects you'll see quite a
difference<00:05:22.330> so<00:05:23.330> I'm<00:05:23.390> gonna<00:05:23.510> go<00:05:23.600> with<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:24.070> bump

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
difference so I'm gonna go with a bump

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.330 
difference so I'm gonna go with a bump
0.7<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.540> that<00:05:26.690> finishes<00:05:27.080> off<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.260> tile<00:05:27.650> on<00:05:27.980> my

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
0.7 and that finishes off the tile on my

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.110 
0.7 and that finishes off the tile on my
Terrace<00:05:29.890> now<00:05:30.890> I<00:05:30.920> want<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.220> add<00:05:31.400> a<00:05:31.430> custom<00:05:31.940> map

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
Terrace now I want to add a custom map

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.810 
Terrace now I want to add a custom map
to<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.690> pool<00:05:33.220> it's<00:05:34.220> also<00:05:34.370> going<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.640> be<00:05:34.790> a

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
to the pool it's also going to be a

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.530 
to the pool it's also going to be a
ceramic<00:05:36.370> tile<00:05:37.370> just<00:05:37.790> a<00:05:37.910> different<00:05:38.210> design

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
ceramic tile just a different design

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.540 
ceramic tile just a different design
different<00:05:38.960> JPEG<00:05:39.320> I'm<00:05:39.470> going<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:39.650> use<00:05:39.860> this

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
different JPEG I'm going to use this

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.910 
different JPEG I'm going to use this
object<00:05:40.790> is<00:05:41.060> also<00:05:41.360> an<00:05:41.480> editable<00:05:41.840> mesh<00:05:41.960> so<00:05:42.830> I'm

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
object is also an editable mesh so I'm

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.490 
object is also an editable mesh so I'm
going<00:05:43.070> to<00:05:43.130> do<00:05:43.280> a<00:05:43.310> new<00:05:43.790> material<00:05:44.210> in<00:05:44.540> my<00:05:45.200> slots

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.530 
going to do a new material in my slots
here<00:05:45.770> just<00:05:46.010> call<00:05:46.160> it<00:05:46.280> pool<00:05:46.520> tile<00:05:49.360> I'm<00:05:50.360> gonna

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
here just call it pool tile I'm gonna

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:58.029 
here just call it pool tile I'm gonna
use<00:05:50.810> a<00:05:50.840> ceramic<00:05:51.410> material<00:05:51.710> again

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.339 

and<00:05:58.639> again<00:05:59.089> my<00:05:59.270> reflectance<00:05:59.809> map<00:06:00.020> just<00:06:00.259> like

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
and again my reflectance map just like

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.799 
and again my reflectance map just like
before<00:06:00.619> I'm<00:06:01.099> gonna<00:06:01.159> go<00:06:01.430> out<00:06:01.639> cooking<00:06:02.419> bitmaps

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:02.809 
before I'm gonna go out cooking bitmaps

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:05.739 
before I'm gonna go out cooking bitmaps
I<00:06:03.020> can<00:06:03.139> put<00:06:03.229> a<00:06:03.259> custom<00:06:03.619> map<00:06:03.770> in<00:06:04.009> there<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:05.360> this

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:05.749 
I can put a custom map in there and this

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:07.689 
I can put a custom map in there and this
would<00:06:05.869> be<00:06:05.990> a<00:06:06.020> mosaic<00:06:06.830> so<00:06:07.369> it's<00:06:07.490> just<00:06:07.580> a

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
would be a mosaic so it's just a

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:15.219 
would be a mosaic so it's just a
different<00:06:08.029> JPEG<00:06:08.360> is<00:06:08.509> all<00:06:08.629> I'm<00:06:08.719> using<00:06:08.899> here<00:06:14.229> and

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
different JPEG is all I'm using here and

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.029 
different JPEG is all I'm using here and
real<00:06:15.529> world<00:06:15.740> scale<00:06:17.080> again<00:06:18.080> I<00:06:18.110> know<00:06:18.349> this<00:06:18.740> image

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
real world scale again I know this image

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.659 
real world scale again I know this image
represents<00:06:19.219> a<00:06:19.789> three<00:06:20.059> meter<00:06:20.270> by<00:06:20.479> 3<00:06:20.899> meter

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
represents a three meter by 3 meter

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.359 
represents a three meter by 3 meter
piece<00:06:22.669> of<00:06:22.879> tile<00:06:23.089> or<00:06:23.479> section<00:06:23.839> of<00:06:23.960> tile<00:06:24.279> so<00:06:25.279> I'm

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:25.369 
piece of tile or section of tile so I'm

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:27.339 
piece of tile or section of tile so I'm
going<00:06:25.490> to<00:06:25.550> use<00:06:25.669> that<00:06:25.879> and<00:06:26.059> change<00:06:26.389> the<00:06:26.689> setting

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
going to use that and change the setting

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.610 
going to use that and change the setting
there<00:06:28.300> swimming<00:06:29.300> pool<00:06:29.599> object<00:06:30.110> is<00:06:30.319> an

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
there swimming pool object is an

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.769 
there swimming pool object is an
editable<00:06:30.889> mesh<00:06:30.979> suck<00:06:31.819> in<00:06:31.999> does<00:06:32.210> that<00:06:32.389> mapping

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779 
editable mesh suck in does that mapping

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.320 
editable mesh suck in does that mapping
coordinates<00:06:33.080> so<00:06:33.409> I<00:06:33.469> have<00:06:33.559> to<00:06:33.680> add<00:06:33.800> a<00:06:34.219> UVW<00:06:34.789> map

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
coordinates so I have to add a UVW map

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.689 
coordinates so I have to add a UVW map
modifier<00:06:35.360> and<00:06:36.169> have<00:06:36.919> real-world<00:06:37.189> map<00:06:37.669> size

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
modifier and have real-world map size

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:40.929 
modifier and have real-world map size
turned<00:06:38.240> on<00:06:38.419> and<00:06:39.050> apply<00:06:39.740> that<00:06:39.770> and<00:06:40.460> I<00:06:40.639> can<00:06:40.789> see

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:40.939 
turned on and apply that and I can see

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:43.389 
turned on and apply that and I can see
in<00:06:41.029> the<00:06:41.120> viewport<00:06:41.569> now<00:06:42.199> the<00:06:42.259> base<00:06:42.649> of<00:06:42.979> the

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:43.399 
in the viewport now the base of the

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.399 
in the viewport now the base of the
object<00:06:43.819> worked<00:06:43.999> fine<00:06:44.330> but<00:06:44.599> the<00:06:44.809> tiles<00:06:45.169> on<00:06:45.289> the

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
object worked fine but the tiles on the

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.350 
object worked fine but the tiles on the
side<00:06:45.710> of<00:06:45.860> the<00:06:45.919> pool<00:06:46.129> you<00:06:46.580> can<00:06:46.699> see<00:06:46.879> our<00:06:46.969> stretch

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
side of the pool you can see our stretch

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.689 
side of the pool you can see our stretch
there<00:06:47.659> so<00:06:48.499> to<00:06:48.620> change<00:06:48.860> that<00:06:49.159> it's<00:06:49.370> just<00:06:49.610> the

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
there so to change that it's just the

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.549 
there so to change that it's just the
mapping<00:06:50.029> parameter<00:06:50.509> I<00:06:50.689> have<00:06:50.930> to<00:06:51.050> change<00:06:51.349> that

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:51.559 
mapping parameter I have to change that

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:55.689 
mapping parameter I have to change that
from<00:06:51.709> planar<00:06:52.099> to<00:06:52.459> box<00:06:52.959> then<00:06:53.959> the<00:06:54.009> surfaces<00:06:55.009> 3d

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:55.699 
from planar to box then the surfaces 3d

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:57.429 
from planar to box then the surfaces 3d
is<00:06:55.879> know<00:06:56.059> that<00:06:56.089> it's<00:06:56.449> 3d<00:06:56.749> and<00:06:56.930> it's<00:06:57.020> mapped<00:06:57.259> on

00:06:57.429 --> 00:06:57.439 
is know that it's 3d and it's mapped on

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:00.480 
is know that it's 3d and it's mapped on
each<00:06:57.559> side<00:06:57.800> and<00:06:58.149> that<00:06:59.149> finishes<00:06:59.569> up<00:06:59.899> the

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
each side and that finishes up the

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.379 
each side and that finishes up the
custom<00:07:01.490> maps<00:07:01.699> I'm<00:07:01.849> going<00:07:01.969> to<00:07:02.029> do<00:07:02.120> for<00:07:02.270> this

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:02.389 
custom maps I'm going to do for this

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.389 
custom maps I'm going to do for this
portion<00:07:02.839> and<00:07:03.649> I'm<00:07:03.770> just<00:07:03.889> going<00:07:04.039> to<00:07:04.129> render<00:07:04.279> out

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:04.399 
portion and I'm just going to render out

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:06.339 
portion and I'm just going to render out
that<00:07:04.819> side<00:07:05.209> of<00:07:05.389> it<00:07:05.449> so<00:07:05.509> we<00:07:05.749> can<00:07:05.779> see<00:07:06.050> that<00:07:06.199> those

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:06.349 
that side of it so we can see that those

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:09.369 
that side of it so we can see that those
materials<00:07:06.860> did<00:07:07.039> work<00:07:07.249> and<00:07:07.809> then<00:07:08.809> in<00:07:09.080> the<00:07:09.259> next

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:09.379 
materials did work and then in the next

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.019 
materials did work and then in the next
video<00:07:09.709> we're<00:07:09.979> gonna<00:07:10.069> do<00:07:10.309> some<00:07:10.490> more<00:07:10.610> custom

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:11.029 
video we're gonna do some more custom

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:13.719 
video we're gonna do some more custom
maps<00:07:11.240> and<00:07:11.569> do<00:07:12.469> some<00:07:12.680> other<00:07:12.889> material<00:07:13.399> property

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:13.729 
maps and do some other material property

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.059 
maps and do some other material property
settings
