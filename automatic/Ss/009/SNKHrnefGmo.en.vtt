could do a lot worse than the hand which
not<00:02:00.950> sure<00:02:01.130> that's<00:02:01.280> with<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.580> but<00:02:01.810> as<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
not sure that's with it but as the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.510 
not sure that's with it but as the
