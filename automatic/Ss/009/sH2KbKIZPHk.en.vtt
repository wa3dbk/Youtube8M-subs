 called moon dance or there was a fashion in 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.440
 then the cartoonists gave them 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.790

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.780
 mundane was invited to a party and this 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.670
 it brings us a flashback of the first 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.230
 episode of the whole series showing you 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.760
 the since all that was pony bill was the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 day when the world was invited to a party 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.090
 and that's why since then it became more 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.259
 antisocial that I the amount of 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.420
 continuity that there is in this floor is 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.069
 pretty awesome where you try 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 to speak again as a dancer for all 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.439
 the possible means 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.359
 even getting into his books 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.280
 there probably exists motorcycle you read 50 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.600
 shadows of grace to try to make that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.520
 be founded is giving the forgiveness 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.749
 old house key contains age 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.749
 He even invites you to dinner 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 77 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.290
 seeing that nothing works current 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.210
 decided to bring pink and to remove the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.040
 piece that mundane was organized and for 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.990
 bring her leaves a line of books sounds 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.060
 logical considering that the others assemble 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.290
 wood force moondance comes the party and 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.790
 all the different ones will start from that 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.300
 Celebration but world become the saga 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.300
 against the jce 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
 ah 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.160
 then it shows you how sorry you are 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.080
 is and shows him moondance the one that does not 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.460
 is alone bringing some acquaintances to 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.460
 SimÃ³n Dancer is reconciled on time 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.910
 if none of that did not happen hopefully but not 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.630
 world to be considered punctual and all 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.810
 they live happy 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.670
 I hope it's close in that episode was 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.440
 very good when mnp deals with issues of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.550
 real life this does not stand out anymore and in this 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.710
 case talks about a passing issue 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.270
 also followed in society and is a 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.280
 topic that I can also relate to 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.840
 experience but the 'floor is very good 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.430
 written found it seems to me a character 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.990
 interesting that gave him enough 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.760
 continuity to things that were shown in 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.400
 the first season and talking about 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.720
 continuity in conclusion this has been 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.580
 in the most prominent episodes up 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.050
 now in the season in my opinion and 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.610
 good with nothing more to say many 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.610
 thanks for watching and see you next 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.050

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.540
