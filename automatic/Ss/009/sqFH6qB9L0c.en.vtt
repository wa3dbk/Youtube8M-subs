 I'm making this video because it 's a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.400
 something that will happen to you 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.510
 if you start making bonsai it is 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.150
 inevitable 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.180

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.760
 is in any part of the world that does not 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.339
 have killed a plant everyone has already killed 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 a plant does not have as it were by carelessness 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.010
 sometimes it is not because of the bad guys 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.830
 the carelessness of an error 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.420
 Do you know how to do a lack of study? 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.340
 information that ends up killing the plant 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.930
 is that my father died and now responds to 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 you have two alternatives or 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 You hit the boat ahead and continue. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.770
 giving affection to other plants or 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.920
 You give up I'm saying this because 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 July 31 now 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 The most beautiful bonsai died that I had 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.909
 in my life but died in the mother is and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.780
 fuck people 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.929
 I was powerless to record from any 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.179
 team giving a lump in the throat here 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.109
 I already lost think the eight kilos more or 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:00.289
 less and one thing that my mother always 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:03.799
 You have to have strength, you can not stop. 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.090
 life does not stop, would that 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.140
 She taught me and I think I'm going to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.939
 you 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.069
 This plant that I lost will make some 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:16.010
 two months because I missed fertilization 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.739
 because it's mac donald also misses nobody is 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.079
 perfect in this world remember I told 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.360
 chemical fertilizer that is dangerous and 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.269
 so I put a small amount 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.900
 In this caliandra, this caliandra was 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.569
 beautiful take a look there I just 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.129
 losing the poet plant that I already had 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.579
 told you that I did not think 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.579
 was going to lose 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.269
 Motinha da silva, what am I going to do now? 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.489
 I will reuse this substrate or 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.109
 reuse this basin and I'll start 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.420
 a new plant 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.790
 I will not stop as soon as I do not go 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.400
 stop making video for you 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.950
 people do not like to die, what I do 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.609
 acquire species that will be easy to 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.239
 it is not easy to grow gold at 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:08.959
 Calandra I always dedicated myself to the 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.849
 people who were starting but at 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.489
 that I have studied 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.290
 she looks like a robust plant fan one 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.530
 strong plant but it is a plant 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.370
 so sensitive that I put half of the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.349
 normal fertilization that she died 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.400
 so what I say to you ficus 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.290
 10 very strong gold dig so far 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.190
 never have any 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.280
 if someone killed 11 leave it is because it is good 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.609
 dude its good and this is what i have to 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.660
 Talk to you, do not give up, do not give up. 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:47.930
 a bonsai and it's difficult forsyth 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.190
 You have to work hard. 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.770
 dedicate and do not focus on death 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.010
 I say this not only in the art of bonsai I 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.650
 I say this to life, do not focus on 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.380
 death death is a passage 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.940

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.310
