00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it's kind of easier to sleep inside

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.080

straight<00:02:23.730> up<00:02:26.240> now<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.630> lightweight

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
straight up now this is a lightweight

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.910 
straight up now this is a lightweight
nobody's<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.400> miss<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:30.690> way<00:02:30.960> so<00:02:31.380> you

don't have to put like maximal force
into<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.560> you're<00:02:34.620> going<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.830> back<00:02:35.160> yourself<00:02:35.340> in

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
into it you're going to back yourself in

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.880 
into it you're going to back yourself in
the<00:02:35.850> chin<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.810> get<00:02:36.960> carried<00:02:37.290> away<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.530> full

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
the chin if you get carried away in full

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.860 
the chin if you get carried away in full
a<00:02:38.100> hard<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.880> we're<00:02:39.000> looking<00:02:39.300> at<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.600> getting

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
a hard but we're looking at just getting

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.290 
a hard but we're looking at just getting
the<00:02:39.990> movement<00:02:40.500> correct<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:43.050> gluteus<00:02:43.620> maximus

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
the movement correct the gluteus maximus

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.380 
the movement correct the gluteus maximus
should<00:02:45.300> be<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.580> strongest<00:02:47.580> largest<00:02:48.090> muscle

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
should be the strongest largest muscle

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.180 
should be the strongest largest muscle
in<00:02:48.570> your<00:02:48.660> body<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.830> produce<00:02:50.010> more

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
in your body it's going to produce more

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.430 
in your body it's going to produce more
power<00:02:50.490> than<00:02:51.060> anything<00:02:51.480> else<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.900> he

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
power than anything else and he

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.110 
power than anything else and he
mentioned<00:02:53.070> getting<00:02:53.190> their<00:02:53.460> shoulders<00:02:53.790> over

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
mentioned getting their shoulders over

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.480 
mentioned getting their shoulders over
the<00:02:54.210> bar<00:02:54.390> if<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.780> start<00:02:55.050> here<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:56.160> are<00:02:56.310> now

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
the bar if you start here you are now

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.300 
the bar if you start here you are now
dependent<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.210> me<00:02:57.510> extension<00:02:58.140> versus<00:02:58.770> hip

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
dependent on me extension versus hip

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.729 
dependent on me extension versus hip
extension<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.120> just<00:03:00.360> lost<00:03:00.739> seventy

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
extension and you just lost seventy

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.320 
extension and you just lost seventy
percent<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:02.130> your<00:03:02.190> power<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.180> little

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
percent of your power and that little

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.840 
percent of your power and that little
distance<00:03:03.810> difference<00:03:04.350> being<00:03:04.500> here<00:03:04.890> versus

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
distance difference being here versus

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.780 
distance difference being here versus
here<00:03:06.510> at<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.870> beginning<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:08.580> we're<00:03:08.730> looking

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
here at the beginning so we're looking

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.760 
here at the beginning so we're looking
at<00:03:08.970> using<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.390> largest<00:03:09.840> muscle<00:03:10.140> as<00:03:10.200> possible

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
at using the largest muscle as possible

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.240 
at using the largest muscle as possible
versus<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.610> arms<00:03:12.650> with<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> efficient<00:03:14.130> way

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
versus the arms with the efficient way

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.160 
versus the arms with the efficient way
but<00:03:14.520> watch<00:03:14.670> this<00:03:14.970> heavy<00:03:15.239> guys<00:03:15.450> thinking<00:03:15.930> about

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
but watch this heavy guys thinking about

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.470 
but watch this heavy guys thinking about
just<00:03:16.440> kind<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.890> head<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> ceiling<00:03:18.150> just

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
just kind of head to the ceiling just

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.420 
just kind of head to the ceiling just
jumping<00:03:18.870> straight<00:03:19.140> up<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.590> lot<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.130> people<00:03:20.370> who

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
jumping straight up a lot of people who

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.610 
jumping straight up a lot of people who
think<00:03:20.459> like<00:03:20.670> bits<00:03:21.080> will<00:03:22.080> get<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.320> kind<00:03:22.530> of

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
think like bits will get this kind of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.530 
think like bits will get this kind of
catapult<00:03:23.160> action<00:03:23.520> well<00:03:24.090> if<00:03:24.180> I'm<00:03:24.270> going<00:03:24.480> with

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
catapult action well if I'm going with

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.050 
catapult action well if I'm going with
this<00:03:24.750> I'm<00:03:25.170> setting<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.620> bar<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:25.980> way<00:03:26.130> boo

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
this I'm setting the bar this way boo

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.180 
this I'm setting the bar this way boo
it's<00:03:27.360> just<00:03:27.540> all<00:03:27.989> these<00:03:28.140> problems<00:03:28.380> most

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
it's just all these problems most

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.710 
it's just all these problems most
efficient<00:03:29.640> shortest<00:03:30.269> distance<00:03:30.570> is<00:03:30.660> a

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
efficient shortest distance is a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.180 
efficient shortest distance is a
straight<00:03:30.930> line<00:03:31.110> straight<00:03:31.830> up<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.130> straight

straight line straight up and straight

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.460 
straight line straight up and straight
down<00:03:32.340> okay<00:03:33.150> might<00:03:33.840> never<00:03:33.989> go<00:03:34.050> back<00:03:34.260> arch

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
down okay might never go back arch

down okay might never go back arch
that's<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.800> big<00:03:34.950> extension<00:03:35.580> here<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.630> bar

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
that's a big extension here but that bar

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.110 
that's a big extension here but that bar

before it landed yeah you go out this
direction<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.599> arms<00:03:59.810> do<00:04:00.019> then

direction of that so the arms do then

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.830 
direction of that so the arms do then
you<00:04:00.440> watch<00:04:01.069> UCD<00:04:01.610> its<00:04:02.180> arm<00:04:02.330> is<00:04:02.450> bending<00:04:02.629> you're

you watch UCD its arm is bending you're

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.660 
you watch UCD its arm is bending you're
thinking<00:04:03.170> well<00:04:03.319> they're<00:04:04.069> using<00:04:04.280> their<00:04:04.370> arms
