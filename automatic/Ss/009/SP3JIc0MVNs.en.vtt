thing i think i was hoping to figure out
was<00:03:06.390> if<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:06.810> game<00:03:07.019> was<00:03:07.170> canon<00:03:07.680> or<00:03:07.799> not<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.250> if

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
was if this game was canon or not and if

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.360 
was if this game was canon or not and if
it<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.269> where<00:03:09.989> does<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.560> fit<00:03:10.890> within<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
