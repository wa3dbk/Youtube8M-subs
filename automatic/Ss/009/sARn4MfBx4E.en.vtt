00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.799
 puts and we find ourselves for a whole 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.410
 new tutorial so that this time I'm going 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.009
 show you how to open your 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.600
 nat type so for call of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.880
 to open so on xbox 360 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.810
 it's a 360 so you go on so 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.650
 your livebox 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.300
 finally your modem so for the aurenche 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.610
 and 192 points 168 takes 1.1 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 so after iphone in configuration 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 advanced network that there the password if 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.379
 you have not changed your parents too 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.530
 have not changed it's still tomorrow 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.610
 r- password is tomorrow so 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.760
 put off until tomorrow and not tomorrow 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.760
 recorded record so there his load 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 after helping you nate's not loose 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.960
 so then it's very simple so 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.360
 so you go into apps 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 services it makes you new to you 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.290
 so do xbox that to the offer by 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.450
 example call of duty 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:29.189
 this is after so you have to wear 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:33.360
 internal ports 3074 external port the same 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.880
 thing is going to be both and the ip address 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.740
 of your console so to know 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.430
 the ip address of your console is very 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.740
 easy so see her so you go 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.490
 in system settings network 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.579
 you have on your livebox configure 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.610
 the network is so there you saw there 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.820
 would have written ip ip address settings 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.850
 so for me so it's a sense what 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.159
 meaning 188 for sixty 168 years 1.12 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.840
 so as soon as you have the respect 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.910
 you put it where he wrote devices 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.459
 so me as I say already done I do not 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.799
 do not do them so this time you in 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.489
 so do a new one you actually 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.010
 of a new one so we have no job 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.580
 xbox this time we did not put an end 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.830
 80 external ports 80 men were in 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.299
 our 80 80 you put in tcp and there 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.790
 you give the ip address of your 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:43.580
 console so the ip address of the console 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.360
 me this is a point 12 and price 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.700
 open added 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.160
 so as soon as they did as soon as you 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:55.010
 did you do it right ? 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.390
 restart your xbox and your livebox 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.670
 so when you when you restart 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.040
 your xbox is first your bbox 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.750
 after the xbox 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.320
 so normally as soon as you have 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.440
 restart your xbox and your livebox 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.530
