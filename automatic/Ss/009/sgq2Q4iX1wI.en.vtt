you need now the rare one of this

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.709 
you need now the rare one of this
collection<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.870> rank<00:00:58.170> CPU<00:00:59.070> node<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.730> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
collection is the rank CPU node and I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
collection is the rank CPU node and I
seem<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.770> breaker<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.399> about<00:01:02.609> 4

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
seem to go in the breaker for about 4

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.109 
seem to go in the breaker for about 4
million<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.729> that's<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
million so it's like a like that's a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
million so it's like a like that's a
fair<00:01:06.330> bit<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.600> money<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.260> rich<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
fair bit of money but if you're rich you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
fair bit of money but if you're rich you
can<00:01:07.799> probably<00:01:08.070> afford<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.750> just

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
can probably afford it and you can just

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
can probably afford it and you can just
buy<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.040> rare<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
buy it but that's the rare one of the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.450 
buy it but that's the rare one of the
collection<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> bad<00:01:13.920> thing<00:01:14.280> about

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
collection and now the bad thing about

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.030 
collection and now the bad thing about
this<00:01:14.820> collection<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.439> actually

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this collection is that it is actually

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
this collection is that it is actually
spread<00:01:17.580> over<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.479> huge<00:01:18.990> area<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.770> map<00:01:19.950> um<00:01:20.220> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
spread over a huge area of the map um so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.399 
spread over a huge area of the map um so
you'll<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.659> where<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> UM<00:01:24.409> but

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
you'll see where I go to UM but

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590 
you'll see where I go to UM but
basically<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.759> area<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> want<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
basically the area that you want to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.230 
basically the area that you want to
search<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.640> basically<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> middle<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
search is basically the middle of the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
search is basically the middle of the
map<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.900> you'll<00:01:31.110> see<00:01:31.320> anyway<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> video

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
map but you'll see anyway in the video

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.030 
map but you'll see anyway in the video
and<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.110> hope<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.560> video<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> helpful

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and so I hope this video is helpful

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:55.969 
and so I hope this video is helpful
