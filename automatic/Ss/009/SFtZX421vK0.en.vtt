00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.800
 What are you telling me is that they are meshes in your arms? 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:13.720
 [music] 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.260
 This week we will review sports myths ... FOR MAN! 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
 It's true like a colony, HOW A MAN! 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.100
 The truth is that this is ... a strange outline. 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.590
 It's a human being, it's like a manga, since it's only here until here. 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:34.010
 And I think these are high tech mittens, durability and comfort for outdoor exercise. 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.910
 Well, I think the idea behind this is that people burn their arms 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.820
 Or they get darker, so wear these sleeves 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.560
 under her t-shirts, 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.360
 what confuses me, because if you wanted long sleeve 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.780
 Why not buy a long sleeve shirt? 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 But everyone carries it! Truly they are popular. 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.380
 It's not like a weird thing. And they come to the subway, 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.700
 As people go with carts around there and sell them 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.490
 for about 1000 won or so. 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.410
 And you see a lot of people on the subway by buying them too 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.810
 If! It's like a very hot comfort. 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.620
 What I really like about this is that if you look behind 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.220
 There are a lot of images of people doing sports 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.050
 But nobody wears the bracelets! 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.980
 Mites Simon [Mites! Forgive!] 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.350
 You see someone running, but you only see their legs. 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.570
 Do not put that in your legs! 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.780
 You see someone playing tennis, but it does not take mites! 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.520
 There is a full silhouette man fishing! 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.020
 It's like you can not even pay for your models to put them in! 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.230
 I really like the diagram in the back, 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.830
 Because, shoot up on one side, shoot up on the other side 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.430
 That means? [circulation?] Circulation? 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.130
 It looks like "Indian rug burn" (forgiveness, I mean burned) that they give you. 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.050
 Remember Indian rug burn? RRRRR! 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.960
 Ow, it's supposed you do not have to! [Oh sorry!] 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.370
 Well, let's get this right, then. 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.270
 Perfect, since this is for man [I also want one!] 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.660
 But then why did not you get one for a woman? 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.850
 There was one for a woman but I ... 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.980
 Now what I want to know is why there are one for man and another for women? 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.090
 Is it that, so different are the arms of women of men? 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.810
 It's like they have a woman's arms or something 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.190
 and why is there a different way? 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.620
 Because if that were so, it would be great! 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.620
 Tetabraços. TETABRAÇOS! 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.210
 Okay, let's try them [vale] 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.440
 Here we go. He is quite caught [adjusted] 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.830
 I really feel like an anime character. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.850
 You know how the manga and anime characters wear those ridiculous dresses 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.660
 What do they have, what are the armpits in the open? 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.860
 And they go in the way "I will fight for life, because that's what I can do!" 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.880
 [Martina mimics out of dubbing. He is really articulating "But I also like elephants!"] 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.700
 Do you know what I'm talking about? 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.420
 SHOYUKEN! 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.990
 In fact, one feels cool. 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.020
 Yes it feels great, yes! 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.710
 I hate having to say that, I'm sorry 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.610
 VALE AGITA EL BRAÇ towards this side. How do you feel? 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.900
 Now shake it to the other side. 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.650
 Oh my goodness! This is so strange! 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.980
 In fact, this keeps your arm cold. 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.670
 I do not know why. I feel as if I had a cold gel on my arm. 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.290
 Okay, do you know what? I was totally wrong about that. 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.400
 If we could simply wander in public waving their arms like this 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.130
 And all the Koreans at home will be like "Already are these foreigners again!" 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.710
 and we're like, walking down the street. 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.420
 Do the Seungri dance. 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.650
 OH OH OH OH! OH OH OH 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.130
 Maybe he was refreshing his arm. [but I did not have one] Can I put the other? 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.830
 I want a double refreshment effect. 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.450
 OH GOD! I know what he reminds me of! It reminds me of, like an artistic skater dress 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.260
 Do you know that they carry how, the top with sequins, 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.950
 and then how, that it does not stick, 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.180
 Oh, the hard nylon for the whole body? 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.020
 But do not stick to the hoop, have those sleeves 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.520
 Very long ones that reach the fingers and wear scarves that waver around there. 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.240
 If you were an art skater you would dance "Love Song" by Rain 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.030
 And it would be like, on the skating rink as NANUN OTTOKAY! 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.850
 You took the shirt NEE NEE NEE NEE NEE! 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.160
 Because it would give you 10 out of 10 if you saw it. 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.260
 GONG! 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.100
 It's the draw time [OH YES!] 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.410
 Yes, we have reviewed 4 WTFs. We made the epic cup Twonkle Twonkle, 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.850
 Double-eyelid tape, Ddung products, 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.850
 the perfume as well as the cream, and now 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.860
 the mites of man. HOW A MAN! 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.160
 Yes, forgive Namja means man. 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.770
 So to win this time all you have to do is invent your own Twonkle Twonkle bresson song! 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.290
 TWONKLE TWONKLE LITTLE STAR! 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.980
 and then do the rest. 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.700
 you do not have to sing it with Viking accent if you want, 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.410
 all you have to do is leave it to the comments on our YouTube page, 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.810
 or on our eatyourkimchi page. 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.530
 And we will choose the best poem, more fun, great and creative 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.330
 and we will send you the WTF package. 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.840
 Including the coveted Twonkle Twonkle Extra Cup. 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 Correct Did you know that in fact we found more things Twonkle Twonkle? 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.670
 We found Twonkle Twonkle "Look ..."! 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.580
 True Twonkle Twonkle what? 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.180
 Mir-garlic 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.570
 Mirrors 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.090
 I am going 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.090
 GONG!
