00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.970
 percent employees teach how the cuckoo is solved 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.260
 two protocol 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.369
 the text is 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.419
 one of the 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.609
 simpler bridges like 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.759
 you can imagine and really do not need any tutor and andy 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.749
 no explanation because they resolve to be sedesol 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.749
 but to the two forms I would like to comment a couple of details 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.140
 for example 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.599
 certainly not strange 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.710
 the survey yes 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.990
 this movement called him rr de rajoy 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.680
 and there we would have back 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.540
 where yes this will be gay 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.540
 and this is terrible 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.270
 then how is this level solved I put you then you take it 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.610
 in any position for example we can like this 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.830
 and we repeat movements 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.160
 a sequence of rpta movements suddenly reverts until it resolves 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.320
 I must start with the reunion is approved for example sell to run 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 bush r 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.320
 r 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.470
 and it would be solved 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.470
 but it may have started by 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.170
 strap on the power that does not 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.570
 then ni and m 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.300
 my experience and why the insistent why does this happen 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.760
 they have lent us 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 as well as the pulse wins among others so for example 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 I'm not going to present by Pedro Santos 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.070
 it is not static without rest 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.320
 and it would be solved 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.360
 why 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.420
 it does not matter how we do the cube because mengual 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.270
 start being able to start with d because the pp has consequences of form percent 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.430
 continue to lose green 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.020
 it was finished solving ap 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.800
 Well that's what you want what I want to say 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.630
 guayana already knows and pro 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.030
 I say it anyway 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.880
 this day the technician only has six states 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.490
 there are only six forms this course six poems are presented one of them is 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.489
 is 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.269
 resolved 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.580
 the 25 more 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.629
 states that are convicted prisoners 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.200
 the quirón hospital diagram for martha roncería excel summer 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.089
 What can I say 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.089
 he added that for months tóth 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.859
 for example who was determined 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.919
 and finally these heartless 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.279
 yes they have not solved and I do 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:41.059
 because it is not conservative but governor of the state is ordained r others see with 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.960
 other troops 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.789
 provincial lourdes 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.849
 then we formosa as straw we brought from a sovereign state that can 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 be any of these five 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.649
 for example let's suppose that it is because our state 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:56.019
 so if I do by then r 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.629
 I already ruled 22 agüerri I will go dylan solved but pockets started by 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:03.979
 depor b 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:09.159
 I would do the interpreter there are four movements instead of two 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.179
 but it would also be solved 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:16.549
 no matter how he loses if you see here he could do it and return everything 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.039
 resolved if this sequence 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:24.369
 obviously there is never going to be an admiration because rr twice 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:28.269
 is to see again with what we are not critical then we want to lose 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.549
 then we have to lose 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.760
 note that rr eye 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.379
 dd 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.379
 so I thought that's what we need 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.669
 and the longest algorithm that we will have to use 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.439
 to return everything resolved 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.040
 this cycling excellent messy state that is minor these 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.049
 movements 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.049
 debating mosquera btr to try backwards 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:56.519
 oaks in this state there are many movements in which we would be 2 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.769
 4 if we wanted Peruvian 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.769
 but yes that the shortest path towards which here one 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.599
 in total six states went up this Thursday 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.779
 ee 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.479
 the messy state 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.479
 to say it in a way that is further away than it is resolved 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.090
 is dear in three movements 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.900
 at times the breaks the greco prd and pt transparent 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.479
 I do not know if they gave me everything they had to keep creating 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.939
 then for example 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.599
 we imagine that of the 104 of the bacteria and 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.150
 this slowed down 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.610
 I have done erc altogether they are viviana expensive 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.110
 here that implies quincy that it would revolve 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.879
 but internet of entertainment r wwe to see what you're stopping 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.789
 2 between test tubes etc 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.099
 r 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.139
 r 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.419
 and we go back to the state 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.020
 well I hope the credit was from the deceased help 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.629
 they will not pretend little either way, not only because it is quite simple but 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:04.449
 rather 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.039
 der the connection between states and returned to memphis and different 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.060
 and that by this society solberg and moving it randomly 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.339
 forever if it ends up solving 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.479
 Well, I do not expect you to be prevented from helping and the others do not 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:18.409
