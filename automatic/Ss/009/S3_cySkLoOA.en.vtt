00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.950
 new video here from galaxy and today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.680
 I would like to have a late hour with you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 a small theme day we do so 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.490
 let's grab a bit 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.500
 I will be the topic already at the title 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.299
 have read and that's about how 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.640
 So Android updates are always first too 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.619
 come late or like some cell phones 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.390
 generally no update at all 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.369
 get and I wish you on each 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.369
 a lot of fun with this video 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.380
 many of you will wonder 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.149
 surely have already made like that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 damn it gets my cellphone 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.469
 just my phone no update or why 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.660
 I get my update so late though 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.610
 android has been out for so long or 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 Android app has been out for so long and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.930
 yes I have the question myself too 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 often asked and ultimately 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.090
 it is simply the system s.der 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.980
 android system and if you do that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 for example, with ios comparison there 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.750
 it is very simple there is only the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.789
 iphones and apple just makes an update 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 out there and it will be on all iphones 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.660
 it is still missing a bit 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.850
 adapted to the respective hardware of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.799
 the iphones of iphone 5 or iphone 6 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.840
 and then this has then comes the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.369
 comes out still for ipads out 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 and that's all relative 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.070
 uniform because of that it is easy for 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 apple a central operating system too 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.990
 and then almost actually 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.970
 unchanged on each device 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 and at android it just is not there 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.710
 There are thousands of manufacturers and everyone 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.590
 Manufacturer has another phone and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.240
 other hardware and that is actually 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.619
 again not necessarily the times 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.240
 of course you could do it worse 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.850
 the hardware must be adapted to be 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 I do not think the hardest 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.880
 but the biggest problem is belief 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.100
 me that everyone stops that everyone 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.649
 manufacturer once again his own 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.470
 you have to cook something sweet and you see 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.229
 that at samsung htc and and do that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 all your own user interface that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.630
 is it something like a lover so the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.280
 Install it at the factory 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.840
 your device for example at samsung 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.450
 That's the whole touchwiz that is 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.540
 the touchwiz interface or htc 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.489
 is called the htc sense and that's just 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.590
 surfaces again on the android 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.300
 system what original actually from 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.410
 Google is still shipping 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 be installed 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.940
 so that the user makes a difference 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.310
 gets along to other phones with forms 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.230
 htc but that looks great or something is 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 at least the plan at touchwiz finds 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.160
 that is partly not so good 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.340
 you have to say so 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.260
 and that's why it comes to that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.420
 We have many different devices 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.430
 and these then as still a 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.130
 have additional software on it that is 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.470
 if now at the s5 for example a 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.290
 update should come then samsung has that 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.930
 update what is produced by google 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.250
 or edited he gets 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.240
 samsung and that must first 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.660
 to adjust 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.580
 which means that we need to adapt to 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.410
 that touchwiz on the 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.840
 touchwiz surface that means you have to 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.490
 your touchwiz surface accordingly 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.530
 sometimes cover it up again 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.500
 compatible with the new version of 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.670
 google is and then you have to 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.290
 put together and then you can get out of it 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.370
 first update do you have to stop 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.540
 everything will be tested again if it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.340
 everything really works for us too 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.900
 of course a big disgrace for samsung 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.640
 that measures the check and thus 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.459
 draw weeks and months 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.020
 pass by and go into the country 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.790
 the user actually no update 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.090
 will probably get out for a long time 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.500
 So theoretically and yes there comes 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.180
 the bigger problem i think 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.550
 This is not actually in 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.890
 is the interest of the manufacturers 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.450
 to provide updates 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.670
 You also notice that quite often 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.550
 smaller manufacturers if one now to 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.530
 Example which china has cell phones or 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.870
 Smaller companies often do that 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.150
 No updates because that's because of that 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.830
 do not want to lift because of course how 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.690
 Everybody had this extra 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.050
 software or most of the nexus 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.880
 row, for example, has no additional 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.980
 surface or motorola is too 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.850
 I say relatively thin 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.900
 they do not have a great new one either 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.970
 user interface but otherwise has 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.010
 almost every manufacturer is his 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.570
 surface on it and that means if it is 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.580
 always new update must come 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.870
 always staff and developers 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.120
 to provide for it 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.950
 that you just adapt the software for 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.840
 her device and then again new update 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.880
 of course that costs money 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.830
 and of course, people have that 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.780
 Of course, there is no company in itself 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.120
 income thereby because that one 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.710
 update comes out is generally rather no 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.060
 smartphone is more sold and the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.520
 manufacturers just deserve theirs 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.590
 Money by owning smartphones 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.810
 that means it only sounds good on the sell 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.610
 At the beginning the smartphone is bought and 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.110
 most people are not careful 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.550
 if there will be many updates 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.080
 and most of the time, of course, it's bad 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.180
 predictable how many updates too 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.410
 will come 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.340
 This can be tended to again 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.650
 sum up 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.259
 so all is due to the problem-if 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.360
 many different phones from 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.520
 many different manufacturers 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.900
 all different hardware have where that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.490
 of course adapted to it first 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.210
 must be and then we have that 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.139
 problem with original software and 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.570
 user interfaces that is google 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.759
 developed original shall we say 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.560
 android m send that out and then have to 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.599
 every manufacturer nevertheless one 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.430
 user's own user interface 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.169
 uses that because user own 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.270
 user interface he then needs to use 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.199
 again, the whole thing again 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.270
 adapt to the update that is so 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.610
 normal step that is when you do that 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.560
 so come together then still has 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.289
 to that all that easy money for the 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.840
 manufacturer costs and not much more 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.400
 Bringing value to them means that they laugh 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.560
 Not many people on the updates and 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.970
 therefore also buy no smartphones 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.409
 more if you hear there is also one 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.039
 update because I buy the phone 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.900
 from that 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.550
 that's probably more rarely the 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.380
 maybe there is another case 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.800
 but a few are more likely to roam 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.590
 Not 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.449
 and yes that's the problem in general 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.449
 it can of course also be a 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.969
 derive further thought and 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.780
 Although what do I buy now for me 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.789
 smartphone 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.930
 and of course that is so now 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:07.020
 tends to be smartphones with one in it 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.750
 can use with any new mart 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.590
 Phones do not have a new user interface 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.900
 use 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.699
 which are of course the advantage because 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.639
 There the manufacturers are not great 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.750
 have to spend effort to stop that 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.580
 update out because they do that 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.570
 then just have to adapt to the device 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.789
 but not another one 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.349
 recreate user interface 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.580
 would have user interface is really a 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.060
 bad word that I have today so often 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.289
 said but good and of course 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.689
 Also a user interface I want 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.979
 do not do that bad now so new 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:37.259
 Of course, the surface also has it 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.119
 advantages especially for samsung there is 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.529
 countless new features which then 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:42.179
 still to be inserted 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.099
 this does not inform the normal android 

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:45.569
 there you have to, of course , then for yourself 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.429
 you would like to decide this 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.169
 features which are there purely pumped 

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:51.209
 want you the way that looks as 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.189
 or say hey I do without it 

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:54.989
 and it's more important to me 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:56.699
 Updates get that's the thought 

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:58.739
 which derives from it so 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.779
 when you buy a phone soon 

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:03.209
 Want to think you are important to you 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:05.039
 that the surface of the android 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:07.379
 operating system is that many 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.199
 features still in addition or has 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:10.919
 that they are just more continuous 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.149
 is updated and accordingly 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:13.739
 you should call for a mobile phone 

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:15.629
 decide what either a cool one 

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:18.119
 user interface htc sense or 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:19.800
 touchwiz or if you just like it 

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:24.029
 renounce and say hey where nexus me
