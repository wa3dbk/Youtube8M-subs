so once again you only pay a dollar 50

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.410 
so once again you only pay a dollar 50
so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.670> gotta<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.060> into

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so you gotta take that into

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.499 
so you gotta take that into
consideration<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:19.289> so<00:01:19.969> it's<00:01:20.969> stacked<00:01:21.390> with

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
consideration is so it's stacked with

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
consideration is so it's stacked with
condiments<00:01:22.759> but<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.890> passes<00:01:26.039> a<00:01:26.310> at

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
condiments but you see if it passes a at
