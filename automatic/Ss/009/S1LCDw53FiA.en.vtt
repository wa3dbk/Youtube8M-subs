and then of course you know it's also

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.530 
and then of course you know it's also
good<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.950> having<00:01:14.250> more<00:01:14.490> controllers<00:01:15.360> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
good for just having more controllers so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.090 
good for just having more controllers so
that<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:15.870> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.320> more<00:01:16.830> players

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
controllers and the ps2 controller acts

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.649 
controllers and the ps2 controller acts
exactly<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> same<00:01:22.260> I<00:01:22.620> note<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:24.060> has<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
exactly the same I note that this has to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.750 
exactly the same I note that this has to
be<00:01:24.960> hooked<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.800> to<00:01:25.860> system<00:01:26.550> with<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
is turned on otherwise it does not

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.940 
is turned on otherwise it does not

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
register you cannot just randomly hook

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.680 
register you cannot just randomly hook
up<00:01:32.100> another<00:01:32.310> controller<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.330> it<00:01:33.479> does<00:01:33.659> not

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
up another controller to it it does not

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.830 
up another controller to it it does not
work<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.380> way

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
work that way

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.140 
work that way
there's<00:01:37.229> no<00:01:37.380> discs<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.950> anything<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
there's no discs or anything for this it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.060 
there's no discs or anything for this it
just<00:01:39.180> works<00:01:39.570> perfectly<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:41.700> same<00:01:42.560> now<00:01:43.560> I'll

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
just works perfectly the same now I'll

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.990 
just works perfectly the same now I'll
show<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.850> does<00:01:45.120> work<00:01:45.409> say<00:01:47.000> Deadpool

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
show that this does work say Deadpool

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.550 
show that this does work say Deadpool
and<00:01:49.430> then<00:01:50.430> left<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.940> start<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.960> some<00:01:52.380> odd

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and then left is start for some odd

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
and then left is start for some odd
reason<00:01:52.680> they'd<00:01:53.190> switch<00:01:53.700> around<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.119> buttons

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
reason they'd switch around the buttons

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
reason they'd switch around the buttons
and<00:01:55.260> I'll<00:01:55.530> show<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.310> ps2
