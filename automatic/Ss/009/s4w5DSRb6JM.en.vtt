 one story two alternative 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.580
 reality as you probably remember 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.950
 Warcraft story began with the invasion 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.520
 orcish hordes to azerot and warlords of 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.559

 building a dark portal and prepare 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.950
 from rush to Azeroth to better 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.350
 imagine the scale of the threat 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.869
 imagine the Tatar-Mongol yoke 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.649
 whom you gave chemical weapons and 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.649
 nuclear bomb 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.649
 in the morning 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.960
 the reason for going back is incredible 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.689
 successful this year warcraft series 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.360
 turned 20 years and a year later 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.640
 film about the events of the very first game and 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.700
 new addition not only plays on 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.920
 nostalgia fans but also lays the base 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.700
 for those who do not know why everything 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.100
 started off 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.159
 well, new stories followed and 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.090
 new game mechanics in mist of 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.189
 pandaria 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.229
 you had a small farm where you 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.390
 grew radish and tried 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.390
 maintain friendly relations with 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.880
 neighbors here you are responsible for the whole 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.750
 city for its industrial and military 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.420
 activity 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.510
 you give your subordinates an assignment 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.090
 ugrami fight for honor and money 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.510
 or let's say grow herbs for potions 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.420
 the garden 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.030
 you decide what to build in the garrison 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.880
 was it worth or is there a jewelry boutique 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.780
 the city grows and develops with you 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.760
 wooden buildings are replaced by stone 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.590
 nearby mine gets deeper a 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.410
 ore veins are richer 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.200
 you are settled new allies and old 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.420
 familiar even your faithful doggie sperm and 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.670
 task for your wards 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.040
 one of the main incentives daily 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.170
 return to the game the garrison becomes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.859
 so self-sufficient base for 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.049
 operations 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:54.299
 that you simply don't want to get out of it 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:58.359
 here and ore and grass and pru for fishing 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:02.160
 banker auction everything you need can even 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.160
 build an arena for pvp 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.160
 however, before you get involved 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.770
 garrison is to pass the story 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.959
 in relation to filing performance she 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.880
 perhaps the best in the history of the world 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.280
 warcraft most assignments 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.770
 arranged correctly and with meaning 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.320
 they flow smoothly into one another 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.720
 it seems like the writers are leading by the hand 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.870
 you on an amusement park skipping out 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.540
 the queues for each are all united by a common 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.170
 the subject of the research of draenor is the search for new 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.060
 allies disclosing the weak points of the enemy 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.430
 preparation for the final battle here on 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.040
 every step is reminded of the universal enemies 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.470
 and in full involve in what is happening 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.870
 every little bit important event 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.450
 accompanied by a full-fledged spectacular 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.370
 roller and that the head was spinning 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.190
 playing regularly adds new ones 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.470
 buildings and tasks in the garrison prompting 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.560
 take breaks and go back home 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.200
 the main feeling of both the plot and 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.730
 games upon reaching level 100 world of 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.730
 warcraft matured 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.660
 not just loop rudiments here at everything 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.400
 it makes sense 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.830
 each element has its own role 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.320
 some minor accident on 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.200
 verification is often thought out 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.590
 part of the gameplay reward for your 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.040
 the enthusiasm and curiosity of the texts are almost 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.680
 lost jokes and humor and references 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.140
 pop culture has become much more subtle 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.780
 for very rare but accurate 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.540
 Except even central women 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.490
 characters are no longer walking around 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.030
 half-dressed as chris metzen said 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.280
 close 2014 my daughter was always in 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.680
 delighted with the dragons but looking 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.080
 the ending of the cataclysm took an interest 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.410
 why are they all human 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.620
 half naked and in bathing suits and I could not find 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.620
 with the answer 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.270
 that 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:25.629
 the local visual range is unambiguous 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.520
 the triumph of designers and art director of over 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:30.039
 the limitations of the ancient engine 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.470
 in warlords of draenor for the first time 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.520
 add-ons history did not add new ones 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.889
 classes and races 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.129
 but pulled up the existing models 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.900
 heroes to modern standards 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:43.090
 diversifies facial expressions and traced 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.129
 normal hands with fingers 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.860
 with this character magically 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:50.530
 remained recognizable hellish peninsula 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.789
 the flame became the Tanaan jungle 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.610
 zangartop 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.830
 for Angarsk sea grant remained on 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.440
 grandee and at any time you can 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.590
 see how it was and how it became and 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.110
 make sure that only the best space has become 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.630
 over the ridge of ice fire canyons and 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.469
 jungle mountains grundo grand pique 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.819
 Arak is all incredibly beautiful 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:15.669
 advertised opportunity instantly 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.460
 raise to level 90 one of the heroes and 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.690
 immediately send it to 30 as it turned out 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.449
 great idea 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.819
 blizzard allowed to overcome almost all 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.370
 what prevented return to the game for those who 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.440
 threw it a few additions back 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.289
 or join the passage of the new 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.599
 novice content even professions from now on 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.750
 you can pump from scratch on resources 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:39.819
 new world and quite importantly 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.250
 blizzard brought to mind the season 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:45.130
 most of the old players are gone 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.770
 opportunities to kill for the raid for 5-6 hours 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.690
 a day but with a garrison present 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.120
 structure quests and convenient 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.639
 group search tools 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.279
 quietly go into the game every day on 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:01.560
 half an hour without sacrificing important things 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:01.560
 but not depriving myself of pleasure 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.060
 hide and seek 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.409
 hail 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.490
 weigh the supplement for now 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.220
 it cannot be developed yet 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.740
 fewer years waiting for us a few large 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.380
 content patches will finally open 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.600
 gateway nano jungle history 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.430
 having interrupted she will get mid 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.070
 raids development will appear 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.380
 the remaining models will be updated from 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.080
 vanilla world of warcraft left 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.330
 already something warlords of draenor replaced 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.370
 even character models of ten 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.889
 prescription with them all disappeared 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.680
 roughness and roughness original 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:52.650
 it remains only what it is doing to this day 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.220
 one of the best if not the best game 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.220
 kind of
