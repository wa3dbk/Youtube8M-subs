00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
also gonna make my circle size very

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.500 
also gonna make my circle size very
small<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.620> I'm<00:02:20.489> gonna<00:02:20.670> bring<00:02:20.909> my<00:02:20.969> opacity

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
small and I'm gonna bring my opacity

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.470 
small and I'm gonna bring my opacity
down<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.469> about<00:02:23.129> halfway<00:02:23.370> here<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.239> like<00:02:24.390> I

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
down to about halfway here so like I

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.819 
down to about halfway here so like I
said<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.719> do<00:02:24.870> have<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.140> respring<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.739> these

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
said you do have to respring for these

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.229 
said you do have to respring for these
changes<00:02:26.189> to<00:02:26.310> take<00:02:26.430> effect<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.969> I'm<00:02:27.030> gonna<00:02:27.150> go

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
changes to take effect so I'm gonna go

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.869 
changes to take effect so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:27.329> and<00:02:27.420> respring<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.530> here<00:02:29.519> we<00:02:29.670> are

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
ahead and respring now and here we are

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.270 
ahead and respring now and here we are
so<00:02:30.209> my<00:02:30.359> circle<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:31.049> is<00:02:31.079> much<00:02:31.739> much<00:02:32.010> smaller

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
so my circle here is much much smaller

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.550 
so my circle here is much much smaller
than<00:02:32.459> originally<00:02:33.090> was<00:02:33.269> in<00:02:33.540> addition<00:02:34.109> to<00:02:34.439> it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
than originally was in addition to it

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.309 
than originally was in addition to it
being<00:02:34.709> smaller<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.700> icons<00:02:36.390> are<00:02:36.569> also<00:02:36.720> dimmer

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
being smaller the icons are also dimmer

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.220 
being smaller the icons are also dimmer
so<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.129> cannot<00:02:38.700> see<00:02:38.970> them<00:02:39.180> as<00:02:39.329> well<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
so you cannot see them as well as you

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.819 
so you cannot see them as well as you
could<00:02:40.769> before<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:43.019> really<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.530> for

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
could before so that's really it for

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.699 
could before so that's really it for
jelly<00:02:44.189> lock<00:02:44.430> 7<00:02:44.909> like<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.689> said<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.109> is<00:02:46.290> free<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
jelly lock 7 like I said it is free I

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.619 
jelly lock 7 like I said it is free I
don't<00:02:46.889> know<00:02:47.099> if<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.310> said<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.549> actually<00:02:48.060> but

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
don't know if I said it actually but

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.390 
don't know if I said it actually but
that<00:02:48.840> does<00:02:49.049> sum<00:02:49.319> everything<00:02:49.650> up<00:02:49.859> hopefully

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that does sum everything up hopefully

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.399 
that does sum everything up hopefully
