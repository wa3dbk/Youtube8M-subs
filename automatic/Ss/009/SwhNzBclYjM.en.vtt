00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.012
 Hello! 

00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:12.064
 The task before us is to find the digit weight of the digit 3 in the number 4.356. 

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:15.064
 The more you solve practical problems on this topic, 

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:18.007
 the faster you learn to deal with them. 

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:22.012
 However, whenever I encounter such tasks, 

00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:28.007
 I prefer to describe in detail what the number in front of me really is. 

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:33.079
 Now the number 4.356 is in front of me, so I'll write it in detail, 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.092
 with all the numbers I will write in different colors. 

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:45.071
 So, 4.356 is equal ... And let's just think about 

00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:48.088
 as I just said this number. 

00:00:48.088 --> 00:01:00.076
 It is equal to 4 thousand plus 300, plus 50 and plus 6. 

00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:04.043
 It would be possible to find the answer to the problem, based solely on the fact 

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:10.092
 as we say this number: four thousand three hundred fifty six. 

00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:14.035
 And you can argue in another way: this number means 

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:21.040
 4 thousand plus 3 hundreds (and you can say “three hundred”), 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.051
 plus ... 50 can be represented as 5 dozen, which means 

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:34.084
 plus 5 dozen plus 6, and instead of "6" you can say "6 units." 

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:41.003
 And if you go back to the original number 4.356, then this is the same 

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:53.043
 which is 4 thousand, 3 hundreds, 5 dozen and 6 units. 

00:01:53.043 --> 00:01:57.064
 So, when asked what is the weight of the digit digits 3 

00:01:57.064 --> 00:02:02.043
 in the number 4.356 (i.e. we are interested in this three), 

00:02:02.043 --> 00:02:06.047
 then we see that this figure is in the rank of hundreds. 

00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:10.015
 If instead of 3 ex there were 4, then there would be 4 hundreds, 

00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:13.000
 if there were 5 instead of 3-ex, then 5 hundred. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.056
 This number is the third on the right: this is the level of units, 

00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:21.024
 and it costs 6 units; further - 5 dozen and 3 hundreds. 

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:26.071
 Hence, the answer to the problem: the number 3 is in the hundreds. 

00:02:26.071 --> 99:59:59.000
 Well, that's all for today. See you at the next lesson!
