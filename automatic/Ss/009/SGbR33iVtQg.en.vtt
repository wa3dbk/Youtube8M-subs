mousse which I have had for about two

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.319 
mousse which I have had for about two
weeks<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> I've<00:00:50.160> used<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.910> three

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
weeks now and I've used it like three

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.439 
weeks now and I've used it like three
times<00:00:51.710> when<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.829> comes<00:00:53.070> out<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
little bit of color immediately so it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.849 
little bit of color immediately so it
makes<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.539> easy<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.079> apply<00:00:58.320> because
