00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
had this for two years as I said before

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.459 
had this for two years as I said before
and<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:48.000> definitely<00:00:48.360> worth<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.780> money<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and it's definitely worth the money and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.400 
and it's definitely worth the money and
if<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.860> take<00:00:50.190> care<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:51.140> it's<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.289> an

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
if you take care of it it's like an

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
if you take care of it it's like an
investment<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.340> take<00:00:53.550> care<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
investment if you take care of it and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
investment if you take care of it and
over<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.539> long<00:00:54.719> term<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.590> gonna<00:00:55.770> work<00:00:55.920> out

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
over the long term it's gonna work out

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
over the long term it's gonna work out
great<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.699> that's<00:00:57.449> what's<00:00:57.629> happening<00:00:57.870> with

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
great and that's what's happening with

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
great and that's what's happening with
this<00:00:58.140> glove<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.879> break-in<00:01:00.270> period<00:01:02.090> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
this glove so the break-in period you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.539 
this glove so the break-in period you
can<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> catch<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.040> probably

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
can if you catch a lot with it probably

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
can if you catch a lot with it probably
do<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.820> about<00:01:05.909> two<00:01:06.150> weeks<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
do it in about two weeks this is the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.600 
do it in about two weeks this is the
quickest<00:01:08.100> I've<00:01:08.250> had<00:01:08.549> broken<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:10.610> basically

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
quickest I've had broken in basically

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
quickest I've had broken in basically
when<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> feels<00:01:12.689> stiff<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.170> want

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
when you get it it feels stiff we want

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170 
when you get it it feels stiff we want
to<00:01:13.380> start<00:01:13.560> catching<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.070> starts<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> soften<00:01:14.939> up

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to start catching it starts to soften up

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
to start catching it starts to soften up
really<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.140> quick<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.710> think

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
really really really quick and I think

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
really really really quick and I think
that's<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> love<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.640> use<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.420> like

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that's the love they use they have like

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410 
that's the love they use they have like
the<00:01:19.350> tan<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.189> softer<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.150> black

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the tan is like softer but the black

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.880 
the tan is like softer but the black
keeps<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.990> rigid<00:01:23.330> that's<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:25.350> awesome

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
keeps it rigid that's and that's awesome

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.440 
keeps it rigid that's and that's awesome
it's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.490> good<00:01:26.640> combination

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it's a good combination

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.480 
it's a good combination
none<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> laces<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.189> broken<00:01:29.490> whatsoever

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
none of the laces have broken whatsoever

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.510 
none of the laces have broken whatsoever
they<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.820> still<00:01:33.600> durable<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.320> ever

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
they are all still durable as ever

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.940 
they are all still durable as ever
honestly<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.619> conditioned<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
honestly I have not conditioned this in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
honestly I have not conditioned this in
a<00:01:38.040> while<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:40.100> really<00:01:41.100> haven't<00:01:41.280> had<00:01:41.490> any<00:01:41.820> -<00:01:42.090> I've

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
a while I really haven't had any - I've

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.149 
a while I really haven't had any - I've
been<00:01:42.869> doing<00:01:43.049> fine<00:01:43.439> without<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.920> being

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
been doing fine without it being

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.789 
been doing fine without it being
conditioned<00:01:44.840> even<00:01:45.840> though<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.229> getting<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
conditioned even though it is getting a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.609 
conditioned even though it is getting a
little<00:01:47.040> dry<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.909> probably<00:01:48.659> should<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> little

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
little dry I probably should a little

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.149 
little dry I probably should a little
bit<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.720> said<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.009> think

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
bit but as I said it's I don't think

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.319 
bit but as I said it's I don't think
it's<00:01:53.310> very<00:01:53.490> necessary<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:55.340> yeah<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.149> right

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
it's very necessary and yeah so right

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
it's very necessary and yeah so right
now<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:58.469> pretty<00:01:58.740> stiff<00:01:59.210> and<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:01.409> reason<00:02:01.860> why

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
now it's pretty stiff and the reason why

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.289 
now it's pretty stiff and the reason why
it's<00:02:02.130> one<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.579> reason<00:02:02.790> why<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> staff<00:02:03.210> is

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
it's one of the reason why the staff is

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.719 
it's one of the reason why the staff is
my<00:02:03.450> hands<00:02:03.719> sweat<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.219> see<00:02:05.579> in

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
my hands sweat a lot as you can see in

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.570 
my hands sweat a lot as you can see in
there<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.540> really<00:02:06.960> dark<00:02:07.310> because<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
there it's really dark because of the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.540 
there it's really dark because of the
sweat<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> stained<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.810> leather<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.739> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
sweat it stained the leather and it

anything negative to say about this
glove<00:02:57.760> other<00:02:58.120> than<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.599> it's<00:02:58.750> awesome<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.340> I

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
glove other than that it's awesome I I

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.729 
glove other than that it's awesome I I
went<00:03:00.849> from<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.120> 32<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:01.629> a<00:03:01.750> half<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.110> 33<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.650> a

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
went from a 32 and a half to 33 and a

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.559 
went from a 32 and a half to 33 and a
half<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.250> think<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:04.000> only<00:03:04.120> difference<00:03:04.209> is

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
half and I think the only difference is

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.199 
half and I think the only difference is
the<00:03:04.690> pockets<00:03:05.170> bigger<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.769> this<00:03:05.920> one<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.519> the

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
the pockets bigger on this one so the

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.819 
the pockets bigger on this one so the
transfer<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.290> might<00:03:08.410> need<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.620> get<00:03:08.739> used

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
transfer and you might need to get used

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.369 
transfer and you might need to get used
to<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.069> transferring<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.810> stuff<00:03:11.079> like<00:03:11.200> that
