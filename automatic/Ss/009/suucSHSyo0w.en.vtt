my life but there's always it's been
proven<00:00:45.829> through<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:46.129> years<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:47.530> don't<00:00:48.530> mean<00:00:49.069> it

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
proven through the years I don't mean it

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
more talent more potential than that but

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.189 
more talent more potential than that but
but<00:00:58.729> as<00:00:58.999> you<00:00:59.120> can<00:00:59.239> see<00:00:59.300> with<00:00:59.960> sheer
