altona he did fantastic race until he a
technical<00:04:20.810> problem<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.709> I<00:04:22.250> think<00:04:22.520> we<00:04:22.880> can<00:04:23.270> win

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
technical problem so I think we can win

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.350 
technical problem so I think we can win
and<00:04:23.690> we<00:04:24.200> always<00:04:24.500> look<00:04:24.770> for<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.010> highest
