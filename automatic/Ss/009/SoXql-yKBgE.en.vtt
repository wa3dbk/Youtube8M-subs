we're<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> do<00:00:07.140> here<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.770> cut<00:00:08.550> an<00:00:08.670> 88<00:00:09.059> inch

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
we're going to do here is cut an 88 inch

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.810 
we're going to do here is cut an 88 inch
hood<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.679> see<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> pattern<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.400> screen

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
hood you see the pattern on the screen

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.480 
hood you see the pattern on the screen
here<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.780> dictates<00:00:13.380> how<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.920> machines<00:00:14.280> going

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
here this dictates how of machines going

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.550 
here this dictates how of machines going
to<00:00:14.610> cut<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> tool<00:00:15.179> out<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.379> this

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
to cut in the tool out we do this

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.260 
to cut in the tool out we do this
machine<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:17.580> cutting<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> pattern

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
machine it's cutting out a pattern

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.720 
machine it's cutting out a pattern
obviously<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.080> want<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:19.470> sure<00:00:19.520> it's<00:00:20.520> as

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
obviously we want to make sure it's as

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.439 
obviously we want to make sure it's as
precise<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.510> possibly<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:22.910> before<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.300> on

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
precise as it possibly can before is on

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.120 
precise as it possibly can before is on
the<00:00:24.570> screen<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.140> need<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> reduce<00:00:25.859> any

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the screen so we need to reduce any

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.370 
the screen so we need to reduce any
movements<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.760> material<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.199> do

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
movements in the material so what we do

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.140 
movements in the material so what we do
we<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.650> machined<00:00:29.099> go<00:00:29.310> around<00:00:29.550> first<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
we have machined go around first and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.690 
we have machined go around first and
drill<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.539> holes<00:00:31.040> wages<00:00:32.040> after<00:00:32.189> battery

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
drill all the holes wages after battery

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.060 
drill all the holes wages after battery
Ben<00:00:32.880> goes<00:00:33.090> around<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> creasing<00:00:34.320> so

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
Ben goes around as all the creasing so

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
Ben goes around as all the creasing so
still<00:00:35.370> which<00:00:35.520> should<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.790> nil<00:00:36.000> movements<00:00:36.510> in

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
still which should be nil movements in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
still which should be nil movements in
the<00:00:36.690> material<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.380> then<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.010> there's<00:00:38.160> any

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the material and then if there's any

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.290 
the material and then if there's any
internal<00:00:38.730> cuts

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
internal cuts

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.890 

all<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.250> our<00:03:14.370> hoods<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.000> auditing<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.420> we<00:03:15.659> do

all of our hoods the auditing that we do

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.470 
all of our hoods the auditing that we do
we<00:03:16.379> do<00:03:16.560> by<00:03:16.739> machine<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.730> reason<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.299> this

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
we do by machine the reason we do this

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.130 
we do by machine the reason we do this
is<00:03:18.720> if<00:03:19.170> we're<00:03:19.349> putting<00:03:19.500> all<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.400> by<00:03:20.610> hand

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
is if we're putting all it's in by hand

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.300 
is if we're putting all it's in by hand
what<00:03:22.140> tends<00:03:22.409> to<00:03:22.500> happen<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.950> people<00:03:22.980> do

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
what tends to happen is people do

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.190 
what tends to happen is people do
eyelets<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.819> different<00:03:24.209> pressure<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.959> it's

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
eyelets in a different pressure and it's

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.630 
eyelets in a different pressure and it's
never<00:03:25.409> as<00:03:25.560> consistent<00:03:26.099> as<00:03:26.159> we<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.430> get<00:03:26.549> it

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
never as consistent as we can get it

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.180 
never as consistent as we can get it
with<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.790> machine<00:03:30.049> now<00:03:31.049> assume<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.590> window<00:03:32.010> is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190

done it's quite a tricky little job to
do<00:03:36.110> which<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.230> one<00:03:37.379> of<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.500> important<00:03:37.980> parts

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
hood top through the binding machine

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.839 
hood top through the binding machine
it's<00:04:01.530> obviously<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.859> very<00:04:01.890> large<00:04:02.370> panel<00:04:02.760> to

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
it's obviously a very large panel to

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.970 
it's obviously a very large panel to
handle<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.900> takes<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.349> couple<00:04:04.379> of<00:04:04.620> people<00:04:04.769> to

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
handle so it takes a couple of people to

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.069 
handle so it takes a couple of people to
fold<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.489> get<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.730> already<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.780> wanna<00:04:06.900> cut

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
fold it in get it already you wanna cut

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.119 
fold it in get it already you wanna cut
people<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.440> show<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.590> up<00:04:07.799> coming<00:04:08.129> together

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
people to show you up coming together

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.349 
people to show you up coming together
when<00:04:11.129> you<00:04:11.220> get<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.549> stage<00:04:11.849> some<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.209> you

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
when you get to this stage some of you

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.849 
when you get to this stage some of you
got<00:04:12.510> extra<00:04:12.810> panels<00:04:13.200> now<00:04:13.410> which<00:04:13.680> are

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
got extra panels now which are

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.849 
got extra panels now which are

we said when you were binding along

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.310 
we said when you were binding along
you'd<00:04:18.269> be<00:04:18.359> very<00:04:18.539> careful<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:19.019> don't<00:04:19.049> get

finish<00:04:58.919> these<00:04:59.669> one's<00:04:59.910> a<00:05:00.000> little<00:05:00.090> bit<00:05:00.300> trickier

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
finish these one's a little bit trickier

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.300 
finish these one's a little bit trickier
one<00:05:01.470> good<00:05:01.710> swipe<00:05:01.979> and<00:05:02.280> they<00:05:02.340> go<00:05:02.490> in<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.700> tree

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
hooks on most of the panels now have all

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.080 
hooks on most of the panels now have all
been<00:05:07.260> finished<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:07.919> next<00:05:08.580> day<00:05:08.729> you've<00:05:08.970> also

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
been finished so next day you've also

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.450 
been finished so next day you've also
have<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.389> join<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.810> whole<00:05:09.960> hood<00:05:10.199> together

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
have to join the whole hood together

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.890 
have to join the whole hood together
this<00:05:11.460> can<00:05:11.669> be<00:05:11.760> quite<00:05:11.910> tricky<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.449> a<00:05:12.510> big<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.840> a

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
this can be quite tricky of a big of a

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.020 
this can be quite tricky of a big of a
hood<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.199> is<00:05:13.320> we're<00:05:13.650> now<00:05:13.800> going<00:05:14.039> to<00:05:14.160> join<00:05:14.430> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
hood it is we're now going to join the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.300 
hood it is we're now going to join the
side<00:05:15.300> curtain<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:16.260> rooftop

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.040 

one<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.400> important<00:05:21.120> features<00:05:21.270> is<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.630> try<00:05:21.930> and

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
one of important features is to try and

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.740 
one of important features is to try and
keep<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.500> joining<00:05:23.370> of<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.700> side<00:05:23.970> panel<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.540> the

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
keep the joining of a side panel and the

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
keep the joining of a side panel and the
rooftop<00:05:25.200> nice<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.070> straight

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.440 

okay<00:05:35.770> so<00:05:35.830> this<00:05:36.040> is<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.340> finished<00:05:37.030> item

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
okay so this is the finished item

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.690 
okay so this is the finished item
falafel<00:05:38.290> machines<00:05:38.620> always<00:05:39.070> give<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.520> good

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
falafel machines always give it a good

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.300 
falafel machines always give it a good

through from a rear curtain that's a bit

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.560 
through from a rear curtain that's a bit
tricky<00:05:45.130> for<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.460> to<00:05:45.550> do<00:05:45.700> yourself<00:05:46.090> we<00:05:46.270> do<00:05:46.420> back

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
for the first few weeks then hood should

for the first few weeks then hood should
settle<00:06:56.470> down<00:06:56.680> a<00:06:56.740> bit<00:06:56.860> more<00:06:57.250> like<00:06:57.430> a<00:06:57.460> bit<00:06:57.640> of<00:06:57.730> a
