00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.350 
Keeble odd but seeing as we've escaped
from<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> guzheng<00:02:17.190> already<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.150> would<00:02:18.240> label

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
from the guzheng already and would label

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.770

this<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.630> commonplace<00:02:19.280> even<00:02:20.280> acting<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.390> I

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
this is commonplace even acting so I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.930 
this is commonplace even acting so I
