on going that many open world games were
out<00:00:28.699> there<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.329> I<00:00:29.840> think<00:00:30.079> they<00:00:30.199> at<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:30.529> point

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
out there and I think they at this point

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.290 
out there and I think they at this point
in<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.009> industry<00:00:31.430> it's<00:00:31.789> pretty<00:00:32.029> tough<00:00:32.239> to

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
in the industry it's pretty tough to

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.549 
in the industry it's pretty tough to
come<00:00:32.540> up<00:00:32.570> with<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:32.809> game<00:00:32.989> that<00:00:33.170> really<00:00:33.320> is

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
come up with a game that really is

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.850 
come up with a game that really is
unlike<00:00:34.010> anything<00:00:34.280> else<00:00:34.550> out<00:00:34.760> there

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 

that's<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> things<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.300> think

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
that's one of the things that I think

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.090

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
terms of the tone in terms of all the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
terms of the tone in terms of all the
options<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.930> over-the-top<00:00:46.320> nature<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
options and the over-the-top nature of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.490 
options and the over-the-top nature of
