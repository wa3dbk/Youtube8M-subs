hi<00:00:03.210> I'm<00:00:03.480> Becky<00:00:03.689> from<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.080> Clarion<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.770> in<00:00:05.040> the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
hi I'm Becky from a Clarion and in the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.220 
hi I'm Becky from a Clarion and in the
past<00:00:05.339> year<00:00:05.790> we<00:00:06.120> have<00:00:06.150> been<00:00:06.330> experimenting

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
past year we have been experimenting

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.070 
past year we have been experimenting
with<00:00:07.340> amplification<00:00:08.389> in<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.570> past<00:00:09.780> we've

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
with amplification in the past we've

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.330 
with amplification in the past we've
been<00:00:10.110> playing<00:00:10.469> all<00:00:10.740> our<00:00:10.889> concerts

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
been playing all our concerts

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.459 
been playing all our concerts
acoustically<00:00:12.000> but<00:00:12.389> sometimes<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.170> play<00:00:13.349> in

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
acoustically but sometimes we play in

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.350 
acoustically but sometimes we play in
venues<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.130> need<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> little<00:00:14.790> bit<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> extra

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
venues that need a little bit of extra

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.560 
venues that need a little bit of extra
resonance<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.710> we<00:00:17.039> decided<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.460> try<00:00:17.699> miking

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
resonance so we decided to try miking

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.200 
resonance so we decided to try miking
bridge<00:00:19.140> couldn't<00:00:19.410> resist<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.460> miking<00:00:21.119> my

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
bridge couldn't resist on to miking my

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.450 
bridge couldn't resist on to miking my
clarinet<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.930> couple<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.380> reasons<00:00:22.590> number

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
clarinet for a couple of reasons number

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.420 
clarinet for a couple of reasons number
one<00:00:23.670> reason<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.600> clarinet<00:00:25.470> sound<00:00:25.769> itself

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
one reason is the clarinet sound itself

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.210 
one reason is the clarinet sound itself
needs<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.480> really<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.260> good<00:00:28.470> microphone<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
needs a really really good microphone to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.160 
needs a really really good microphone to
pick<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> sweet<00:00:30.000> frequencies<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.900> leave

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
pick up the sweet frequencies and leave

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.220 
pick up the sweet frequencies and leave
out<00:00:31.349> all<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> nasty<00:00:32.130> stuff<00:00:32.510> number<00:00:33.510> two<00:00:33.780> um

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
out all the nasty stuff number two um

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.040 
out all the nasty stuff number two um
you<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.309> should<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:36.090> mic<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> clarinet

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you really should not mic the clarinet

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.110 
you really should not mic the clarinet
from<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> Bell<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.070> that's<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> only<00:00:38.969> place

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
from the Bell and that's the only place

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.440 
from the Bell and that's the only place
really<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.440> clip<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.129> microphone<00:00:42.059> on

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
really that you can clip a microphone on

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.440 
really that you can clip a microphone on
to<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.649> problem<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
to it the problem with that is that the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.119 
to it the problem with that is that the
microphone<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.350> clipped<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.800> right<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
microphone if it's clipped on right to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.130 
microphone if it's clipped on right to
the<00:00:47.219> bell<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.730> only<00:00:47.969> pick<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> low<00:00:48.899> notes

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the bell will only pick up the low notes

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.799 
the bell will only pick up the low notes
and<00:00:49.379> they'll<00:00:49.500> boom<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.309> extremely<00:00:50.820> loud<00:00:51.149> but

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and they'll boom out extremely loud but

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.360 
and they'll boom out extremely loud but
then<00:00:51.960> you're<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> miss<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.250> other

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
then you're going to miss all the other

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.619 
then you're going to miss all the other
notes<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> air<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.480> escaping

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
notes because the air is escaping

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
notes because the air is escaping
through<00:00:55.199> every<00:00:55.559> single<00:00:55.890> hole<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
through every single hole in the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.590 
through every single hole in the
clarinet<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:58.500> solution<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.430> I've<00:01:00.120> seen

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
clarinet so one solution that I've seen

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
clarinet so one solution that I've seen
is<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.020> people<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.100> drilled<00:01:02.699> um

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
is that people have actually drilled um

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.899 
is that people have actually drilled um
and<00:01:04.019> put<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> pickup<00:01:04.920> mic<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:05.489> into<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and put up a pickup mic right into the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.539 
and put up a pickup mic right into the
barrel<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.420> was<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> little<00:01:07.530> bit<00:01:07.619> afraid<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.369> do

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
barrel I was a little bit afraid to do

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.020 
barrel I was a little bit afraid to do
that<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.689> didn't<00:01:10.200> want<00:01:10.439> anything

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
that so I really didn't want anything

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.399 
that so I really didn't want anything
attaching<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.390> clarinet<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.960> would

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
attaching on to my clarinet that would

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
attaching on to my clarinet that would
be<00:01:13.530> permanently<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.850> last<00:01:15.119> issue<00:01:15.479> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
be permanently there the last issue that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.980 
be permanently there the last issue that
I<00:01:15.930> had<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.759> couldn't<00:01:18.180> click<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> mic

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
I had was if I couldn't click on a mic

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
I had was if I couldn't click on a mic
to<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.259> Bell<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
to the Bell I would have to use just a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
to the Bell I would have to use just a
regular<00:01:21.060> mic<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> stand<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.159> made<00:01:23.340> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
regular mic on a stand and that made it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
regular mic on a stand and that made it
really<00:01:23.490> difficult<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> move

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
really difficult because I like to move

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.499 
really difficult because I like to move
around<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.740> lot<00:01:25.770> while<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.520> playing<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
around a lot while I'm playing so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.569 
around a lot while I'm playing so
sometimes<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:28.560> bell<00:01:28.799> would<00:01:29.100> hit<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sometimes my bell would hit the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.520 
sometimes my bell would hit the
microphone<00:01:29.840> sometimes<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.049> would<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.290> playing

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
microphone sometimes I would be playing

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.109 
microphone sometimes I would be playing
completely<00:01:31.860> far<00:01:32.280> away<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.790> microphone

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
completely far away from the microphone

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
completely far away from the microphone
and<00:01:33.750> when<00:01:33.900> you're<00:01:34.020> focusing<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> music

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and when you're focusing on the music

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
and when you're focusing on the music
you<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.400> want<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> focusing<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.390> where

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you don't want to be focusing on where

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
you don't want to be focusing on where
am<00:01:37.049> i<00:01:37.140> standing<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.740> entire<00:01:38.040> time<00:01:38.340> while<00:01:38.520> I'm

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
am i standing the entire time while I'm

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.420 
am i standing the entire time while I'm
playing<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.810> needed<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.740> able<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
playing so I needed to be able to have a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.639 
playing so I needed to be able to have a
portable<00:01:41.909> mic<00:01:42.270> attached<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.110> clarinet

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
portable mic attached to this clarinet

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.999 
portable mic attached to this clarinet
we<00:01:44.460> found<00:01:44.850> some<00:01:45.479> great<00:01:45.840> microphones<00:01:46.649> from

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
we found some great microphones from

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
we found some great microphones from
long<00:01:47.280> McQuade<00:01:47.729> these<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> apex<00:01:48.780> mics

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
long McQuade these are the apex mics

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.850 
long McQuade these are the apex mics
they<00:01:49.740> pick<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> sound<00:01:50.720> beautifully<00:01:51.860> they

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
they pick up the sound beautifully they

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.910 
they pick up the sound beautifully they
fit<00:01:53.310> great<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:54.149> David's<00:01:54.600> accordion<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.560> we

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
fit great on David's accordion so we

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.429 
fit great on David's accordion so we
thought<00:01:56.159> hey<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.759> clip<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> Bell<00:01:57.479> but

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
thought hey it will clip on the Bell but

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
thought hey it will clip on the Bell but
unfortunately<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.090> clarinet<00:02:00.540> Bell<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.990> just

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
unfortunately the clarinet Bell is just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.399 
unfortunately the clarinet Bell is just
a<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.590> too<00:02:01.799> fat<00:02:02.540> these<00:02:03.540> mics<00:02:03.990> fit

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
a little bit too fat these mics fit

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.910 
a little bit too fat these mics fit
great<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.130> saxophones<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.750> even<00:02:07.170> fit<00:02:07.500> really

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
great on saxophones they even fit really

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.010 
great on saxophones they even fit really
well<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.000> bass<00:02:09.179> clarinet<00:02:09.509> I'm<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
well on the bass clarinet I'm going to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.279 
well on the bass clarinet I'm going to
show

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
show

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.050 
show
real<00:02:10.500> quick<00:02:10.739> how<00:02:10.920> easy<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.849> click

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
real quick how easy it is to just click

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.780 
real quick how easy it is to just click
this<00:02:12.269> one<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.920> okay<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.609> bass

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
this one on okay so this is the bass

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.479 
this one on okay so this is the bass
clarinet<00:02:15.120> bail<00:02:15.510> on<00:02:15.840> it's<00:02:16.349> pretty<00:02:16.980> much<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
clarinet bail on it's pretty much the

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.410 
clarinet bail on it's pretty much the
exact<00:02:17.969> same<00:02:18.209> thickness<00:02:19.250> as<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.310> saxophone<00:02:21.180> bail

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
exact same thickness as a saxophone bail

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.259 
exact same thickness as a saxophone bail
and<00:02:21.689> so<00:02:22.500> these<00:02:22.680> microphones<00:02:23.219> did<00:02:23.909> say<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
and so these microphones did say that

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.819 
and so these microphones did say that
they<00:02:24.359> were<00:02:24.420> great<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:25.049> saxophones<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.680> as

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
they were great for saxophones and as

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.399 
they were great for saxophones and as
you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.099> see<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.939> can<00:02:27.090> clip<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.629> right<00:02:27.659> on<00:02:28.109> it

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
you can see you can clip it right on it

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.610 
you can see you can clip it right on it
goes<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.159> all<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.849> way<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:31.260> stays<00:02:31.500> on

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
goes in all the way in and it stays on

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.819 
goes in all the way in and it stays on
really<00:02:32.040> nicely<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:33.109> again<00:02:34.109> when<00:02:34.680> you're

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
really nicely and again when you're

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.490 
really nicely and again when you're
miking<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.459> clarinet<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.659> don't<00:02:36.989> want<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.379> have

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
miking a clarinet you don't want to have

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.229 
miking a clarinet you don't want to have
the<00:02:37.620> mic<00:02:37.829> really<00:02:38.220> close<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.609> the<00:02:38.700> keys<00:02:38.939> there's

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
the mic really close to the keys there's

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.629 
the mic really close to the keys there's
a<00:02:39.329> huge<00:02:39.719> amount<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.230> key<00:02:40.469> noise<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:41.400> gets

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
a huge amount of key noise that gets

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.000 
a huge amount of key noise that gets
picked<00:02:41.939> up<00:02:42.120> I'll<00:02:43.079> just<00:02:43.109> let<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.530> hear<00:02:43.769> some<00:02:43.980> of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
picked up I'll just let you hear some of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.679 
picked up I'll just let you hear some of
that<00:02:44.189> right<00:02:44.430> here<00:02:47.120> see<00:02:48.120> now<00:02:48.389> I<00:02:48.419> have<00:02:48.659> a

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
that right here see now I have a

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.390 
that right here see now I have a
percussionist<00:02:49.319> stirring<00:02:49.680> along<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.189> my

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
percussionist stirring along with my

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.589 
percussionist stirring along with my
regular<00:02:51.209> bass<00:02:51.659> clarinet<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:54.060> really<00:02:54.419> want

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
regular bass clarinet so you really want

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.080 
regular bass clarinet so you really want
to<00:02:54.629> make<00:02:54.810> sure<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:56.189> far<00:02:56.579> enough<00:02:56.849> back

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
to make sure that it's far enough back

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.869 
to make sure that it's far enough back
that<00:02:57.450> not<00:02:58.439> only<00:02:58.859> do<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.159> pick<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.669> lot<00:02:59.819> of

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
that not only do you pick up a lot of

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.490 
that not only do you pick up a lot of
the<00:03:00.030> clean<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.480> don't<00:03:00.810> pick<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.200> lot<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.439> the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the clean you don't pick up a lot of the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.099 
the clean you don't pick up a lot of the
key<00:03:01.680> noise<00:03:01.889> but<00:03:02.519> also<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:03.329> way<00:03:03.540> it'll<00:03:03.810> pick

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
key noise but also that way it'll pick

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.349 
key noise but also that way it'll pick
up<00:03:04.260> more<00:03:04.859> of<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:05.280> air<00:03:05.489> coming<00:03:05.819> out<00:03:06.000> from<00:03:06.180> all

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
up more of the air coming out from all

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.569 
up more of the air coming out from all
of<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.629> keys<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:07.139> opposed<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.980> down<00:03:08.189> here

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
of the keys as opposed to just down here

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.789 
of the keys as opposed to just down here
so<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:09.540> works<00:03:09.750> really<00:03:10.019> great<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.620> bass

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
so this works really great for the bass

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.229 
so this works really great for the bass
but<00:03:11.549> um<00:03:11.849> as<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:13.139> showed<00:03:13.439> you<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.980> doesn't<00:03:14.699> fit<00:03:15.000> on

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
but um as I showed you it doesn't fit on

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.809 
but um as I showed you it doesn't fit on
the<00:03:15.359> clarinet<00:03:15.750> bail<00:03:16.169> so<00:03:16.859> I<00:03:17.280> came<00:03:17.400> up<00:03:17.579> with<00:03:17.790> a

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
the clarinet bail so I came up with a

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.110 
the clarinet bail so I came up with a
little<00:03:18.060> MacGyver<00:03:18.209> solution<00:03:19.139> just<00:03:19.470> temporary

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
little MacGyver solution just temporary

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.199 
little MacGyver solution just temporary
I<00:03:21.150> took<00:03:21.659> a<00:03:21.930> binder<00:03:22.409> clip<00:03:22.440> because<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.909> was<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
I took a binder clip because it was the

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.089 
I took a binder clip because it was the
only<00:03:24.269> thing<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.629> was<00:03:24.840> skinny<00:03:25.139> enough<00:03:25.500> for

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
only thing that was skinny enough for

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.699 
only thing that was skinny enough for
the<00:03:26.609> microphone<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.209> attach<00:03:27.629> to<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.379> course<00:03:28.590> I

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
the microphone to attach to of course I

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.920 
the microphone to attach to of course I
didn't<00:03:29.040> want<00:03:29.069> it<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.579> scratch<00:03:29.879> my<00:03:30.180> clarinet<00:03:30.690> so

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
didn't want it to scratch my clarinet so

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.610 
didn't want it to scratch my clarinet so
I<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.409> took<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.620> little<00:03:31.769> bit<00:03:31.919> of<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.310> kind<00:03:32.609> of

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
I just took a little bit of this kind of

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.580 
I just took a little bit of this kind of
styrofoam<00:03:34.620> bubbly<00:03:35.609> wrap<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.470> clipped<00:03:37.470> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
styrofoam bubbly wrap and I clipped it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.759 
styrofoam bubbly wrap and I clipped it
onto<00:03:37.919> the<00:03:38.010> bail<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.609> stained<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.690> then<00:03:40.409> I

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
onto the bail it's stained and then I

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.659 
onto the bail it's stained and then I
attached<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:42.120> microphone<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:44.040> one<00:03:44.549> of

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
attached the microphone just to one of

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.449 
attached the microphone just to one of
the<00:03:44.760> clips<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.620> then<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> was<00:03:46.889> able<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.159> turn

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
the clips and then I was able to turn

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:56.210 
the clips and then I was able to turn
the<00:03:47.879> microphone

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.660 

and<00:03:56.310> at<00:03:57.180> least<00:03:57.330> this<00:03:57.720> way<00:03:58.050> it<00:03:58.890> was<00:03:59.100> far<00:03:59.460> enough

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
and at least this way it was far enough

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.430 
and at least this way it was far enough
away<00:03:59.850> it<00:04:00.120> was<00:04:00.240> picking<00:04:00.600> up<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.810> sound<00:04:01.050> okay

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
away it was picking up the sound okay

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.530 
away it was picking up the sound okay
the<00:04:01.950> weights<00:04:02.250> not<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.850> great<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.510> course

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
the weights not so great and of course

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.360 
the weights not so great and of course
is<00:04:03.930> really<00:04:04.260> flimsy<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.530> needed<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.010> come<00:04:08.220> up

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
is really flimsy so I needed to come up

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.490 
is really flimsy so I needed to come up
with<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.580> more<00:04:08.820> permanent<00:04:09.060> solution<00:04:09.510> that

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
with a more permanent solution that

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.790 
with a more permanent solution that
looked<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:11.130> lot<00:04:11.370> better<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.900> remembered<00:04:13.470> that

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
looked a lot better so I remembered that

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.890 
looked a lot better so I remembered that
I<00:04:13.860> had<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.640> old<00:04:14.850> marching<00:04:15.360> band<00:04:15.570> lawyer

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
I had this old marching band lawyer

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.140 
I had this old marching band lawyer
these<00:04:16.350> are<00:04:16.590> literally<00:04:17.160> only<00:04:17.340> five<00:04:17.790> dollars

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
these are literally only five dollars

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.610 
these are literally only five dollars
and<00:04:18.980> they<00:04:19.980> are<00:04:20.130> great<00:04:20.519> because<00:04:20.959> they<00:04:21.959> allow<00:04:22.260> me

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and they are great because they allow me

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.680 
and they are great because they allow me
to<00:04:22.920> click<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.430> mic<00:04:23.610> on<00:04:23.850> into<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.240> center<00:04:24.660> of

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
to click the mic on into the center of

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.720 
to click the mic on into the center of
the<00:04:24.900> clarinet<00:04:25.380> again<00:04:25.800> without<00:04:25.980> actually

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
the clarinet again without actually

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.550 
the clarinet again without actually
adding<00:04:26.910> anything<00:04:27.600> on<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.840> my<00:04:27.930> clarinet<00:04:28.380> to

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
adding anything on to my clarinet to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.870 
adding anything on to my clarinet to
change<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.190> in<00:04:29.310> any<00:04:29.430> way

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
change it in any way

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.000 
change it in any way
permanently<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.520> take<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.670> clarinet<00:04:33.060> apart

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
permanently so take the clarinet apart

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.940 
permanently so take the clarinet apart
just<00:04:35.010> slip<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:35.640> ring<00:04:36.290> over<00:04:37.290> top<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:39.950> screw

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
just slip this ring over top and screw

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.290 
just slip this ring over top and screw
it<00:04:41.070> on

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.540 

so<00:04:47.870> then<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.230> had<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.650> top<00:04:48.890> back<00:04:49.130> onto<00:04:49.340> the

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
so then I had the top back onto the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.060 
so then I had the top back onto the
clarinet<00:04:49.910> and<00:04:50.030> there's<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.960> lawyer<00:04:51.170> and<00:04:51.470> it

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
clarinet and there's the lawyer and it

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.490 
clarinet and there's the lawyer and it
doesn't<00:04:52.340> really<00:04:52.430> affect<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.880> weight<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.240> much

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.850 

just<00:04:57.500> clip<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.010> mic<00:04:58.250> on<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:59.480> there<00:05:00.050> and<00:05:00.350> then

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
just clip the mic on to there and then

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.610 
just clip the mic on to there and then
you<00:05:01.010> just<00:05:01.040> adjust<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:02.420> distance<00:05:02.630> as<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.110> need

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
you just adjust the distance as you need

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.890 
you just adjust the distance as you need
it

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.730 

and<00:05:09.990> there<00:05:10.680> we<00:05:10.860> have<00:05:11.070> a<00:05:11.810> miking<00:05:12.810> solution<00:05:13.380> for

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
and there we have a miking solution for

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.430 
and there we have a miking solution for
the<00:05:13.919> clarinet
