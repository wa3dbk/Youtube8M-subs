Saver this house is an old cape that's
been<00:00:11.270> added<00:00:11.450> on<00:00:11.720> to<00:00:11.990> so<00:00:12.440> now<00:00:12.740> we're<00:00:12.950> gonna

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
been added on to so now we're gonna

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.450 
been added on to so now we're gonna
inject<00:00:13.640> foam<00:00:14.360> insulation<00:00:14.930> into<00:00:15.530> the<00:00:15.800> walls<00:00:16.010> to

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
inject foam insulation into the walls to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.940 
inject foam insulation into the walls to
make<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:16.820> walls<00:00:17.060> leak<00:00:17.510> less<00:00:17.840> and<00:00:18.170> be<00:00:18.800> more

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
make the walls leak less and be more

we<00:00:21.170> have<00:00:21.289> our<00:00:21.440> injection<00:00:21.860> foam<00:00:22.070> machine

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
we have our injection foam machine

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.100 
we have our injection foam machine
running<00:00:22.610> here<00:00:22.880> in<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.060> background<00:00:23.539> but<00:00:23.690> when

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
running here in the background but when

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.779 
running here in the background but when
we<00:00:24.230> took<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.500> siding<00:00:24.949> off<00:00:25.070> we<00:00:25.279> can<00:00:25.430> see<00:00:25.460> these

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
we took the siding off we can see these

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.970 
we took the siding off we can see these
gaps<00:00:26.119> in<00:00:26.449> the<00:00:26.570> siding<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.140> this<00:00:27.710> was

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
gaps in the siding and this was

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.160 
gaps in the siding and this was
something<00:00:28.910> new<00:00:29.090> was<00:00:29.359> done<00:00:29.539> to<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.750> house<00:00:29.930> it

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
something new was done to the house it

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.470 
something new was done to the house it
was<00:00:30.260> remodeled<00:00:30.650> but<00:00:31.400> here's<00:00:31.640> old<00:00:32.029> sheathing

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
was remodeled but here's old sheathing

and<00:00:32.840> see<00:00:33.350> these<00:00:33.500> gaps<00:00:33.829> here<00:00:34.100> even<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:34.609> one<00:00:34.789> I

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:34.819 
and see these gaps here even this one I

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:37.649 
and see these gaps here even this one I
could<00:00:34.999> stick<00:00:35.179> my<00:00:35.329> finger<00:00:35.719> in<00:00:35.749> it<00:00:36.190> these<00:00:37.190> holes

could stick my finger in it these holes

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.290 
could stick my finger in it these holes
this<00:00:38.659> house<00:00:38.960> leaks<00:00:39.440> through<00:00:39.889> there<00:00:40.219> and<00:00:40.429> this

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
this house leaks through there and this

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.840 
this house leaks through there and this
vinyl<00:00:41.960> siding<00:00:42.499> is<00:00:42.620> no<00:00:42.829> match<00:00:43.069> for<00:00:43.100> air<00:00:43.579> that

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
vinyl siding is no match for air that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.119 
vinyl siding is no match for air that
wants<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.179> leak<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:44.629> or<00:00:44.780> out<00:00:44.929> when<00:00:45.649> we<00:00:45.829> fill<00:00:46.100> all

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
wants to leak in or out when we fill all

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.340 
wants to leak in or out when we fill all
these<00:00:46.460> holes<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.179> seams<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.749> gaps<00:00:47.989> with

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
these holes and seams and gaps with

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.160 
these holes and seams and gaps with
injection<00:00:48.889> foam<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:49.729> won't<00:00:49.999> leak<00:00:50.179> anymore<00:00:50.510> so

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
injection foam it won't leak anymore so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.199 
injection foam it won't leak anymore so
if<00:00:51.440> we<00:00:51.559> take<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:51.799> look<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:52.159> these<00:00:52.309> walls<00:00:52.639> this

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:53.209 
if we take a look in these walls this

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:54.729 
if we take a look in these walls this
house<00:00:53.389> has<00:00:53.569> been<00:00:53.600> added<00:00:54.049> on<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.409> over<00:00:54.620> the

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
house has been added on to over the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.399 
house has been added on to over the
years<00:00:55.269> we<00:00:56.269> see<00:00:56.510> these<00:00:56.719> walls<00:00:57.049> are<00:00:57.260> completely

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
years we see these walls are completely

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.799 
years we see these walls are completely
empty<00:00:57.889> have<00:00:58.370> no<00:00:58.609> insulation<00:00:59.030> whatsoever<00:00:59.209> and

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
empty have no insulation whatsoever and

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.959 
empty have no insulation whatsoever and
you<00:00:59.869> can<00:01:00.019> see<00:01:00.199> right<00:01:00.409> in<00:01:00.589> there<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.699> first

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
you can see right in there the first

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.180 
you can see right in there the first
step<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.510> injecting<00:01:03.229> foam<00:01:03.440> insulation<00:01:03.709> into

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
step of injecting foam insulation into

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.160 
step of injecting foam insulation into
walls<00:01:04.400> is<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.760> remove<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.239> siding<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.750> this

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
walls is to remove the siding and this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.500 
walls is to remove the siding and this
is<00:01:06.350> vinyl<00:01:06.740> siding<00:01:07.160> so<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:07.490> remove<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.210> if<00:01:08.360> it

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
is vinyl siding so we remove it if it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.370 
is vinyl siding so we remove it if it
was<00:01:08.630> clapboard

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
was clapboard

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.680 
was clapboard
we<00:01:09.830> would<00:01:10.040> drill<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.610> siding<00:01:11.060> wood<00:01:11.240> clapboard

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
we would drill the siding wood clapboard

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.910 
we would drill the siding wood clapboard
drill<00:01:11.930> right<00:01:12.080> through<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.350> siding<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:12.710> put

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
drill right through the siding and put

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.210 
drill right through the siding and put
wood<00:01:13.100> plugs<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:13.610> there<00:01:13.820> over<00:01:14.300> here<00:01:14.330> we<00:01:14.930> have

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
wood plugs in there over here we have

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.280 
wood plugs in there over here we have
fiberglass<00:01:16.220> insulation<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:17.810> is<00:01:17.990> white

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
fiberglass insulation and this is white

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.620 
fiberglass insulation and this is white
fiberglass<00:01:19.010> as<00:01:19.310> we<00:01:19.490> can<00:01:19.670> see<00:01:19.910> and<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:20.360> can<00:01:20.480> see

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
fiberglass as we can see and you can see

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.030 
fiberglass as we can see and you can see
