we've<00:00:01.460> heard<00:00:01.609> a<00:00:01.640> lot<00:00:01.849> about<00:00:01.879> this<00:00:02.149> haven't<00:00:02.389> we

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:02.450 
we've heard a lot about this haven't we

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.669 
we've heard a lot about this haven't we
over<00:00:02.570> the<00:00:02.629> last<00:00:02.810> couple<00:00:03.229> of<00:00:03.379> weeks<00:00:03.439> in

years<00:00:06.290> now<00:00:06.500> behind<00:00:06.740> me<00:00:06.859> you've<00:00:06.980> got<00:00:07.069> a<00:00:07.100> graphic

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:07.549 
years now behind me you've got a graphic

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.480 
years now behind me you've got a graphic
showing<00:00:07.879> the<00:00:08.390> Arctic<00:00:09.080> ice<00:00:09.410> and<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:10.040> melt<00:00:10.280> it

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
showing the Arctic ice and the melt it

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.759 
showing the Arctic ice and the melt it
starts<00:00:10.790> out<00:00:10.910> in<00:00:11.150> 1989<00:00:11.690> then<00:00:12.170> we<00:00:12.290> move<00:00:12.440> on<00:00:12.559> ten

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
starts out in 1989 then we move on ten

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.400 
starts out in 1989 then we move on ten
years<00:00:13.009> to<00:00:13.549> 1999<00:00:14.480> and<00:00:14.629> then<00:00:14.960> let's<00:00:15.110> move<00:00:15.290> it<00:00:15.379> on

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
years to 1999 and then let's move it on

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.470 
years to 1999 and then let's move it on
another<00:00:15.710> and<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.460> can<00:00:16.640> see<00:00:16.820> highlighted<00:00:17.300> by

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
another and you can see highlighted by

all<00:00:20.029> these<00:00:20.180> images<00:00:20.600> by<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.779> way<00:00:20.990> taken<00:00:21.439> during

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
all these images by the way taken during

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.230 
all these images by the way taken during
the<00:00:21.710> month<00:00:21.859> of<00:00:21.949> September<00:00:22.070> when<00:00:22.519> that<00:00:22.699> Arctic

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
the month of September when that Arctic

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.810 
the month of September when that Arctic
sea<00:00:23.449> ice<00:00:23.480> is<00:00:23.869> at<00:00:24.560> its<00:00:24.859> lowest<00:00:25.189> that<00:00:25.519> is<00:00:25.670> when

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
sea ice is at its lowest that is when

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.210 
sea ice is at its lowest that is when
the<00:00:25.939> ice<00:00:26.119> has<00:00:26.330> retreated<00:00:26.720> further<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:27.590> as<00:00:27.920> you

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
the ice has retreated further so as you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.800 
the ice has retreated further so as you
say<00:00:28.369> what<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:28.880> impact<00:00:29.240> in<00:00:29.510> particular

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
say what is the impact in particular

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.599 
say what is the impact in particular
what<00:00:30.199> is<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.410> impact<00:00:30.769> to<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.039> polar<00:00:31.310> bear

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
what is the impact to the polar bear

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.400 
what is the impact to the polar bear
because<00:00:32.180> we've<00:00:32.330> all<00:00:32.450> been<00:00:32.480> hearing<00:00:32.870> how<00:00:33.290> of

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
because we've all been hearing how of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.410 
because we've all been hearing how of
course<00:00:33.650> their<00:00:34.010> habitat<00:00:34.460> is<00:00:34.670> indeed<00:00:35.240> at

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
course their habitat is indeed at

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.040 
course their habitat is indeed at
diminishing

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
diminishing

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.380 
diminishing
well<00:00:36.170> I'm<00:00:36.410> very<00:00:36.710> own<00:00:36.890> Jessica<00:00:37.460> Ellis<00:00:37.760> she

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
well I'm very own Jessica Ellis she

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.570 
well I'm very own Jessica Ellis she
actually<00:00:38.630> took<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.960> trip<00:00:39.350> up<00:00:39.560> into<00:00:40.190> that<00:00:40.280> part

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
actually took a trip up into that part

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.210 
actually took a trip up into that part
of<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.880> world<00:00:41.060> to<00:00:41.270> find<00:00:41.720> out<00:00:41.900> for<00:00:42.080> herself

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
of the world to find out for herself

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.740 
of the world to find out for herself
exactly<00:00:43.220> what<00:00:43.700> is<00:00:43.820> happening<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.540> polar

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
exactly what is happening to the polar

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
exactly what is happening to the polar
bear<00:00:46.210> because<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.390> Hudson<00:00:47.750> Bay<00:00:47.930> which<00:00:48.560> is<00:00:48.740> a

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
bear because the Hudson Bay which is a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.620 
bear because the Hudson Bay which is a
part<00:00:49.220> of<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.370> Arctic<00:00:49.640> Ocean<00:00:49.730> dips<00:00:50.180> way<00:00:50.390> down

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
part of the Arctic Ocean dips way down

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.930 
part of the Arctic Ocean dips way down
into<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.050> central<00:00:51.350> part<00:00:51.560> of<00:00:51.680> Canada<00:00:52.100> here<00:00:52.310> the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
into the central part of Canada here the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.820 
into the central part of Canada here the
Arctic<00:00:53.240> actually<00:00:53.600> does<00:00:54.050> not<00:00:54.170> follow<00:00:54.470> an

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
Arctic actually does not follow an

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.890 
Arctic actually does not follow an
east-to-west<00:00:55.250> line<00:00:55.790> say<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.240> 60th<00:00:56.690> parallel

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
east-to-west line say the 60th parallel

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.560 
east-to-west line say the 60th parallel
but<00:00:57.800> actually<00:00:58.130> comes<00:00:58.490> way<00:00:58.670> down<00:00:58.910> into<00:00:59.120> central

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
but actually comes way down into central

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.630 
but actually comes way down into central
Canada<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.290> brings<00:01:00.800> all<00:01:00.950> that<00:01:01.100> cold<00:01:01.370> water

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
Canada and brings all that cold water

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.160 
Canada and brings all that cold water
and<00:01:01.790> that<00:01:01.850> ice<00:01:02.060> mass<00:01:02.360> down<00:01:02.630> with<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.020> and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
and that ice mass down with it and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.900 
and that ice mass down with it and
that's<00:01:03.740> what<00:01:03.950> has<00:01:04.100> that's<00:01:04.460> what<00:01:04.580> holds<00:01:04.729> the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
that's what has that's what holds the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.040 
that's what has that's what holds the
Bears<00:01:05.120> here<00:01:05.360> as<00:01:05.449> well<00:01:05.630> that's<00:01:05.780> why<00:01:05.870> we<00:01:06.020> have

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
Bears here as well that's why we have

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.050 
Bears here as well that's why we have
polar<00:01:06.320> bears<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:06.740> far<00:01:06.980> down<00:01:07.160> into<00:01:07.430> Canada<00:01:07.880> and

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
polar bears so far down into Canada and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.060 
polar bears so far down into Canada and
certainly<00:01:08.810> there<00:01:08.990> does<00:01:09.170> seem<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.440> be<00:01:09.590> the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
certainly there does seem to be the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.160 
certainly there does seem to be the
higher<00:01:10.250> Arctic<00:01:10.580> areas<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.030> are<00:01:11.210> ice-free

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
higher Arctic areas that are ice-free

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.780 
higher Arctic areas that are ice-free
that<00:01:12.380> haven't<00:01:12.620> been<00:01:12.740> for<00:01:12.980> years<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.430> elders

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
that haven't been for years the elders

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.250 
that haven't been for years the elders
they<00:01:13.940> newid<00:01:14.150> elders<00:01:14.450> are<00:01:14.570> talking<00:01:14.900> about<00:01:15.020> how

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
they newid elders are talking about how

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.320 
they newid elders are talking about how
there's<00:01:15.500> no<00:01:16.220> ice<00:01:16.400> where<00:01:16.640> there<00:01:16.760> has<00:01:17.090> always

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
there's no ice where there has always

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.910 
there's no ice where there has always
been<00:01:17.540> nice<00:01:17.720> in<00:01:17.930> their<00:01:18.020> entire<00:01:18.260> lifetime

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
been nice in their entire lifetime

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.890 
been nice in their entire lifetime
so<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.760> certainly<00:01:20.060> would<00:01:20.240> appear<00:01:20.510> that<00:01:20.570> some

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
so it certainly would appear that some

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.220 
so it certainly would appear that some
things<00:01:21.170> are<00:01:21.320> changing<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:23.330> polar<00:01:23.570> bears<00:01:23.840> here

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
things are changing the polar bears here

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.080 
things are changing the polar bears here
are<00:01:24.700> just<00:01:25.700> amazing<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:27.440> actually<00:01:27.940> get<00:01:28.940> in

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
are just amazing to actually get in

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.720 
are just amazing to actually get in
close<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.750> largest<00:01:30.710> land<00:01:31.040> carnivore<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:31.640> the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
close to a largest land carnivore in the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.110 
close to a largest land carnivore in the
world<00:01:31.940> is<00:01:32.120> pretty<00:01:32.330> amazing<00:01:32.810> experience<00:01:32.930> I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
world is pretty amazing experience I

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.490 
world is pretty amazing experience I
come<00:01:35.120> out<00:01:35.270> here<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:35.450> photograph<00:01:35.690> photographs

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
come out here to photograph photographs

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.410 
come out here to photograph photographs
simply<00:01:37.130> because<00:01:37.460> they're<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:38.030> me<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.300> most

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420

showing up in the area the map that is

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.909 
showing up in the area the map that is

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
where we're talking about there that

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.680 
where we're talking about there that
perhaps<00:06:49.070> the<00:06:49.340> diminishing<00:06:49.850> population<00:06:50.480> polar

perhaps the diminishing population polar

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.020 
perhaps the diminishing population polar
bears<00:06:50.930> because<00:06:51.440> of<00:06:51.770> the<00:06:51.860> potential<00:06:52.340> of<00:06:52.490> that
