00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.540
 tomato mozzarella stood on 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.280
 For that I have prepared with and 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.280
 Although kimi is clear 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.470
 tomatoes mozzarella we have red or 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.410

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.350
 First you always go a drop 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.350
 olive oil in the pan 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.490
 then we go in our train 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.490
 the 1 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.410
 short of both sides currently fry 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.369
 a bit of olive oil 2 tablespoons 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.340
 and emotions 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:35.380
 We just never have to take it seriously 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.530
 heard and struck 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:47.950

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:26.379

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.629

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
 Naturally 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.369
 I wisely make a bit small 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:11.290

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.729

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.729
