that is contributed to my weight I kind

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.480 
that is contributed to my weight I kind
of<00:02:47.520> use<00:02:47.640> my<00:02:47.670> comedy<00:02:48.300> as<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.870> defense<00:02:49.290> mechanism

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
of use my comedy as a defense mechanism

I think it's really what I was used to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.750 
I think it's really what I was used to
when<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:55.740> younger<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.220> people<00:02:56.700> would

when I was younger like people would

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.850 
when I was younger like people would
snap<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.150> each<00:02:57.270> other<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> big
