00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
so one two now a good trick that I have

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.680 
so one two now a good trick that I have
is<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:14.230> hold<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.650> curl<00:03:15.919> so<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.970> cools<00:03:17.269> down<00:03:17.480> so

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
is to hold the curl so it cools down so

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.479 
is to hold the curl so it cools down so
it<00:03:18.019> was<00:03:18.109> staying<00:03:18.380> your<00:03:18.500> hair<00:03:18.620> longer<00:03:18.829> so<00:03:19.130> hold

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
it was staying your hair longer so hold

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.909 
it was staying your hair longer so hold
it<00:03:19.669> and<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.120> release<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:21.049> curl<00:03:21.260> I'd<00:03:21.650> say

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
it and then release the curl I'd say

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.610 
it and then release the curl I'd say
four<00:03:22.250> seconds<00:03:22.910> at<00:03:23.060> max<00:03:23.540> on<00:03:23.900> here<00:03:24.200> with<00:03:24.410> these
