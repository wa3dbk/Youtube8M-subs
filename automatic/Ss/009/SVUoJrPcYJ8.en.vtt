00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.120 

the<00:00:32.149> process<00:00:32.570> is<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.899> same<00:00:32.930> for<00:00:33.170> both<00:00:33.410> so

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
the process is the same for both so

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.319 
the process is the same for both so
we'll<00:00:34.250> just<00:00:34.460> show<00:00:34.579> you<00:00:34.640> how<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.880> catch<00:00:35.120> the

this<00:00:42.590> cast<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.970> wax<00:00:44.210> is<00:00:44.390> our<00:00:44.570> first<00:00:44.840> wave<00:00:45.199> and

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
this cast the wax is our first wave and

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.040 
this cast the wax is our first wave and
then<00:00:46.010> multiplied<00:00:46.489> by<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:46.760> factor<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:47.239> 13.5

the waxes are then placed onto a rubber
base

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.529

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
they are then dipped into a solution

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.889 
they are then dipped into a solution
that<00:00:59.140> will<00:00:59.289> make<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.680> mold<00:00:59.980> material<00:01:00.449> bond<00:01:01.449> to

the wax a metal flask is then secured to

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.780 
the wax a metal flask is then secured to
the<00:01:07.119> rubber<00:01:07.390> base
