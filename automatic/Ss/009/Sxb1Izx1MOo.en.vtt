00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.010
 to know how easy you can work 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.010
 the best self inbox 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.860
 whether you buy in a product or 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.200
 extremely long 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.020
 that's one thing that's all about 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.980
 water flows down so it 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.560
 end point 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.080
 must be days beyond the starting point and 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.210
 in between you ensure a beautiful 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.610
 the product does not expire constantly 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.210
 today in all to me 9 is 5 kilometers 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.120
 long 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.239
 the start of my tree at a height of 77 meters 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.699
 and finishes in the legion at 52 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.269
 meter height the height difference is therefore 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.260
 25 meters that is 50 centimeters per 100 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.670
 meter 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.650
 we call that a half-decay 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.750
 per cent 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.729
 this piece is 10 meters so if i'm right 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.420
 fit then the end must be five 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:09.000
 centimeters lower than the start 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.000
 a look or doing looks waters 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 for a small piece like this it is not 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.510
 so hard to have a good decay 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.240
 but how did they do it 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.610
 about those many miles before 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.310
 the romans that built a kind 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.410
 spirit level when you come and look over at 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.960
 large distances the same level of family 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.320
 and so you could end up on the neat 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.320
 to create 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.590
 then starting the trouble was really suggestion 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.150
 you are my bon in the hills at 50 km 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.500
 as the crow flies from the destination 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.880
 in position 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.980
 how mission that that source on the good 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.930
 put hope and corner if you even the 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.850
 towards the route 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.440
 here in mountain and valley have the same 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.050
 issues 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.070
 the name says it all hills and valleys 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.070
 did well around it and that
