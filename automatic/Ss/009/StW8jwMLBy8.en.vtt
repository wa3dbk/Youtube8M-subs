00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
does have a flip phone design so it's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
does have a flip phone design so it's
not<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> usual<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.910> Nokia<00:00:33.239> candybar<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
not the usual of Nokia candybar that

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.750 
not the usual of Nokia candybar that
we've<00:00:33.960> seen<00:00:34.140> for<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.410> long<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> front<00:00:35.670> we

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
we've seen for so long on the front we

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.610 
we've seen for so long on the front we
just<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> camera<00:00:36.719> lens<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.230> there<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.469> no

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
just have a camera lens here there is no

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
just have a camera lens here there is no
flash<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.070> self-portrait<00:00:38.610> mirror<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
flash or self-portrait mirror and the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
flash or self-portrait mirror and the
display<00:00:40.050> down<00:00:40.230> below<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.620> monochrome<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.489> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
display down below is monochrome so you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.459 
display down below is monochrome so you
can't<00:00:41.790> use<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> van<00:00:42.660> taking<00:00:43.020> vanity

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
shots and it doesn't show photo color

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.940

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
idea as well

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.380

thing<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.500> didn't<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.710> about<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> phone<00:00:53.190> is

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
thing I didn't like about the phone is

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.889 
thing I didn't like about the phone is
there<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.579> no<00:00:53.760> controls<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> side<00:00:54.660> so

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
there are no controls on the side so

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.779 
there are no controls on the side so
there's<00:00:55.050> no<00:00:55.170> volume<00:00:55.410> rocker<00:00:55.800> no<00:00:56.460> kind<00:00:56.699> of

camera button or anything like that so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.840
