check<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.820> see<00:00:12.030> which<00:00:12.240> side<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.590> both

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
check to see which side is it is it both

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.039 
check to see which side is it is it both
maybe<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.059> side<00:00:15.330> maybe<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
maybe it's one side maybe it's the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.810 
maybe it's one side maybe it's the
driver<00:00:16.289> side<00:00:16.590> maybe<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> passenger

okay<00:00:47.070> there's<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.879> cv<00:00:49.760> boot<00:00:50.870> there<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:55.190> looks

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
okay there's one cv boot there it looks

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:05.030 
okay there's one cv boot there it looks
most<00:00:56.550> likely<00:00:58.280> going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:01:01.219> um<00:01:03.860> most<00:01:04.860> likely

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
most likely going to be um most likely

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.530 
most likely going to be um most likely
probably<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> other<00:01:06.510> side<00:01:08.150> cuz<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.360> don't

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
probably on the other side cuz I don't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.590 
probably on the other side cuz I don't
see<00:01:09.840> any<00:01:10.020> tear<00:01:10.729> I'm<00:01:11.729> not<00:01:11.970> quite<00:01:12.180> sure<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
see any tear I'm not quite sure if you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.270 
see any tear I'm not quite sure if you
can<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:16.909> kind<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> looked<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.450> it

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
can see that but I kind of looked at it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.830 
can see that but I kind of looked at it
here's<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:22.400> fact<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.850> lab<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:26.750> there's<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
here's the fact is a lab it there's the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.700 
here's the fact is a lab it there's the
other<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:29.600> NASA's<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> passenger<00:01:31.380> side<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
other one NASA's the passenger side and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.640 
other one NASA's the passenger side and
I<00:01:32.070> heard<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> passenger<00:01:32.909> side<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.200> Axel's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
I heard the passenger side of the Axel's

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.319 
I heard the passenger side of the Axel's
locked<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.189> here<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> left<00:01:36.960> side<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.670> let

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
locked in here then the left side so let

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.649 
locked in here then the left side so let
me<00:01:39.360> look<00:01:39.689> here<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:42.950> there<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.659> right

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
me look here and there you go right

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.069 
me look here and there you go right
there<00:01:47.479> is<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.869> driver's<00:01:49.350> side<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:51.810> been

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
there is the driver's side and this been

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.069 
there is the driver's side and this been
probably<00:01:54.290> going<00:01:55.290> off<00:01:55.350> quite<00:01:55.829> some<00:01:56.130> time<00:01:57.079> maybe

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
probably going off quite some time maybe

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.119 
probably going off quite some time maybe
a<00:01:58.259> year<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:01.850> that's<00:02:02.850> it
