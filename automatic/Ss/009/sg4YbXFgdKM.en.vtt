not know it can be it can be taken out

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.810 
not know it can be it can be taken out
by<00:02:02.549> bullets<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.149> has<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:03.990> flare<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.280> takes

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
by bullets it has one flare so it takes

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.719

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
the facts show it is better because even

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.220 
the facts show it is better because even
though<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.430> manually<00:03:14.940> controlled<00:03:15.420> by<00:03:15.720> you

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
running something higher than that like

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.050

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
streak the fact that it has one flare

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.650 
streak the fact that it has one flare
also<00:03:38.280> makes<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.580> better<00:03:38.760> than<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.030> age<00:03:39.270> six

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
also makes it better than the age six

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.080 
also makes it better than the age six
because<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> lot<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:40.950> people<00:03:41.040> run<00:03:41.459> stingers<00:03:42.060> in

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
because a lot of people run stingers in

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.780 
because a lot of people run stingers in
this<00:03:42.540> game<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:44.220> will<00:03:44.340> help<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.580> stay

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
this game and I that will help you stay

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.430 
this game and I that will help you stay
up<00:03:44.820> in<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.030> air<00:03:45.120> for<00:03:45.480> longer<00:03:45.780> considering<00:03:46.260> it

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
up in the air for longer considering it

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.759 
up in the air for longer considering it
has<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:47.720> player<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:51.150> guess<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.720> age<00:03:51.930> 6<00:03:52.470> is

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
has a a player and I guess the age 6 is

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.670 
has a a player and I guess the age 6 is
a<00:03:52.800> kind<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.580> good<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.870> uh<00:03:54.900> because

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
a kind of good but if you uh because

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.080 
a kind of good but if you uh because

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
like if you're the type of players a

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.880

mind dying too much or like being
revealed<00:03:59.310> to<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.360> enemy<00:04:00.739> um<00:04:03.350> then<00:04:04.350> uh<00:04:04.640> yeah<00:04:05.640> I

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
revealed to the enemy um then uh yeah I

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.350 
revealed to the enemy um then uh yeah I
would<00:04:06.000> use<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.450> age<00:04:06.720> 6<00:04:07.790> also<00:04:08.790> if<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.030> don't

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
would use the age 6 also if you don't

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.330 
would use the age 6 also if you don't
like<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.780> use<00:04:09.810> manually<00:04:10.410> control<00:04:10.769> killstreaks

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
like to use manually control killstreaks

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.610 
like to use manually control killstreaks
I<00:04:11.489> would<00:04:11.610> use<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.200> Reaper<00:04:13.590> is

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
I would use that but the Reaper is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.530 
I would use that but the Reaper is
better<00:04:14.550> in<00:04:15.330> my<00:04:15.480> opinion<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:16.310> fact-based<00:04:17.540> it

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
better in my opinion and fact-based it

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.729 
better in my opinion and fact-based it
is<00:04:18.810> better

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
is better

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.749 
is better
now<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:23.780> no<00:04:24.780> judging<00:04:25.500> on<00:04:25.620> my<00:04:25.800> other<00:04:26.009> video<00:04:26.400> the

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
now so no judging on my other video the

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.159 
now so no judging on my other video the
paper<00:04:27.750> over<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:28.229> c-130<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:29.520> should<00:04:29.729> use<00:04:29.970> a

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
paper over a c-130 you should use a

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.909 
paper over a c-130 you should use a
predator<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:32.060> reaper<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.569> pave<00:04:34.139> low<00:04:34.380> as<00:04:34.590> your
