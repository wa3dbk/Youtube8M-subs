carbon hood or stock hood it's kind of a

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.350 
carbon hood or stock hood it's kind of a
weird<00:02:59.550> paint<00:03:00.550> job<00:03:00.790> there<00:03:01.030> isn't<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.330> doesn't

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
weird paint job there isn't it doesn't

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.380

of<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.100> really<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.580> be<00:03:36.670> honest<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.209> think<00:03:37.780> it

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
of it really to be honest I think it

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.660 
of it really to be honest I think it
looks<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.200> lot<00:03:38.290> better<00:03:38.440> stem<00:03:38.800> round<00:03:39.100> bear<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.610> I

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
looks a lot better stem round bear so I

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.890 
looks a lot better stem round bear so I
leave<00:03:39.880> on<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.150> think<00:03:40.390> I'd<00:03:40.480> used<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.750> roll

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900
