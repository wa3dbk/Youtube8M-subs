you'll<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:48.899> outdoor<00:01:49.259> writers

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you'll see some outdoor writers

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.130 
you'll see some outdoor writers
especially<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:51.390> big<00:01:51.540> quads<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
especially have really big quads and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
especially have really big quads and
they're<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.320> balanced<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:52.920> um<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.850> spin

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
they're not balanced out um in spin

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
they're not balanced out um in spin
class<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:54.990> least<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.290> my<00:01:55.470> class<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.070> tell

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
class at least with my class I tell

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.810 
class at least with my class I tell
people<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.060> focus<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.380> pool<00:01:58.950> almost<00:01:59.610> more

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
people to focus on the pool almost more

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.069 
people to focus on the pool almost more
than<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> push<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.689> push<00:02:00.899> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
than the push because the push is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
than the push because the push is
natural<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.070> push<00:02:02.280> meaning<00:02:02.670> Eric<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
natural the push meaning Eric can you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.020 
natural the push meaning Eric can you
get<00:02:03.299> down<00:02:03.420> here

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
get down here

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.360 
get down here
the<00:02:04.420> push<00:02:04.660> meaning<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.320> my<00:02:05.470> seed<00:02:05.740> is<00:02:05.890> too<00:02:06.160> low

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
the push meaning and my seed is too low

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.980 
the push meaning and my seed is too low
so<00:02:06.580> I'm<00:02:06.670> going<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.880> say<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.420> means<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
so I'm going to say that that means the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.930 
so I'm going to say that that means the
front<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.710> pedal<00:02:08.979> stroke<00:02:09.009> that's<00:02:09.369> natural

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
front of the pedal stroke that's natural

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.730 
front of the pedal stroke that's natural
it's<00:02:10.119> natural<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.750> push<00:02:10.929> but<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.350> part<00:02:11.560> that's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
it's natural to push but the part that's

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.380 
it's natural to push but the part that's
not<00:02:11.800> as<00:02:12.100> natural<00:02:12.490> as<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.640> part<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.060> Matt<00:02:13.360> is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
not as natural as the part that Matt is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.360 
not as natural as the part that Matt is
talking<00:02:13.900> about<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.320> that's<00:02:14.470> why<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.740> not<00:02:14.950> in

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
talking about and that's why it's not in

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.910 
talking about and that's why it's not in
his<00:02:15.820> muscle<00:02:16.210> memory<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:17.230> pullback<00:02:17.710> and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
his muscle memory is that pullback and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.490 
his muscle memory is that pullback and
so<00:02:18.490> what<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:18.850> tell<00:02:19.240> people<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.750> do<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:19.930> pretend

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
so what all tell people to do is pretend

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.880 
so what all tell people to do is pretend
there's<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.770> clock<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.190> both<00:02:21.400> sides<00:02:21.730> okay<00:02:22.390> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
there's a clock on both sides okay and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.140 
there's a clock on both sides okay and
what<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.040> want<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.280> do<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.880> want<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.090> think

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
hit every number on that clock so I'm

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.040 
hit every number on that clock so I'm
gonna<00:02:29.170> grab<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.500> phone<00:02:29.680> alright<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.900> most

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
that I'm going around in my pedal stroke

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.770 
that I'm going around in my pedal stroke
you<00:02:42.670> don't<00:02:42.820> want<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.000> wait<00:02:43.120> until<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.510> six

o'clock to start that pull action where

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.220 
o'clock to start that pull action where
the<00:02:45.730> heel<00:02:45.940> comes<00:02:46.209> up<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.750> actually<00:02:47.050> want<00:02:47.200> to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230

work on that if you want your legs to be

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.690 
work on that if you want your legs to be
more<00:03:22.989> balanced<00:03:23.470> naturally<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.250> quad<00:03:24.519> is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
more balanced naturally the quad is

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.460 
more balanced naturally the quad is
about<00:03:24.940> sixty<00:03:25.360> per<00:03:25.570> it's<00:03:25.810> about<00:03:25.959> sixty<00:03:26.350> percent

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
about sixty per it's about sixty percent

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.920 
about sixty per it's about sixty percent
to<00:03:26.799> 40<00:03:27.130> percent<00:03:27.160> as<00:03:27.700> far<00:03:27.880> as<00:03:28.030> power<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.420> the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
to 40 percent as far as power and the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.880 
to 40 percent as far as power and the
size<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:30.010> muscle<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.549> so<00:03:31.390> in<00:03:32.380> what<00:03:32.860> I

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
size of the the muscle and so in what I

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.370 
size of the the muscle and so in what I
shoot<00:03:33.280> for<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.579> if<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.760> look<00:03:33.940> at<00:03:34.180> my<00:03:34.870> legs<00:03:35.110> and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
shoot for it if you look at my legs and

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.630 
shoot for it if you look at my legs and
if<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.590> look<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.860> I'll<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.130> show<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.310> my

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
if you look and I'll just show you my

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.539 
if you look and I'll just show you my
legs<00:03:36.850> they<00:03:37.510> are<00:03:37.540> more<00:03:38.019> balanced<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.070> have

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
legs they are more balanced so I have

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.090 
legs they are more balanced so I have
almost<00:03:39.880> as<00:03:40.239> much<00:03:40.360> hamstring<00:03:40.959> as<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.680> do<00:03:41.739> quad

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
almost as much hamstring as I do quad

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.400 
almost as much hamstring as I do quad
and<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.489> reason<00:03:42.760> for<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.630> practice

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
and the reason for that is I practice

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.319 
and the reason for that is I practice
that<00:03:44.620> pool<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.220> it's<00:03:45.670> one<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.850> those<00:03:46.030> things

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
that pool and it's one of those things

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.850 
that pool and it's one of those things
that's<00:03:46.480> just<00:03:46.600> going<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.870> come<00:03:47.049> in<00:03:47.079> time<00:03:47.380> when

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
that's just going to come in time when

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.270 
that's just going to come in time when
you<00:03:47.980> practice<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:49.150> think<00:03:49.660> round<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.049> round

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
you practice it so think round and round

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.430 
you practice it so think round and round
what<00:03:51.280> do<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.430> guys<00:03:51.519> say<00:03:51.760> about<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.440> think

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
what do you guys say about it I think

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.680 
what do you guys say about it I think
another<00:03:53.620> part<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.190> can<00:03:54.340> practice<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.910> if

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
another part that you can practice is if

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.620 
another part that you can practice is if
we're<00:03:55.989> in<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.230> push<00:03:56.440> back<00:03:56.620> cover<00:03:56.890> position

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
we're in the push back cover position

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.259 
we're in the push back cover position
when<00:03:58.630> you're<00:03:58.810> hovered<00:03:59.410> back<00:03:59.709> focus<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:01.030> the

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
when you're hovered back focus on the

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.759 
when you're hovered back focus on the
pole<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:02.049> got<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.350> kind<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.560> do<00:04:02.650> it

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
pole and you got to kind of do it

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.009 
pole and you got to kind of do it
mentally<00:04:02.980> also<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.880> do<00:04:04.060> but<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.750> got<00:04:04.870> to

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
mentally also you do but you got to

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.630 
mentally also you do but you got to
focus<00:04:05.140> on<00:04:05.440> bringing<00:04:05.560> your<00:04:05.799> heel<00:04:06.070> to<00:04:06.280> your<00:04:06.310> butt

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
focus on bringing your heel to your butt

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.930 
focus on bringing your heel to your butt
or<00:04:06.970> your<00:04:07.000> glute<00:04:07.360> that's<00:04:07.660> true<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.590> I

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
automatically when I switch my thinking

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.450 
automatically when I switch my thinking
to<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.560> heel<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.220> glutes<00:04:12.459> heel<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.849> glutes

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
shift mentally and so I hope that that

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.890 
shift mentally and so I hope that that
answer<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.340> answers<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:43.880> question<00:04:44.090> what

leg<00:04:53.000> drill<00:04:53.390> so<00:04:53.570> they<00:04:53.720> would<00:04:53.870> have<00:04:54.050> people<00:04:54.290> be

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
leg drill so they would have people be

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.220 
leg drill so they would have people be
Clifton<00:04:55.460> or<00:04:55.670> you<00:04:56.060> know<00:04:56.180> still<00:04:56.450> in<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.720> toe

if<00:05:12.200> you're<00:05:12.470> doing<00:05:13.100> this<00:05:13.250> far<00:05:13.520> into<00:05:13.730> a<00:05:13.910> class

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
if you're doing this far into a class

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.590 
if you're doing this far into a class
I<00:05:15.100> don't<00:05:16.100> like<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.280> cuz<00:05:16.670> this<00:05:17.090> part<00:05:17.420> gets

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
I don't like it cuz this part gets

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.600 
I don't like it cuz this part gets
sweated<00:05:18.140> on<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.920> gets<00:05:19.070> really<00:05:19.190> slippery

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
sweated on and it gets really slippery

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.640 
sweated on and it gets really slippery
and<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:20.030> fallen<00:05:20.480> off<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.960> but<00:05:21.440> what<00:05:21.560> do<00:05:21.620> you

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
and I fallen off and but what do you

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.350 
and I fallen off and but what do you
think<00:05:21.800> of<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:21.950> single<00:05:22.100> leg<00:05:22.340> stuff<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:22.700> focus<00:05:23.090> on

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
think of a single leg stuff to focus on

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.360 
think of a single leg stuff to focus on
different<00:05:23.600> studies<00:05:24.230> were<00:05:24.410> do<00:05:24.620> it<00:05:24.800> another

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
different studies were do it another

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.950 
different studies were do it another
thing<00:05:25.640> that<00:05:25.760> you<00:05:25.880> can<00:05:26.000> do<00:05:26.210> that's<00:05:26.450> probably<00:05:26.840> a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
thing that you can do that's probably a

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.170 
thing that you can do that's probably a
little<00:05:27.200> bit<00:05:27.350> more<00:05:27.530> safe<00:05:27.830> is<00:05:28.160> it's<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.850> exact

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
little bit more safe is it's the exact

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.360 
little bit more safe is it's the exact
same<00:05:29.210> idea<00:05:29.840> but<00:05:30.140> you're<00:05:30.410> just<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:30.890> you<00:05:30.950> stay<00:05:31.340> in

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
same idea but you're just so you stay in

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.160 
same idea but you're just so you stay in
on<00:05:31.820> both<00:05:32.030> sides<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:32.510> you're<00:05:32.660> flipped<00:05:32.900> in<00:05:33.020> on

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
on both sides so you're flipped in on

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.410 
on both sides so you're flipped in on
both<00:05:33.320> sides<00:05:33.650> but<00:05:34.130> you're<00:05:34.310> focusing<00:05:34.520> only<00:05:35.060> on

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
both sides but you're focusing only on

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.420 
both sides but you're focusing only on
the<00:05:35.630> right<00:05:35.990> leg<00:05:36.230> are<00:05:36.410> only<00:05:36.650> on<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.070> left<00:05:37.280> leg

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
the right leg are only on the left leg

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.830 
the right leg are only on the left leg
so<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.610> would<00:05:37.820> say<00:05:38.000> that<00:05:38.030> that's<00:05:38.390> the<00:05:38.630> same

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
so I would say that that's the same

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.630 
so I would say that that's the same
concept<00:05:39.140> got<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.710> little<00:05:39.950> bit<00:05:40.070> of<00:05:40.130> a<00:05:40.220> safer

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
concept got a little bit of a safer

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.940 
concept got a little bit of a safer
drill<00:05:40.910> so<00:05:41.540> you're<00:05:41.750> pumping<00:05:42.110> around<00:05:42.380> you<00:05:42.860> know

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
drill so you're pumping around you know

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.010 
drill so you're pumping around you know
as<00:05:43.040> far<00:05:43.160> as<00:05:43.220> drills<00:05:43.790> ask<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.510> know<00:05:44.600> Matt<00:05:44.810> ask

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
as far as drills ask you know Matt ask

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.630 
as far as drills ask you know Matt ask
for<00:05:45.230> drills<00:05:45.410> you<00:05:45.860> can<00:05:45.890> do<00:05:46.160> that<00:05:46.340> where<00:05:46.520> you're

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
for drills you can do that where you're

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.580 
for drills you can do that where you're
pumping<00:05:47.030> just<00:05:47.330> with<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.660> right<00:05:47.840> leg<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.260> then

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
pumping just with the right leg and then

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.380 
pumping just with the right leg and then
just<00:05:48.950> with<00:05:49.160> the<00:05:49.190> left<00:05:49.490> leg<00:05:49.580> focusing<00:05:50.180> on<00:05:50.300> the

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
just with the left leg focusing on the

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.910 
just with the left leg focusing on the
push<00:05:50.600> and<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:50.930> pull<00:05:50.960> action<00:05:51.500> at<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.710> same

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
push and the pull action at the same

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.820 
push and the pull action at the same
time<00:05:52.130> so<00:05:52.550> let<00:05:52.760> one<00:05:52.970> leg<00:05:53.210> go<00:05:53.450> dead<00:05:53.750> exactly<00:05:54.620> so

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
time so let one leg go dead exactly so

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.380 
time so let one leg go dead exactly so
it's<00:05:55.040> just<00:05:55.190> kind<00:05:55.460> of<00:05:55.490> a<00:05:55.580> longer<00:05:55.910> for<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.210> ride

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
it's just kind of a longer for the ride

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.240 
it's just kind of a longer for the ride
while<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:56.930> other<00:05:57.080> one<00:05:57.290> is<00:05:57.410> doing<00:05:57.530> a<00:05:57.740> lower<00:05:57.890> so

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
while the other one is doing a lower so

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.280 
while the other one is doing a lower so
I<00:05:58.280> would<00:05:58.520> say<00:05:58.700> that<00:05:58.850> that's<00:05:58.940> probably<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.510> safer

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
I would say that that's probably a safer

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.100 
I would say that that's probably a safer
drill<00:06:00.530> okay<00:06:00.680> good<00:06:01.010> okay<00:06:01.130> and<00:06:01.870> another<00:06:02.870> thing

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
guys so so that's the muscle memory but

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.400
