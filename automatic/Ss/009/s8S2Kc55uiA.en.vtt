 j clash sw's coming to turn 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.950
 listening 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.150
 hope makes us live we get out of any case 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.710
 look for those who keep smiling 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.120
 there are still some lands 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.560
 for those who transcribe their lives 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390
 on paper to forget everything 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.770
 long live the sport, even you feel 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.390
 tarbes and those who graffit the walls 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 spend their time running away 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.660
 those who had a difficult past but 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 are ready to challenge the future what you 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.390
 see coming retirement by the mother touches 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.100
 not the little one squeeze the elbows 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.360
 to the bigger ones and say they have on 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.190
 the little ones do not care about you 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.080
 size the currency is to go inside of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 do not let go until you're there 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.050
 leave teeth with or without 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.699
 antecedent home little soldiers 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.019
 are veterans and are already 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.610
 for the older ones for what the 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.559
 everyday you do not want to be a mere 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.000
 in the crowd I represent the towers and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.009
 all these young people who get clogged 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.570
 this crowd of beauf brandishing the same 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.100
 signed way authentic clean 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.030
 leaving the pain behind me is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.040
 for those who hang out 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 which hinders those who bleed what they do not 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.070
 not give up does not brake when the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.259
 limits which I explain to you our lives 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.470
 so low when we fight it's for the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.420
 turns is bad 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.020
 squatters his scratching one could vote 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.020
 raise 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.700
 hiller that at the bottom of their house it's not going 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.289
 until very late in every corner 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.240
 of my tricks his skin his tarmac on the 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.829
 sidewalk so it does not crack that 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.390
 continues his studies for those who 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.039
 tear up as much in school as in front 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.630
 he suits the hostile youth 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.039
 those who have the art and the way have 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.450
 more than one round in their pregnancy who 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.310
 want to look like big brother too 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.689
 for my dirty guy that vi took for 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.219
 target I can not deny that it's sad 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.959
 to see brothers in the precipice 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.850
 those who dream of revolt but have 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.500
 not a word to say brother go out of ta 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.810
 cage they can not stop you from acting 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.670
 those who are closed with or without reason 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.289
 which would give time for tolerance 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.909
 or freedom of expression often 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.799
 too much pressure at school rarely to 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.640
 their opinion me I represent my city I 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.619
 remember my life 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.479
 always the same banner with us 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.829
 hip hop argues that the whole crowd makes 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.239
 noise is so nene turn as much 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.050
 loosen up for those who hang out 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.550
 which hinders those who have 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.380
 who does not give in does not brake when the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480
 legal limits I tell you we live 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.250
 down here when we fight it's for the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.380
 turns these thugs these squatters his 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.380
 bleachers w 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.440
 it is for those who hang what bothers 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.850
 what was said what they do not give up 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.830
 do not take when the limits the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.810
 technical sheaths we live down here when 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.610

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.610
