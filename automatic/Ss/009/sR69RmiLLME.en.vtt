00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.040
 how about movie friends gamers and 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.750
 welcome to this little video in 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.070
 where are we going to continue talking a bit about 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.990
 what his opinion has said about the 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.760
 new troop yesterday we had already 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.580
 announced that it had finally been announced 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.889
 that there was going to be a new barrack level 6 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.710
 and well I had told them that 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.570
 I suspected that he said that of suspecting 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.189
 that by the design that it had could be 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.140
 for town hall at day level since 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.849
 also the town hall at level 10 of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.759
 design is also lava and that then 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.169
 well I went around here I had 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.609
 half an hour of having published the 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.920
 image there was nothing shows much of 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.500
 where to hold on but now right now 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.090
 They have spent 24 hours a little longer whether 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.640
 We can read in the official account of 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.730
 twitter of your profile where there was 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.530
 sign that the dark shack is 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.539
 who said yes or the dark barracks that 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.089
 it's like I know it's going to be from 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.829
 from town hall level 9 that's very 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.989
 important because good at least not me 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.280
 forces me to say you know that they 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.379
 I wanted to hold on a bit longer in the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.050
 city â€‹â€‹hall level 9 and for this thing 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.909
 the same and if it was going to rise fortunately 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.690
 As you get over the son, we 're going to 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.549
 go down 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.810
 that was going to be for town halls level 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.460
 9 and well another thing that this was mentioned 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.759
 and which is what we are 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.740
 showing below is this picture 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.860
 where they are giving us a small 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.430
 hint that this may be the new 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.899
 unit some we are leaving if you 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.070
 they left me there in their comments for 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.899
 I remind you that it is very important 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.119
 here comments are left below 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.920
 what do you think it can be and that's what we 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.780
 they had said that by design 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.090
 It had to be something about fire 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.320
 what we see here seems to be 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.080
 completely in accordance with the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.250
 workshops this remember that firefox is 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.750
 the word in English after fires 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:49.009
 artificial is this then it seems to be 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.289
 like a fire golem as well as the the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.460
 if they want to say what some 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.229
 of you told me yesterday in your 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.210
 comments equal and this are more than 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.210
 that person were more than what 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.789
 correct than I thought yesterday but 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.840
 I do not know this also for several 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.130
 comments where they say it can be 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.020
 an air unit 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.090
 since at the moment there were only the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.060
 minions this could be totally 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.120
 true it could be an air unit I would 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.860
 imagine a merger between that is a 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.660
 tiny unit like what is the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.450
 minion the minimum if you have a game in 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.250
 English more than in addition but at the same 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.080
 time as a golem as well as a golem 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.480
 very small blown Now when 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.610
 it breaks and this little one is accepted yet 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.989
 smaller than that that had wings like that 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.660
 like flying and at the same time 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.080
 had in design is what we are 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.380
 watching right now and how good was the lava 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.360
 things so for the moment good is 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.220
 everything that is known about the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.410
 unit on the other hand also super cell 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.910
 affirms that as with the 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.860
 defense castle when we are in 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.220
 war is no longer necessary that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.840
 example if someone needs to donate and vice 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.430
 healthy because I'm one but you know that if 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.230
 you want to donate this shot what I have and 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.970
 if you are going to donate the same thing to help 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.519
 to donate as I fill it again 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.200
 and before you had to go to the campaign 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.329
 the elves was the simplest way to 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.280
 throw it or good if you were in my case 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.660
 that sometimes with this goes from losing 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.770
 special trophies until it's going to be the 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.680
 castle 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.720
 so that x would return if he already lost now 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.090
 thanks to this new update 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.980
 superior it is confirmed that we will be able to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.420
 throw the castle as we do it like 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.340
 that with the defense castle in the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.650
 war we're going to have less button already 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.300
 I mean, you know, I need the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.330
 come on, they gave me not the doubles 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.920
 we throw and good the only bad thing until 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.360
 right now I think that if we go to 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.700
 have to keep waiting for the 20 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.310
 minutes to be able to ask again 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.400
 donate however this new one is appreciated 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.680
 change that is happening and good 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.710
 reminds me of your comments 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.990
 more original comments that they believe 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.540
 that can happen as with this new 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.400
 melon unit I'll tell you after a while 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.980
 in the stream remember that today at 8 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.170
 of the night pm we have the stream of this 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.490
 Wednesday of farming that is going to be this 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.900
 live for those who want 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.630
 join us good take advantage well 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.060
 special this about what is going to be this 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.310
 unit I also prefer to talk about it live 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.720
 because I have my doubts about this 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.520
 and I prefer to read your comments that 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.590
 believe that you make this unit believe that of 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.450
 do something specific that is immune to 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.800
 something for example that is immune to 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.959
 air defense 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.060
 or that for example they do very little damage 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.709
 the air defense or do you think it's going 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.000
 After some unit, all that can be done to me 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.210
 leave here in your comments the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.100
 comments this most original those that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.540
 I think there could be the thing the 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.640
 I read live the minute we are in the 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.590
 extreme good after I am your friend 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.920
 peter that they are very well and until the 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.190
 next 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.190
 bye bye 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.469
 it is now 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.619
