00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
master card now if we were to pack say a

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.420 
master card now if we were to pack say a
one<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.300> watch<00:02:25.480> player<00:02:25.780> or<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.110> rising<00:02:26.680> star<00:02:26.830> or

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
a MasterCard they all get their bonuses

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.920 
a MasterCard they all get their bonuses
so<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> first<00:02:30.580> one<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.450> thought<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.720> think

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
so the first one is I thought I think

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.330 
so the first one is I thought I think
it's<00:02:32.110> actually<00:02:32.349> what<00:02:32.590> goes<00:02:32.739> in<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.010> order

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
it's actually what goes in this order

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.580 
it's actually what goes in this order
the<00:02:33.970> first<00:02:34.209> one<00:02:34.420> would<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.599> one<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.140> watch<00:02:35.290> now

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
the first one would be one to watch now

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.530 
the first one would be one to watch now
if<00:02:35.709> we<00:02:35.830> do<00:02:35.980> pack<00:02:36.250> one<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.610> those<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:37.209> get<00:02:37.420> to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
if we do pack one of those we get to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.210 
if we do pack one of those we get to
bring<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.900> player<00:02:38.050> from<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.950> same
