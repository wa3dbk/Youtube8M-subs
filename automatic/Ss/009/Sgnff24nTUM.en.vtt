00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.799
 Hello you love the winners of our 2009 Christmas campaign 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:18.859
 We had asked how many Amonwan did Semper Video have 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.859
 15 12 10 2009 11 pm 59 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.220
 3223 is the right number that we have built in our table and out 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.970
 which then gives the wins Eppstein 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.970
 Ambri to wear one 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.310
 Here's a corridor, for example, when typing on the nest 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.070
 would have 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.120
 at this correct numbers they could have typed 29 18 to 35 28 that 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.730
 we have been all right 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.870
 you can easily understand the winners we have determined ourselves 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.659
 have the table in front of our website 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.709
 Enter the number and then compare it with the channel comments 

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:01.279
 of course there are several users who have the right tip but like in that 

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:04.609
 Video says then counts the order of the entrance 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.580
 So what you possibly typed a week before the expiration of this action correctly 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.560
 unfortunately not enough if all the other two weeks before correctly 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.970
 have typed 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.050
 We also had some tips about the commenting feature of the video 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.100
 we would not get our basic set 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.310
 and let be just five but very old unfair to the muezzin the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.469
 have kept to the rules mentioned in the video and just stop 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.670
 killed in Yemen 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 we will now introduce many users who are winners and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.460
 Although the first winner in the order are the winner of the four 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.020
 Winners will now need a sequence of prizes like theirs 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.820
 want to have 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.150
 more info in the reason video 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.770
 The first winner will get the price he gets first 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.520
 want 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.900
 The second winner can then only choose between the remaining ones 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 remaining prices in quotes 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.659
 that means we need the corresponding lists because then 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.020
 The result is what the second winner can still get the third 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.400
 Winners fear that winners can unfortunately turn into overpainting over again 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.020
 Unfortunately 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.329
 just say what the other three winners did not want 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.669
 For whatever reason, the profits should not be with us 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.699
 We can not wait to let the others wait so far 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.399
 now someone the small one 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.209
 so if she does not say what he wants at 14 first winner then the second one 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.919
 also choose nothing and so on and so on about the number he up to 24 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:24.579
 Bit off 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:25.620
 To bring to an end 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.650
 So sign up via your youtube account and send us the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.289
 List no later than 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:31.970
 twentieth twelfth 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.970
 then she should work it out with the 24 Ston 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.559
 in the end then a little bad news and indeed the teaching networks 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.180
 not yet provided the promised powerline adapter 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.330
 We try to reach the guys for some time but not if 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.620
 that somebody before not as far as if we wait there something before we the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.579
 Rather than report a failure 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.530
 then it may be in this respect nothing more until the 24 ston if all 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.849
 Of course we'll jump from Semper Video this spring 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.279
 for this lost price and stands for it straight 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:07.040
 then we go to normal trading to get in Power Kit send them 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:08.429
 at Easter too 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.639
 but that's not likely to be from Lea Networks 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.129
 This is only as information if the winners that the animals price selection 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.650
 So if you are for one you want to consider 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.600
 I really wanted the UBA to be that nothing will be meat if 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.419
 she then Massa on the second prize 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.519
 let's go 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.739
 the winners are 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.149
 «Space Tourists» the 7 6 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:33.099
 Only typed 99 in March 2009 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.679
 at 16 10 the judge at half past midnight 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.039
 at half past eight 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:43.319
 so 2999 Huber the table at sixteenth he is 2009 or 99 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.689
 the corridor until 29 18 until the 30 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.869
 So he's definitely in it that's right 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.579
 second winner 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.249
 Alexie l 8 7 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.199
 30 is tilted 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.369
 30 is also in the profit corridor in it 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:03.609
 yes at the same 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.999
 Jarque is ticking 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.209
 Profen excavations on too 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.659
 Sixteenth eleventh 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.820
 10 o'clock 26 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.820
 So this is the second winner Alexi II 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.569
 Third winner 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.190
 Michael Mann Rapa x 3200 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.520
 also on 16 11 ask Dreyer 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.430
 1 pm 4 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.059
 3200 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:32.779
 pretty close with 3200 Lite 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.639
 Even at the right number of this crowd has made Ewald Nowotny hours in the 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.270
 first and gave the seniors to Israel again even looked at 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.759
 the first hit 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.139
 paints first 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.710
 So whether he won the Mindener police that is the third prize 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.779
 and 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:53.800
 fourth prize solved 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.860
 wat 200 the killer with 3100 BF 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.400
 3100 BBQ also between 29 18 and 31 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.939
 35 28 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:15.249
 all have typed on the same day only from the current is different he too 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.189
 on 16 Alston this is because he started the action there and there 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.639
 paints a lot of people there 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:22.810
 because of that 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.810
 all hits on this day 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.970
 So these profits 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.410
 let us get the list, we will send you as soon as possible 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.840
 Prices here again on our website in the event of 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.059
 Cases that he still does not know exactly what he needs 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.809
 All other users will only want more luck next time 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:43.229
 left 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.069
 As I said, they can understand the number and possibly get there 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.349
 now annoy some because they typed correctly but just stop in 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.059
 which video commentary is not in the channel comments and in the video 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.069
 that was clearly mentioned before 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:58.469
 so far that would be unfair to the other users 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:01.929
 You do not have to go straight to the gunman to be the next one 

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.659
 Sion is already in planning so there is still a lot to come
