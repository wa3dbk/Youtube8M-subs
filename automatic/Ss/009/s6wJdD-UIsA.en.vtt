a good attack position in stat of 86 and
he<00:04:05.810> also<00:04:06.020> has<00:04:06.380> high<00:04:06.920> attacking<00:04:07.400> work<00:04:07.580> red<00:04:07.760> and

medium<00:04:08.690> defensive<00:04:09.290> workrate<00:04:09.650> which<00:04:09.920> is

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
medium defensive workrate which is

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.740 
medium defensive workrate which is
pretty<00:04:10.250> decent<00:04:10.520> workers<00:04:11.090> from<00:04:11.239> striker<00:04:11.510> guys

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
pretty decent workers from striker guys

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.300 
pretty decent workers from striker guys
obviously<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.230> perfect<00:04:12.620> will<00:04:12.739> be<00:04:12.860> high<00:04:13.010> low

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
obviously the perfect will be high low

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.729 
obviously the perfect will be high low
but<00:04:14.000> high<00:04:14.570> medium<00:04:15.020> is<00:04:15.140> good<00:04:15.260> enough<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:15.620> work

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
but high medium is good enough to work

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.140 
but high medium is good enough to work
with<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.190> had<00:04:16.400> no<00:04:16.549> problems<00:04:17.000> whatsoever

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
dribbling a ball control for me was

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.900 
dribbling a ball control for me was
pretty<00:04:22.820> decent<00:04:23.330> as<00:04:23.510> well

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
pretty decent as well

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.430 
pretty decent as well

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.510 
people told me that is dribbling a ball
control<00:04:27.510> was<00:04:28.020> terrible<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.370> honestly

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
control was terrible but I honestly

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.210 
control was terrible but I honestly
found<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.150> good<00:04:30.360> enough<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.690> not<00:04:31.620> be<00:04:31.800> added<00:04:32.100> as

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
found it good enough to not be added as

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.860

a weakness you know it's not absolutely
insane<00:04:34.620> but<00:04:35.190> it's<00:04:35.340> not<00:04:35.430> terribly<00:04:36.120> poor<00:04:36.510> at<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
insane but it's not terribly poor at the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.260 
insane but it's not terribly poor at the
same<00:04:37.170> time<00:04:37.410> it's<00:04:37.650> sort<00:04:37.800> of<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:38.040> between
