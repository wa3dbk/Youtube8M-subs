kind of just picking it as I go how they

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.130 
kind of just picking it as I go how they
create<00:01:11.909> hard<00:01:12.210> light<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> would<00:01:12.720> explain<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
create hard light and would explain that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.010 
create hard light and would explain that
howl<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.770> use<00:01:13.950> slipspace<00:01:14.400> how<00:01:15.299> they<00:01:15.450> create

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
howl they use slipspace how they create

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
howl they use slipspace how they create

let's go take about 30 minutes 30 to 40

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.060 
let's go take about 30 minutes 30 to 40
minutes<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.170> talk<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
minutes to talk about all of it and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.399 
minutes to talk about all of it and
explain<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> understand<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.689> um

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the second part uh is going to probably

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.890 
the second part uh is going to probably
shorter<00:02:11.370> 25<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.000> 30<00:02:12.209> minutes<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:12.780> going

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
shorter 25 to 30 minutes and it's going

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.180

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
dimensional plane well you couldn't

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.570 
dimensional plane well you couldn't
really<00:02:54.870> call<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.769> nine<00:02:56.040> dimensional

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
and then we'll be to the explanation

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.309 
and then we'll be to the explanation
later<00:03:46.489> um<00:03:47.489> why<00:03:48.090> did<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.420> forerunners<00:03:48.930> not

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
later um why did the forerunners not

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.650 
later um why did the forerunners not
clone<00:03:50.010> themselves<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.850> send<00:03:51.209> their<00:03:51.359> species

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
clone themselves and send their species

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.009 
clone themselves and send their species
back<00:03:52.170> out<00:03:52.380> into<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> galaxy

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.360 

doesn't<00:03:56.019> make<00:03:56.110> any<00:03:56.319> sense<00:03:56.560> right<00:03:56.920> they<00:03:57.159> wipe

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
doesn't make any sense right they wipe

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.280 
doesn't make any sense right they wipe
the<00:03:57.580> entire<00:03:57.700> galaxy<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.510> all<00:03:58.629> sentient<00:03:58.900> life

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
the entire galaxy of all sentient life

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.649 
the entire galaxy of all sentient life
and<00:03:59.760> then<00:04:00.760> they're<00:04:00.909> absent<00:04:01.299> from<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.540> whole

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
and then they're absent from the whole

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.759 
and then they're absent from the whole
picture<00:04:03.450> why<00:04:04.450> why<00:04:04.870> they<00:04:05.200> cloned<00:04:05.440> everything

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
picture why why they cloned everything

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.229 
picture why why they cloned everything
else<00:04:05.890> except<00:04:06.190> themselves<00:04:06.340> why<00:04:06.700> couldn't<00:04:07.180> they

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
else except themselves why couldn't they

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.670 
else except themselves why couldn't they
just<00:04:07.269> do<00:04:07.540> that<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.750> their<00:04:07.870> own<00:04:07.959> race<00:04:08.110> tree<00:04:08.409> help

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
just do that to their own race tree help

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.759 
just do that to their own race tree help
you<00:04:08.890> know<00:04:09.010> why<00:04:09.849> why<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:13.150> answer<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:16.440> well<00:04:17.440> I

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
you know why why the answer is well I

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.439 
you know why why the answer is well I
don't<00:04:18.519> know<00:04:18.639> if<00:04:18.729> I<00:04:18.760> can<00:04:18.850> actually<00:04:19.150> say<00:04:19.299> there

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
don't know if I can actually say there

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.140 
don't know if I can actually say there
is<00:04:19.720> an<00:04:20.049> answer<00:04:23.699> we'll<00:04:24.699> get<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.000> later

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
is an answer we'll get to that later

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.529 
is an answer we'll get to that later
though<00:04:25.660> it's<00:04:25.919> for<00:04:26.919> later<00:04:27.100> later<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:28.240> it's<00:04:28.389> your

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
though it's for later later so it's your

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:29.840 
though it's for later later so it's your
dessert<00:04:28.870> if<00:04:29.169> there<00:04:29.440> is<00:04:29.500> anything

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
dessert if there is anything

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.500 
dessert if there is anything
technological<00:04:30.850> wise<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.240> would<00:04:31.360> like

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
technological wise you would like

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.870 
technological wise you would like
specifically<00:04:32.199> to<00:04:32.320> know<00:04:32.470> how<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.740> work<00:04:32.979> that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
specifically to know how to work that

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.140 
specifically to know how to work that
that<00:04:34.240> works<00:04:34.449> that<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.110> foreigners<00:04:35.440> have

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
that works that the foreigners have

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.520 
that works that the foreigners have
leave<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.539> comments<00:04:37.720> below<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.169> be

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
as specific as possible so I can really

you<00:04:47.199> can<00:04:47.440> maybe<00:04:47.770> even<00:04:48.010> what<00:04:48.220> page<00:04:48.490> that'd<00:04:48.970> be

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
you can maybe even what page that'd be

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.390 
you can maybe even what page that'd be
really<00:04:49.300> nice<00:04:49.600> or<00:04:49.900> if<00:04:50.650> it's<00:04:50.949> in<00:04:51.100> one<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.280> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
really nice or if it's in one of the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.670 
really nice or if it's in one of the
games<00:04:51.520> which<00:04:52.090> game<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.690> know<00:04:52.930> what<00:04:53.199> terminal

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
games which game you know what terminal

games which game you know what terminal
in<00:04:54.100> which<00:04:54.310> game<00:04:54.550> or<00:04:54.940> cutscene<00:04:55.539> or<00:04:55.780> you<00:04:56.229> know

in which game or cutscene or you know

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.440 
in which game or cutscene or you know
anything<00:04:56.710> that<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:56.919> can<00:04:57.070> reference<00:04:57.450> when

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
anything that you can reference when

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.550 
anything that you can reference when
you're<00:04:58.539> asking<00:04:58.870> these<00:04:58.930> questions<00:04:59.410> that

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
you're asking these questions that

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.930 
you're asking these questions that
you've<00:04:59.680> seen<00:04:59.889> its<00:05:00.099> like<00:05:00.190> how<00:05:00.430> does<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.729> work

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
you've seen its like how does that work

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.400 
you've seen its like how does that work
that<00:05:01.150> would<00:05:01.240> be<00:05:01.330> great<00:05:01.450> I'm<00:05:01.840> going<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.169> explain

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
that would be great I'm going to explain

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.159 
that would be great I'm going to explain
how<00:05:02.470> hard<00:05:02.830> light<00:05:03.010> works<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:04.120> or<00:05:04.690> how<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:04.840> think

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
how hard light works so or how I think

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.050 
how hard light works so or how I think
it<00:05:05.320> works<00:05:05.500> which<00:05:05.860> is<00:05:06.039> I<00:05:06.310> think<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.760> really<00:05:07.270> good

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
it works which is I think a really good

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
it works which is I think a really good
hypothesis<00:05:10.060> I'm<00:05:10.210> not<00:05:10.330> gonna<00:05:10.419> say<00:05:10.570> guess<00:05:10.810> cuz

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
hypothesis I'm not gonna say guess cuz

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.379 
hypothesis I'm not gonna say guess cuz
it's<00:05:11.260> pretty<00:05:11.500> it's<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.400> very<00:05:12.580> educated<00:05:13.090> guess

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
it's pretty it's a very educated guess

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.250 
it's pretty it's a very educated guess
so<00:05:13.630> it's<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.840> hypothesis<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.560> how<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.800> works<00:05:15.010> um

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
so it's a hypothesis is how it works um

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.810 
so it's a hypothesis is how it works um
I'm<00:05:17.260> gonna<00:05:17.590> explain<00:05:17.889> how<00:05:18.070> they<00:05:18.190> create<00:05:18.460> things

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
I'm gonna explain how they create things

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.010 
I'm gonna explain how they create things
their<00:05:19.060> architecture<00:05:19.630> how<00:05:19.780> they<00:05:19.870> create

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
their architecture how they create

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.440 
their architecture how they create
baylor<00:05:20.410> rings<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.919> arc<00:05:21.130> I'm<00:05:22.120> going<00:05:22.389> to

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
baylor rings the arc I'm going to

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.980 
baylor rings the arc I'm going to
explain<00:05:22.690> how<00:05:22.840> they<00:05:22.960> do<00:05:23.050> slipspace<00:05:23.550> or<00:05:24.550> try<00:05:24.700> to

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
explain how they do slipspace or try to

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.620 
explain how they do slipspace or try to
that<00:05:25.990> one's<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.500> little<00:05:26.680> tougher<00:05:27.389> because<00:05:28.389> it

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
that one's a little tougher because it

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.350 
that one's a little tougher because it
involves<00:05:29.169> quantum<00:05:29.919> mechanics<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.639> a<00:05:30.700> frozen

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
involves quantum mechanics and a frozen

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.940 
involves quantum mechanics and a frozen
bridge<00:05:32.050> thingy<00:05:32.530> um<00:05:33.750> that<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:35.020> made<00:05:35.260> me<00:05:35.410> cry<00:05:35.650> a

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
bridge thingy um that that made me cry a

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.040 
bridge thingy um that that made me cry a
little<00:05:36.130> bit<00:05:36.250> as<00:05:36.729> i<00:05:36.970> was<00:05:37.090> reading<00:05:37.270> stuff<00:05:37.870> my
