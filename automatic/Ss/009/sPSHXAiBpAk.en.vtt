easy<00:05:19.030> enough<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.389> use<00:05:20.070> like<00:05:21.070> I<00:05:21.220> said<00:05:21.490> marksman

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
easy enough to use like I said marksman

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.060 
easy enough to use like I said marksman
sites<00:05:22.210> have<00:05:22.479> more<00:05:22.690> impact<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.680> if<00:05:23.949> you're

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070
