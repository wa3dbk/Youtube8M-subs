00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
because why would you and no second gas

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.560 
because why would you and no second gas
here<00:01:58.520> for<00:01:58.670> squirrel<00:01:58.880> he<00:01:59.030> probably<00:01:59.240> will<00:01:59.420> take

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
here for squirrel he probably will take

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.330 
here for squirrel he probably will take
one<00:01:59.750> soon<00:01:59.960> but<00:02:00.230> he<00:02:00.380> may<00:02:00.560> decide<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.950> try<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.190> use

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
one soon but he may decide to try to use

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.750 
one soon but he may decide to try to use
his<00:02:01.490> probe<00:02:01.730> to<00:02:02.270> for<00:02:02.540> gate<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.900> would<00:02:03.080> be<00:02:03.760> yeah

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
his probe to for gate that would be yeah

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.250 
his probe to for gate that would be yeah
I'd<00:02:04.940> be<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.270> risky<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.690> mean<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.200> a

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
I'd be so risky I mean this is not a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.960 
I'd be so risky I mean this is not a
normal<00:02:06.500> strategy<00:02:07.040> but<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.250> mean<00:02:07.430> it's<00:02:07.580> squirtle

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
normal strategy but I mean it's squirtle

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.430 
normal strategy but I mean it's squirtle
he<00:02:08.119> just<00:02:08.330> doesn't<00:02:08.630> hesitate<00:02:08.750> with<00:02:09.140> stuff<00:02:09.380> like

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
he just doesn't hesitate with stuff like

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.110 
he just doesn't hesitate with stuff like
this<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.980> then<00:02:10.130> second<00:02:10.429> guys<00:02:10.610> still<00:02:10.880> oh<00:02:10.910> my

I have two chances to make this work do
I<00:02:23.570> really<00:02:23.810> play<00:02:24.170> straight<00:02:24.560> up<00:02:24.740> in<00:02:24.890> both<00:02:25.130> best

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
I really play straight up in both best

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.820 
I really play straight up in both best

of threes or do I try to mix mix things
up<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.070> little<00:02:28.190> bit<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.520> now<00:02:28.910> we<00:02:28.970> have<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.330> pro

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
up a little bit and now we have the pro

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.750 
up a little bit and now we have the pro
of<00:02:29.720> Crater<00:02:30.020> insane<00:02:30.740> Bay<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.160> he's<00:02:31.520> scouting

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
of Crater insane Bay and he's scouting

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.120 
of Crater insane Bay and he's scouting
in<00:02:32.030> exactly<00:02:32.390> yeah<00:02:32.540> he<00:02:33.050> sees<00:02:33.350> no<00:02:33.380> second<00:02:33.980> gas

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
in exactly yeah he sees no second gas

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.740 
in exactly yeah he sees no second gas
and<00:02:34.430> he<00:02:34.490> sees<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.820> chrono<00:02:35.060> on<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.390> work<00:02:35.540> eight

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and he sees the chrono on the work eight

and he sees the chrono on the work eight
research<00:02:36.140> but<00:02:36.500> he's<00:02:37.190> not<00:02:37.430> seeing<00:02:37.790> this

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
research but he's not seeing this

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.040 
research but he's not seeing this
probiem<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.450> cannot<00:02:38.660> believe<00:02:38.840> he's<00:02:39.020> not

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
probiem I cannot believe he's not

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.750 
probiem I cannot believe he's not
checking<00:02:39.380> for<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.830> after<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:40.160> situation

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
checking for it after this situation

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.690 
checking for it after this situation
he's<00:02:41.480> trying<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:41.989> fake<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.350> gas<00:02:42.530> here<00:02:42.890> yes<00:02:43.580> but

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
he's trying to fake the gas here yes but

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.310 
he's trying to fake the gas here yes but
he's<00:02:43.820> not<00:02:43.910> gonna<00:02:44.060> kill<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.330> kill<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> probe<00:02:44.810> in

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
he's not gonna kill to kill the probe in

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.870 
he's not gonna kill to kill the probe in
time<00:02:45.620> he's<00:02:45.920> just<00:02:45.950> not<00:02:46.160> gonna<00:02:46.280> mine<00:02:46.489> from<00:02:46.730> it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
time he's just not gonna mine from it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.729 
time he's just not gonna mine from it
very<00:02:47.060> likely<00:02:47.239> if<00:02:47.600> he<00:02:48.140> wants<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.440> commit<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
very likely if he wants to commit to

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.780 
very likely if he wants to commit to
this<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.070> still<00:02:49.310> fall<00:02:49.489> back<00:02:49.670> to

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
this you can still fall back to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.920 
this you can still fall back to
something<00:02:49.970> else<00:02:50.150> oh<00:02:51.700> wow<00:02:52.700> he<00:02:53.060> doesn't<00:02:53.420> see<00:02:53.630> it

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
something else oh wow he doesn't see it

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.630 
something else oh wow he doesn't see it
still<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.560> here<00:02:54.739> come<00:02:55.010> those<00:02:55.160> sentries

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.259 
spotted he sees it is to put the pylon

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.850 
gateway in his main nope island he's
gonna<00:03:17.660> just<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.019> three<00:03:18.260> gateway<00:03:18.530> expand

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
gonna just do a three gateway expand

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.210 
gonna just do a three gateway expand
very<00:03:19.760> likely<00:03:20.000> here<00:03:20.269> now<00:03:20.560> hey<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:21.739> have<00:03:21.830> him<00:03:21.980> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
very likely here now hey we have him the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.240 
very likely here now hey we have him the
probe<00:03:22.550> dies<00:03:22.940> risky<00:03:23.840> risky<00:03:24.019> built<00:03:24.470> by<00:03:24.739> squirtle

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
probe dies risky risky built by squirtle

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.949 
probe dies risky risky built by squirtle
but<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.400> really<00:03:25.850> liked<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.480> takes<00:03:26.660> this

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
but I really liked it it takes this

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.320 
but I really liked it it takes this
gamble<00:03:27.440> yeah<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.370> he<00:03:28.610> actually<00:03:28.730> canceled<00:03:29.180> two

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
gamble yeah and he actually canceled two

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.640 
actually own the map and creators able
to<00:05:00.389> get<00:05:00.570> them<00:05:00.750> with<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:00.960> Phoenix<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.500> right

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
to get them with the Phoenix is right

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.400 
to get them with the Phoenix is right
away<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:03.030> was<00:05:03.180> kind<00:05:03.360> of<00:05:03.419> weird<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:04.110> he<00:05:04.200> sent

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
away that was kind of weird that he sent

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.589 
away that was kind of weird that he sent
those<00:05:04.500> down<00:05:04.710> there<00:05:04.950> um<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.910> think<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.419> reason

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
those down there um I think the reason

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.330 
those down there um I think the reason
actually<00:05:06.870> though<00:05:07.320> is<00:05:07.560> he<00:05:08.010> may<00:05:08.130> have<00:05:08.220> been

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
actually though is he may have been

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.980 
actually though is he may have been
trying<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.669> see<00:05:08.849> the<00:05:09.000> observer<00:05:09.330> like<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
a little bit gamble this because he

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.219 
a little bit gamble this because he
doesn't<00:05:32.970> really<00:05:33.150> know<00:05:33.360> what<00:05:33.389> squirrels<00:05:33.900> doing

back<00:05:34.380> at<00:05:34.410> home<00:05:34.590> he<00:05:34.680> knew<00:05:34.770> his<00:05:34.889> gas<00:05:35.070> was<00:05:35.340> late<00:05:35.520> so

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
back at home he knew his gas was late so

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.370 
back at home he knew his gas was late so
you<00:05:36.090> could<00:05:36.240> kind<00:05:36.389> of<00:05:36.510> assume<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.960> Nexus<00:05:37.260> is

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
you could kind of assume the Nexus is

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.689 
you could kind of assume the Nexus is
there<00:05:37.530> but<00:05:37.680> it's<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.830> bold<00:05:38.070> choice<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.490> just

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
there but it's a bold choice to just

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.219 
there but it's a bold choice to just
assume<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.180> he<00:05:39.300> needs<00:05:39.479> to<00:05:39.630> lift<00:05:39.720> those<00:05:39.960> two

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
assume that he needs to lift those two

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:41.750 
assume that he needs to lift those two
centuries<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.949> that's<00:05:41.070> exactly<00:05:41.220> what<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.550> up

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
centuries and that's exactly what it up

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.150 
centuries and that's exactly what it up
oh<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.570> boat<00:05:42.780> speeds<00:05:43.169> go<00:05:43.320> down<00:05:43.590> on<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.010> less

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
oh the boat speeds go down on the less

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.270 
oh the boat speeds go down on the less
but<00:05:44.400> he<00:05:44.520> takes<00:05:44.760> down

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
but he takes down

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.980 
but he takes down
and<00:05:45.610> now<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:45.940> second<00:05:46.420> one<00:05:46.540> doesn't<00:05:46.840> have<00:05:46.870> the

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
and now the second one doesn't have the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.270 
and now the second one doesn't have the
energy<00:05:47.290> he<00:05:47.380> needs<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.710> wait<00:05:47.860> for<00:05:48.010> the<00:05:48.040> force

actually<00:05:50.139> love<00:05:50.470> it<00:05:50.620> he<00:05:50.770> doesn't<00:05:50.980> even<00:05:51.100> waste<00:05:51.370> a

he's<00:05:53.350> like<00:05:53.470> well<00:05:53.620> I'm<00:05:53.980> just<00:05:54.130> gonna<00:05:54.310> pick<00:05:54.460> up<00:05:54.580> a
