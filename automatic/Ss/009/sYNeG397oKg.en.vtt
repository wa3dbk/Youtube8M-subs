00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 the cultivation of peach palm to palm 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.560
 production of palmito has been 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.110
 the interest of large and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.710
 small farmers with good acceptance 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.650
 in the market is an ecological alternative 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.320
 traditional palm heart whose extraction in 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.949
 nature almost always occurs in a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.769
 illegal natural product and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.580
 healthy the pupunha palm can be 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.650
 consumed in natura in the salad 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.800
 the seeds still in germination will give 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.690
 Origin of the cultivation of palmito pupunha 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.270
 different from Europe in taste and that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.489
 being sweet wins the consumer's taste and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.180
 producer that has amÃ©rico production 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.559
 of 5,000 feet in an approximate area of 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.079
 8,500 square meters 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.120
 the planting began two years ago and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.789
 according to him the culture is easy to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.520
 working with production throughout the year which 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.960
 encouraged him to develop the activity 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.410
 the advantages that we have in the culture 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 one of them that I fell in love at the time was 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.090
 Profiling is a culture that you 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.520
 deploy it and you will only drive the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.680
 country of life when the 30's 40's 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.780
 years for how many years if you want to drive 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.430
 she does not have it if she does not have data of a suit 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.500
 culture is not yet 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 so when you can see here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.330
 we have the mother plant that was planted 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.119
 two years ago in this plant that is already 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.909
 a plant that is close to the parent by 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.689
 part of the market it will be cut 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.340
 approximately here and cut here and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.600
 When you cut here, you'll go. 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:45.390
 note that you have one two three 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:46.710
 four five six seven eight nine plants 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.240
 an interesting thing for us to 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.299
 talk and profiling then the person will 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.590
 so we see it then the here three 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.439
 years the guy will have 10,000 plants 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.200
 etc. and the plan may already have its plan 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.700
 only if you also leave these 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 All plants here will happen 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.340
 very thin will not give size of 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.350
 Marketplace 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 then you enter what the standard there is 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.789
 standard for example will be 3 but as 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.129
 is that it will cut until it passes through the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.740
 act when I send machete from here already 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.990
 automatically cuts 134 on the floor 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.030
 the hamas will cut will die will not go 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.040
 die it will delay the growth will 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.550
 play three deaths and can reach has 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.560
 one larger two larger 3 larger 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.330
 then then this one here will be the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.090
 three next after will be almost three 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.590
 evidence in a two then it comes a 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.450
 cycle that does not fit it comes without 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.060
 so when you cut you have it later 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.070
 Do you want to have to rot? 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.110
 organic and it will drop by another 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.300
 inside will replace the palm again 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.460
 investments start on the ground and 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.530
 differential drip irrigation 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.320
 for hot weather and organic fertilization 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.390
 one of the biggest losses was the attack 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.060
 of the boars at the beginning of the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.950
 ended up with half of the crop in average 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.960
 1 hectare you can have five to ten 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.570
 thousand plants depends on personal budget 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.100
 use that way it will work right 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.770
 here I am eight thousand square meters 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.230
 There are five thousand plants, I have. 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.450
 I would have more but I had a great 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.970
 problem that I do not know if you can 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.290
 to observe that here she is. 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.180
 perfect, is not it? 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.560
 But then, when will we get in? 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.870
 more inside you will see that they have 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.690
 spent on failure was an attack 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.990
 Last booty last year already worth it 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.730
 and started to force it not to 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.500
 ate the committee it works the work 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.480
 rancoroso changed out world was one 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.310
 and the professional grudge of 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.690
 five thousand seedlings that if I make a 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.360
 abrupt account if I see a piece today 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.450
 11 percent a piece today for an average of 56 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.390
 real hey he took me so ps removed 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.760
 from 25 to 30 thousand reais and in two days this 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.580
 for this culture the expectation of 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 harvest for the next year is 30% of the 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.710
 American production is not intended to 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.300
 stop wanting to increase farming and invest 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.880
 at 50 thousand feet 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.440
 while celebrating productivity and 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.660
 gives the tips for the best use 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.750
 of the pupunha palm 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.760
 we cut it right right we observe that the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.860
 the hardest part is the straightest and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.330
 start a light belly around here like this 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.360
 like this cheerful belly watching that 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.770
 the palm is hidden here just to 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.880
 maintain the increase of good quality 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.500
 the housewife who has to do has to 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.420
 have this part to protect the palm 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.800
 has from today points out so I come 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.800
 and cut here 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.400
 then it will be noted that here he is still 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.699
 it's pretty furious sheet 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.290
 so if I send a piece to a network 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:41.470
 the market or any other 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.360
 establishment does a cleaning here and 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.610
 then when the person comes home he sees that 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.970
 this piece will have to clean and eat right 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.040
 the palm heart hidden inside the team of 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.470
 approximately 500 grams 600 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.120
 well remembered grams has the palm that 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.030
 people call it the heart of the palm here that is the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.010
 part that comes those tubes that is the 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.169
 and participated in the heart of palm 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.770
 in soft and super tasty 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.620
 then we cut more over here there now 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.910
 that you have already given the diplomat 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.010
 here you can eat and like it 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.169
 the cultivation of peach palm palm has 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.620
 advantages over palm heart 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:24.150
 traditional it allows cutting 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.150
 continued production of palm heart
