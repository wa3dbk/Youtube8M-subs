 so is already how to make debate 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.119

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.360
 were separated from their mother 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.009

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.680
 the parents we are going to go to 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.880
 their cage or their aviary we want 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.439
 to give them something to eat 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.579
 protective helmet as those they 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.730

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.110

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.260

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.820

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 short so that's after that here are the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.550

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.510
 it is not me 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.820
 I would just say a little 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.390
 cage where I paint species of terrariums 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.320
 so that may not be good 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.480
 something that is if I want when 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.430
 even like me I thought a cage even 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.530
 was a good layer of francs and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 everything and if possible this meeting this is 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.490

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.560
 incubator also yes so he who starts 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.950

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.840
 firm breasts and milk trades I you 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.190
