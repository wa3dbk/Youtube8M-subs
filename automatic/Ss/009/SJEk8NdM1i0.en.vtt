remember<00:00:57.949> here<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.519> it<00:00:58.789> cannot<00:00:59.329> be<00:00:59.660> both

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
remember here is that it cannot be both

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.770 
remember here is that it cannot be both

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
same paragraph rather than in a separate

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.460

introduction we have the same thesis

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.810 
introduction we have the same thesis
statement<00:05:29.440> but<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.220> difference<00:05:30.610> you'll

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
statement but the difference you'll

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.530 
statement but the difference you'll
notice<00:05:30.850> is<00:05:31.530> here<00:05:32.530> we<00:05:33.130> take<00:05:33.370> historical<00:05:34.270> time

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
notice is here we take historical time

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.710 
notice is here we take historical time
periods<00:05:35.140> or<00:05:35.320> significant<00:05:36.220> events<00:05:36.700> and<00:05:36.880> we

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
periods or significant events and we

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.450 
periods or significant events and we
simply<00:05:38.050> compare<00:05:38.880> PO<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:40.570> frost<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:41.320> then<00:05:42.220> we

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
simply compare PO to frost and then we

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.880 
simply compare PO to frost and then we
go<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.640> our<00:05:42.910> next<00:05:43.150> paragraph<00:05:43.930> on<00:05:44.470> the

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
go to our next paragraph on the

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.140 
go to our next paragraph on the
background<00:05:45.490> and<00:05:46.020> again<00:05:47.020> we<00:05:47.290> compare<00:05:47.770> PO<00:05:48.640> to

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
background and again we compare PO to

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.540 
background and again we compare PO to
Frost<00:05:49.420> and<00:05:49.930> then<00:05:50.590> we<00:05:50.770> go<00:05:50.950> to<00:05:50.980> our<00:05:51.220> next

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
Frost and then we go to our next

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.880 
Frost and then we go to our next
paragraph<00:05:52.030> where<00:05:52.570> we<00:05:52.690> talk<00:05:52.900> about<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:53.320> themes

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
paragraph where we talk about the themes

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.380 
paragraph where we talk about the themes
and<00:05:54.340> we<00:05:55.150> go<00:05:55.390> and<00:05:55.720> we<00:05:55.780> compare<00:05:56.560> po<00:05:57.040> frost<00:05:57.850> in<00:05:58.240> our

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
and we go and we compare po frost in our

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.200 
and we go and we compare po frost in our
writing<00:05:58.660> so<00:05:59.620> it's<00:05:59.830> pretty<00:06:00.010> simple<00:06:00.340> huh<00:06:00.880> and

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
writing so it's pretty simple huh and

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.430 
writing so it's pretty simple huh and
then<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.740> next<00:06:03.040> paragraph<00:06:03.960> for<00:06:04.960> example<00:06:05.350> if

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
then the next paragraph for example if

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.890 
then the next paragraph for example if
we're<00:06:05.620> using<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:06.130> symbolism<00:06:06.670> like<00:06:07.540> we<00:06:07.720> would

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
we're using the symbolism like we would

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.500 
we're using the symbolism like we would
have<00:06:07.990> used<00:06:08.200> in<00:06:08.380> our<00:06:08.470> block<00:06:08.710> quote<00:06:09.100> we<00:06:10.060> simply

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
have used in our block quote we simply

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.100 
have used in our block quote we simply
then<00:06:10.720> compare<00:06:11.170> po<00:06:11.530> to<00:06:12.040> frost<00:06:12.340> and<00:06:12.790> then<00:06:13.660> our

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
then compare po to frost and then our

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.700 
then compare po to frost and then our
last<00:06:14.620> paragraph<00:06:15.400> is<00:06:15.730> simply<00:06:16.480> our<00:06:16.710> conclusion

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
last paragraph is simply our conclusion

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.650 
last paragraph is simply our conclusion
now<00:06:18.430> what<00:06:18.700> you<00:06:18.880> notice<00:06:19.120> here<00:06:19.330> is<00:06:19.930> that<00:06:20.190> we<00:06:21.660> kept

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
now what you notice here is that we kept

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.030 
now what you notice here is that we kept
the<00:06:23.080> same<00:06:23.610> comparison<00:06:24.610> going<00:06:25.240> po<00:06:25.660> to<00:06:25.720> frost<00:06:26.290> po

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
the same comparison going po to frost po

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.850 
the same comparison going po to frost po
to<00:06:27.100> frost

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
to frost

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.000 
to frost
again<00:06:29.860> in<00:06:30.010> every<00:06:30.580> paragraph<00:06:31.120> and<00:06:31.740> it<00:06:32.740> may<00:06:32.950> seem

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
again in every paragraph and it may seem

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.100 
again in every paragraph and it may seem
a<00:06:33.310> bit<00:06:33.430> repetitive<00:06:34.120> when<00:06:34.780> you're<00:06:34.900> first

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
a bit repetitive when you're first

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.010 
a bit repetitive when you're first
writing<00:06:35.470> but<00:06:36.460> in<00:06:36.820> the<00:06:36.970> end<00:06:37.150> it<00:06:37.420> turns<00:06:37.660> out<00:06:37.900> to

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
writing but in the end it turns out to

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.940 
writing but in the end it turns out to
be<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.200> really<00:06:38.650> nice<00:06:38.860> essay<00:06:39.640> because<00:06:40.950> your
