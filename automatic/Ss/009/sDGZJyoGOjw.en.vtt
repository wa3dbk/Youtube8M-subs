00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
stage weight will probably be a little

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.069 
stage weight will probably be a little
bit<00:02:28.579> higher<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:29.150> because<00:02:29.329> I<00:02:29.359> glycogen<00:02:29.930> and

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
bit higher just because I glycogen and

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.640 
bit higher just because I glycogen and
all<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.470> but<00:02:31.630> what<00:02:32.630> my<00:02:32.780> lowest<00:02:33.230> weight<00:02:33.319> will

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.110 
all that but what my lowest weight will
be<00:02:33.769> i<00:02:33.799> hope<00:02:34.099> i<00:02:34.220> don't<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.549> dip<00:02:34.790> into<00:02:34.910> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
be i hope i don't have to dip into the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.960 
be i hope i don't have to dip into the
160's<00:02:35.870> i<00:02:36.109> might<00:02:36.500> end<00:02:36.799> up<00:02:37.010> hitting<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.609> but

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
160's i might end up hitting that but

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.309 
160's i might end up hitting that but
i'm<00:02:38.150> thinking<00:02:38.180> i<00:02:38.569> only<00:02:38.780> have<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> few<00:02:39.139> more

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
i'm thinking i only have a few more

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.870 
i'm thinking i only have a few more
pounds<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.739> go<00:02:39.919> i<00:02:39.950> think<00:02:40.190> my<00:02:40.280> average<00:02:40.489> weight

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
pounds to go i think my average weight

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.520 
pounds to go i think my average weight
won't<00:02:41.720> go<00:02:41.870> lower<00:02:42.079> than<00:02:42.290> like<00:02:43.870> 172<00:02:44.870> pounds<00:02:45.139> or

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
won't go lower than like 172 pounds or

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.860 
won't go lower than like 172 pounds or

I was I've been getting a little bit

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.339 
I was I've been getting a little bit
pissed<00:03:19.159> that<00:03:19.400> I've<00:03:19.489> been<00:03:19.780> having<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.870> drop<00:03:21.079> my

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
pissed that I've been having to drop my

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.770 
pissed that I've been having to drop my
work<00:03:21.680> set<00:03:22.099> weight<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:23.090> reps<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.659> I'm

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
work set weight and the reps that I'm

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.699 
work set weight and the reps that I'm
doing<00:03:24.139> a<00:03:24.609> little<00:03:25.609> bit<00:03:25.790> at<00:03:25.909> that<00:03:26.090> weight<00:03:26.329> but

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
doing a little bit at that weight but

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.530 
doing a little bit at that weight but
now<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.889> I<00:03:27.920> think<00:03:28.040> of<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.430> when<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:28.670> was<00:03:28.999> about

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
now that I think of it when I was about

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.459 
now that I think of it when I was about
200<00:03:29.959> pounds<00:03:30.799> when<00:03:30.980> i<00:03:31.450> started<00:03:32.450> my<00:03:32.629> prep<00:03:32.959> i<00:03:33.139> hit

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
that's about two times body weight and i

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.550 
that's about two times body weight and i
was<00:03:40.969> able<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.299> hit<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.540> first<00:03:41.750> sets<00:03:42.019> of<00:03:42.200> three

forward to being done with this prep and

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.039 
forward to being done with this prep and
making<00:03:58.189> strength<00:03:58.579> gains<00:03:59.000> while<00:03:59.359> keeping<00:03:59.900> my

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
making strength gains while keeping my

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.170 
making strength gains while keeping my
body<00:04:00.379> weight<00:04:00.680> pretty<00:04:01.099> low<00:04:01.400> i'm<00:04:01.579> going<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.790> try

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
body weight pretty low i'm going to try

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.939 
body weight pretty low i'm going to try
to<00:04:02.269> maintain<00:04:02.569> my<00:04:02.989> weight<00:04:03.019> for<00:04:03.409> a<00:04:03.439> while<00:04:03.650> and

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
to maintain my weight for a while and

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.270 
to maintain my weight for a while and
just<00:04:04.129> get<00:04:04.370> stronger<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.769> get<00:04:06.769> pretty<00:04:07.010> strong

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
just get stronger and get pretty strong

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.020 
just get stronger and get pretty strong
pound<00:04:07.579> for<00:04:07.730> pound<00:04:07.959> but<00:04:09.459> that's<00:04:10.459> it<00:04:10.639> for<00:04:10.879> now<00:04:11.000> I

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
pound for pound but that's it for now I

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.770 
pound for pound but that's it for now I
think<00:04:11.239> I<00:04:14.019> don't<00:04:15.019> know<00:04:15.139> what<00:04:15.319> else<00:04:15.439> is<00:04:15.680> going<00:04:15.980> on

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
think I don't know what else is going on

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.849 
think I don't know what else is going on
been<00:04:17.780> feeling<00:04:18.139> good<00:04:19.060> hunger<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.680> energy<00:04:21.680> are

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
been feeling good hunger and energy are

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.149 
been feeling good hunger and energy are
like<00:04:22.630> Thor<00:04:23.630> whatever<00:04:23.930> i'm<00:04:24.259> so<00:04:24.620> used<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:25.009> it<00:04:25.039> now

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
like Thor whatever i'm so used to it now

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.240 
like Thor whatever i'm so used to it now
it's<00:04:25.550> like<00:04:25.870> not<00:04:26.870> really<00:04:27.139> a<00:04:27.289> big<00:04:27.470> deal<00:04:27.530> hunger

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
it's like not really a big deal hunger

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.480 
it's like not really a big deal hunger
doesn't<00:04:28.430> really<00:04:29.860> doesn't<00:04:30.860> really<00:04:31.039> bother<00:04:31.280> me

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
doesn't really doesn't really bother me

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.379 
doesn't really doesn't really bother me
the<00:04:31.820> energy<00:04:31.970> levels<00:04:32.479> suck<00:04:32.780> but<00:04:34.270> what<00:04:35.270> are<00:04:35.330> you

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
the energy levels suck but what are you

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.460 
the energy levels suck but what are you
going<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.570> do<00:04:35.720> that's<00:04:36.050> what's<00:04:36.229> going<00:04:36.380> to

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
going to do that's what's going to

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.050 
going to do that's what's going to
happen<00:04:36.740> when<00:04:36.860> your<00:04:37.009> body<00:04:37.159> fat<00:04:37.460> get<00:04:37.669> slow<00:04:37.909> i'm

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
happen when your body fat get slow i'm

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.940 
happen when your body fat get slow i'm
probably

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
probably

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.920 
probably
I<00:04:40.040> know<00:04:40.550> people<00:04:40.790> always<00:04:41.060> like<00:04:41.330> try<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.630> guess

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
I know people always like try to guess

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.170 
I know people always like try to guess
their<00:04:42.170> body<00:04:42.440> fat<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.100> they're<00:04:43.610> usually<00:04:43.760> way

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
their body fat and they're usually way

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.680 
their body fat and they're usually way
off<00:04:44.420> but<00:04:45.730> we<00:04:46.730> all<00:04:46.820> say<00:04:47.000> I'm<00:04:47.120> around<00:04:47.360> five

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
off but we all say I'm around five

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.460 
off but we all say I'm around five
percent<00:04:48.170> right<00:04:48.380> now<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:49.460> give<00:04:49.760> or<00:04:49.790> take<00:04:50.470> one

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
percent right now so give or take one

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.320 
percent right now so give or take one
percent<00:04:51.980> so<00:04:52.310> maybe<00:04:55.000> I'm<00:04:56.000> probably

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
percent so maybe I'm probably

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.180 
percent so maybe I'm probably
low-balling<00:04:57.170> it<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.350> little<00:04:57.530> bit<00:04:57.770> i'm<00:04:57.950> probably

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
low-balling it a little bit i'm probably

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.340 
low-balling it a little bit i'm probably
between<00:04:58.670> five<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.180> six<00:04:59.570> percent<00:04:59.990> that's<00:05:00.170> what

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
between five and six percent that's what

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.480 
between five and six percent that's what
i'm<00:05:00.440> going<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.620> go<00:05:00.740> with<00:05:00.770> let<00:05:01.160> me<00:05:01.250> know<00:05:01.370> what

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
i'm going to go with let me know what

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.880 
i'm going to go with let me know what
you<00:05:01.640> guys<00:05:01.790> think<00:05:02.090> i<00:05:02.420> know<00:05:02.930> it's<00:05:03.230> probably<00:05:03.530> kind

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
you guys think i know it's probably kind

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.890 
you guys think i know it's probably kind
of<00:05:04.070> hard<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.340> see<00:05:04.580> from<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:04.940> video<00:05:05.150> a<00:05:05.330> lot<00:05:05.750> of

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
of hard to see from that video a lot of

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.800 
of hard to see from that video a lot of
detail<00:05:06.260> just<00:05:06.500> because<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.860> lighting<00:05:07.340> and

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
detail just because of the lighting and

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.420 
detail just because of the lighting and
because<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.020> focus<00:05:09.470> when<00:05:10.160> I<00:05:10.190> could

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
because of the focus when I could

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.260 
because of the focus when I could
actually<00:05:10.730> take<00:05:11.150> pictures<00:05:11.690> with<00:05:11.930> that<00:05:12.170> t3i<00:05:13.270> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
actually take pictures with that t3i the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.820 
actually take pictures with that t3i the
