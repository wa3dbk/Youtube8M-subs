00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
so let's talk about that weeks from

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.110 
so let's talk about that weeks from
seedling<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.660> transplant<00:00:07.610> if<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.849> were<00:00:08.940> to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
seedling to transplant if you were to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.330 
seedling to transplant if you were to
put<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> seed<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.019> tomato<00:00:10.559> seed<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.309> ground

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
put a seed a tomato seed in the ground

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.279 
put a seed a tomato seed in the ground
and<00:00:12.290> aunt<00:00:13.290> right<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.950> your<00:00:14.070> garden<00:00:15.109> it's<00:00:16.109> going

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
and aunt right in your garden it's going

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.570 
and aunt right in your garden it's going
to<00:00:16.320> take<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.500> while<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.830> germinate<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:17.460> going

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to take a while to germinate it's going

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
to take a while to germinate it's going
to<00:00:17.640> take<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> while<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.090> grow<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.750> whatever<00:00:19.350> so

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
to take a while to grow and whatever so

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.870 
to take a while to grow and whatever so
that's<00:00:19.770> why<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:19.980> typically<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.699> them

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that's why we typically start them

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.010 
that's why we typically start them
before<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> need<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> plant<00:00:21.810> them<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
before you need to plant them in the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
before you need to plant them in the
ground<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.680> nice<00:00:22.890> start<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.850> see

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
ground you get this nice start you see

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.830 
ground you get this nice start you see
at<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> storage<00:00:24.300> right<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.650> there's<00:00:26.519> some

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
at the storage right so there's some

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.120 
at the storage right so there's some
plants<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.019> really<00:00:28.320> conducive<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.830> just

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
plants that are really conducive to just

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.290 
plants that are really conducive to just
putting<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.429> seat<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> garden<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
putting the seat in the garden like a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.749 
putting the seat in the garden like a
pea<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.900> carrot<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:32.189> some<00:00:32.550> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
pea or a carrot and there's some that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.690 
pea or a carrot and there's some that
you<00:00:32.910> really<00:00:33.210> would<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.829> was<00:00:34.980> favorable<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.520> get

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
you really would it was favorable to get

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400 
you really would it was favorable to get
a<00:00:35.730> transplant<00:00:36.149> because<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.899> only<00:00:36.930> are<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
a transplant because not only are you a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.490 
a transplant because not only are you a
month<00:00:37.710> ahead<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> schedule<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.629> you're

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
month ahead of the schedule but you're

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.799 
month ahead of the schedule but you're
also<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:40.829> taking<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> guess<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> seed

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
also not taking a guess on if that seed

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
also not taking a guess on if that seed
is<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.379> grow<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.670> you've<00:00:45.000> got

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
is going to grow or not so you've got

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
is going to grow or not so you've got
that<00:00:45.329> one's<00:00:45.690> particular<00:00:46.379> spot<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.829> put<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that one's particular spot and you put a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
that one's particular spot and you put a
seat<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> may<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.090> germinate<00:00:48.600> very

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
seat in there and may not germinate very

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.139 
seat in there and may not germinate very
well<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.350> something<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> grow<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
well or or something so I like to grow a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
well or or something so I like to grow a
number<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> different<00:00:51.780> starts<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.620> pick

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
number of different starts and then pick

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.290 
number of different starts and then pick
like<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> five<00:00:53.340> best<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> do

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
like the five best if I'm going to do

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
like the five best if I'm going to do
five<00:00:54.480> plants<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.129> gives<00:00:56.250> me<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
five plants and then that gives me a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.420 
five plants and then that gives me a
good<00:00:57.289> you<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.379> you're<00:00:58.469> gonna<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.859> packet

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
good you know you're gonna get a packet

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.250 
good you know you're gonna get a packet
of<00:00:59.489> 200<00:00:59.940> seeds<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> need<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.020> grows

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of 200 seeds and all you need it grows

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.009 
of 200 seeds and all you need it grows
five<00:01:01.500> plants<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.730> I'd<00:01:03.059> outgrow<00:01:03.719> 10<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
five plants you know I'd outgrow 10 of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.770 
five plants you know I'd outgrow 10 of
them<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.409> which<00:01:04.530> ones<00:01:04.739> turn<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.250> best

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
them and see which ones turn out best

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.120 
them and see which ones turn out best
yeah<00:01:06.780> here's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> handout<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> care<00:01:07.890> if

yeah here's a handout if you care if
you're<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> grow<00:01:08.580> seeds<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.720> might

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you're going to grow seeds you might

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
you're going to grow seeds you might
want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> pick<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.530> handout<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> it

want to pick up this handout and it
basically<00:01:11.790> gives<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> chart<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.189> says<00:01:14.189> if

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
basically gives you a chart that says if

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
basically gives you a chart that says if
you're<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.970> beats<00:01:15.330> four<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> six

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you're going to do beats four to six

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.770 
you're going to do beats four to six
weeks<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.340> date<00:01:17.580> safe<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> set<00:01:18.659> out

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
weeks from the so date safe to set out

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.719 
weeks from the so date safe to set out
two<00:01:18.930> weeks<00:01:19.049> before<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.710> any<00:01:19.979> way<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.580> your

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
two weeks before in any way you put your

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
two weeks before in any way you put your
frost<00:01:20.939> free<00:01:21.150> date<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.049> derive<00:01:22.259> all

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
frost free date and you can derive all

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.859 
frost free date and you can derive all
the<00:01:22.530> other<00:01:22.650> dates<00:01:22.890> off<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the other dates off of it so this is a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.700 
the other dates off of it so this is a
good<00:01:24.990> hand<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.350> you're<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> do

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
good hand out if you're going to do

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.859 
good hand out if you're going to do
seeds<00:01:26.900> endorse<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.610> set<00:01:29.610> them<00:01:29.729> yourself<00:01:30.090> it's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
seeds endorse or set them yourself it's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.940 
seeds endorse or set them yourself it's
also<00:01:30.990> important<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.530> you're<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> buy
