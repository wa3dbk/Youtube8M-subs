happening<00:04:21.579> it's<00:04:22.450> unfortunate<00:04:24.389> guess<00:04:25.389> it's

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
happening it's unfortunate guess it's

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.590

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
just too bad today right

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.990 
just too bad today right
it<00:04:28.810> wasn't<00:04:29.500> fortunate<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.550> track

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
it wasn't fortunate the track

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.930 
it wasn't fortunate the track
temperature<00:04:31.630> had<00:04:31.930> been<00:04:32.110> at<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.500> hundred<00:04:33.010> in<00:04:33.490> 30

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
temperature had been at a hundred in 30

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.510 
temperature had been at a hundred in 30
degrees<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.750> day<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.530> maybe<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:36.010> really<00:04:36.280> was

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
degrees that day so maybe it really was

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.270 
degrees that day so maybe it really was
the<00:04:36.730> heat<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.090> blame<00:04:37.360> either<00:04:37.900> way<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:39.040> was

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
the heat to blame either way this was

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.090 
the heat to blame either way this was
also<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.910> day<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.870> massive<00:04:41.380> thunderstorm

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
also the day of the massive thunderstorm

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.040 
also the day of the massive thunderstorm
that<00:04:42.310> knocked<00:04:42.550> at<00:04:42.700> all<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.180> power<00:04:43.389> in<00:04:43.840> my

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
state that was a terrifying night to

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.290 
state that was a terrifying night to
drive<00:04:46.990> home<00:04:47.260> that<00:04:47.590> night<00:04:47.860> but<00:04:48.610> thankfully

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
drive home that night but thankfully

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.250 
drive home that night but thankfully
everybody<00:04:50.200> got<00:04:50.650> home<00:04:50.919> okay<00:04:51.450> even<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.600> GTR<00:04:53.229> I

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
everybody got home okay even that GTR I

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.950 
everybody got home okay even that GTR I
mentioned<00:04:53.950> was<00:04:54.400> running<00:04:54.760> mid<00:04:55.060> 12<00:04:55.510> second

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.900 
mentioned was running mid 12 second
times<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.979> is<00:04:57.250> what<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.490> should<00:04:57.669> have

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
times and that is what I should have

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.409 
times and that is what I should have
been<00:04:58.120> running<00:04:58.979> maybe<00:04:59.979> it<00:05:00.250> really<00:05:00.430> was<00:05:00.639> the

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
been running maybe it really was the

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.740 
been running maybe it really was the
heat<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.840> blame<00:05:02.139> I<00:05:02.760> am<00:05:03.760> definitely<00:05:04.030> going<00:05:04.389> back

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
heat to blame I am definitely going back

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
heat to blame I am definitely going back
on<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.139> day<00:05:05.590> with<00:05:05.830> better<00:05:06.070> conditions
