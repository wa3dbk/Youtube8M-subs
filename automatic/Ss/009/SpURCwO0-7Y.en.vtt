which<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.080> very<00:01:21.710> tall<00:01:22.190> figure<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:22.910> if<00:01:23.090> I

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
which is a very tall figure so if I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.120 
which is a very tall figure so if I
knock<00:01:23.450> this<00:01:23.690> well<00:01:24.110> he<00:01:24.500> will<00:01:24.650> fall<00:01:24.920> over

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
knock this well he will fall over

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.880 
knock this well he will fall over
because<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.820> legs<00:01:26.120> are<00:01:26.360> very<00:01:26.870> long<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.590> we

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
because the legs are very long and we

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.400 
because the legs are very long and we
have<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.250> big<00:01:28.520> blocky<00:01:28.850> head<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:29.420> body<00:01:29.660> at

stand<00:01:33.020> up<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.350> may<00:01:33.530> have<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.920> rest<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.460> against

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
stand up you may have to rest it against

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.930 
stand up you may have to rest it against
a<00:01:35.510> wall<00:01:36.080> if<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.500> want<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:37.130> display<00:01:37.490> now

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
a wall if you want it on display now

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.060 
a wall if you want it on display now
let's<00:01:38.120> have<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.300> look<00:01:38.450> after<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.590> figure<00:01:39.860> we<00:01:39.950> do

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
let's have a look after the figure we do

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.820 
let's have a look after the figure we do
get<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.340> eyes<00:01:40.460> there<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.960> pixelated

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
get the eyes there and the pixelated

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.480 
get the eyes there and the pixelated
black<00:01:43.280> coloration<00:01:43.700> throughout<00:01:44.710> this<00:01:45.710> figure

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
black coloration throughout this figure

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.910 
black coloration throughout this figure
you<00:01:46.610> can<00:01:46.820> move<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.210> head<00:01:47.450> that's<00:01:48.440> what<00:01:48.680> movie

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
you can move the head that's what movie

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.070 
you can move the head that's what movie
you<00:01:49.070> can<00:01:49.220> also<00:01:49.340> move<00:01:49.670> these<00:01:49.910> really<00:01:50.570> long<00:01:50.690> arms

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
you can also move these really long arms

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.380 
you can also move these really long arms
as<00:01:51.200> well<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:52.040> do<00:01:52.220> get<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.550> hand<00:01:52.820> sections

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
as well we do get the hand sections

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.500 
as well we do get the hand sections
there<00:01:53.750> just<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.560> cut<00:01:54.950> in<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.430> end<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.090> arms

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.020 
there just a cut in the end of the arms
but<00:01:56.810> both<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.140> those<00:01:57.530> will<00:01:57.770> move<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:59.000> can

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
but both of those will move and you can

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.980 
but both of those will move and you can
move<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.660> legs<00:02:00.170> as<00:02:00.710> well<00:02:01.040> forwards<00:02:01.700> and

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
move the legs as well forwards and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.570 
move the legs as well forwards and
