00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.290
 so when you gave to watch 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 it's not about us bringing them back everyone 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.630
 take this opportunity to give their voice 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.629
 in fact there was the light passing 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.429
 in the eyepiece that was automatically and 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.289
 so that he projects the image of the sun 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.539
 so this device does not fool themselves scott 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.569
 that allows me to watch the sun the 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.390
 security since obviously we find 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.819
 a smaller one does not promise gold one 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.010
 do not look at the same union that I'm losing 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.690
 not directly from the goblin we start to 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.999
 see that the moon has started to eat a 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.769
 little bit to pass in front of the sun the 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:00.129
 tasks that we see these are tasks of 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:06.220
 the air of its activities and of useful and 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.520
 so on the late the sun you have 2 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.189
 cows 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.079
 thank you so all this is activity 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.079
 solar so that's it 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.080
 yes closes at 2 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.790
 the gauchos this thing while me with 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.659
 that for fun because because I 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.719
 a reference cost 10 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.719
 goodbye is more comfortable 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:51.670
 which means that this is the case 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.360
 this opinion was only I would like that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.530
 this heroine is he one is the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.250
 difference between a mine is a 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.870
 telescope 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.599
 is that the telescope is only 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.209
 lentils the Anglo Saxons and aims 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.450
 a refractory and telescopes this is a 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.390
 mirror and we put it back 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.489
 reflectors with a bezel image 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.030
 a lot complicated and for everything 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.330
 is defined from with a telescope 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.830
 it must be said that for the price of one 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.709
 bezel you can have three 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.660
 telescopes then there must be erased such 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.819
 a wire as a sunscreen 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.160
 do not have fun tinkering with fibers 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.640
 with the old radios stuff like 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.970
 that because the son sort and let 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.489
 spend a hundred thousandth of the light and 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.650
 it filters all the ultra violet on 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.870
 prints the rays that are the most 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.010
 dangerous to stop it I would have 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.269
 preferred to be closer to the trees 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.799
 are that men with genes for the 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.320
 otherwise perhaps total view and in 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.850
 day the public under arms for 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.340
 show them what we call 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.560
 pinhole these are small rays of 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.140
 light that goes through the facts and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.030
 instead of having iron on the floor 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.450
 is helpless growing sun and Mappy 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.450
 eclipse 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.480
 on the device 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.310
 it is well sector activists 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.389
 I like the whole body 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.990
 in because in most 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.060
 legends of all the people ago 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:38.440
 recess game of infinity blade earth 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:40.090
 we were afraid that his animal 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.470
 ate in the sun and so had to 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.450
 to make noise he was shooting 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.670
 arrows I agreed but in 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.610
 Polynesia and some other places 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.090
 like some Indian tribes in 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.030
 Alaska 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.350
 on the contrary the glyphs this sun and 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.420
 the moon that they are husband and wife 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.500
 they get together to make love and 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.620
 that's why they close the shutters 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.900
 and believers who are not going to look by 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.310
 more voices there and that's nice and that 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.050
 it's in the Polynesian region where he 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.000
 are these legends of the moon and the sun 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.360
 it flips off from time to time for the 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.360
 good cause
