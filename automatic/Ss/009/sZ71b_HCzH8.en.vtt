00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.900

 belmont park racecourse in new york with 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.010
 this new intervention in which we are going 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.840
 to listen next what we 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.119
 commented the Puerto Rican rider José 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.510
 Luis Ortiz who will be riding 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.400
 specimen planted in the belmont stakes 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.100
 jose Luis rode this horse to the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.780
 victory in the codem came second in the 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.520
 wood memorial to about three bodies of 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.039
 winner wicked stranger participates 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.840
 also in this one belmont stakes and then 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.239
 in the kentucky derby ended in the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.980
 fifth place let's listen next 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.600
 the statements of josé luís ortiz in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390
 around the opportunity of shaun wright 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.930
 in the belmont stakes the horse in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.000
 sing the party well very well but 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.620
 the favorite horse california chrono 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.760
 I have inside me and while he goes 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.610
 moving I have to put the pressure 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.350
 because the horse that we had to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.850
 we understand that you have to beat him I go 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.730
 putting pressure and I'm the one who 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.300
 I'm putting pressure on him and he got tired 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.030
 little but he never stepped down from the follow 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.150
 and so I think that dancing me and 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.610
 half a mile and a half in the velma 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.230
 we have to understand that with the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.790
 experience of distance my room 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.270
 of the derby I think I can do it now 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.500
 good for the belmont coming from the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.830
 rest that has already practically 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.430
 five weeks if that career would help 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.150
 very faithful of the beat 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.850
 mature also much more the horse a 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.660
 little immature and he has remained 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.220
 working mile work that has 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.710
 done very well back or a mile in 142 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.770
 good work and there's a boost 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.540
 I think that about 22 days ago I work 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.659
 one mile in 145 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.220
 it's a little softer and I'm here today 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.440
 to see more or tomorrow we will see it here 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.180
 see how work he was working on 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.430
 agreements during all these last 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.869
 weeks if in the block of rick bayless 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.729
 I remember 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.280
 He is there but today I have been here 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.280
 tomorrow I will see it here as work 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.360
 what it feels like to ride in races of 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.770
 triple crown and this time that you 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.050
 touches the opportunity to ride in the belmont 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.020
 stakes 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.450
 we stop thinking about knowing that 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.450
 you are there that I think is a dream come true 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.840
 average reality I left the mec the kentucky 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.450
 derby I left the tunnel out people 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.270
 singing in 7 sincere horns but I was 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.980
 stopped is something that if you're not there 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.810
 you can not imagine how it feels and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.069
 now I'm going to ride my first we can 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.600
 take 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.310
 There will be many people too 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.470
 and maxims with the importance of 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.630
 career that with california with looking 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.360
 the triple crown on the face I think that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.950
 the fifth one that is very important but in 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.210
 this time the case was not going to be good 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.370
 important because if the horse wins 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.230
 a long time ago you do not have a 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.120
 triple crown I 'm not also a career 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.930
 very important being this your first 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.700
 experience in the belmont stakes 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.810
 obviously we could say that maybe you 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.000
 first experience at this racecourse 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.630
 belmont pay half mile counting 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.630
 my medium 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.900
 there is no race that I immediately the only 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.130
 but mounted such a long distance in 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.770
 the grass 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.270
 in relation to the belmont stakes obviously 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.520
 a pure strategy race for the 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.950
 factor of distance that makes more 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.080
 one think hard as you can 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.060
 do the race pace where you can 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.110
 go your horse located 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.240
 and what do you think about that? 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.150
 in a career like you say strategy 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.440
 because you do not know which horse can go 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.030
 the average I will try to relax as much 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.790
 possible to my horse 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.640
 with a good position saves the ground 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.380
 real saracco but I have 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.959
 to finish think that this is a 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.510
 horse with the qualities like to 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.270
 maybe give the surprise in the monster yes 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.090
 I think he's still very skilled he can 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.129
 win the shaka 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.129
 and if you win against california chrome 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.890
 It will not feel bad on one side because of 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.420
 public and peak that everyone wants 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.950
 a triple crowned but I'm going to go 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.250
 out of my job that in beating him 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.670
 to him and if I win it would be an achievement 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.380
 immense for my career so short this 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.080
