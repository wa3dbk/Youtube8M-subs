by throwing in groups of five into your

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.240 
by throwing in groups of five into your
pentatonic<00:00:18.480> scale<00:00:18.869> sequencing<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.980> this

pentatonic scale sequencing in this

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.790 
pentatonic scale sequencing in this
lesson<00:00:20.550> we're<00:00:21.090> gonna<00:00:21.210> take<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> little<00:00:22.050> bit<00:00:22.590> a

lesson we're gonna take a little bit a
little<00:00:23.189> look<00:00:23.369> into<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> world<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.420> pentatonic

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
little look into the world of pentatonic

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.500 
little look into the world of pentatonic
scale<00:00:25.740> substitution<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.760> don't<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.449> scared

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
scale substitution and don't be scared

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.330 
scale substitution and don't be scared
if<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.470> understand<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.010> mean<00:00:29.160> it's

if you don't understand it I mean it's
gonna<00:00:29.429> be<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.599> simple<00:00:30.990> let's<00:00:31.590> say

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
gonna be really really simple let's say

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.220 
gonna be really really simple let's say
we're<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.820> key<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.030> G<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.480> we're<00:00:34.050> playing

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
we're in the key of G and we're playing

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.639 
we're in the key of G and we're playing
over<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> G<00:00:34.739> chord<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:36.260> we're<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.350> playing<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
over a G chord and we're just playing a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.180 
over a G chord and we're just playing a
G<00:00:37.800> major<00:00:38.010> pentatonic<00:00:38.129> scale

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.549 

playing<00:00:44.190> simple<00:00:44.670> easy<00:00:45.059> now<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.020> want<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
playing simple easy now if you want to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
playing simple easy now if you want to
to<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.399> different<00:00:47.610> sound<00:00:48.030> out

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to get a little bit different sound out

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840 
to get a little bit different sound out
of<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.570> pentatonic<00:00:49.140> skills<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.430> do

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of your pentatonic skills you can do

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 
of your pentatonic skills you can do
what's<00:00:51.239> called<00:00:51.360> pentatonic<00:00:52.170> substitution

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
what's called pentatonic substitution

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.680 
what's called pentatonic substitution
and<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.610> case<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.480> easy

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and in this case it's really easy

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.119 
and in this case it's really easy
because<00:00:54.870> all<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.110> gonna<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.500> count<00:00:55.770> five

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
because all you gonna do is count five

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.260 
because all you gonna do is count five
away<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.610> whatever<00:00:56.879> chord<00:00:57.120> you're<00:00:57.239> playing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
away from whatever chord you're playing

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.700 
away from whatever chord you're playing
over<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:57.899> playing<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
over if you're playing it like in a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
over if you're playing it like in a
major<00:00:58.949> key<00:00:59.190> whatever<00:00:59.340> major<00:00:59.609> K<00:00:59.850> playing<00:01:00.120> count

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
major key whatever major K playing count

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.649 
major key whatever major K playing count
five<00:01:00.960> away<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.680> G<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.600> B<00:01:03.600> C<00:01:04.309> D<00:01:05.360> are<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
five away from so G a B C D are going to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
five away from so G a B C D are going to
do<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.990> use<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.740> pentatonic<00:01:08.189> scale<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> major

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
do is use the pentatonic scale the major

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.810 
do is use the pentatonic scale the major
pentatonic<00:01:09.270> scale<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:10.260> based<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.610> D

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
pentatonic scale that's based on the D

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.340 
pentatonic scale that's based on the D
chord<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:12.659> five<00:01:12.840> away<00:01:13.110> from

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
chord the one that's five away from

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.990 
chord the one that's five away from
whatever<00:01:13.530> root<00:01:13.830> you're<00:01:13.950> playing<00:01:14.130> over<00:01:14.340> take

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
whatever root you're playing over take

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060 
whatever root you're playing over take
that<00:01:15.180> pentatonic<00:01:15.720> scale<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> mix<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.979> up

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that pentatonic scale and mix it up

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
that pentatonic scale and mix it up
throw<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.060> there<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.720> can

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
throw that in there with it and you can

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
throw that in there with it and you can
get<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> lot<00:01:19.439> different<00:01:20.369> sound<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.850> doesn't

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
get a lot different sound that doesn't

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
get a lot different sound that doesn't
quite<00:01:21.330> sound<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.020> running<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.920> G<00:01:23.430> major

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
quite sound just like running a G major

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.910 
quite sound just like running a G major
pentatonic<00:01:23.970> scale<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.689> down<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.140> I'll

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
pentatonic scale up and down and I'll

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
pentatonic scale up and down and I'll
let<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.240> an<00:01:27.360> idea<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.689> us

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
let you get a kind of an idea with us

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.719 
let you get a kind of an idea with us
and<00:01:27.960> look<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.189> you're<00:01:29.310> playing<00:01:29.460> over

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and look here so if you're playing over

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.719 
and look here so if you're playing over
G<00:01:29.939> chord<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.470> using<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> regular<00:01:32.159> G

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
G chord and using just a regular G

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.109 
G chord and using just a regular G
pentatonic<00:01:33.329> shape

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.389 

you<00:01:38.119> can<00:01:38.240> use<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.689> D<00:01:39.109> major<00:01:39.649> pentatonic<00:01:40.100> shape

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
you can use the D major pentatonic shape

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.490 
you can use the D major pentatonic shape
too<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.539> give<00:01:41.689> it<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> little<00:01:41.990> bit<00:01:42.200> different

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
too to give it a little bit different

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.340 
too to give it a little bit different
color<00:01:42.649> well<00:01:43.600> your<00:01:44.600> G<00:01:44.750> chord<00:01:44.780> try<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.200> remember

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
color well your G chord try to remember

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.859 
color well your G chord try to remember
that<00:01:45.590> sounds<00:01:45.859> like<00:01:46.240> I'm<00:01:47.240> gonna<00:01:47.329> move<00:01:47.509> up<00:01:47.630> here

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
that sounds like I'm gonna move up here

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:57.700 
that sounds like I'm gonna move up here
and<00:01:47.929> play<00:01:48.229> just<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.560> regular<00:01:48.829> D<00:01:49.009> major

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.710 

now<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.790> might<00:01:59.060> sound<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.480> little<00:01:59.510> bit

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
now that might sound a little bit

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.940 
now that might sound a little bit
strange<00:01:59.870> to<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:00.410> or<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.650> little<00:02:00.830> bit

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
strange to you or a little bit

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.430 
strange to you or a little bit
unorthodox<00:02:01.640> or<00:02:02.330> not<00:02:02.510> quite<00:02:02.660> what<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:02.990> used<00:02:03.290> to

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
unorthodox or not quite what you used to

kind of pentatonic substitution like

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.699 
kind of pentatonic substitution like
this<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:14.060> switching<00:02:14.540> back<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:14.840> forth<00:02:15.110> filling

talked about in the previous lessons in

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.860 
talked about in the previous lessons in
this<00:03:59.590> series<00:03:59.920> about<00:04:00.459> throwing<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.300> groups<00:04:01.690> of

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
this series about throwing in groups of

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.350 
this series about throwing in groups of
five<00:04:02.170> in<00:04:02.470> between<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:03.459> know<00:04:03.580> pentatonic

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
five in between you know pentatonic

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.000 
five in between you know pentatonic
sequencing<00:04:04.780> of<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.959> groups<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.440> six<00:04:05.830> and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
sequencing of the groups of six and

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.680 
sequencing of the groups of six and
stuff<00:04:06.220> like<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.580> and<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.239> starts<00:04:07.540> off

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
stuff like that and so it starts off

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.449 
stuff like that and so it starts off
with<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.930> G<00:04:08.140> major<00:04:08.380> pentatonic<00:04:08.709> scale<00:04:09.220> this

we're gonna play five notes descending

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.370 
we're gonna play five notes descending
from<00:04:21.760> there<00:04:25.110> that's<00:04:26.110> your<00:04:26.229> G<00:04:26.350> major

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.030 

so<00:06:22.540> that<00:06:22.750> lick<00:06:22.990> if<00:06:23.170> you<00:06:23.260> can<00:06:23.410> learn<00:06:23.590> that<00:06:23.650> and

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
so that lick if you can learn that and

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.320 
so that lick if you can learn that and
understand<00:06:24.460> what's<00:06:24.610> going<00:06:24.820> on<00:06:24.940> there<00:06:25.120> you<00:06:25.210> can

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
understand what's going on there you can

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.240 
understand what's going on there you can
have<00:06:25.450> a<00:06:25.480> really<00:06:26.020> good<00:06:26.440> foundation<00:06:27.220> for

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
have a really good foundation for

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.920 
have a really good foundation for
starting<00:06:28.090> to<00:06:28.150> do<00:06:28.240> some<00:06:28.360> pentatonic

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
starting to do some pentatonic

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.110 
starting to do some pentatonic
substitution<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:30.280> you're<00:06:30.520> playing<00:06:30.790> and<00:06:30.970> one

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
substitution and you're playing and one

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.490 
substitution and you're playing and one
of<00:06:31.210> the<00:06:31.270> cool<00:06:31.510> things<00:06:31.750> about<00:06:31.900> this<00:06:32.260> kind<00:06:32.470> of

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
of the cool things about this kind of

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.710 
of the cool things about this kind of
playing<00:06:32.800> is<00:06:33.070> it<00:06:33.640> gives<00:06:33.940> you<00:06:34.120> a<00:06:34.150> pentatonic

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
playing is it gives you a pentatonic

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.810 
playing is it gives you a pentatonic
feel<00:06:35.260> you<00:06:35.530> know<00:06:35.620> two<00:06:35.950> notes<00:06:36.160> per<00:06:36.370> string<00:06:36.400> on

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
feel you know two notes per string on

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.670 
feel you know two notes per string on
them<00:06:36.940> just<00:06:37.210> about<00:06:37.390> every<00:06:37.600> string<00:06:37.840> but<00:06:38.560> it

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
them just about every string but it

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.350 
them just about every string but it
really<00:06:39.250> almost<00:06:39.490> sounds<00:06:40.000> like<00:06:40.030> you're<00:06:40.240> playing

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
really almost sounds like you're playing

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.720 
really almost sounds like you're playing
just<00:06:40.600> a<00:06:40.660> regular<00:06:40.960> major<00:06:41.230> scale<00:06:41.680> a<00:06:41.920> major<00:06:42.430> scale

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
just a regular major scale a major scale

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.660 
just a regular major scale a major scale
sound<00:06:43.120> with<00:06:43.300> a<00:06:43.390> pentatonic<00:06:43.690> feel<00:06:44.200> because

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
sound with a pentatonic feel because

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.980 
sound with a pentatonic feel because
really<00:06:45.670> you're<00:06:45.940> getting<00:06:46.240> all<00:06:46.450> the<00:06:46.660> notes<00:06:46.840> in

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
really you're getting all the notes in

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.750 
really you're getting all the notes in
the<00:06:47.110> major<00:06:47.320> scale<00:06:47.560> I'm<00:06:47.920> mixing<00:06:48.430> these<00:06:48.580> two

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
the major scale I'm mixing these two

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.240 
the major scale I'm mixing these two
pentatonix<00:06:49.390> up<00:06:49.570> except<00:06:50.350> for<00:06:50.440> the<00:06:50.890> fourth

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
pentatonix up except for the fourth

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.180 
pentatonix up except for the fourth
scale<00:06:51.790> degree<00:06:51.850> to<00:06:52.750> BC<00:06:53.170> so<00:06:55.950> again<00:06:56.950> if<00:06:57.100> you

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
scale degree to BC so again if you

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.500 
scale degree to BC so again if you
haven't<00:06:57.460> downloaded<00:06:57.520> the<00:06:57.820> jam<00:06:58.030> track<00:06:58.270> that<00:06:58.450> I

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
haven't downloaded the jam track that I

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.900 
haven't downloaded the jam track that I
made<00:06:58.720> for<00:06:59.020> you<00:06:59.290> want<00:06:59.470> to<00:06:59.560> do<00:06:59.680> that<00:06:59.890> and<00:07:00.190> like<00:07:00.790> I

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
made for you want to do that and like I

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.580 
made for you want to do that and like I
said<00:07:01.150> earlier<00:07:01.480> in<00:07:01.600> the<00:07:01.660> lesson<00:07:02.050> this<00:07:02.230> doesn't

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
said earlier in the lesson this doesn't

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.410 
said earlier in the lesson this doesn't
just<00:07:02.710> apply<00:07:02.920> to<00:07:03.010> major<00:07:03.460> pentatonic<00:07:03.850> skills

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.420 
just apply to major pentatonic skills

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.180 
just apply to major pentatonic skills
you<00:07:04.600> can<00:07:04.720> do<00:07:04.780> with<00:07:04.900> minor<00:07:05.260> pentatonic<00:07:05.710> skills

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
you can do with minor pentatonic skills

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.340 
you can do with minor pentatonic skills
too<00:07:06.520> so<00:07:06.880> that<00:07:07.390> first<00:07:07.570> jam<00:07:07.810> track<00:07:08.080> that<00:07:08.230> we're

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
too so that first jam track that we're

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.990 
too so that first jam track that we're
talking<00:07:08.500> about<00:07:08.710> is<00:07:09.070> in<00:07:09.250> kind<00:07:09.430> of<00:07:09.460> an<00:07:09.580> E<00:07:09.760> minor

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
talking about is in kind of an E minor

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.330 
talking about is in kind of an E minor
so<00:07:10.690> what<00:07:10.900> you<00:07:10.990> can<00:07:11.170> do<00:07:11.320> is<00:07:11.560> you<00:07:11.680> can<00:07:11.860> you<00:07:12.220> know

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
so what you can do is you can you know

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.270 
so what you can do is you can you know
improvise<00:07:12.910> and<00:07:13.330> you<00:07:13.390> minor<00:07:13.600> figure<00:07:13.900> out<00:07:13.990> that

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.970 

but<00:07:18.280> you<00:07:18.370> can<00:07:18.520> also<00:07:18.790> throw<00:07:19.750> in<00:07:19.840> the<00:07:20.710> minor

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980 
but you can also throw in the minor

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.220 
but you can also throw in the minor
pentatonic<00:07:21.190> scale<00:07:21.790> that's<00:07:21.910> five<00:07:22.240> away<00:07:22.810> from

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.230 
pentatonic scale that's five away from

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.120 
pentatonic scale that's five away from
the<00:07:23.380> e<00:07:23.410> which<00:07:23.740> is<00:07:23.770> e<00:07:24.120> G<00:07:25.120> a<00:07:25.360> B<00:07:26.290> so<00:07:26.740> you<00:07:26.830> can<00:07:26.860> throw

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
the e which is e G a B so you can throw

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.010 
the e which is e G a B so you can throw
in<00:07:27.340> that<00:07:27.460> B<00:07:27.730> minor<00:07:27.970> pentatonic<00:07:28.360> in<00:07:28.690> there<00:07:28.810> too

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
in that B minor pentatonic in there too

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.420 
in that B minor pentatonic in there too
so<00:07:29.200> if<00:07:29.320> you<00:07:29.440> can<00:07:29.590> go<00:07:29.770> up<00:07:29.920> your<00:07:30.250> minor

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:30.430 
so if you can go up your minor

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.590 
so if you can go up your minor
pentatonic<00:07:30.760> scale<00:07:32.970> come<00:07:33.970> down<00:07:34.120> your<00:07:34.270> B<00:07:34.390> minor

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:34.600 
pentatonic scale come down your B minor

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.690 
pentatonic scale come down your B minor
pentatonic<00:07:34.930> scale<00:07:38.250> that's<00:07:39.250> a<00:07:39.340> really<00:07:39.580> good

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:39.700 
pentatonic scale that's a really good

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.430 
pentatonic scale that's a really good
way<00:07:39.850> just<00:07:39.880> to<00:07:40.450> start<00:07:40.720> practicing<00:07:41.290> this

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 
way just to start practicing this

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.410 
way just to start practicing this
concept<00:07:41.980> and<00:07:42.160> start<00:07:42.580> getting<00:07:43.180> that<00:07:43.240> under

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:43.420 
concept and start getting that under

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.550 
concept and start getting that under
your<00:07:43.600> fingers<00:07:43.870> and<00:07:43.990> then<00:07:44.110> you<00:07:44.260> can<00:07:44.380> start

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
your fingers and then you can start

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.750 
your fingers and then you can start
making<00:07:44.860> up<00:07:44.980> some<00:07:45.100> really<00:07:45.250> cool<00:07:45.430> licks<00:07:45.640> for

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:45.760 
making up some really cool licks for

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.440 
making up some really cool licks for
yourself<00:07:46.090> using<00:07:46.570> this<00:07:47.050> idea
