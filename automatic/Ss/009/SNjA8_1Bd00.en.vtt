00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.620
 has happened to us and we will need 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 half medium onion one or two 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.670
 carrots that we're going to grate a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.099
 zucchini a leek and a green pepper 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.789
 We're going to need a teaspoon of 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.920
 flour 45 teaspoons of milk that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.170
 We will see when we are preparing it and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.970
 a pinch of curry here does not like the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 curry can be omitted that is also 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.090
 very good we are going to need a package 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.210
 of philo dough and to prepare it 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.020
 a butter that we are going to melt 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 oil and salt 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.440
 the first thing I'm going to do is chop 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.110
 the vegetables all very small and when 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.110
 I have it already cut and to support it 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.250
 Well, I'm tracing the vegetables 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.440
 let's try to make all the pieces 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 do more or less the same both in the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.230
 zucchini like onion pepper 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.420
 leek and carrot then the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.149
 we make slices we are going to trace 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.280
 welcome now I will keep chopping the 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:14.390
 rest of vegetables, well, I already have 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.060
 all the zucchini chopped and I'm going to 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.180
 follow 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.090
 with the leek the leek I throw a cross 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.799
 to the top part to wash it in the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.409
 If you have something from you, receive 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:31.560
 now the trophy 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.560
 and the same operation often chopped 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.030
 I already have it, we're going to put it together with 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.299
 the zucchini because the vegetables are going 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.250
 to associate all together the same 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.119
 operation we do with the green pepper 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.490
 well washed without seeds and I throw them 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.590
 plasters and now we do squares 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.670
 same as trying to make the size 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.670
 also tiny 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.200
 the onion as I said I'm just going to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.350
 have average 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.990
 coins 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.450
 great dates and we'll just pass 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.710
 half onion I already have the onion 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.620
 chopped and we do the same operation 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:23.959
 the carrot I'm going to cut into strips 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.959
 and I'm going to meet her also my mañanitas 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.430
 mom is a tray 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.110
 I have put about 5 tablespoons of 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.030
 oil when it's olive oil that 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.410
 when heated grows quite not you 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.260
 Worry that you look like a lot of oil 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.810
 because once the vegetable is fried 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.060
 we will remove the excess is already hot and 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.060
 let's incorporate everything to the pan 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.610
 they stick that to him so that he releases the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.610
 Water 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.040
 we are going to stir for the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.040
 weakness training 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:11.230
 we mix well we distribute to cover 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:15.280
 well let's put it on medium heat 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.920
 about 76 about 12 minutes and we're going to 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.280
 cook covered stirring from time to time 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.280
 when 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.420
 at the end the vegetable has left to sauté 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.760
 20 minutes because at 12 he was 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.430
 still a little tender 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.049
 I want to say al dente I'm going to put a 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.950
 little bit of salt that I just tried and 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.950
 it's a little bland 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.500
 and let's put a little bit of curry this 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.550
 as he said special 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.780
 to the taste of each will be as average 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.780
 teaspoon coffee size 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.849
 and we are going to put a spoonful 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:05.120
 in size but day 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.810
 we water it with positive 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.060
 so that the mine does not know everything 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.230
 to the flour he hugged and now we're going to 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.230
 put a little milk 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.710
 I guess I would have put two 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.950
 tablespoons about me 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.220
 I'm going to continue cooking for a minute 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.350
 or two and we will reserve it to prepare 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.350
 our triangles with fine pasta 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.330
 well, I've let our 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.090
 mass that we have made for an hour 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.540
 approximately and I have already melted the 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.340
 butter and I have removed from the bag the 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.010
 edge to the phyllo dough are a 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.160
 super thin sheets of pasta that we're going to 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.950
 use one at a time let's set aside 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.670
 here and we're going to take only one 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.740
 full 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.750
 it is advisable while if we are going to 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.430
 take a little while to get a wet cloth and 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.070
 always put it on the leaves that 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.810
 we have here without using because it is a 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.240
 paste that dries very fast 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.820
 and then you already know that the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.350
 we could use the let's brush 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.400
 all with butter 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.380
 need not be a layer very 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:33.650
 thick butter only that is 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.650
 hydrated we are going to double it in 3 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.940
 that we're also going to put a little bit of 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.650
 Butter 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.650
 that will make her stay puffed 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.440
 I'm going to brush butter a third 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.920
 of the pasta that we have on this side 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.920
 bent 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.270
 and now in this piece of here we're going to 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.660
 put a thin layer of our dough 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.980
 vegetables 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.980
 we are going to extend it 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.080
 you see that you do not need much 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.080
 quantity 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.230
 that does not reach the extremes but now 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.680
 by folding it if it would come out it becomes a layer 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.680
 finite 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.030
 with this will be enough 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.150
 and we're going to double it in a triangle 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.040
 this way we cojemos thus we double now 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.710
 in this way 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.570
 we are crushing yes it stands out then 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.570
 we extend we help ourselves with the spoon 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.389
 and we are going to be folding on itself 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.740
 until we have all the dough folded 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.470
 A) Yes 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.880
 A) Yes 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.980
 and now this part of here 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.060
 today we are going to put some butter 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.300
 as well 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.990
 we double it 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.910
 the masters brush 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.770
 and on this side we are also going to 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.200
 apply well of butter will help 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:16.560
 to be golden and very crispy 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.480
 we are going to do them all and 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.520
 arranging them in a tray that already 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.410
 I have here prepared with paper of 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.590
 bake for now when we have them 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.870
 all put to good oven for longer 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.660
 I have preheated the oven I have it 200 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.120
 degrees and now I'll go down to 190 at the end I 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.840
 11 pieces have come out that we are going to bake 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:40.820
 for about 18 to 20 minutes when what 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.820
 let's see well doradito will be ready 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:48.480
 Well, in the end I've had them 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:50.440
 25 minutes until I have stayed like this 

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.460
 of doraditos 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.949
 we will get inside 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.229
 they have remained as a color and an aroma 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:01.380
 that smell great we are going to place 

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:05.330
 already taste the uncles are the 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.330
 I recommend trying them because they will love it
