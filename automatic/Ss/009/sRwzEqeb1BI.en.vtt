00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it's very slightly rounded it's not as

completely<00:01:50.639> flat<00:01:50.819> face<00:01:51.389> either<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.990> kind<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
completely flat face either it's kind of

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.559 
completely flat face either it's kind of
like<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.319> halfway<00:01:52.649> house<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.569> between

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
like a halfway house there between

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.410 
like a halfway house there between
Marilyn<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.439> flat<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.909> there's<00:01:57.090> still<00:01:57.179> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
Marilyn and flat so there's still you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.359 
Marilyn and flat so there's still you
know<00:01:57.509> quite<00:01:57.749> good<00:01:58.109> impact<00:01:58.439> area<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.130> ball

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
know quite good impact area for the ball

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.629 
know quite good impact area for the ball
it<00:01:59.579> still<00:01:59.700> helps<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.329> edges<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:01.130> as<00:02:02.130> big<00:02:02.490> as

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639 
it still helps the edges be as big as

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:04.489 
it still helps the edges be as big as
they<00:02:02.819> are<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.990> you're<00:02:04.109> not<00:02:04.170> getting<00:02:04.439> that

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
they are but you're not getting that

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.949 
they are but you're not getting that

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.059 
completely a flat that put some people
off<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.709> let's<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:10.069> profile

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
off and let's now look at the profile

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.760 
off and let's now look at the profile
and<00:02:11.480> similar<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.720> other<00:02:12.750> Hattori's<00:02:13.500> no

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and similar to the other Hattori's no

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.199 
and similar to the other Hattori's no
real<00:02:14.010> difference<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:14.790> you're<00:02:15.000> getting

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
real difference here you're getting

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.500 
real difference here you're getting
minimal<00:02:15.720> concave<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.860> low<00:02:17.459> middle<00:02:17.819> which<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
minimal concave in a low middle which is

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.430 
minimal concave in a low middle which is
a<00:02:18.540> very<00:02:18.780> long<00:02:19.200> middle<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.739> well<00:02:19.950> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
a very long middle as well and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.410 
a very long middle as well and
a very<00:02:21.860> chunky<00:02:22.100> toe<00:02:22.490> look<00:02:22.790> at<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.030> spine

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
a very chunky toe look at that spine

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.600 
a very chunky toe look at that spine
running<00:02:23.810> right<00:02:23.990> through<00:02:24.020> into<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.680> toe<00:02:24.950> will

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
running right through into that toe will

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.460 
running right through into that toe will
get<00:02:25.760> aside<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.360> shots<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:26.960> perhaps<00:02:27.260> see

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
get aside on shots you can perhaps see

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.460 
get aside on shots you can perhaps see
it<00:02:27.680> even<00:02:28.070> more<00:02:28.190> clearly<00:02:28.900> yeah<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.290> say

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
it even more clearly yeah as I say

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.020 
it even more clearly yeah as I say
you're<00:02:30.620> not<00:02:30.680> massive<00:02:31.160> difference<00:02:31.370> between

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
you're not massive difference between

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.280 
you're not massive difference between
the<00:02:32.120> regulator<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.600> mean<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.870> edges<00:02:33.260> are

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the regulator I mean the edges are

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.410 
the regulator I mean the edges are
slightly<00:02:33.890> bigger<00:02:34.190> than<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.520> spine<00:02:34.850> slightly

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
slightly bigger than the spine slightly

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.390 
slightly bigger than the spine slightly
higher<00:02:35.720> I'll<00:02:36.650> prove<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
higher I'll prove that to you in a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.640 
higher I'll prove that to you in a
second<00:02:37.880> but<00:02:38.480> yeah<00:02:38.690> quite<00:02:39.050> similar<00:02:39.560> in<00:02:39.590> shape

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
second but yeah quite similar in shape

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.370 
second but yeah quite similar in shape
to<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.460> sachin<00:02:41.180> tendulkar<00:02:41.840> well<00:02:42.050> especially

to the sachin tendulkar well especially

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.670 
to the sachin tendulkar well especially
the<00:02:42.590> hammer<00:02:42.830> berserker<00:02:43.400> st<00:02:43.910> i've<00:02:44.180> noticed<00:02:44.680> but

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the hammer berserker st i've noticed but

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.100 
the hammer berserker st i've noticed but
that<00:02:45.770> is<00:02:45.920> great<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.550> like<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.910> be

middle extends right up to about there

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.110 
middle extends right up to about there
so<00:03:03.350> it's<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:03.890> basically<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.400> low<00:03:04.640> middle<00:03:04.940> of

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120

they're all SAP word and yeah just
stunning<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:19.070> really<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.550> let's<00:03:20.120> do<00:03:20.270> some

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
stunning it really is let's do some

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.640 
stunning it really is let's do some
measurements<00:03:20.810> because<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.440> so

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
measurements because it is so

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.980 
measurements because it is so
significant<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.460> this<00:03:22.610> bout<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.420> be<00:03:23.540> talking

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
significant on this bout to be talking

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.670 
significant on this bout to be talking
about<00:03:24.110> these<00:03:25.570> specifics<00:03:26.570> based<00:03:27.260> on<00:03:27.530> the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
about these specifics based on the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.100 
about these specifics based on the
weight<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.280> size<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.910> everything<00:03:29.110> but

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
weight and the size and everything but

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.810 
weight and the size and everything but
yeah<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.500> look<00:03:30.620> at<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.770> edge<00:03:31.010> there<00:03:31.489> I

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
yeah if you look at the edge there I

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.320 
yeah if you look at the edge there I
make<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.660> edge<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:33.020> be<00:03:33.140> 38<00:03:33.890> 39<00:03:34.370> millimeters

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
make the edge to be 38 39 millimeters

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.680 
make the edge to be 38 39 millimeters
and<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:36.320> spine<00:03:36.800> is<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.459> think<00:03:38.260> 63<00:03:39.260> 64

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
and the spine is I think 63 64

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.570 
and the spine is I think 63 64
millimeters<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:42.410> know<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.709> huge<00:03:43.070> bat<00:03:43.370> as

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
millimeters you know it's a huge bat as

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.840 
millimeters you know it's a huge bat as
you<00:03:43.970> know<00:03:44.150> but<00:03:44.510> some<00:03:45.020> bouts<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:46.340> go<00:03:46.489> for<00:03:46.670> sort

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
you know but some bouts to go for sort

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.479 
you know but some bouts to go for sort
of<00:03:46.940> edge<00:03:47.180> over<00:03:47.750> spine<00:03:48.050> or<00:03:48.350> spine<00:03:48.650> over<00:03:48.860> edge<00:03:49.130> in

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
of edge over spine or spine over edge in

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.520 
of edge over spine or spine over edge in
this<00:03:49.970> case<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:50.480> getting<00:03:50.690> huge<00:03:51.050> edges<00:03:51.440> and

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
this case and getting huge edges and

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.620 
this case and getting huge edges and
you're<00:03:51.650> getting<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.860> huge<00:03:52.100> spine<00:03:52.459> too<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.150> again

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
you're getting a huge spine too so again

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.440 
you're getting a huge spine too so again
having<00:03:54.050> your<00:03:54.170> cake<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.500> eating<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.450> so

of<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.510> manor<00:04:41.720> is<00:04:41.960> just<00:04:42.410> immense<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:43.280> saw<00:04:43.460> how

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
of the manor is just immense you saw how

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.340 
of the manor is just immense you saw how
far<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:43.880> was<00:04:44.060> rebounding<00:04:44.420> off<00:04:44.780> and

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
far that was rebounding off and

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.810 
far that was rebounding off and
convinced<00:04:45.920> this<00:04:46.010> to<00:04:46.130> perform<00:04:46.520> really<00:04:46.700> well

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
convinced this to perform really well

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.490 
convinced this to perform really well
straighten<00:04:47.330> out<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.570> packet<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.200> only<00:04:48.410> need

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
straighten out the packet you only need

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.680 
straighten out the packet you only need
to<00:04:48.560> wait<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:49.130> couple<00:04:49.190> of<00:04:49.790> seasons<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.419> to<00:04:50.570> open

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
to wait a couple of seasons this to open

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.470 
to wait a couple of seasons this to open
up<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.200> really<00:04:51.860> think<00:04:52.070> it's<00:04:52.310> going<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.550> go<00:04:52.610> from

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
up I really think it's going to go from

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.150 
up I really think it's going to go from
ball<00:04:53.780> one<00:04:54.820> pick<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:56.230> let's<00:04:57.230> try<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:58.010> mean

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
ball one pick up let's try that I mean

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.480 
ball one pick up let's try that I mean
you<00:04:58.250> know<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.730> weight<00:04:58.910> of<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.570> I<00:05:00.440> think<00:05:01.100> in

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
you know the weight of it and I think in

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.580 
you know the weight of it and I think in
this<00:05:01.610> slightly<00:05:02.060> heavier<00:05:02.600> way<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.050> starts<00:05:03.500> to

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
this slightly heavier way it starts to

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.080 
this slightly heavier way it starts to
become<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.860> bit<00:05:04.070> more<00:05:04.100> bottom<00:05:04.580> heavy<00:05:04.790> the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
become a bit more bottom heavy the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.830 
become a bit more bottom heavy the
hitori<00:05:05.480> for<00:05:06.260> me<00:05:06.560> that<00:05:07.160> certainly<00:05:07.580> feels<00:05:08.090> what

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
hitori for me that certainly feels what

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.140 
hitori for me that certainly feels what
it<00:05:08.960> weighs<00:05:09.200> it<00:05:09.740> picks<00:05:10.190> up<00:05:10.340> slightly<00:05:10.669> heavier

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
it weighs it picks up slightly heavier

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.080 
it weighs it picks up slightly heavier
than<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.450> tempo<00:05:11.900> definitely<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:13.310> despite

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
than the tempo definitely and despite

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.300 
than the tempo definitely and despite
the<00:05:14.300> tempo<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:15.020> we<00:05:15.260> did<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.500> review<00:05:15.860> for<00:05:16.040> being

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
the tempo that we did a review for being

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.240 
the tempo that we did a review for being
slightly<00:05:16.669> heavier<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:17.780> feels<00:05:18.290> fairly<00:05:18.890> heavy

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
slightly heavier that feels fairly heavy

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.190 
slightly heavier that feels fairly heavy
to<00:05:19.490> me<00:05:19.640> I<00:05:19.790> wouldn't<00:05:20.330> want<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.570> be<00:05:20.690> wielding

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
to me I wouldn't want to be wielding

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.140 
to me I wouldn't want to be wielding
that<00:05:21.229> and<00:05:21.740> but<00:05:22.370> then<00:05:22.490> again<00:05:22.610> I'm<00:05:22.850> not<00:05:22.880> very

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
that and but then again I'm not very

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.909 
that and but then again I'm not very
strong<00:05:23.419> playing<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:23.930> certainly<00:05:24.320> can't<00:05:24.650> play

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
strong playing I certainly can't play

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.159 
strong playing I certainly can't play
big<00:05:25.250> shots<00:05:25.580> this<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.120> certainly<00:05:26.479> not<00:05:26.600> about

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
big shots this is certainly not about

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.290 
big shots this is certainly not about
that<00:05:27.320> suitable<00:05:27.830> for<00:05:27.979> me<00:05:28.100> what<00:05:28.640> it<00:05:28.729> is<00:05:28.820> suitable

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
that suitable for me what it is suitable

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.150 
that suitable for me what it is suitable
for<00:05:29.360> is<00:05:29.780> an<00:05:30.050> aggressive<00:05:30.350> player<00:05:30.830> especially

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
for is an aggressive player especially

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.370 
for is an aggressive player especially
if<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.610> play<00:05:31.790> on<00:05:31.850> the<00:05:32.000> front<00:05:32.270> foot<00:05:32.390> and<00:05:33.290> you

if you play on the front foot and you

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.920 
if you play on the front foot and you
just<00:05:33.680> like<00:05:33.979> to<00:05:34.220> really<00:05:34.880> take<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.390> bowling<00:05:35.750> on

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
just like to really take the bowling on

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.260 
just like to really take the bowling on
and<00:05:36.830> just<00:05:37.070> make<00:05:37.250> use<00:05:37.430> of<00:05:37.460> this<00:05:37.640> big<00:05:38.030> long

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
and just make use of this big long

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.870 
and just make use of this big long
middle<00:05:38.690> this<00:05:38.840> chunky<00:05:39.320> toe<00:05:39.729> you're<00:05:40.729> also

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
middle this chunky toe you're also

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.840 
middle this chunky toe you're also
getting<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.419> very<00:05:41.630> thick<00:05:42.050> handle<00:05:42.680> here<00:05:42.890> like<00:05:43.820> a

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
getting a very thick handle here like a

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.510 
getting a very thick handle here like a
tree<00:05:44.240> trunk<00:05:44.270> handle<00:05:45.140> it's<00:05:45.740> noticeably

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
tree trunk handle it's noticeably

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.700 
tree trunk handle it's noticeably
thicker<00:05:46.820> than<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.120> other<00:05:47.330> hattori<00:05:47.780> about<00:05:48.080> it

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
thicker than the other hattori about it

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.790 
thicker than the other hattori about it
means<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.340> bottom<00:05:49.700> feels<00:05:49.910> more<00:05:50.180> oval<00:05:50.720> and<00:05:51.650> it

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
means the bottom feels more oval and it

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.230 
means the bottom feels more oval and it
just<00:05:51.979> means<00:05:52.190> you<00:05:52.370> getting<00:05:52.669> less<00:05:52.970> of<00:05:53.150> your

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
just means you getting less of your

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.650 
just means you getting less of your
hands<00:05:53.570> involved<00:05:54.070> through<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.190> ball<00:05:55.450> so<00:05:56.450> yeah

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
hands involved through the ball so yeah

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.350 
hands involved through the ball so yeah
it's<00:05:56.990> like<00:05:57.229> an<00:05:57.410> adam<00:05:57.710> gilchrist<00:05:58.190> style<00:05:58.729> you

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
it's like an adam gilchrist style you

it's a bit heavier to be honest but also
it<00:06:27.540> means<00:06:27.690> it's<00:06:27.990> a<00:06:28.050> bit<00:06:28.260> better<00:06:28.500> I<00:06:28.950> mean
