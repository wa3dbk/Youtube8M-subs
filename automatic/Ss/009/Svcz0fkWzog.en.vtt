and<00:00:15.949> what<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.130> means<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:19.010> little<00:00:20.010> Honda

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and what that means is a little Honda

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.170 
and what that means is a little Honda
and<00:00:20.670> 600<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> motorcycle<00:00:22.470> engine<00:00:23.090> now<00:00:24.090> you

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and 600 with a motorcycle engine now you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.339 
and 600 with a motorcycle engine now you
can't<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> engine<00:00:25.109> right<00:00:25.289> now<00:00:25.730> because

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
can't see the engine right now because

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.750 
can't see the engine right now because
it's<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.470> bagged<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.550> spent<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
it's all bagged up we just spent a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.790 
it's all bagged up we just spent a
couple<00:00:29.939> hours<00:00:30.090> power<00:00:31.080> washing<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.590> car

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
couple hours power washing the car

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.370 
couple hours power washing the car
getting<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.250> cleaned<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:33.079> got<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.200> figure

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
getting it all cleaned up got to figure

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.940 
getting it all cleaned up got to figure
out<00:00:34.469> where<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> rust<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> ready

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
out where the rust is and get it ready

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950 
out where the rust is and get it ready
for<00:00:38.100> paint<00:00:38.300> if<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> feeling<00:00:39.809> it's

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
for paint if they have a feeling it's

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
for paint if they have a feeling it's
going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> work<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.370> good<00:00:41.520> shot

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
going to work this is a really good shot

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.790 
going to work this is a really good shot
of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.210> sprocket<00:00:42.780> assembly

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.979 

I'll<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.360> dwell<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I'll just dwell on this for just a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
I'll just dwell on this for just a
second<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.210> motorcycle<00:00:51.210> engine<00:00:51.420> then

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
second so the motorcycle engine then

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
second so the motorcycle engine then
turns<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> chain<00:00:52.379> which<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.370> turn<00:00:53.640> turns<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
turns the chain which in turn turns the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.490 
turns the chain which in turn turns the
sprocket<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.699> gives<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.760> power<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> both

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
sprocket and gives you power to both

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.410 
sprocket and gives you power to both
front<00:00:58.500> axles<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> differential<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.079> modified

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
front axles the differential is modified

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.740 
front axles the differential is modified
from<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> Honda<00:01:03.750> 600<00:01:04.290> car<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.240> it's<00:01:06.240> been<00:01:06.450> set

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
from a Honda 600 car and it's been set

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300 
from a Honda 600 car and it's been set
back<00:01:06.900> into<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> pasture<00:01:07.560> compartments<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
back into the pasture compartments so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670 
back into the pasture compartments so
that<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.790> fits<00:01:09.119> sprocket<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> big<00:01:10.409> one

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that it all fits sprocket is a big one

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.030 
that it all fits sprocket is a big one
it's<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.340> 52<00:01:11.909> tooth<00:01:12.630> sprocket<00:01:13.020> normal<00:01:13.860> bike

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it's a 52 tooth sprocket normal bike

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.670 
it's a 52 tooth sprocket normal bike
sprockets<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> 40s<00:01:15.650> 40<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> 49<00:01:17.220> 45<00:01:18.060> 30s

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
sprockets are in the 40s 40 to 49 45 30s

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
sprockets are in the 40s 40 to 49 45 30s
I'm<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.009> concerned<00:01:20.189> about<00:01:20.490> top-end<00:01:20.880> speed

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I'm not so concerned about top-end speed

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.280 
I'm not so concerned about top-end speed
with<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.960> car<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.500> am<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.710> torque<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:24.290> by

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
with this car as I am for torque so by

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.960 
with this car as I am for torque so by
begging<00:01:25.590> giving<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> bigger<00:01:26.280> sprocket<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
begging giving it a bigger sprocket you

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.319 
begging giving it a bigger sprocket you
give<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:27.299> torque<00:01:28.159> hopefully<00:01:29.159> less<00:01:29.340> wear

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
give it more torque hopefully less wear

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.969 
give it more torque hopefully less wear
on<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> clutch<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.409> designed<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.860> a

spray it out the back of the brakes and
where<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> fuel<00:01:46.320> tank<00:01:46.950> goes<00:01:47.220> we're<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.579> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
where the fuel tank goes we're going to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
where the fuel tank goes we're going to
put<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> pump<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:48.240> an<00:01:48.329> electric<00:01:48.600> pump<00:01:49.040> so

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
put a pump in there an electric pump so

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.310 
put a pump in there an electric pump so
we<00:01:50.070> pressure<00:01:50.460> wash<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.790> floorboards<00:01:51.509> from

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
we pressure wash the floorboards from

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.130 
we pressure wash the floorboards from
the<00:01:52.409> top<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:53.270> now<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.630> matter<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.899> getting

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
the top up now it's a matter of getting
rid<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> bondo<00:01:56.000> somebody<00:01:57.000> slapped<00:01:57.270> on

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
here and there's quite a bit of rust in

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.340 
here and there's quite a bit of rust in
this<00:01:59.610> window<00:02:00.360> well<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.750> which<00:02:00.960> I'll<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
this window well here which I'll have to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.420 
this window well here which I'll have to
figure<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.509> all
