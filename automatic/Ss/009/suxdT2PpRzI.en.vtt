clones<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.229> create<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> first<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.189> I'm

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
clones so to create the first one I'm

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.460 
clones so to create the first one I'm
going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.549> open<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.330> my<00:01:12.479> first<00:01:12.750> insert

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
going to open up my first insert

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.640 
going to open up my first insert
sequence<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.689> make<00:01:15.689> sure<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> entire<00:01:16.320> thing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
sequence and make sure the entire thing

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.310 
sequence and make sure the entire thing
is<00:01:16.770> selected<00:01:17.280> by<00:01:17.430> choosing<00:01:17.670> edit<00:01:18.110> select<00:01:19.110> all

is selected by choosing edit select all

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.830 
is selected by choosing edit select all
and<00:01:20.570> then<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> cloning<00:01:23.840> create

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and then I can go to cloning create

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.480 
and then I can go to cloning create
gateway<00:01:25.290> entry<00:01:25.920> clone<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:28.220> that<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.369> bring

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
gateway entry clone and that will bring

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.420 
gateway entry clone and that will bring

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
can edit the name so now that I have

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.320 
can edit the name so now that I have
that<00:02:12.530> done<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.980> now<00:02:13.220> need<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.640> repeat<00:02:14.180> that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
that done I now need to repeat that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.480 
that done I now need to repeat that
process<00:02:14.540> for<00:02:14.840> each<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.500> my<00:02:15.530> remaining<00:02:16.010> insert

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
process for each of my remaining insert

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.170 
process for each of my remaining insert
sequences<00:02:18.310> now<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.490> I<00:02:19.520> have<00:02:19.760> all<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.970> my

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.030 
sequences now that I have all of my
entry<00:02:20.480> clones<00:02:20.690> created<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.410> ready<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:21.920> the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
entry clones created I'm ready to do the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.370 
entry clones created I'm ready to do the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
final recombination so I'm going to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.050 
final recombination so I'm going to
choose<00:02:24.590> my<00:02:24.770> clones<00:02:25.010> folder<00:02:25.460> which<00:02:25.880> will

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
choose my clones folder which will

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.790 
choose my clones folder which will
select<00:02:26.390> all<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> entry<00:02:27.110> clones<00:02:27.350> within<00:02:27.650> it

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
select all of the entry clones within it

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.970

multi-site<00:02:38.090> cloning<00:02:38.420> advisor<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:42.250> here<00:02:43.250> you

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
multi-site cloning advisor and here you

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.220 
multi-site cloning advisor and here you
can<00:02:43.520> see<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.850> five<00:02:44.390> plasmids<00:02:44.960> I<00:02:45.080> had

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
can see the five plasmids I had

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.690 
can see the five plasmids I had
specified<00:02:45.470> are<00:02:45.950> shown<00:02:46.100> in<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.340> top<00:02:46.460> portion

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
specified are shown in the top portion

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.550 
specified are shown in the top portion
of<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.000> window<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.510> those<00:02:48.260> are<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.440> ones

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
of the window and those are the ones

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.100 
of the window and those are the ones
that<00:02:48.710> will<00:02:48.890> be<00:02:49.010> recombined<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:50.110> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
that will be recombined and the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.600 
that will be recombined and the
experiment<00:02:51.650> analysis<00:02:52.130> portion<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.550> the

experiment analysis portion of the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.180 
experiment analysis portion of the
window<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.150> telling<00:02:53.690> me<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.870> based<00:02:54.860> on<00:02:55.040> the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
window is telling me that based on the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.699 
window is telling me that based on the
plasmids<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.150> specified<00:02:56.709> that

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
plasmids I have specified that

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.949 
plasmids I have specified that
recombination<00:02:58.430> will<00:02:58.760> result<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.300> one<00:02:59.570> clone

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
recombination will result in one clone

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.910 
recombination will result in one clone
with<00:03:00.440> four<00:03:00.890> inserts<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:02.750> if<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.380> happen<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.770> be

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
with four inserts now if I happen to be

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.250 
with four inserts now if I happen to be
missing<00:03:04.100> anything<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:05.150> experiment<00:03:05.720> analysis

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
missing anything the experiment analysis

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.660 
missing anything the experiment analysis
portion<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.860> window<00:03:07.070> will<00:03:07.220> tell<00:03:07.430> me<00:03:07.520> that

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
portion of the window will tell me that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.750 
portion of the window will tell me that
as<00:03:07.790> well<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.239> let's<00:03:08.720> say<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:10.070> forgot<00:03:10.580> to

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
as well so let's say that I forgot to

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.790 
as well so let's say that I forgot to
add<00:03:10.880> my<00:03:11.060> entry<00:03:11.360> clones<00:03:11.600> I'll<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.500> remove

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
add my entry clones I'll just remove

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.210 
add my entry clones I'll just remove
these<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.959> can<00:03:15.140> see<00:03:15.350> now<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:15.890> telling

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
these you can see now that it's telling

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.930 
these you can see now that it's telling
me<00:03:16.310> my<00:03:16.459> entry<00:03:16.760> clones<00:03:16.970> are<00:03:17.150> missing<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:19.610> I'll

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
me my entry clones are missing so I'll

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.870 
me my entry clones are missing so I'll
go<00:03:20.090> ahead<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.270> add<00:03:20.420> those<00:03:20.600> back<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.730> can

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
go ahead and add those back and you can

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.780 
go ahead and add those back and you can
do<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.209> by<00:03:23.270> dragging<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.260> dropping<00:03:24.790> from

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
do that by dragging and dropping from

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.729 
do that by dragging and dropping from
the<00:03:26.090> cloning<00:03:26.420> project<00:03:26.780> window<00:03:27.080> directly<00:03:27.410> onto
