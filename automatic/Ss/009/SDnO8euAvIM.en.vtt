00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hello guys it's andreen today we take a

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.990 
hello guys it's andreen today we take a
look<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.730> ump45<00:00:03.540> for<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.410> security<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.850> my

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
look at the ump45 for the security in my

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.330 
look at the ump45 for the security in my
opinion<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.839> weapon<00:00:07.290> really<00:00:07.680> shines<00:00:08.160> at

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
opinion this weapon really shines at

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.790 
opinion this weapon really shines at
close<00:00:08.550> quarters<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.690> already<00:00:10.050> know<00:00:10.530> why

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
close quarters and you already know why

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.980 
close quarters and you already know why
because<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.400> lighter<00:00:11.610> weight<00:00:11.990> 3.5

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
because of the lighter weight 3.5

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.049 
because of the lighter weight 3.5
kilograms<00:00:13.259> because<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.429> runs<00:00:14.670> four<00:00:14.880> means

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
kilograms because the runs four means

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.230 
kilograms because the runs four means
are<00:00:15.269> 600<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:17.100> not<00:00:17.340> good<00:00:17.640> compared<00:00:18.150> to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
are 600 and it's not good compared to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.150 
are 600 and it's not good compared to
holder<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:18.869> men<00:00:19.199> jeez<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:19.710> still<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.130> have

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
holder as men jeez but still you have

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.179 
holder as men jeez but still you have
more<00:00:20.640> stopping<00:00:21.390> power<00:00:21.600> than<00:00:22.439> other<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:22.949> men

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
more stopping power than other as men

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.390 
more stopping power than other as men
jeez<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.050> train<00:00:25.320> some<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:26.039> know<00:00:26.160> runs

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
jeez so you can train some you know runs

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.519 
jeez so you can train some you know runs
per<00:00:26.609> minute<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.269> damage<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.050> good<00:00:28.410> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
per minute for damage which is good in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.320 
per minute for damage which is good in
my<00:00:28.680> opinion

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
my opinion

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.820 
my opinion
also<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.779> higher<00:00:30.960> end<00:00:31.170> sights<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.619> not

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
also the higher end sights are not

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.410 
also the higher end sights are not
really<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> best<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.969> weapon<00:00:33.149> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
really the best for this weapon you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.020 
really the best for this weapon you
don't<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> lot<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> visibility<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
don't have a lot of visibility so you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.000 
don't have a lot of visibility so you
might<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.450> take<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.690> consideration

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
might want to take in consideration

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.950 
might want to take in consideration
using<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> holographic<00:00:38.730> sight<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> only<00:00:39.660> one

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
using the holographic sight the only one

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.160 
using the holographic sight the only one
we<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.649> now<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> game<00:00:42.170> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
we can have right now in the game the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.350 
we can have right now in the game the
problem<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.129> weapon<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:44.789> opinion

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
problem with this weapon in my opinion

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.720 
problem with this weapon in my opinion
first<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> recoil<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.039> vertical<00:00:47.489> one

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
first of all the recoil the vertical one

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.819 
first of all the recoil the vertical one
is<00:00:47.940> really<00:00:48.270> easy<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> manage<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.440> probably

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
is really easy to manage the probably

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.880 
is really easy to manage the probably
count<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> side-to-side<00:00:51.000> recoil<00:00:51.890> when

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
count with the side-to-side recoil when

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.340 
count with the side-to-side recoil when
you<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.610> long<00:00:53.910> bars<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> weapon

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you make long bars with this weapon

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.040 
you make long bars with this weapon
the<00:00:55.559> recoil<00:00:55.890> gonna<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> lap<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the recoil gonna go is going to lap to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.619 
the recoil gonna go is going to lap to
right<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.820> can't<00:01:00.059> control<00:01:00.120> it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
right and you really can't control it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.959 
right and you really can't control it
very<00:01:00.780> well<00:01:01.020> especially<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.890> medium<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.789> long

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
very well especially and medium and long

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.590 
very well especially and medium and long
ranges<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:05.220> me<00:01:05.430> sometime<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.119> really

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
ranges and for me sometime I really

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.870 
ranges and for me sometime I really
missed<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.110> lot<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> shots<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.920> even<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.549> hit

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
missed a lot of shots and even if I hit

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.240 
missed a lot of shots and even if I hit
the<00:01:09.570> problem<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.380> don't<00:01:10.439> kill<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> first

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
the problem is I don't kill in the first

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
the problem is I don't kill in the first
shot<00:01:11.520> I'm<00:01:11.700> gonna<00:01:11.850> tell<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> why<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> use

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
shot I'm gonna tell you why when I use

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.190 
shot I'm gonna tell you why when I use
it<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.070> mostly<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.610> demolition<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.689> security

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
it is mostly on demolition and security

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
it is mostly on demolition and security
so<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.710> carrying<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.369> rock<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.759> rocket

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
so when I'm carrying a rock a rocket

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.960 
so when I'm carrying a rock a rocket
launcher<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.780> rocket<00:01:19.439> launcher<00:01:19.830> takes<00:01:20.220> six

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
launcher a rocket launcher takes six

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.539 
launcher a rocket launcher takes six
supplies<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:22.350> order<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.250> weapon

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
supplies in order to get this weapon

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
supplies in order to get this weapon
just<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> web<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:24.869> pantry

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
just to get the web and use pantry

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.679 
just to get the web and use pantry
supplies<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> maximum<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> 10

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
supplies you can have a maximum of 10

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.359 
supplies you can have a maximum of 10
supplies<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.619> game<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.189> means

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
supplies on this game so that means

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.999 
supplies on this game so that means
you're<00:01:29.820> left<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.420> supply<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.409> most<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you're left with one supply and most of

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
you're left with one supply and most of
all<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.030> holographic<00:01:33.630> sights

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
all I use it for the holographic sights

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
all I use it for the holographic sights
so<00:01:34.790> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> big<00:01:36.920> disappointment<00:01:37.920> because

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so this is a big disappointment because

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
so this is a big disappointment because
you<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> spend<00:01:40.350> whole<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you don't want to spend whole the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.980 
you don't want to spend whole the
supplies<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> weapon<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
supplies just to get the weapon and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.380 
supplies just to get the weapon and
Esmond<00:01:43.950> g's<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.310> my<00:01:44.430> opinion<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> ones

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
Esmond g's in my opinion are the ones

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
Esmond g's in my opinion are the ones
that<00:01:45.479> need<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.990> know<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> suppressor<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.220> good

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that need you know a suppressor a good

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.190 
that need you know a suppressor a good
sight<00:01:48.420> maybe<00:01:50.180> armor-piercing<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.390> hollow

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
sight maybe armor-piercing or hollow

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.620 
sight maybe armor-piercing or hollow

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
points because they have really low

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.660 
points because they have really low

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
because even if the stopping power it's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.160 
because even if the stopping power it's
higher<00:02:53.040> its<00:02:53.489> stillness<00:02:53.880> mangie<00:02:54.480> doesn't<00:02:55.019> have

target very fast and if you can't see
the<00:03:34.079> hole<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.350> target<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:35.010> can<00:03:35.310> target<00:03:35.850> it
