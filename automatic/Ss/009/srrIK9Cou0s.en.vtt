picked up everything comes back it's

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.440 
picked up everything comes back it's
fairly<00:02:07.250> easy<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.670> be<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.940> little<00:02:08.209> time

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
fairly easy to be a little time

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.770 
fairly easy to be a little time
consuming<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:10.220> ultimately<00:02:10.819> fairly<00:02:11.300> easy<00:02:11.510> if

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
consuming but ultimately fairly easy if

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.250 
consuming but ultimately fairly easy if
you<00:02:11.900> don't<00:02:12.110> want<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.350> saddle<00:02:12.650> for<00:02:13.040> your<00:02:13.190> BP

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
you don't want to saddle for your BP

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.620 
you don't want to saddle for your BP
you'll<00:02:15.260> only<00:02:15.440> get<00:02:15.650> BP<00:02:16.069> if<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:16.790> maximum

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
you'll only get BP if you have maximum

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.290 
you'll only get BP if you have maximum
capacity<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:19.310> item<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.790> you're<00:02:19.940> leading

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
capacity of the item that you're leading

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.000 
capacity of the item that you're leading
such<00:02:20.720> as<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.989> rocket<00:02:21.319> launches<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.769> homing

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
such as the rocket launches and homing

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.180 
such as the rocket launches and homing
launchers<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.870> have<00:02:24.079> three<00:02:24.799> out<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:24.950> five

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
launchers so you have three out of five

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.539 
launchers so you have three out of five
homing<00:02:25.730> launchers<00:02:26.470> you'll<00:02:27.470> pick<00:02:27.769> up<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:28.220> and

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
homing launchers you'll pick up to and

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.940 
homing launchers you'll pick up to and
then<00:02:28.760> those<00:02:29.480> will<00:02:29.690> not<00:02:29.840> count<00:02:30.110> for<00:02:30.170> 100<00:02:30.650> BP

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
then those will not count for 100 BP

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.850 
then those will not count for 100 BP
each<00:02:31.269> this<00:02:32.269> area<00:02:32.690> will<00:02:33.110> roughly<00:02:33.440> get<00:02:33.709> you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
each this area will roughly get you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.590 
each this area will roughly get you
about<00:02:34.299> 1300<00:02:35.299> BP<00:02:36.019> per<00:02:36.350> run<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.060> find<00:02:38.360> in<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
about 1300 BP per run but I find in the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.120 
about 1300 BP per run but I find in the
next<00:02:38.870> area<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.560> don't<00:02:39.739> want<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.070> many

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
next area I don't want to so many

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.250 
next area I don't want to so many
spoilers<00:02:40.489> but<00:02:40.850> in<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.090> next<00:02:41.209> area<00:02:41.510> there's<00:02:42.140> a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
spoilers but in the next area there's a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.720 
spoilers but in the next area there's a
chest<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:43.010> contains<00:02:43.850> five<00:02:44.209> thousand<00:02:44.840> BP

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
chest that contains five thousand BP

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.509 
chest that contains five thousand BP
which<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:47.090> also<00:02:47.299> be<00:02:47.769> reopened<00:02:48.769> each<00:02:49.070> time<00:02:49.459> you

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
which can also be reopened each time you

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.720 
which can also be reopened each time you
do<00:02:50.329> this<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.260> might<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> little<00:02:51.709> bit<00:02:51.920> more

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
do this so it might be a little bit more

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.820 
do this so it might be a little bit more
easy<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.840> go<00:02:53.989> there<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.680> and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
easy to go there and do it and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.240 
easy to go there and do it and
definitely<00:02:55.519> faster<00:02:56.860> because<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.010> would<00:02:58.099> take

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
definitely faster because it would take

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.920 
definitely faster because it would take
five<00:02:58.400> runs<00:02:58.700> in<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:58.940> lobby<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.390> get<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.659> amount

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
five runs in the lobby to get the amount

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.550 
five runs in the lobby to get the amount
it<00:03:00.200> takes<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.560> get<00:03:00.709> in<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.489> next<00:03:01.730> area<00:03:02.120> but<00:03:02.989> it

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
it takes to get in the next area but it

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.490 
it takes to get in the next area but it
can<00:03:03.799> be<00:03:03.920> done<00:03:04.069> this<00:03:04.459> isn't<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.819> glitch<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:05.510> not

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
can be done this isn't a glitch it's not

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.440 
can be done this isn't a glitch it's not
a<00:03:06.560> bug<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:07.040> not<00:03:07.220> an<00:03:07.340> exploit<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.970> developers

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
a bug is not an exploit the developers

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.300 
a bug is not an exploit the developers
definitely<00:03:08.870> know<00:03:08.989> it's<00:03:09.170> there<00:03:09.319> because<00:03:09.500> other

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
definitely know it's there because other

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.039 
definitely know it's there because other
chest<00:03:10.730> where<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.120> get<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.390> special<00:03:11.510> idol<00:03:11.870> mike

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
chest where you get a special idol mike

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.160 
chest where you get a special idol mike
endurance<00:03:13.150> those<00:03:14.150> tests<00:03:14.840> do<00:03:15.500> not<00:03:15.530> spawn<00:03:16.040> back

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
endurance those tests do not spawn back

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.869 
endurance those tests do not spawn back
while<00:03:18.170> other<00:03:18.470> ones<00:03:18.739> do<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.220> they<00:03:19.459> probably

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
while other ones do so they probably

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.640 
while other ones do so they probably
figured<00:03:20.360> people<00:03:20.569> would<00:03:20.720> be<00:03:21.110> grinding<00:03:22.010> for<00:03:22.129> BP

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
figured people would be grinding for BP

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.220 
figured people would be grinding for BP
so<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:25.610> it's<00:03:25.910> not<00:03:26.090> something<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:27.110> know

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
so it's it's not something that you know

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.960 
so it's it's not something that you know
you<00:03:27.290> can<00:03:27.680> get<00:03:27.799> in<00:03:27.920> trouble<00:03:28.220> or<00:03:28.400> it's<00:03:28.819> not

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
you can get in trouble or it's not

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.759 
you can get in trouble or it's not
something<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.329> be<00:03:29.480> low<00:03:29.989> down<00:03:30.230> on<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.650> know

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
something to be low down on you know

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.710 
something to be low down on you know
it's<00:03:30.980> just<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.340> matter<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:31.670> farming<00:03:32.269> or

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
it's just a matter of farming or

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.410 
it's just a matter of farming or
grinding<00:03:34.480> but<00:03:35.480> it's<00:03:35.870> easy<00:03:36.049> to<00:03:36.230> do<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:38.150> just

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
grinding but it's easy to do but just

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.660 
grinding but it's easy to do but just
