00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.629
 a friend and made craft beer the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.539
 craft beer and good and from there arises 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:21.210
 the proposal to generate this 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.650
 entrepreneurship as a factory 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.910
 and this was a brewery 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.140
 handcrafted today a little bit was trying to 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.630
 broadcast in the region or this is more 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.820
 beyond being a commercial project look 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.570
 in this transmit what was the culture 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.570
 of beer 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.830
 what is the process to make a good 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.380
 beer how to start what are the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.630
 steps well the process starts up start 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.720
 grinding we have here a 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.760
 mill and we have a place where we have 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.660
 deposited the malts and we do the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.790
 grinding a recipe already prepared 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.890
 hydrate 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.350
 directly we went to the room 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.480
 cooking where is where 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.810
 makes beer what kind of malts 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.330
 there and where are the malts used 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.780
 many types of malt the most there are malts 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.300
 base that are the pilsen that is the base 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.610
 of all beer and then according to 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.250
 the malts and the amount one reads 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.380
 I put in the recipe we achieved 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.540
 different types of beer 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.850
 how much more or less do you produce 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.060
 how much malt is used for example for 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.440
 do the volume that they are producing 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:37.270
 we are using around 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.270
 200 kilos per cooking 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.869
 here we do the cooking of beer and 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 We started by heating the water to 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.980
 just temperatures that we look for 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.120
 we put the malt in the water that we already 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.570
 previously it is ground and made 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.320
 stir mixes to homogenize that 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.459
 liquid and the maceration is started what 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.680
 that is called maceration that is 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.830
 we extract and transform the starch into 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.000
 simpler sugars so that the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.860
 yeasts in the fermentation process 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.730
 can assimilate these sugars and 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.310
 produce alcohol and gas which is what 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.280
 fermentation produces this process 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.510
 how long does it have an estimated time 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.380
 us the cooking part that we do 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.300
 two cooking are peace and followed 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.370
 We started at seven in the morning and 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.030
 we finished around six in the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.300
 late and then we would go to the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.300
 fermentation 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.470
 good after the cooking time the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.900
 liquid the must that we take out of the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.720
 cooking goes through a cooler that 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.739
 it cools sharply of a hundred and 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.930
 degrees at 20 to 18 degrees and it happens to these 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.390
 tanks where the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.580
 yeast and here begins the process of 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.760
 fermentation that process takes around 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.610
 of 7 days in which the sugars are 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.849
 they convert into alcohol and gas for another 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.849
 side 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.989
 and then these tanks withstand pressure 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.019
 then we make it ferment and 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.290
 gasifies in a single step and from here the 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.180
 beer we passed directly to barrel 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.150
 to pass the barrel after seven 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.730
 fermentation days we make it mature 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.950
 in this tank 20 days we put the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.780
 yeast we are taking it out 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.410
 progressively the yeast and until 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.090
 It is clear and clean beer that is 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.670
 that a month later the beer to be able 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.470
 take it the process takes more or less a 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.880
 month from the day of prayer until 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.880
 be able to ingest the one month 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.150
 watch the beers the different destinations 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.870
 they have their temperatures 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.169
 the criterion of temperature arises more 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:26.130
 that all because of being able to enjoy more 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.770
 the styles for example the rains 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.200
 and they are softer lighter or 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.610
 coolest beers in particular good 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.610
 if they are brewing the temperature is taken 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.390
 we are not talking about grades 2 Â° 3 Â° but 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.870
 good and styles like you listen to them 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.490
 brown and obasi black ladies like in 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.840
 states are the temperatures that 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.020
 really one notes a lot the difference 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.390
 if part of the 56 degrees where already 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.060
 the aromas typical of malts with the 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.780
 what the product is made are taken 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.780
 a lot of strength 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.180
 It really is a product that every day 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.229
 you go out you search more you buy it more more 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.379
 towards what is personal taste 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.240
 you're also trying to get people 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:16.629
 you like your product then you go 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.559
 looking like people are constantly going 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:23.310
 it is correcting details until 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:26.160
 really find what it is 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.650
 in what one feels that is the point 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.570
 exact ideal where people come to you 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.870
 like and one is more than satisfied with 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.870
 that
