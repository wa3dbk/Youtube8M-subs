these muscles are supposed to contract

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.830 
these muscles are supposed to contract
properly<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.950> equally<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.180> terms<00:00:42.480> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
strength so whenever one side is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.819 
strength so whenever one side is
contracting<00:00:47.039> more<00:00:47.340> than<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> other<00:00:47.820> side<00:00:48.180> or

if one side is weaker than the other

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.119 
if one side is weaker than the other
side<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.050> problems<00:00:52.680> are<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> occur

side then problems are going to occur
which<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.239> manifest<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:55.140> pain<00:00:55.800> loss<00:00:56.520> of
