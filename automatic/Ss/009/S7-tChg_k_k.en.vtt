00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
the reason why that is is it's trying to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.000 
the reason why that is is it's trying to
access<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> CraftBukkit<00:02:57.360> jar<00:02:57.960> file<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.860> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
access a CraftBukkit jar file but the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.500 
access a CraftBukkit jar file but the
name<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.370> actual<00:02:59.760> file<00:02:59.910> we<00:03:00.060> downloaded<00:03:00.090> is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
name of the actual file we downloaded is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.930 
name of the actual file we downloaded is
not<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:01.080> CraftBukkit<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.400> easiest<00:03:02.580> way

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
not just CraftBukkit so the easiest way

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.310 
not just CraftBukkit so the easiest way
to<00:03:03.000> fix<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.720> rename<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:06.320> get

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
to fix that is just rename this and get

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
rid of all these extra dashes and then

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.930 
rid of all these extra dashes and then
enter<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.010> was<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> right-click<00:03:11.460> by<00:03:11.880> the

allocation the one with the essenay is

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.800 
allocation the one with the essenay is
the<00:04:22.650> starting<00:04:23.040> Ram<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:23.610> if<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.910> put<00:04:24.090> like<00:04:24.270> 512

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
the starting Ram so if I put like 512

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.360 
the starting Ram so if I put like 512
I'm<00:04:24.990> telling<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.800> can<00:04:25.919> start<00:04:26.160> by

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
I'm telling it that it can start by

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.260 
I'm telling it that it can start by
loading<00:04:26.640> at<00:04:26.850> least<00:04:27.060> five

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270

12 megabytes of my ram and if it needs

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.730 
12 megabytes of my ram and if it needs
up<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.669> 120<00:04:30.660> or<00:04:30.810> thousand<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.319> twenty<00:04:31.440> four

up to 120 or thousand and twenty four
you<00:04:32.099> go<00:04:32.340> ahead<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.610> use<00:04:32.759> that<00:04:32.789> you<00:04:33.330> can<00:04:33.449> even

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
you go ahead and use that you can even

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.020 
you go ahead and use that you can even
set<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.840> 2<00:04:34.259> g's<00:04:34.680> for<00:04:35.099> gigs<00:04:35.310> too<00:04:35.580> so<00:04:35.819> if<00:04:35.940> you

your<00:05:28.530> server<00:05:28.740> as<00:05:28.979> well<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:30.180> can<00:05:30.389> use<00:05:30.419> a<00:05:30.629> port

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
your server as well you can use a port

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.899 
your server as well you can use a port
forward<00:05:31.289> method<00:05:31.440> but<00:05:31.770> I<00:05:31.830> /<00:05:31.949> I<00:05:32.069> recommend<00:05:32.789> not

doing<00:05:32.969> it<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.539> way<00:05:33.569> it's<00:05:34.050> not<00:05:34.199> as<00:05:34.440> safe<00:05:34.800> and

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
doing it that way it's not as safe and

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.339 
doing it that way it's not as safe and
you<00:05:35.669> may<00:05:35.909> be<00:05:35.940> vulnerable<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.599> computer<00:05:37.110> hacks

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
you may be vulnerable to computer hacks

you may be vulnerable to computer hacks
and<00:05:37.590> attacks<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.099> all<00:05:38.400> at<00:05:38.520> once<00:05:38.789> yet<00:05:39.319> alright

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
and attacks and all at once yet alright

and attacks and all at once yet alright
so<00:05:40.710> in<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.190> server<00:05:41.430> dot<00:05:41.669> properties<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.300> few

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
so in the server dot properties a few

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.939 
so in the server dot properties a few
things<00:05:42.870> you're<00:05:43.050> going<00:05:43.139> to<00:05:43.199> need<00:05:43.289> to<00:05:43.440> add<00:05:43.590> is

things you're going to need to add is

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.670 
things you're going to need to add is
where<00:05:44.250> it<00:05:44.340> says<00:05:44.490> server<00:05:44.789> IP<00:05:45.659> if<00:05:46.110> for<00:05:46.590> whatever

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
where it says server IP if for whatever

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.320 
where it says server IP if for whatever
reason<00:05:46.889> when<00:05:47.279> you<00:05:47.370> do<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:47.699> launch<00:05:47.909> stop<00:05:48.120> at

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
reason when you do the launch stop at

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.570 
reason when you do the launch stop at
and<00:05:48.539> you<00:05:48.599> see<00:05:48.630> failed<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.319> bind<00:05:49.529> to<00:05:50.039> port<00:05:50.250> it's

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
and you see failed to bind to port it's

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.540 
and you see failed to bind to port it's
rather<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.300> IP<00:05:51.509> here<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.110> set<00:05:52.319> wrong<00:05:52.560> or<00:05:52.889> you

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
rather the IP here is set wrong or you

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.980 
rather the IP here is set wrong or you
need<00:05:53.759> to<00:05:53.909> actually<00:05:54.060> set<00:05:54.449> it<00:05:54.539> to<00:05:54.659> what's<00:05:54.870> on

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
need to actually set it to what's on

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.680 
need to actually set it to what's on
your<00:05:55.050> hamachi<00:05:55.289> so<00:05:55.919> for<00:05:56.430> me<00:05:56.610> on<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.240> match<00:05:57.419> it's

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
your hamachi so for me on the match it's

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.300 
your hamachi so for me on the match it's
right<00:05:57.750> here<00:05:58.319> you<00:05:58.680> would<00:05:58.770> set<00:05:58.979> it<00:05:59.009> to<00:05:59.190> those

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
right here you would set it to those

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.899 
right here you would set it to those
numbers<00:05:59.789> and<00:06:00.090> you'll<00:06:00.240> be<00:06:00.389> good<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.690> go<00:06:04.909> okay

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
numbers and you'll be good to go okay

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.290 
numbers and you'll be good to go okay
and<00:06:07.190> everything<00:06:08.190> else<00:06:08.370> here<00:06:08.610> is<00:06:08.759> pretty<00:06:09.120> much

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
and everything else here is pretty much

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.909 
and everything else here is pretty much
straightforward<00:06:09.690> if<00:06:10.289> you<00:06:10.440> want<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.710> change

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
straightforward if you want to change

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.790 
straightforward if you want to change
what<00:06:11.340> world<00:06:11.909> the<00:06:12.569> server<00:06:13.139> is<00:06:13.229> loading<00:06:13.680> you

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
what world the server is loading you

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.709 
what world the server is loading you
would<00:06:13.919> change<00:06:14.219> that<00:06:14.580> to<00:06:14.909> the<00:06:15.000> actual<00:06:15.360> folder

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
would change that to the actual folder

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.719 
would change that to the actual folder
name<00:06:16.139> of<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:16.590> world<00:06:16.800> you<00:06:16.979> want<00:06:17.130> it<00:06:17.279> to<00:06:17.370> load<00:06:17.520> so

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
name of the world you want it to load so

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.330 
name of the world you want it to load so
if<00:06:17.819> you're<00:06:17.940> bringing<00:06:18.210> in<00:06:18.270> like<00:06:18.449> a<00:06:18.479> backup<00:06:18.900> from

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
if you're bringing in like a backup from

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.029 
if you're bringing in like a backup from
vanilla<00:06:20.340> minecraft<00:06:20.969> game<00:06:21.599> or<00:06:22.169> whatever<00:06:22.349> you

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
vanilla minecraft game or whatever you

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.100 
vanilla minecraft game or whatever you
can<00:06:23.159> do<00:06:23.310> that<00:06:23.460> and<00:06:23.729> you<00:06:23.880> just<00:06:24.000> change<00:06:24.360> this<00:06:24.810> to

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
can do that and you just change this to

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.559 
can do that and you just change this to
whatever<00:06:25.319> the<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:26.279> know<00:06:26.400> for<00:06:26.819> the<00:06:26.849> name<00:06:27.120> is<00:06:27.300> of

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
whatever the you know for the name is of

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.809 
whatever the you know for the name is of
the<00:06:27.690> world<00:06:27.840> so<00:06:28.229> the<00:06:28.830> world<00:06:29.009> and<00:06:29.400> it'll<00:06:29.610> load

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
the world so the world and it'll load

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.120 
the world so the world and it'll load
folders<00:06:30.419> called<00:06:30.840> other<00:06:30.990> world<00:06:31.229> so<00:06:31.740> that's

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
folders called other world so that's

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.279 
folders called other world so that's
pretty<00:06:32.789> much<00:06:32.880> it<00:06:33.029> that's<00:06:33.360> you<00:06:33.690> know<00:06:33.810> important

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
pretty much it that's you know important

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.040 
pretty much it that's you know important
in<00:06:34.409> there<00:06:34.909> so<00:06:35.909> go<00:06:36.060> ahead<00:06:36.149> and<00:06:36.330> save<00:06:36.539> that<00:06:36.570> and

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
in there so go ahead and save that and

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.210 
in there so go ahead and save that and
once<00:06:37.649> again<00:06:37.770> those<00:06:38.250> changes<00:06:38.669> won't<00:06:38.849> be<00:06:39.210> done

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
once again those changes won't be done

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.410 
once again those changes won't be done
until<00:06:40.400> you<00:06:40.490> reload<00:06:40.970> the<00:06:41.210> server<00:06:41.950> okay<00:06:42.950> so<00:06:43.820> if

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
until you reload the server okay so if

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.480 
until you reload the server okay so if
you<00:06:45.020> need<00:06:45.170> more<00:06:45.380> information<00:06:45.680> on<00:06:46.070> logmein

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
you need more information on logmein
