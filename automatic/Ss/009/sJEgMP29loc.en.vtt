right<00:01:18.789> now<00:01:19.030> that's<00:01:19.479> going<00:01:19.749> on<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:20.049> windows

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
right now that's going on in windows

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.239 
right now that's going on in windows
vista<00:01:20.729> some<00:01:21.729> applications<00:01:22.420> work<00:01:22.659> flawlessly

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249

don't<00:01:27.039> and<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.490> causes<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.880> lot<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.090> problems<00:01:28.600> so

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
don't and it causes a lot of problems so

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.160 
don't and it causes a lot of problems so
the<00:01:30.039> answer<00:01:30.069> to<00:01:30.459> that<00:01:30.579> would<00:01:30.819> be<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.270> wait<00:01:32.139> a

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
the answer to that would be to wait a

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.719 
the answer to that would be to wait a
little<00:01:32.319> while<00:01:32.469> for<00:01:32.950> all<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:33.219> Kings<00:01:33.429> to<00:01:33.579> get

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
little while for all the Kings to get

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.540 
little while for all the Kings to get
ironed<00:01:33.999> out<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.499> then

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.030 

and<00:01:37.670> then<00:01:38.390> dive<00:01:38.720> in<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:39.440> you<00:01:39.740> know<00:01:39.830> in<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
and then dive in but you know in the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.270 
and then dive in but you know in the
past<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.790> even<00:01:41.530> now<00:01:42.530> I'm<00:01:42.770> thinking<00:01:42.920> about

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
past and even now I'm thinking about

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.940 
past and even now I'm thinking about
just<00:01:43.970> go<00:01:44.150> ahead<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.480> getting<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.380> and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
just go ahead and getting it and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.220 
just go ahead and getting it and
actually<00:01:46.190> serving<00:01:46.670> as<00:01:47.000> one<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.720> those<00:01:47.900> people

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
actually serving as one of those people

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.440 
actually serving as one of those people
to<00:01:48.320> iron<00:01:48.560> out<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.800> issues<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.490> actually

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
to iron out the issues and actually

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.300 
to iron out the issues and actually
report<00:01:50.870> to<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.080> guys<00:01:51.320> what<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.040> should<00:01:52.220> avoid

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
report to you guys what you should avoid

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.030 
report to you guys what you should avoid
and<00:01:52.760> things<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.180> that<00:01:53.240> it's<00:01:53.900> just<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
and things like that it's just a the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.480 
and things like that it's just a the
early<00:01:55.310> adopter<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:57.110> um<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.590> got<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.160> lot<00:01:58.460> of

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
early adopter but um I got a lot of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.790 
early adopter but um I got a lot of
important<00:01:59.180> things<00:01:59.210> running<00:01:59.660> on<00:01:59.870> the<00:01:59.960> max<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.470> I

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
important things running on the max so I

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.970 
important things running on the max so I
don't<00:02:01.340> have<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.490> spare<00:02:01.910> machine<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:03.710> really

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
don't have a spare machine to really

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.710 
don't have a spare machine to really
