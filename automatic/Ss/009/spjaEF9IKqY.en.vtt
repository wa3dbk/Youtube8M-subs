00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.580 
do is on the side or from behind you got
like<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.550> really<00:03:02.820> quickly<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:04.320> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
like that just really quickly so like I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.260 
like that just really quickly so like I
graph<00:03:06.290> right<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.530> then<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.190> did<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.580> lost<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
graph right and then I did the lost and

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.100 
graph right and then I did the lost and
transformed<00:03:10.050> right<00:03:11.330> lastly<00:03:12.330> transformed<00:03:12.959> is

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
transformed right lastly transformed is

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.160 
transformed right lastly transformed is
when<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.950> also<00:03:14.310> do<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.700> double<00:03:15.090> left<00:03:15.270> your

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
double left in lot of tricks and there

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.390 
double left in lot of tricks and there
are<00:03:19.080> few<00:03:19.230> tutorials<00:03:19.380> for<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.220> youtube

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
are few tutorials for this on youtube

are few tutorials for this on youtube
double<00:03:21.360> life<00:03:21.510> right<00:03:21.900> they<00:03:22.590> don't<00:03:22.830> see<00:03:23.070> it

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
double life right they don't see it

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.060 
double life right they don't see it
because<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.640> done<00:03:23.880> looks<00:03:24.690> like<00:03:24.930> you've<00:03:25.680> run<00:03:25.860> up
