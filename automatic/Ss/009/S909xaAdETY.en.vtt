00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
feel well rich the centerpiece is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.680 
feel well rich the centerpiece is
definitely<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.000> big<00:01:36.300> entertainment

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
definitely this big entertainment

display on the center console which

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
display on the center console which
looks<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.330> an<00:01:39.540> iPad<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.470> not<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
looks a bit like an iPad it's not a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.020 
looks a bit like an iPad it's not a
touchscreen<00:01:40.950> though<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.610> guess<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> idea

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
touchscreen though I guess the idea

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.550 
touchscreen though I guess the idea
being<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.110> driving<00:01:43.290> around

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
being that when you're driving around

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
being that when you're driving around
you<00:01:44.190> don't<00:01:44.369> necessarily<00:01:44.940> have<00:01:45.090> full<00:01:45.330> control

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
you don't necessarily have full control

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.270 
you don't necessarily have full control
over<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:46.020> arm<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.650> you're<00:01:46.890> bouncing

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
over your arm because you're bouncing

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.200 
over your arm because you're bouncing
all<00:01:47.400> over<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.729> place

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
all over the place

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.210 
all over the place
so<00:01:48.570> instead<00:01:48.900> Mercedes<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.650> used<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.009> couple

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
so instead Mercedes have used a couple

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.550 
so instead Mercedes have used a couple
of<00:01:50.369> alternative<00:01:51.030> input<00:01:51.360> methods<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.530> first

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
of alternative input methods the first

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.680 
of alternative input methods the first
is<00:01:53.100> much<00:01:53.340> tried<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> trusted<00:01:54.030> command

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690

the<00:02:13.200> fact<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.650> open<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.040> boot<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:15.030> the

the fact you can open the boot with the

you're driving a car from the future

then you get pulled right back into the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.720 
present notice I didn't say past though
because<00:03:38.930> this<00:03:39.199> car<00:03:39.440> it's<00:03:39.919> still<00:03:40.010> fun<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.430> drive

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
because this car it's still fun to drive

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.610 
because this car it's still fun to drive
and<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:40.970> feels<00:03:41.180> great<00:03:41.449> if<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.079> keep<00:03:42.260> your<00:03:42.410> foot

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
and it feels great if you keep your foot

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.009 
and it feels great if you keep your foot
planted<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.250> will<00:03:43.340> go<00:03:43.459> all<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.699> way<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:44.030> 152

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
planted it will go all the way to 152

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:45.970 
planted it will go all the way to 152
miles<00:03:45.440> per<00:03:45.650> hour

miles per hour

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.270

so<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.790> definitely<00:03:47.030> doesn't<00:03:47.629> hang<00:03:47.900> about<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
so it definitely doesn't hang about the

so it definitely doesn't hang about the
ride<00:03:49.519> quality<00:03:49.699> is<00:03:50.150> awesome

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
ride quality is awesome

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.330 
ride quality is awesome
especially<00:03:51.199> if<00:03:51.290> you're<00:03:51.440> on<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.590> smooth<00:03:51.859> a<00:03:52.099> road

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340
