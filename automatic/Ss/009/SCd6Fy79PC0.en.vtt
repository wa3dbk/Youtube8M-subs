know say later on down the road wanna
buy<00:01:51.030> another<00:01:51.299> graphics<00:01:51.750> card<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.259> know<00:01:52.380> get

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
buy another graphics card you know get

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620 
buy another graphics card you know get
another<00:01:52.890> graphics<00:01:53.399> card<00:01:53.729> hook<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.479> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
another graphics card hook it up and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.000 
another graphics card hook it up and
you're<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.259> faster

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
you're going to get faster

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.370 
you're going to get faster
upgrade<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.400> ram<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.810> way<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
upgrade the ram but the way that this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
upgrade the ram but the way that this
thing<00:01:58.590> comes<00:01:58.860> right<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.550> all<00:01:59.730> set<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
thing comes right now is all set so

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.970 
thing comes right now is all set so
let's<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.750> some<00:02:00.870> stuff<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.950> know

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
let's go for some stuff on it you know

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.850 
let's go for some stuff on it you know
you're<00:02:02.220> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.400> have<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.610> Amy<00:02:02.790> athlon<00:02:03.860> x2

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you're going to have to Amy athlon x2

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.220 
you're going to have to Amy athlon x2
which<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> dual<00:02:05.820> core<00:02:06.090> 2.8<00:02:06.600> gigahertz<00:02:06.900> and

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
which is the dual core 2.8 gigahertz and

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.570 
which is the dual core 2.8 gigahertz and
it's<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> black<00:02:07.800> condition<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.520> is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it's the black condition so is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.770 
it's the black condition so is
overclockable<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:10.170> 4<00:02:11.160> gigabytes<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:12.090> corsair

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
