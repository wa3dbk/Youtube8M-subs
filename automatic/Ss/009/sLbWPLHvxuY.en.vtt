here<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.140> mesh<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> mesh

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
here is like a mesh this is like a mesh

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.139 
here is like a mesh this is like a mesh
let<00:01:45.149> me<00:01:45.210> pull<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.600> off<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.030> see

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
let me pull this off and you can see

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.380 
let me pull this off and you can see
that<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.509> another<00:01:48.689> bonnet<00:01:49.759> underneath<00:01:50.759> so

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that I have another bonnet underneath so

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.050 
that I have another bonnet underneath so
this<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.720> more<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.649> meshing<00:01:52.979> see<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
this is more like a meshing see that a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.420 
this is more like a meshing see that a
messy<00:01:54.390> type<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> material<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.470> use<00:01:55.560> just

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
messy type of material that I use just

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.399 
messy type of material that I use just
to<00:01:56.549> hold<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.090> place<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
to hold this in place because if I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.170 
to hold this in place because if I
didn't<00:01:58.799> we'll<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.369> floppy<00:01:59.700> around<00:02:00.119> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
didn't we'll just be all floppy around I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120 
didn't we'll just be all floppy around I
have<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> lot<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> hair<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.860> mesh

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
have a lot of hair so this the mesh

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.280 
have a lot of hair so this the mesh
helps<00:02:02.579> me<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.969> control<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.719> hair<00:02:03.930> under<00:02:04.259> here

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
helps me to control the hair under here

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
helps me to control the hair under here

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
spring lock twist out after I separated

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.860 
spring lock twist out after I separated
everything<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:43.700> get<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.330> really
