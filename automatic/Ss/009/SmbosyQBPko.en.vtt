00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
with having one side longer than the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.770 
with having one side longer than the
other<00:04:32.710> which<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.730> really<00:04:34.000> liked<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.540> it's

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
other which I really liked so it's

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:43.640 
other which I really liked so it's
basically<00:04:35.350> up<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.770> you

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.950 

and<00:04:44.010> just<00:04:44.580> keep<00:04:44.760> smudging<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.419> spearing<00:04:45.780> and

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
and just keep smudging and spearing and

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.350 
and just keep smudging and spearing and
so<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.169> get<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.710> look<00:04:46.889> that<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.220> want

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.929 

so<00:04:52.259> just<00:04:52.620> about<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.009> last<00:04:53.189> thing<00:04:53.520> here<00:04:53.759> I

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939 
so just about the last thing here I

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.610 
so just about the last thing here I
wanted<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.539> make<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.870> lip<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.139> little<00:04:55.470> bit

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
wanted to make the lip a little bit

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.950 
wanted to make the lip a little bit
darker<00:04:56.069> make<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.490> feel<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:57.090> little<00:04:57.330> bit<00:04:57.509> dirtier

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
darker make it feel a little bit dirtier

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.499 
darker make it feel a little bit dirtier
and<00:04:58.319> so<00:04:59.189> I'm<00:04:59.310> going<00:04:59.610> over<00:04:59.729> again<00:05:00.330> with

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
and so I'm going over again with

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.589 
and so I'm going over again with
perversion<00:05:01.460> just<00:05:02.460> over<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:02.909> entire<00:05:03.300> lip

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
perversion just over the entire lip

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.779 
perversion just over the entire lip
lightly<00:05:04.439> so<00:05:04.889> we<00:05:05.009> just<00:05:05.159> add<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.340> little<00:05:05.490> bit<00:05:05.639> of

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
lightly so we just add a little bit of

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.670 
lightly so we just add a little bit of
darkness<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.539> I'm<00:05:06.629> going<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.810> take<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.289> also

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
darkness and I'm going to take it also

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:28.070 
darkness and I'm going to take it also
out<00:05:07.919> onto<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.430> smile<00:05:08.759> lines

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.580 

so<00:05:28.560> just<00:05:28.979> some<00:05:29.190> last-minute<00:05:29.720> detailing<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:30.960> I

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
so just some last-minute detailing and I

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.670 
so just some last-minute detailing and I
kind<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.250> wanted<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.610> differentiate<00:05:33.300> her<00:05:33.810> from

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
kind of wanted to differentiate her from

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.010 
kind of wanted to differentiate her from
my<00:05:35.160> Joker<00:05:35.610> like<00:05:35.759> that<00:05:35.940> I've<00:05:36.030> done<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:36.900> just

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
my Joker like that I've done so I just

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.670 
my Joker like that I've done so I just
added<00:05:37.699> one<00:05:38.699> dot<00:05:38.970> below<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:39.990> diamond<00:05:40.349> on<00:05:40.530> each

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
added one dot below the diamond on each

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.670 
added one dot below the diamond on each
side<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.370> then<00:05:41.909> three<00:05:42.300> on<00:05:42.509> the<00:05:42.629> top<00:05:42.840> just<00:05:43.409> down

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
side and then three on the top just down

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:52.790

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.650 

and<00:05:53.370> then<00:05:53.550> I'm<00:05:53.699> going<00:05:53.879> to<00:05:53.940> go<00:05:54.090> ahead<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.449> just
