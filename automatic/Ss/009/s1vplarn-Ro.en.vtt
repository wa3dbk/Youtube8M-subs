it and only escaped with you know only
having<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> use<00:01:42.119> 780<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:42.869> pretty

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
having to use 780 so that's pretty

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.539 
having to use 780 so that's pretty
awesome<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.880> i<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.200> i<00:01:46.560> need<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.130> do

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
awesome and i do not know i need to do

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.410 
awesome and i do not know i need to do
some<00:01:47.700> research<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.420> figure<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:50.420> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
some research and figure out if the this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.020 
some research and figure out if the this
the<00:01:51.869> dragon<00:01:52.229> defender<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> dragon<00:01:53.549> CIMMYT

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the dragon defender with a dragon CIMMYT

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.300 
the dragon defender with a dragon CIMMYT
are<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.930> better<00:01:55.170> than<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.860> ser

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
are is actually better than a ser

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.139 
are is actually better than a ser
diamond<00:01:56.640> sword<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.090> i'm<00:01:57.990> assuming<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:59.149> but

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
diamond sword which i'm assuming not but

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.450 
diamond sword which i'm assuming not but
you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.829> I've<00:02:01.829> been<00:02:02.130> wrong<00:02:02.280> before

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
you know I I've been wrong before

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.179 
you know I I've been wrong before
multiple<00:02:03.390> times<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.860> something<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
multiple times so that's something I

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.590 
multiple times so that's something I
have<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.640> try<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.180> i<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.360> find<00:02:06.390> out

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
have to go try and see if i can find out

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
have to go try and see if i can find out
to<00:02:06.719> actually<00:02:07.020> i<00:02:07.049> thought<00:02:07.530> i<00:02:07.560> had<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:08.099> yes<00:02:08.369> i<00:02:08.520> do

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
to actually i thought i had one yes i do

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.790 
to actually i thought i had one yes i do
okay<00:02:08.940> perfect<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> perfect<00:02:10.500> way

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
okay perfect so this is the perfect way

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.880 
okay perfect so this is the perfect way
to<00:02:10.860> check<00:02:11.099> let's<00:02:11.370> find<00:02:11.550> out<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.940> we've<00:02:12.180> got

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to check let's find out so we've got

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.039 
to check let's find out so we've got
118<00:02:14.890> /<00:02:15.280> with<00:02:16.560> 107<00:02:17.560> million<00:02:17.769> strength<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.840> it's

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
118 / with 107 million strength so it's

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.080 
118 / with 107 million strength so it's
a<00:02:20.140> little<00:02:20.290> better<00:02:20.500> strength<00:02:21.010> wise<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:21.819> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
a little better strength wise but the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.309 
a little better strength wise but the
accuracy<00:02:23.370> what<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.489> defender<00:02:24.939> is<00:02:25.090> better<00:02:25.420> hmm

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
accuracy what the defender is better hmm

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.490 
accuracy what the defender is better hmm
it's<00:02:27.189> tough<00:02:27.400> decision<00:02:28.000> grated<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:28.959> cost<00:02:29.290> of

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
it's tough decision grated one cost of

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.679 
it's tough decision grated one cost of
 ton<00:02:29.889> more<00:02:30.069> so<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.609> may<00:02:31.180> actually<00:02:31.299> end<00:02:31.510> up

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
 ton more so I may actually end up

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:32.970 
 ton more so I may actually end up
trying<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.989> sell<00:02:32.170> my<00:02:32.319> serums<00:02:32.680> or<00:02:32.829> they're

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
trying to sell my serums or they're

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.550 
trying to sell my serums or they're
probably<00:02:33.129> not<00:02:33.280> worth<00:02:33.489> too<00:02:33.700> much<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.840> yeah<00:02:35.230> so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
probably not worth too much but yeah so

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.050 
probably not worth too much but yeah so
that's<00:02:35.829> pretty<00:02:36.280> awesome<00:02:36.370> i<00:02:36.579> got<00:02:36.670> my<00:02:36.730> dragon

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
that's pretty awesome i got my dragon

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.879 
that's pretty awesome i got my dragon
finish<00:02:37.359> i<00:02:37.450> was<00:02:37.540> pretty<00:02:37.659> cool<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.439> after<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.739> got

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
finish i was pretty cool so after I got

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.250 
finish i was pretty cool so after I got
the<00:02:39.069> defender<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:39.730> decided<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.540> go<00:02:40.719> do<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.049> little

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
the defender I decided to go do a little

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.690 
the defender I decided to go do a little
bit<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.409> the<00:02:41.650> mother<00:02:41.829> lode<00:02:42.069> mine<00:02:42.280> because<00:02:42.609> I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
bit of the mother lode mine because I

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.490 
bit of the mother lode mine because I
had<00:02:42.790> actually<00:02:43.060> never<00:02:43.180> been<00:02:43.329> there<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:43.840> I've

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
had actually never been there and I've

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.050 
had actually never been there and I've
always<00:02:44.650> wanted<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:45.010> try<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.280> out<00:02:45.459> plus<00:02:45.849> I<00:02:45.970> was

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
always wanted to try it out plus I was

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.390 
always wanted to try it out plus I was
also<00:02:46.239> editing<00:02:46.959> videos<00:02:47.319> at<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> time<00:02:47.799> so<00:02:48.370> I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
also editing videos at the time so I

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.309 
also editing videos at the time so I
figured<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.909> needed<00:02:48.939> to<00:02:49.299> find<00:02:49.510> some<00:02:49.870> sort<00:02:50.109> of<00:02:50.139> a

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
figured I needed to find some sort of a

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.289 
figured I needed to find some sort of a
FK<00:02:50.680> like<00:02:51.220> skill<00:02:51.579> that<00:02:51.609> I<00:02:51.790> could<00:02:51.970> do<00:02:52.090> while<00:02:52.269> i

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
FK like skill that I could do while i

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.210 
FK like skill that I could do while i
was<00:02:52.359> editing<00:02:52.510> videos<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.799> two<00:02:53.919> choices

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
was editing videos and the two choices

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.640 
was editing videos and the two choices
were<00:02:54.790> essentially<00:02:55.419> mining<00:02:55.870> or<00:02:56.019> wood<00:02:56.319> cutting

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
were essentially mining or wood cutting

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.559 
were essentially mining or wood cutting
because<00:02:57.340> eventually<00:02:57.730> i<00:02:57.939> want<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.299> give<00:02:58.450> my

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
because eventually i want to give my

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.959 
because eventually i want to give my
stats<00:02:58.840> up<00:02:59.049> to<00:02:59.169> 70<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.980> know<00:03:00.069> 70<00:03:00.489> Plus<00:03:00.639> skills

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
stats up to 70 you know 70 Plus skills

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.690 
stats up to 70 you know 70 Plus skills
and<00:03:01.239> those<00:03:02.109> are<00:03:02.319> my<00:03:02.560> two<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:03.010> believe<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.430> are

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
and those are my two I believe that are

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.640 
and those are my two I believe that are
below<00:03:03.939> 70<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.599> are<00:03:04.689> actually<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.260> decently

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
below 70 that are actually like decently

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.740 
below 70 that are actually like decently
AFK<00:03:06.040> well<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:06.790> i<00:03:06.819> chose<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.209> mother<00:03:07.389> lode<00:03:07.569> mine

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
AFK well so i chose the mother lode mine

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.539 
AFK well so i chose the mother lode mine
since<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.079> was<00:03:08.109> already<00:03:08.439> I<00:03:08.769> think<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.219> I<00:03:09.430> was

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
since I was already I think like I was

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.339 
since I was already I think like I was
either<00:03:09.669> 59<00:03:10.239> or<00:03:10.450> 60<00:03:10.750> mining<00:03:11.019> I'm<00:03:11.109> not<00:03:11.230> one

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
either 59 or 60 mining I'm not one

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.319 
either 59 or 60 mining I'm not one
hundred<00:03:11.439> percent<00:03:11.620> sure<00:03:11.859> but<00:03:12.639> um<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.000> just<00:03:13.180> I

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
hundred percent sure but um I just I

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.670 
hundred percent sure but um I just I
just<00:03:13.419> hung<00:03:13.689> out<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:13.959> while<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.260> was<00:03:14.379> editing

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
just hung out there while I was editing

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.949 
just hung out there while I was editing
videos<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.159> stuff<00:03:15.250> like<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:16.569> managed

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
videos and stuff like that and I managed

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.219 
videos and stuff like that and I managed
to<00:03:17.049> get<00:03:17.379> myself<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.979> 65<00:03:18.819> mining<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.449> I<00:03:19.930> decided

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
to get myself to 65 mining and I decided

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.479 
to get myself to 65 mining and I decided
that<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.440> didn't<00:03:20.709> want<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.859> go<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.220> straight

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489

the<00:03:27.280> 65<00:03:27.760> mining<00:03:28.239> while<00:03:28.750> i<00:03:28.780> was<00:03:28.959> AFK<00:03:29.169> videos<00:03:29.739> and

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
the 65 mining while i was AFK videos and

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.460 
the 65 mining while i was AFK videos and
then<00:03:30.579> i<00:03:30.760> decided<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.329> go<00:03:31.359> train<00:03:31.900> woodcutting

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470
