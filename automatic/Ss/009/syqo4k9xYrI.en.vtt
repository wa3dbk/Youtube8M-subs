best four moves for your Pokemon this
video<00:00:08.340> should<00:00:08.700> help<00:00:08.910> out<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:09.690> first<00:00:09.929> off<00:00:10.139> let's

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
video should help out so first off let's

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.629 
video should help out so first off let's
just<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> little<00:00:10.920> bit<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.099> type<00:00:11.280> trivia

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
just do a little bit of type trivia

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.150 
just do a little bit of type trivia
itself<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.480> monotypes<00:00:12.990> ground<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.769> fighting

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
itself for monotypes ground and fighting

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400 
itself for monotypes ground and fighting
deal<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> highest<00:00:15.450> super<00:00:15.750> effective<00:00:16.199> hits

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
deal the highest super effective hits

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.980 
deal the highest super effective hits
with<00:00:16.740> five<00:00:17.100> each<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.090> ground<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.869> hit

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
with five each so ground is going to hit

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.420 
with five each so ground is going to hit
electric<00:00:19.320> fire<00:00:19.500> poison<00:00:19.740> rock<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.220> steel

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
electric fire poison rock and steel

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.460 
electric fire poison rock and steel
fighting<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.480> hit<00:00:21.600> dark<00:00:21.869> ice<00:00:22.080> normal

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
fighting is going to hit dark ice normal

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.620 
fighting is going to hit dark ice normal
rock<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.800> steel<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.240> see<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.510> there

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
rock and steel so you can see that there

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.330 
rock and steel so you can see that there
are<00:00:24.660> some<00:00:24.930> overlaps<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.859> overall<00:00:26.130> you're

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
are some overlaps but overall you're

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.710 
are some overlaps but overall you're
going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.699> good<00:00:26.849> coverage<00:00:27.029> between<00:00:27.390> these

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
going to get good coverage between these

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.750 
going to get good coverage between these
now<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.380> their<00:00:28.710> own<00:00:28.890> things<00:00:29.580> that

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
now they do have their own things that

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.279 
now they do have their own things that
are<00:00:30.060> immune<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> them<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.140> are

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
are immune to them so there are

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.810 
are immune to them so there are
drawbacks<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.949> fighting<00:00:32.279> does<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> lot

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
drawbacks and fighting does have a lot

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880 
drawbacks and fighting does have a lot
of<00:00:32.850> resistances<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.140> want<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
of resistances if we want to get the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.240 
of resistances if we want to get the
highest<00:00:35.540> potential<00:00:36.540> super<00:00:37.440> effective<00:00:37.860> from

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
highest potential super effective from

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.520 
highest potential super effective from
just<00:00:38.460> four<00:00:38.640> moves<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.120> monotypes<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.170> number

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
just four moves on monotypes that number

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
just four moves on monotypes that number
is<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.010> 14<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.820> you're<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
is going to be 14 and you're going to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.440 
is going to be 14 and you're going to
need<00:00:42.690> dark<00:00:43.050> ground<00:00:43.620> fighting<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.489> ice<00:00:44.760> so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
need dark ground fighting and ice so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.180 
need dark ground fighting and ice so
with<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> fighting<00:00:46.379> ground<00:00:46.710> we're<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
with the fighting ground we're going to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.830 
with the fighting ground we're going to
knock<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.640> rock<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> steel<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.660> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
knock off rock and steel like that so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.330 
knock off rock and steel like that so
I'm<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> apply<00:00:49.469> once<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.190> for

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.479 
monotype super effective hits which is
also<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.500> really<00:00:55.860> nice<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.460> can

also going to be really nice you can
also<00:00:56.820> get<00:00:57.090> 14<00:00:57.510> supers<00:00:57.930> by<00:00:58.230> swapping<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
also get 14 supers by swapping out and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.490 
also get 14 supers by swapping out and
dark<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> putting<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> flying<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.109> that's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
dark and putting in flying and that's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
dark and putting in flying and that's
also<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> give<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> those<00:01:02.699> extra<00:01:02.760> super

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
also going to give you those extra super

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
also going to give you those extra super
effective<00:01:03.660> hits<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.710> work<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.070> so

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
effective hits that really work out so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
effective hits that really work out so
still<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.060> ground<00:01:06.420> fighting

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
still it's going to be ground fighting

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
still it's going to be ground fighting
and<00:01:07.380> ice<00:01:07.650> giving<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> coverage<00:01:08.939> and

and ice giving you a lot of coverage and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
and ice giving you a lot of coverage and
then<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> flying<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.229> rounding<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
then the flying just rounding it out and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.310 
then the flying just rounding it out and
giving<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.280> 14<00:01:11.760> super<00:01:12.119> effective<00:01:12.479> hits<00:01:12.689> now

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
giving you 14 super effective hits now

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.359 
giving you 14 super effective hits now
you<00:01:13.380> might<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.650> wondering<00:01:13.950> well<00:01:14.220> which

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you might be wondering well which

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
you might be wondering well which
pokemon<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.180> that's<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.020> gal

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
pokemon get this that's going to be gal

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.130 
pokemon get this that's going to be gal
aid<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.770> Dragonite<00:01:17.520> Kelley<00:01:18.119> has<00:01:18.479> ground

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140

fighting<00:01:19.680> dark<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> ice<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.299> Dragonite

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
fighting dark and ice and then Dragonite

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.560 
fighting dark and ice and then Dragonite
has<00:01:21.900> ground<00:01:22.229> fighting<00:01:22.619> flying<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.670> ice<00:01:23.939> now

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
has ground fighting flying and ice now

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
has ground fighting flying and ice now
that<00:01:24.840> doesn't<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.439> matter<00:01:25.799> though

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that doesn't really matter though

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.380 
that doesn't really matter though
because<00:01:26.250> there<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> lot<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> dual<00:01:27.180> type

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
because there are a lot of dual type

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.969 
because there are a lot of dual type
Pokemon<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> game<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.770> when<00:01:28.890> we

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
Pokemon in the game so that's when we

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and the type coverages that work against

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.370 
and the type coverages that work against
it<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> choose<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.509> four<00:01:36.750> moves<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it so you can choose up to four moves to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.140 
it so you can choose up to four moves to
represent<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> four<00:01:38.250> types<00:01:38.460> corresponding

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
represent the four types corresponding

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.789 
represent the four types corresponding
to<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> attacking<00:01:39.659> moves<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.200> your<00:01:40.380> pokemon

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
to the attacking moves on your pokemon

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.770 
to the attacking moves on your pokemon
and<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.430> lets<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.729> plan<00:01:41.970> out<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:42.420> gives<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and it lets you plan out which gives you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.480 
and it lets you plan out which gives you
the<00:01:42.899> best<00:01:43.049> coverage<00:01:43.259> overall<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.399> can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the best coverage overall so as you can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
the best coverage overall so as you can
see<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.850> pretty<00:01:45.030> useful<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.899> let

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020

have the highest neutral hits so you

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.600 
have the highest neutral hits so you
you're<00:02:07.469> looking<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> can

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you're looking at it like it you can

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.919 
you're looking at it like it you can
find<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.970> trade-offs<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.539> find<00:02:09.720> which

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
find the trade-offs you can find which

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.029 
find the trade-offs you can find which
moves<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.229> gonna<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.410> strongest<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:10.920> your

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
moves are gonna be strongest for your

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.940 
moves are gonna be strongest for your
pokemon<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
pokemon and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.770 
pokemon and
so<00:02:12.040> shows<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.459> immunities<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.150> between

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
so shows the immunities that between

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.390 
so shows the immunities that between
ghosts<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.200> fighting<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:14.860> perfect

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
ghosts and fighting you get perfect

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.089 
ghosts and fighting you get perfect
neutral<00:02:15.760> coverage<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.500> 317<00:02:17.500> super<00:02:17.800> effective

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
neutral coverage and 317 super effective

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.440 
neutral coverage and 317 super effective
hits<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.670> that's<00:02:18.790> kind<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.270> main

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
hits so that's kind of one of the main

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.670 
hits so that's kind of one of the main
things<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.750> note<00:02:19.959> here<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.530> just

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
things to note here is that if you just

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.530 
things to note here is that if you just
want<00:02:20.860> neutral<00:02:21.220> coverage<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.090> access<00:02:22.420> to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
want neutral coverage you have access to

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.089 
want neutral coverage you have access to
ghosts<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:22.930> fighting<00:02:23.170> you're<00:02:23.620> already<00:02:23.830> done

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
ghosts and fighting you're already done

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.620 
ghosts and fighting you're already done
so<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:24.489> hit<00:02:24.670> everything<00:02:25.150> without<00:02:25.300> being

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
so you can hit everything without being

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.270 
so you can hit everything without being
resisted<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.620> works<00:02:26.770> out<00:02:26.890> really<00:02:27.069> nice

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
resisted and that works out really nice

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.610 
resisted and that works out really nice
also<00:02:28.060> because<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.480> chemin<00:02:28.810> Joe<00:02:29.020> you're<00:02:29.410> going

patched up with water dark anything else
really<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.450> heat<00:04:07.720> Rotom<00:04:08.079> is<00:04:08.290> hit<00:04:08.530> neutral<00:04:08.889> by

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
really that heat Rotom is hit neutral by

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.430 
really that heat Rotom is hit neutral by
that<00:04:09.609> dark<00:04:10.030> fairy<00:04:10.329> is<00:04:10.600> only<00:04:10.810> resisted<00:04:11.319> by

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
you kind of see which moves your Pokemon

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.960 
you kind of see which moves your Pokemon
can<00:04:20.289> get<00:04:20.470> access<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.220> then<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.580> just<00:04:21.760> kind

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
can get access to and then you just kind

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.070 
can get access to and then you just kind
of<00:04:22.030> figure<00:04:22.240> out<00:04:22.360> which<00:04:22.510> one's<00:04:22.720> going<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:22.960> give

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
of figure out which one's going to give

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.909 
of figure out which one's going to give
the<00:04:23.200> best<00:04:23.380> coverage

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
the best coverage

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.290 
the best coverage
and<00:04:24.099> also<00:04:24.400> at<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.699> same<00:04:24.849> time<00:04:24.909> you<00:04:25.210> know

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
and also at the same time you know

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.850 
and also at the same time you know
you're<00:04:25.449> not<00:04:25.539> going<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.840> see<00:04:26.110> every<00:04:26.710> single

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
you're not going to see every single

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.589 
you're not going to see every single
Pokemon<00:04:27.159> all<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.669> time<00:04:27.849> now<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> lot<00:04:28.479> of<00:04:28.509> these

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
Pokemon all the time now a lot of these

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.149 
Pokemon all the time now a lot of these
are<00:04:28.810> not<00:04:28.960> fully<00:04:29.139> evolved<00:04:29.439> Pokemon<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.889> lot<00:04:30.069> is

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
are not fully evolved Pokemon a lot is

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:31.980 
are not fully evolved Pokemon a lot is
Pokemon<00:04:30.550> aren't<00:04:30.789> in<00:04:30.879> the<00:04:30.969> meta<00:04:31.150> but<00:04:31.719> you<00:04:31.840> can

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
Pokemon aren't in the meta but you can

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.600 
Pokemon aren't in the meta but you can
just<00:04:32.139> kind<00:04:32.289> of<00:04:32.319> use<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.740> understand<00:04:33.340> what

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
just kind of use it to understand what

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.129 
just kind of use it to understand what
your<00:04:33.759> going<00:04:33.939> to<00:04:34.000> be<00:04:34.060> weak<00:04:34.210> against<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:34.750> then

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
your going to be weak against and then

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.839 
your going to be weak against and then
if<00:04:35.319> you<00:04:35.439> want<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.740> build<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.069> Pokemon<00:04:36.460> it's

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
if you want to build a Pokemon it's

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.640 
if you want to build a Pokemon it's
actually<00:04:37.120> fairly<00:04:37.300> easy<00:04:37.419> that<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.289> just<00:04:38.439> look

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
actually fairly easy that you just look

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.379 
actually fairly easy that you just look
for<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.949> stab<00:04:39.219> coverage<00:04:39.610> like<00:04:40.030> safe<00:04:40.210> for

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
for the stab coverage like safe for

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.490 
for the stab coverage like safe for
Garchomp<00:04:40.750> that's<00:04:40.930> where<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.139> came<00:04:41.199> up<00:04:41.349> with

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
Garchomp that's where I came up with

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.170 
Garchomp that's where I came up with
dragon<00:04:42.039> ground<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.490> then<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.759> just<00:04:42.939> kind<00:04:43.120> of

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
dragon ground and then you just kind of

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.270 
dragon ground and then you just kind of
see<00:04:43.389> what<00:04:43.900> is<00:04:44.050> resisted<00:04:44.590> by<00:04:44.620> dragon<00:04:45.069> ground

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
see what is resisted by dragon ground

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.679 
see what is resisted by dragon ground
try<00:04:45.699> to<00:04:45.759> look<00:04:45.909> for<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.090> other<00:04:46.300> super

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
try to look for that other super

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.240 
try to look for that other super
effective<00:04:47.020> hit<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.409> then<00:04:47.710> see<00:04:47.860> if<00:04:47.949> it<00:04:48.039> works

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
effective hit and then see if it works

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.830 
effective hit and then see if it works
with<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.490> move<00:04:48.639> set<00:04:48.849> so<00:04:49.180> then<00:04:49.360> we<00:04:49.449> take<00:04:49.569> mega

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
with the move set so then we take mega

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.869 
with the move set so then we take mega
Gyarados<00:04:50.319> water<00:04:50.830> dark<00:04:51.159> is<00:04:51.310> going<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.639> give<00:04:51.759> you

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
Gyarados water dark is going to give you

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.399 
Gyarados water dark is going to give you
really<00:04:52.090> good<00:04:52.240> coverage<00:04:52.599> and<00:04:52.750> then<00:04:52.930> adding<00:04:53.229> ice

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
really good coverage and then adding ice

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:54.959 
really good coverage and then adding ice
makes<00:04:53.979> it<00:04:54.129> to<00:04:54.219> where<00:04:54.310> you<00:04:54.460> get<00:04:54.639> about<00:04:54.789> as

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
makes it to where you get about as

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.459 
makes it to where you get about as
well-rounded<00:04:55.210> coverage<00:04:55.870> as<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.110> can<00:04:56.289> get

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:56.469 
well-rounded coverage as you can get

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.709 
well-rounded coverage as you can get
while<00:04:56.949> also<00:04:57.189> carrying<00:04:57.849> that<00:04:58.029> dragon<00:04:58.539> dance

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719 
while also carrying that dragon dance

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:00.480 
while also carrying that dragon dance
that<00:04:59.199> dragon<00:04:59.560> dance<00:04:59.740> is<00:04:59.889> going<00:05:00.069> to<00:05:00.189> work<00:05:00.340> out

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
that dragon dance is going to work out

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.040 
that dragon dance is going to work out
really<00:05:00.520> well<00:05:00.909> then<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.389> can<00:05:01.509> also<00:05:01.629> look<00:05:01.810> into

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
really well then you can also look into

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.629 
really well then you can also look into
other<00:05:02.110> options<00:05:02.379> like<00:05:02.680> earthquake<00:05:03.129> green

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
other options like earthquake green

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.850 
other options like earthquake green
water<00:05:03.849> dark<00:05:04.180> ice<00:05:04.389> and<00:05:04.779> ground<00:05:05.469> you're<00:05:05.740> going

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
water dark ice and ground you're going

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.649 
water dark ice and ground you're going
to<00:05:05.979> have<00:05:06.129> perfect<00:05:06.400> neutral<00:05:06.849> coverage<00:05:07.180> and<00:05:07.419> a

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
to have perfect neutral coverage and a

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.269 
to have perfect neutral coverage and a
ton<00:05:07.840> of<00:05:07.870> damage<00:05:08.110> but<00:05:08.650> then<00:05:08.770> you're<00:05:09.009> not<00:05:09.129> going

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:09.279 
ton of damage but then you're not going

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.409 
ton of damage but then you're not going
to<00:05:09.370> be<00:05:09.430> able<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.580> stat<00:05:09.849> up<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.180> it's<00:05:10.300> really

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
to be able to stat up so it's really

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.570 
to be able to stat up so it's really
what<00:05:10.750> you're<00:05:10.870> looking<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:11.409> give<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:11.919> take<00:05:12.099> to

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
what you're looking to give and take to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.369 
what you're looking to give and take to
get<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.879> best<00:05:13.060> moves<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:13.479> possible<00:05:13.930> also

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:14.379 
get the best moves that possible also

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.980 
get the best moves that possible also
interesting<00:05:15.069> fact<00:05:15.279> freeze-dry<00:05:16.120> plus<00:05:16.689> water

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
interesting fact freeze-dry plus water

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.950 
interesting fact freeze-dry plus water
gives<00:05:17.469> you<00:05:17.620> all<00:05:17.860> coverage<00:05:18.580> except<00:05:19.509> for<00:05:19.689> jinx

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
gives you all coverage except for jinx

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.990 
gives you all coverage except for jinx
with<00:05:20.080> dry<00:05:20.259> skin<00:05:20.529> and<00:05:20.740> shedinja<00:05:21.490> so<00:05:21.879> that's

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
with dry skin and shedinja so that's

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.700 
with dry skin and shedinja so that's
going<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.360> be<00:05:22.479> perfect<00:05:22.990> neutral<00:05:23.229> coverage<00:05:23.560> in

going to be perfect neutral coverage in

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.559 
going to be perfect neutral coverage in
two<00:05:23.860> moves<00:05:24.069> as<00:05:24.310> well<00:05:24.340> but<00:05:25.180> there's<00:05:25.330> one

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
two moves as well but there's one

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.649 
two moves as well but there's one
Pokemon<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.800> hits<00:05:27.039> the<00:05:27.789> hardest<00:05:28.300> that

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
Pokemon that hits the hardest that

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:30.719 
Pokemon that hits the hardest that
there's<00:05:28.930> one<00:05:29.139> type<00:05:29.440> coverage<00:05:29.919> that<00:05:30.339> works<00:05:30.550> the

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
there's one type coverage that works the

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.149 
there's one type coverage that works the
best<00:05:30.909> and<00:05:31.089> that's<00:05:31.210> gonna<00:05:31.389> be<00:05:31.479> flying<00:05:32.159> electric

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
best and that's gonna be flying electric

effective<00:05:42.909> hits<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.360> then<00:05:43.870> 162<00:05:44.830> normal<00:05:45.159> hits

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:45.339 
effective hits and then 162 normal hits

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.550 
effective hits and then 162 normal hits
across<00:05:46.000> all<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.599> pokemon<00:05:47.020> in<00:05:47.199> the<00:05:47.319> game

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
across all the pokemon in the game

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.529 
across all the pokemon in the game
that's<00:05:48.069> fairly<00:05:48.430> absurd<00:05:48.849> and<00:05:49.089> the<00:05:49.180> Pokemon

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
that's fairly absurd and the Pokemon

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.749 
that's fairly absurd and the Pokemon
that<00:05:49.629> gets<00:05:49.779> this<00:05:50.020> Dragonite<00:05:50.830> dragon<00:05:51.490> egg<00:05:51.580> gets

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
that gets this Dragonite dragon egg gets

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.269 
that gets this Dragonite dragon egg gets
earthquake<00:05:52.330> Thunder<00:05:53.020> punch<00:05:53.169> super<00:05:53.860> power<00:05:54.039> and

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:54.279 
earthquake Thunder punch super power and

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.279 
earthquake Thunder punch super power and
then<00:05:54.849> we<00:05:54.939> can<00:05:55.089> also<00:05:55.240> look<00:05:55.509> at<00:05:55.629> fly<00:05:55.930> for<00:05:56.199> the

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
then we can also look at fly for the

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.929 
then we can also look at fly for the
physical<00:05:56.680> or<00:05:56.860> we<00:05:56.979> can<00:05:57.099> under<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:57.580> hurricane

00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:57.939 
physical or we can under and hurricane

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:00.809 
physical or we can under and hurricane
so<00:05:58.360> Dragonite<00:05:58.960> in<00:05:59.110> rain<00:05:59.469> actually<00:06:00.039> has<00:06:00.430> one<00:06:00.729> of

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
so Dragonite in rain actually has one of

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.369 
so Dragonite in rain actually has one of
the<00:06:00.909> best<00:06:01.089> super<00:06:01.389> effective<00:06:01.719> coverages<00:06:02.199> in

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
the best super effective coverages in

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:03.959 
the best super effective coverages in
the<00:06:02.650> game<00:06:02.830> with<00:06:03.009> some<00:06:03.129> of<00:06:03.219> the<00:06:03.279> highest<00:06:03.430> base

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
the game with some of the highest base

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.879 
the game with some of the highest base
power<00:06:04.240> so<00:06:04.870> that's<00:06:05.199> kind<00:06:05.469> of<00:06:05.529> what<00:06:05.710> we're

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
power so that's kind of what we're

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.950 
power so that's kind of what we're
looking<00:06:05.979> at<00:06:06.159> if<00:06:06.279> you<00:06:06.370> want<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.669> most<00:06:07.210> perfect
