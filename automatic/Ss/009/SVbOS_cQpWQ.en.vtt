00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
you're trained to this little spot right

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.569 
you're trained to this little spot right
here<00:03:18.350> like<00:03:19.350> most<00:03:19.739> time<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.160> come<00:03:20.370> down<00:03:20.549> here

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
and they'll attacking but then you can

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.789 
and they'll attacking but then you can
also<00:03:22.859> run<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.790> this<00:03:23.970> little<00:03:24.239> spot<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:25.049> in

also run up to this little spot here in

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.069 
also run up to this little spot here in
the<00:03:26.040> corner<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.489> they<00:03:27.150> probably<00:03:27.420> will<00:03:27.750> start

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
the corner and they probably will start

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.530 
the corner and they probably will start
attacking<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.709> again<00:03:29.070> if<00:03:29.810> not<00:03:30.829> um<00:03:32.540> basically
