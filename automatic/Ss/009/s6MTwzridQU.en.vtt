00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello dear friends with you Sasha and 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.110
 This rubric helped than I could with it. 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.670
 the release of a mess 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.560
 the most tender 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.940
 Gleb which only you could 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.790
 try a day just to 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.910
 because I made the recipes myself 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.849
 I now have more often and sound because 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.540
 that poor sports and breast is generally 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.430
 respect 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.920
 I was already so tired of living 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.289
 stiffness boiled looping endure 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.830
 I can no longer and this is slightly yes like fried 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.890
 breast 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.449
 but the trick is that it just melts in your mouth 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.150
 its even desirable 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.640
 and you can eat 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.829
 that is, it does not bother them taste breast 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.820
 and starts to annoy - there is full 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.890
 same just sit buy 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.329
 buy and you for the bow only half a kilo so 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 drove into the kitchen and see what 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.780
 work out for super delicate breasts to us 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.830
 will need 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.020
 breast starch necessarily starch and 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.790
 important overweight potato just not to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.300
 flour honest china 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.700
 cradle oil lube to finger pan 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.770
 1 to 4 cups milk spices for chicken 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.920
 salt and black pepper 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.160
 history of cooking this dish recipe 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.580
 in communicating breasts I kinda did on 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.740
 Chinese-based dishes that all kick they 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.130
 almost all are processed 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.509
 butter and before that they marina these 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.890
 starch under extra spices 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:37.330
 shorter no chicken we cut 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.330
 thin plates 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.850
 half a centimeter 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.520
 and postpone the cutting for further 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.450
 pickles 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 marinating will marinate for shorter 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.850
 spices I chose just garlic 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.520
 add a little spice for chicken that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.770
 it is very tasty to eat something and scribble 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.640
 chest and we add two tablespoons 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.399
 starch 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.399
 squeezing honestly what is there 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.990
 pour one fourth cup of milk 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.990
 salt to taste 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.770
 add spices to taste 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.120
 of course fresh ground black pepper 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:45.019
 so we mix it all up with a pen 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.400
 supply lie on the gun must 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.680
 put in the fridge I generally think that 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.710
 pickles they are better absorbed casio 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.670
 stand warm because the product 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.710
 scenic temperature with surface 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.750
 air seems to me better marinade 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.750
 imbues meat 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.180
 Leave twenty minutes 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.150
 put the pan on a big flame 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:22.010
 pour a glass of butter 50 grams 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.569
 helping to inhabit favor is a bit of butter 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.060
 I read even if she 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.730
 non-stick on it will be empty 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.950
 kitty your mask somewhere 15 seconds 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:38.940
 stand then just lay out like this 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:42.769
 way the chicken on the butter so that it does not 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.769
 fit tightly into each other 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.010
 breast we laid out give it about five minutes 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.329
 fry one side until golden 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.239
 crusts but if you see that he 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.670
 pick up of course turn over then 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.719
 when a golden crust is killed with one 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.439
 sides we turn over cover 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:15.250
 lid and wait another three minutes did 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:20.910
