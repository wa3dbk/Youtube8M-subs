you've been using in multiplayer the
first<00:00:08.040> one<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.220> pretty<00:00:08.400> basic<00:00:08.550> it's<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> one

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
first one is pretty basic it's the one

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.669 
first one is pretty basic it's the one
that<00:00:09.420> if<00:00:09.540> any<00:00:09.690> word<00:00:09.960> always<00:00:10.139> shows<00:00:10.440> off<00:00:10.650> its

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
that if any word always shows off its

that if any word always shows off its
the<00:00:11.010> catwalk<00:00:11.370> run<00:00:11.610> we're<00:00:12.360> basically<00:00:12.450> making

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the catwalk run we're basically making

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.120 
the catwalk run we're basically making
our<00:00:12.960> way<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> west<00:00:13.410> side<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> map<00:00:13.889> over

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
our way to the west side of the map over

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.829 
our way to the west side of the map over
here<00:00:14.340> from<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> top<00:00:14.880> by<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.089> helicopter<00:00:15.599> and

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
here from the top by the helicopter and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.689 
here from the top by the helicopter and
you<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.710> also<00:00:16.830> use<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.100> ladder<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:17.520> right

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
you can also use the ladder it's right

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.029 
you can also use the ladder it's right
on<00:00:17.730> my<00:00:17.820> feet<00:00:18.119> right<00:00:18.330> now<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.859> there's

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
on my feet right now you can see there's

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.560 
on my feet right now you can see there's
high<00:00:20.189> visibility<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.000> really<00:00:21.119> risky<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
high visibility so it's really risky to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.910 
high visibility so it's really risky to
go<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:21.960> way<00:00:22.080> across<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.439> map<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:22.830> you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
go all the way across the map but you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.710 
go all the way across the map but you
can<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:24.060> jumped<00:00:24.330> off<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.570> here

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
can do it you jumped off in here

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.170 
can do it you jumped off in here
obviously<00:00:25.650> vault<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.220> side<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.609> make

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
obviously vault up on this side and make

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.130 
obviously vault up on this side and make
your<00:00:27.330> way<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> right<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:27.990> actually

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
your way to the right you can actually

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.560 
your way to the right you can actually
get<00:00:28.349> above<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> CTF<00:00:29.189> area<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.640> spawned<00:00:30.000> by

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
get above the CTF area and spawned by

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.569 
get above the CTF area and spawned by
kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> using<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> side<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.189> wall<00:00:32.369> here

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

actual<00:01:20.130> south<00:01:20.430> side<00:01:20.640> I've<00:01:20.820> something<00:01:21.090> cool<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
actual south side I've something cool to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
actual south side I've something cool to
do<00:01:21.540> there's<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.560> slanted<00:01:22.920> area<00:01:23.130> there<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
do there's a slanted area there that

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.820 
do there's a slanted area there that
follows<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> way<00:01:24.360> around<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
follows all the way around and it's a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219 
follows all the way around and it's a
little<00:01:26.070> tricky<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.360> did<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.659> randomly

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
little tricky but we did just randomly

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.319 
little tricky but we did just randomly
blind<00:01:28.619> jump<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.700> looks<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
blind jump this because it just looks so

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.109 
blind jump this because it just looks so
suspicious<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.380> did<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.189> few<00:01:32.340> blind<00:01:32.520> jumps<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
suspicious so did a few blind jumps and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.030 
suspicious so did a few blind jumps and
you<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.780> actually<00:01:33.930> latch<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you can actually latch on as if it's a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.370 
you can actually latch on as if it's a
ladder<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:36.030> climb<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.170> an

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
ladder you climb this one up it's not an

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.569 
ladder you climb this one up it's not an
easy<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.250> take<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> lot<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
easy one to do it's can take a lot of

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.770 
easy one to do it's can take a lot of
practice<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.000> probably<00:01:39.299> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.600> like

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
practice you probably want to go like

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.969 
practice you probably want to go like
what<00:01:39.900> we're<00:01:40.020> doing<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:40.380> system<00:01:40.799> link

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
what we're doing right now system link

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.260 
what we're doing right now system link
so<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.250> probably<00:01:41.430> wanna<00:01:41.640> jump<00:01:41.820> into<00:01:41.970> system

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so you probably wanna jump into system

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
so you probably wanna jump into system
link<00:01:42.450> or<00:01:42.540> something<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.930> try<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.979> few

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
link or something and try it out a few

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.560 
link or something and try it out a few
times<00:01:44.280> definitely<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.390> field

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570

awesome<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:21.319> brings<00:02:21.560> us<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.800> over<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.069> east

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
awesome this brings us on over the east

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.979 
awesome this brings us on over the east
side<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.610> map<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.780> got<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
side of the map so this is you got the

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.600 
side of the map so this is you got the
cubby<00:02:24.230> area<00:02:24.470> on<00:02:24.530> your<00:02:24.680> left<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.130> now<00:02:25.250> straight

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
cubby area on your left and now straight

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.280 
cubby area on your left and now straight
forward<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.330> slanted<00:02:26.900> area<00:02:27.080> where<00:02:27.200> you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
forward is the slanted area where you

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.020 
forward is the slanted area where you
jump<00:02:27.440> up<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.400> actually<00:02:28.519> use<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.849> to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
jump up and you can actually use this to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.309 
jump up and you can actually use this to
traverse<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.420> entire<00:02:29.480> side<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.140> map<00:02:30.290> you

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
traverse the entire side of the map you

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.870 
traverse the entire side of the map you
can<00:02:30.500> get<00:02:30.650> from<00:02:30.769> one<00:02:30.950> CTF<00:02:31.370> point<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.790> other

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
can get from one CTF point to the other

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.280 
can get from one CTF point to the other
you<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.180> actually<00:02:32.300> flag<00:02:32.690> around<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.080> if<00:02:33.200> you

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
you can actually flag around this if you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.050 
you can actually flag around this if you
want<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.470> try<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.680> flag<00:02:33.830> on<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.940> it's<00:02:34.970> just

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
want to try and flag on it but it's just

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.570
