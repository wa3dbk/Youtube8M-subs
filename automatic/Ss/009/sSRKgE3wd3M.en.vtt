these<00:03:24.190> three<00:03:24.520> now<00:03:25.420> obviously<00:03:25.930> if<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.170> were

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.380 
and just the same as if I were using
double<00:03:38.530> points<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.250> slide<00:03:40.030> those

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
double points I just slide those

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.170 
double points I just slide those
stitches<00:03:40.450> all<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.650> way<00:03:41.770> through<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.730> cable

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
stitches all the way through the cable

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.420 
stitches all the way through the cable
to<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.200> other<00:03:44.650> end<00:03:45.720> my<00:03:46.720> don't
