the<00:01:43.229> new<00:01:43.350> STI<00:01:43.649> s<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:44.009> did<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> lot<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> work<00:01:44.549> with

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the new STI s we did a lot of work with

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.179 
the new STI s we did a lot of work with
this<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.149> new<00:01:45.450> cage<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.110> FIA<00:01:46.500> spec<00:01:46.920> for

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
this all new cage this FIA spec for

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.969 
this all new cage this FIA spec for
safety<00:01:47.490> reasons<00:01:47.880> we've<00:01:48.600> got<00:01:48.780> racing<00:01:49.530> seats<00:01:49.770> in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
safety reasons we've got racing seats in

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.950 
safety reasons we've got racing seats in
here<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.220> well<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.670> harnesses<00:01:51.299> once<00:01:51.509> again<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
here as well and harnesses once again a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960 
here as well and harnesses once again a
big<00:01:52.439> safety<00:01:52.680> concern<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.130> us<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.700> Mark

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
big safety concern for us was Mark

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
big safety concern for us was Mark
safety<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.630> having<00:01:55.110> him<00:01:55.200> okay<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.799> case

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
safety and having him okay just in case

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
safety and having him okay just in case
there<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.189> any<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.610> an<00:01:57.000> issue<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:57.570> on

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
there was any kind of an issue here on

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.859 
there was any kind of an issue here on
the<00:01:58.110> track

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.539 

we've<00:02:04.409> improved<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.860> chassis<00:02:05.130> underneath

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
we've improved the chassis underneath

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
we've improved the chassis underneath
with<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> stock<00:02:06.119> car<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.840> means<00:02:07.020> the

with a stock car that means the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.449 
with a stock car that means the
improvements<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:07.649> carried<00:02:07.890> over<00:02:08.039> here<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
improvements are carried over here to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.520 
improvements are carried over here to
the<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> car<00:02:09.209> we're<00:02:09.360> racing<00:02:09.720> today<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.440> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the to the car we're racing today it's a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.220 
the to the car we're racing today it's a
40%<00:02:11.130> stiffer<00:02:11.340> frame<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> new<00:02:12.180> STI<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
40% stiffer frame on the new STI it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.650 
40% stiffer frame on the new STI it
makes<00:02:13.770> us<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.040> much<00:02:14.250> more<00:02:14.459> stable<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:15.390> terms

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
makes us have much more stable in terms

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.229 
makes us have much more stable in terms
of<00:02:15.840> design<00:02:16.380> suspension<00:02:17.040> around<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.459> we've<00:02:18.120> got

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
of design suspension around it we've got

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.640 
of design suspension around it we've got
the<00:02:18.270> great<00:02:18.540> base<00:02:18.780> heading<00:02:19.080> now<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.470> if<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the great base heading now and if you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.720 
the great base heading now and if you
can<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.130> feel<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.370> when<00:02:20.489> you're<00:02:20.580> driving

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
can really feel up when you're driving

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.309 
can really feel up when you're driving
the<00:02:20.940> car<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.540> know<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.690> big<00:02:21.840> difference<00:02:22.170> is

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
the car you know the big difference is

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.199 
the car you know the big difference is
this<00:02:22.470> has<00:02:22.650> an<00:02:22.830> all<00:02:22.950> new<00:02:23.130> steering<00:02:23.670> racks<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.150> to

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
this has an all new steering racks go to

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.360 
this has an all new steering racks go to
13<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.720> one<00:02:24.810> steering<00:02:25.410> rack<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.890> hydraulic

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
13 and one steering rack is hydraulic

13 and one steering rack is hydraulic
steering<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:26.940> car<00:02:27.000> makes<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.720> much

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
steering on this car makes it a much

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.330 
steering on this car makes it a much
better<00:02:28.140> car<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> drive<00:02:28.620> much<00:02:28.860> quicker<00:02:29.040> feel

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
better car to drive much quicker feel

like we said that's what sti's are known
for<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.349> that's<00:02:34.440> what<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.650> carry<00:02:34.830> over<00:02:34.920> here

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
for and that's what we carry over here

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.220 
for and that's what we carry over here
we've<00:02:35.730> got<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.940> six-speed<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.870> basically

as well and we've got four four
different<00:02:43.410> differentials<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.160> where<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
different differentials that's where the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.130 
different differentials that's where the
real<00:02:44.640> work<00:02:44.819> goes<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.150> with<00:02:45.569> our<00:02:45.720> symmetrical

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140

suspension we've hit a pro flex
suspension<00:04:01.480> on<00:04:01.569> this<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.199> essentially<00:04:02.530> it's

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
suspension on this so essentially it's

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
our stock suspension setup we just

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.220 
our stock suspension setup we just
changed<00:04:04.269> up<00:04:04.359> damper<00:04:04.659> and<00:04:04.750> springs<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.139> some

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.649 
pro flex setup other than that that's
the<00:04:08.500> same<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:09.060> pretty<00:04:10.060> much<00:04:10.120> that's<00:04:10.269> it<00:04:10.480> is

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659
