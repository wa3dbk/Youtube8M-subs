00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.410 
both weapons I think I go with the SKS
here<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:44.010> an<00:00:44.129> acog<00:00:44.550> site<00:00:44.850> which<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.270> will

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
here with an acog site which I will

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
here with an acog site which I will
later<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.750> switch<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> infrared<00:00:46.770> night

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
later on switch to the infrared night

later on switch to the infrared night
vision<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.789> prefer<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.629> think

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
vision I just prefer that one I think

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.590 
vision I just prefer that one I think
it's<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> bit<00:00:49.469> imbalance<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> moment<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
it's a bit imbalance at the moment but

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's a bit imbalance at the moment but
yeah<00:00:51.600> why<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.500> foregrip<00:00:52.860> I'm<00:00:53.520> going

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.940 

so<00:04:54.240> once<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:54.630> was<00:04:54.810> likely<00:04:55.080> recorded<00:04:55.650> in<00:04:55.770> a

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
so once this was likely recorded in a

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.040 
so once this was likely recorded in a
few<00:04:56.340> hours<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.700> gameplay<00:04:56.880> so<00:04:57.390> there's<00:04:57.930> nothing

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
few hours of gameplay so there's nothing

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.110 
few hours of gameplay so there's nothing
amazing<00:04:58.530> here<00:04:59.010> but<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.310> does<00:04:59.400> explain<00:04:59.580> how
