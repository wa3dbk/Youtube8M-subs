00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.899
 This item is made possible by 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.899
 deltion college and aj qmedia 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.429
 Gerard Nijkamp owns a few weeks after 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 the end of the 2014 2015 competition 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.719
 how do you look back on this past 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.719
 season 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:24.390
 well with a lot of pride and we 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.919
 thought in the season 13 14 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.919
 to have a unique achievement here 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:32.510
 delivered and if you then look at it 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.920
 last year 14 15 yes we have that 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 matched though that has none none 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.440
 cup win the delivered but the position 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.440
 in the rankings and sixth with a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 record number of points is for us too 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.690
 absolutely those prices for the first time 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.480
 a thud 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.089
 may play for european football yes 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.030
 he couldn't do it 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.679
 so very proud when you enter the season 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.760
 divide the two for the win after the 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:03.510
 profit on where was there with the difference 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.030
 Well well you know if 34 games it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.610
 you end up where you are supposed to end up and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.979
 that is the sixth position with 53 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.790
 points and you sometimes go through the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.730
 lower limit and therein 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.950
 do you ever live an achievement yes what 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.630
 not everyone just expected 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.940
 and that was also after me before the winter break 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.720
 the winter break we think we have our dip 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.400
 can postpone something longer after one 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.900
 great restart 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.220
 in after the training camp in Stellenbosch 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.850
 and dipje can continue to postpone 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.370
 so that was positive in itself 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.290
 proved to be good and and more stable there 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.290
 then the year before 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.910
 so yes i think its about both of them 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.280
 halves quite well with peace or can 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.500
 as was the beautiful moment for you 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.300
 first in the first half of the season 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.619
 elfving season 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.040
 how am I supposed to go back for a while 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.810
 but i think yes i look anyway 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.810
 always just to the beginning of it 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.509
 always demand with them and renovated 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.850
 gain on refurbished team how you get there 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.100
 again insists 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.410
 that was quite exciting again 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.300
 a good preparation then turned 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.880
 play the opening game of at home 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.260
 the season against FC Utrecht 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.849
 each other it is an ion 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.780
 because of who had that draw with 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.689
 those three little ones 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.420
 in the car and and it was successful 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.860
 but at the beginning and designated garden and and 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.110
 that match bit and gains to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.569
 say yes that sounds like a confirmation 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.250
 that it was well and will be the 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.440
 nice bull credits neatly 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.909
 I think that's the first half that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.739
 well the best that we 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.859
 closest to beat and 2 in the second 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.170
 half of the season after a unique moment 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.569
 natural certainly the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.390
 the cup final again that it's just 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.540
 historical is what we have achieved 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.090
 everything was right again in which a year 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.739
 learned from the first year in terms of 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.690
 organization 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.269
 that all went very smoothly me 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.340
 in terms of ticket sales they think so 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.599
 that went well too 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.359
 everyone has been given the opportunity 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.329
 to buy a ticket from the die-hards 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.620
 supporter to people who have that party and 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.580
 come along 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.560
 wanted to make and yes unfortunately that is not it 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.560
 desired result past 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.280
 the cup final is feedback 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.040
 on your own 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.870
 own work of the past year 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.790
 well we do it all together again and 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.950
 I often use those terms there 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.280
 is not one person that that this 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.290
 only we do we really together 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.329
 yes i think i have my purchases that we 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.890
 have made the right choices there 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.780
 are then a record missus 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.379
 in between but well it remains people work 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.549
 and as long as I am and I have to 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.819
 stay because that's what we are 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.370
 enthusiastic about the football game and walk 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.510
 you against that but especially the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.959
 positive exceptions 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.859
 the passion positive purchases 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.709
 thomas no of course was there anyway 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.560
 but you also have rienstra with them 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.990
 a player that position that folio 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.630
 to catch a camp in a short joÃ«lle 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.150
 to call people two and then I forget 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.210
 also a number of others last year 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.139
 you have always had a player in me 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.979
 present 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.510
 how is this this summer 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.120
 yes good look you have to you have to look 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.250
 to my selection we look of course 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.849
 whole years what is possibly on the market 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.879
 coming 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.619
 have been intensive on shoulder and 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.770
 Now you just have to be the right one strategically 

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:54.449
 make choices and I don't let myself be 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.639
 guided by 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.969
 as I have done in the past 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.830
 and goes because luis play with right 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.849
 financial picture of the right 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.029
 package 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.179
 that is real offer and then hit again 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.860
 to 

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:09.599
 he where especially to be checked 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.279
 and what type of player 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.129
 everyone knows we have to look for 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.800
 have a striker of course with bar 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.769
 the netherlands a fine pointed nose only 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.719
 that is kind of crazy 

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:25.129
 ready number 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.129
 she has to be rushed 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:31.919
 then in the central position behind 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:34.709
 is a left-legged defender 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.679
 centrally located and because men again 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:40.830
 must go back to feyenoord and we don't 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:42.779
 ill also need a keeper and focus 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.309
 lie on who put that position already 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.439
 finally decided that when her 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:48.330
 never come back to Pec Zwolle or 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.579
 actually all the doors are up 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.999
 yes nothing nothing is final in football 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:56.099
 and have now learned want you must 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:58.459
 do not exclude anything 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.110
 because others are always in the back of your mind 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:03.479
 take it then and possibly possible 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.369
 right now it is so trapped itself 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.589
 must report at the first training of 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:10.050
 only everyone knows feyenoord 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:12.629
 of course also that we and warm ourselves too 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.849
 like to continue for a year together 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.789
 which is good for the development of van 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.569
 cheeks but which is also good for us 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.809
 receive yes 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:24.089
 are you sick or pensions what 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:25.830
 do you expect from next season 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:28.379
 yeah well i would say imagine that 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.149
 ask about one 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.860
 a few months again as we 

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:34.139
 a week before the start of the 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.330
 competition because then we know how we 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.639
 the roughly things get up again 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.209
 that they have each come that one 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:43.709
 any further and will leave 

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:47.069
 because the know if we want good by 

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:48.719
 we must dare to sell on this 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.419
 moment yes i can of course go anything 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.399
 say where that is possible or two columns 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:57.259
 so its work but mine 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:57.259
 lead to a judgment
