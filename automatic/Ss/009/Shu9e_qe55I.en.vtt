 start folder 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.449
 we have a piece of text that we 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.609
 need to read in advance 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.529
 the temple or by it is forbidden to 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.210
 something to use this is only allowed if there 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.730
 is a sign that says shit 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.590

 New York library to make you special 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070

 the story of the temple of doom 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.510
 looks very interesting to you from that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.920
 your eyes took over the temple 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.960
 located in a special area it is no 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 dual area no polar area or 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.039
 polar region not a desert region 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.620
 it is inexplicable why it is that 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.559
 the area is so different is many archaeologists 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.840
 the term has been investigated 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 or do it to figure out how to do this 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.769
 but they never returned after 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.049

 temple you are not really under the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.790
 impression 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.900

 roll on an evening where you naturally 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 test whether the tram or doom appears 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.030
 could come by using 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.110
 of this weird little bitra that spectrum 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.970
 day 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.470
 round way to sink into a deep hangover 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.959
 you decided to go down 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.830
 that same evening but that went very wrong 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.989
 off 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.599
 you fall meters and form meters 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.580
 then harder smack pole on the ground 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.360
 now it's up to you to get the exit 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.100

 curious how we can exit this 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.590

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.230
 you are holes in the ground and you are 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.350
 holes of which this is this can skewer 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.819
 I do not know I'm just walking by and 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.230
 it will all be plates but I trust 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.390
 not at all 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.830
 i don't trust planes i can't 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.180
 stand this 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.459
 oh oh hello out out out out out out 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.900
 oh shit i'll just run it 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.000
 I don't know where the trap is 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.370
 but i think just go running yes 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.420
 okay it was quite good happy 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.430

 yes holy crap okay that went well then 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.870
 that went well we go by stairs on e 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.739
 tortures which illuminates in the bunch still a 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.090
 bit 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.600
 oh here I was falling down 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.549
 So I think this will be a jump 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.630
 and we can go here and lover like that 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.609
 that persuade 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.049
 it looks that we oh look 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.989
 once 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.359
 we can now go to you and we can 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.560
 use the stairs so that we are a little higher 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.540
 can come 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.160
 and this is the exit because there is 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.170
 namely also something 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.230
 there you can also take a set of stairs but in terms of 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.450
 level there to watch story 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.400
 there is something no so it is nothing at all 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.570
 I don't dare to risk getting there 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.459
 to go 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.890

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:52.110
 upstairs also help seriously back and forth 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.090
 to jump 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:00.660
 I never succeed oh no no no 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:03.180
 no, that's how it should be 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.350
 watch as i figure it out 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.590
 will be fine 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.430
 it could completely block it for me so 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.410
 then the only block yes and we are 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.139
 luckily on 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.490
 very nice done this very fat it gets 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.490
 a bit dark here but i had to 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.910
 brightness on a bat you kill how 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.380
 they put up so bright is this 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.520
 level reached warner maybe we now 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.470
 an output I hope so 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.289
 what is there there is a bat of jews 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.849
 here is a mine cart we have to 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.210
 in that I dare in it I have no choice 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.210
 I think 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.500
 oh yeah 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.880
 oh constant team with deliver 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.710
 what I have to persuade you must 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.660
 you really look forward I think 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.250
 go that way if I pull it over 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.720
 I think I'll take the cart with me 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.970
 oh i don't need an object a scrap yard okay 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.830
 I drop in fine man, I love the 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.930
 rules like that 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.580
 and there is another tnt that is not 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.040
 that was the intention 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.480
 I think he should go TTL folk or go 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.990
 we did not go for it 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.790
 how are we going to let it go r yes me 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.310
 nothing in span so i think we like this 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.150
 should skip, but this should also 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.580
 should 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.020
 break down and then we come to spray 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.080
 to 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.500

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.930
 and I see a tent what a chaz this is 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.000
 and a checkpoint banks to one's 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.130
 sleeping at night can come from this 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.130
 I think I already have one 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.410
 paved the way for this 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.790
 terrible god and I can just free 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.680
 when governments i don't know if that 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.570
 allowed but I still want to see if the 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.980
 maybe something is no i can here 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.030
 don't come true you see it's all 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.170
 dropped off 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.420
 because then try because I am whole 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:56.650

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.910
