because<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.569> really<00:02:28.599> thick<00:02:29.410> really

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
because I have like really thick really

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.400 
because I have like really thick really
straight<00:02:30.400> hair<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:31.090> lot<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.780> it's

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
straight hair and a lot of it and it's

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.130 
straight hair and a lot of it and it's
just<00:02:32.470> kind<00:02:32.799> of<00:02:32.890> psychotic<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:35.019> get

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
just kind of psychotic and so it can get

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.180 
just kind of psychotic and so it can get
really<00:02:35.620> unmanageable<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:38.200> mean<00:02:39.099> it's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
really unmanageable but I mean it's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.199 
really unmanageable but I mean it's
starting<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.489> get<00:02:39.549> kind<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.790> poufy<00:02:40.000> now<00:02:40.120> it's
