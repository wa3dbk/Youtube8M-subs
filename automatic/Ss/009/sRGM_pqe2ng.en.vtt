00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.776
 (incoming Skype call) 

00:00:03.776 --> 00:00:05.015
 (Ian) ZMLKNI! 

00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:08.817
 Look, Tiffany, it's been 6 months. 

00:00:09.107 --> 00:00:11.437
 You promised me to show me your face. 

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:14.112
 You know, j-I don't know. 

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.739
 Tiffany, look. 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.375
 You know I hate arguing with you because I love you so much. 

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:23.315
 Just show me your face. 

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:25.185
 Okay, fine. 

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:27.757
 Just adjust my hair, okay? 

00:00:27.757 --> 00:00:29.689
 I'll be right back. I promise. 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.726
 Great. 

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:35.620
 You'll be an amazing bride. 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.311
 (Tiffany) Okay, are you ready? 

00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:39.347
 - Yes! - (Tiffany) It's coming. 

00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:40.599
 (power outage) 

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:42.991
 No. No! 

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:47.423
 No! I wanted to see your beautiful face! 

00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:51.223
 Tifannnnnnnny! 

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:52.630
 Dude, electricity has fallen out. 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.142
 Yeah, don't talk. 

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:56.208
 Well, look, we need to get electricity back now 

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:58.294
 because I'm in the middle of a super hot date 

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:00.674
 with an extremely sexy girl. 

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:02.139
 What are you talking about? 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.967
 Okay, I didn't want to tell you until I marry her, 

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:07.658
 but I go secretly with this girl 

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:11.477
 about 6 months and I haven't seen my face yet. 

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:13.508
 Well, you're not serious. 

00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:15.201
 Yeah, I'm serious. 

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.018
 If you're serious, do a serious dance. 

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:28.824
 Oh, my God, you're telling the truth. 

00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:31.422
 Yeah, well, so electricity went down. 

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:34.366
 The circuit breaker probably fell out so we have to turn around 

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.383
 that little stick. 

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:36.529
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.770
 I would definitely not go out to be you. 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.277
 Why? 

00:01:40.587 --> 00:01:42.539
 Well, because electricity has probably dropped everywhere, 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.017
 so the aircraft in the sky don't have electricity either 

00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:47.258
 so they probably fall and kill everyone. 

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:48.505
 Could that happen? 

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:49.663
 Fact? 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.300
 Oh my God. 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.495
 Yeah, it's serious. 

00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:02.159
 Look, you should give it up to her. 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.893
 Hey, how long has it been? Two minutes? 

00:02:05.193 --> 00:02:06.719
 Dude, the girls are moving too fast. 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.900
 Probably now with another boy 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.579
 and if not, one of those falling aircraft killed her. 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.970
 No. This is the love of my life. 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.281
 I can't give up on her. 

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:17.261
 - You haven't even seen her face! - I saw her breasts 

00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:18.571
 and they were amazing. 

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.492
 All we have to do is find another way to boot the computer. 

00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:26.161
 Hey, what are you doing? 

00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:27.705
 It's simple physics. 

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:31.129
 If I build enough static electricity, I can touch the computer 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.217
 and he will be operational. 

00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:35.405
 God, this will never work. 

00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:37.541
 TWO HOURS LATER 

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:40.102
 Please work, please work, please work! 

00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:41.838
 Tifanna, I'm running. 

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.887
 Jesus! Are you OK? 

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.115
 And it is done! 

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:50.629
 It's never gonna happen to me. 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.184
 I will never see Tiffan's perhaps a beautiful face. 

00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:58.032
 And I'll never take her to Elvis's concert. 

00:02:58.062 --> 00:03:00.274
 You know, Elvis is dead for about 50 years. 

00:03:00.274 --> 00:03:03.195
 Look, I saw him in Vegas over the moon. 

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:05.818
 If we had electricity, I would find it on Wikipedia 

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:07.350
 and I can tell you that you're wrong. 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.172
 You know if you're telling the truth about he's dead, 

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:10.870
 do dance. 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.832
 No, I don't want it-- 

00:03:11.832 --> 00:03:13.801
 Do that after a ** early serious dance 

00:03:20.704 --> 00:03:23.252
 Oh my God. Oh my God! 

00:03:24.652 --> 00:03:25.959
 Oh my God. I'm so cold. 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.373
 Everything is falling apart. 

00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:30.112
 I need one of those useless things they always give you 

00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:31.599
 victims of accidents. 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.536
 Here you go. 

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:40.745
 Hey, you got the same shirt as my girlfriend. 

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:44.339
 I-yeah, yeah, it's a pretty popular t-shirt. 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.770
 You have the same belly button as she does. 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.464
 Yeah, I mean, it's really-- 

00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:50.641
 And you have the same crotch like her! 

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:54.484
 Dude, did you just play with me? 

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.159
 All right, yeah! Yeah! 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.974
 I played with you. 

00:03:57.942 --> 00:03:59.964
 You were worried like a damned loser. 

00:04:01.258 --> 00:04:03.816
 I had to do something to increase your confidence. 

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:06.494
 Pretending to be my girl over 6 months ?! 

00:04:06.494 --> 00:04:08.975
 Dude, I'm not eating gluten for you! 

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:11.093
 Yeah, and your acne disappeared. 

00:04:11.093 --> 00:04:14.009
 I wrote tons of erotic fanfiction about us two. 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:15.695
 And you published them all. 

00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:20.115
 We called for 12 hours in a row! 

00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:22.261
 Look, I was trying to be a good friend. 

00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:26.356
 Wait ... 

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.804
 (Anthony) What? 

00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:29.984
 (Anthony) C-What are you doing? 

00:04:30.054 --> 00:04:31.221
 This could work. 

00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.013
 You're not serious. 

00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:40.982
 She's catching up with my life.
