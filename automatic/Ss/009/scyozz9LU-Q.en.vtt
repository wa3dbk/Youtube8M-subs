00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.870
 nthe 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.840
 you know welcome to this second online game on the island the 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.379
 legs 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.900
 did not it need history 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.299
 alistair horses 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.230
 today we will see a lot of things 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230
 we will start with existing champion victims 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.460
 so smiling 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.990
 for the creator of the game there are four types of champion the times so 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.649
 the pictures the killers 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.329
 Congratulations 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.519
 it is advisable but we do not care 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 the ump so i'm 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.320
 well that's not really the case andy is funny to have at least ten years in 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.250
 part 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.940
 e you have to know that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.560
 on the nicox menu people is a multiplayer game 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.640
 so we must 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.670
 you have to know that the appellations are 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.650
 English 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.650
 Haitian currency but they are made his Italian leader 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.130
 colombani on the conversion d in which there is a magistrature 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.900
 vice-champion in 1607 a lot more 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.610
 we will see the main 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.800
 then dog time 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.110
 for those who do not know it's the character 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.110
 very very strong who has a lot of health 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.490
 those who type moderately loud 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.280
 so it's siba's 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.100
 arrived first in the group fights we call it team 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.390
 fight 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.730
 and it is he who will take all the blows in celebration 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.130
 they are lowered to be beaten by all the others 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.260
 precisely the guarding of his team 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.790
 past season 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.600
 quietly 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 without being disturbed 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.380
 then we have the warrior then the carrier we call it the curry to d 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.200
 see 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.420
 in anjou 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.040
 the magic could the curry harper 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.190
 the support is called the support I 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.020
 so why not misses and so that's very important it takes 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.590
 remember admit that it means media attacks ie it's 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.670
 physical damage 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.120
 so the warrior with his fps like that 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.310
 call it mean attack to see 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.250
 it's a shame but I know 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.420
 you also have to know two things can they say the term of what i 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.180
 I look fragile I do not have a lot of points of life 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.000
 so it's often the caries ap 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.409
 and the term focus 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.649
 so this is the target attacked in priority 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.879
 we also need who dedicated to hybrids 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.609
 so I do not want to rule when we say fake ass would be 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.909
 drooped chauvel major 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.430
 often falls so what is it wise and massassi summoners 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.959
 if you yourself actually 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.109
 you are an angel we are not sure they have 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.029
 you have to put your head in the carpet hours 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.249
 a motive of a champion you are fighting in the battlefield 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.849
 so you understand champions but you have a motivator 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.329
 the tenant 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.559
 he starts raising his hand country can go up to level 30 he wins a 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.749
 point of mastery in the same sense we talked about it and we'll talk about it later 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.170
 lydia league of experience every time I play matches that them 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.229
 qualifies them lose he will gain a little further for me 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.439
 he also owns rumor books so the Russians that allows a year 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.909
 to improve to the champion early in the game during the game in order to 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.619
 customize your champions 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.309
 there are also three leaders a 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.219
 then we see the champion of England in pure but he had to raise his hand at 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.219
 level 18 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.129
 lydienne dxp during the party 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.349
 but at each party its high level of signatures will begin just as much 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.659
 level 20 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.029
 here I hope I was clear enough 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:20.260
 now we will see 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.580
 the two available maps could it of the variety 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.989
 4 it's true that you are 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.069
 you go and that's enough is enough for fun 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.150
 her singer 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.139
 and we have one that is used by 90% of people 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.969
 aranda the tortured forest the flaw of the summoner the panic tortured his 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.449
 debut three against three 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.059
 the Summoner's Fault 6 55 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:45.040
 when I have 3 against 55 7 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.750
 fifth to qatar which so 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.750
 I am a wok five champions 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.559
 investigators who I have a trip saint-gaudens champions 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.009
 russia heavy with that but I know you understood 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.359
 then at the tendon part of the tortured forest it's much more 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.849
 fast gave 25 stops 40 minutes or so it could last longer 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.029
 podium in amount 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.299
 the Summoner's Fault c2 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.789
 grossomodo 40 minutes to an hour 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:13.029
 it can last longer 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:16.150
 in euros at the stop it is necessary to know that at the level of the players 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.199
 as many players find the Summoner's Fault 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.109
 more balanced because the tortured forest favors tanks and 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.020
 caries the beefy 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.889
 now no when we go to see we calm down a little bit a break 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.090
 lyon will have ios interface do you imagine i know you're waiting 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.180
 in this convoy at the bottom left indeed there are six locations 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.180
 chop on June 5 to the goal it can carry up to 600 different objects 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.219
 thus save a maximum 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.330
 what you will see 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.449
 then the little wood - it's not a button you can not click on it 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.849
 it's the passive of the hero 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.770
 so it's the cat that purrs to restore unique 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.819
 for example I give you the cisse state 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.569
 he runs faster when he has less than 50% of these police 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.249
 this is this nice 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.659
 then that taboos fall on the right is the fate of the hero 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.409
 must know that he has 300 members 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:08.370
 and an ultimate 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.370
 the ultimate activate from level 6 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.630
 and then via August 2 sealed the fate of the wrong lawyer this is the fate that 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.259
 you chose for this part 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.240
 orpar at the beginning of the game 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240
 she could help and support your hero your team 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.620
 then a little button right after that is the match we call alone beaten you 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.550
 had on e-bay 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.320
 and you that I'm on the map your hero not if he does not move for 8 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:32.839
 seconds 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.979
 dabbagh at the base 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.819
 return to the base 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.240
 then at the level of their very important resources to buy a for 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.659
 buy the items that make you win the game 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.249
 while you earn 20 gold by this mode seconds you like about 300 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.670
 dead by movie so you know when you're a hero 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.120
 sandor not racist 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.120
 it is that you are a hero but you do not do the fatal blow 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.119
 and 150 gold per round and find them 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:59.119
 and that's for the whole team so it's all good 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.819
 we're going so I think I did roughly the tournament interface 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.889
 I wish you all a good day and not the next one for 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:07.310
 new videos
