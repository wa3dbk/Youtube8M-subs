like<00:00:13.230> talk<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.440> little<00:00:13.799> bit<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.340> other

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
like talk a little bit about this other

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.460 
like talk a little bit about this other
card<00:00:14.790> dragged<00:00:15.599> down<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> grave<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
card dragged down to the grave and the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.710 
card dragged down to the grave and the
main<00:00:17.070> reason<00:00:17.340> why<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.520> because<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.359> card<00:00:18.600> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
main reason why is because that card is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.420 
main reason why is because that card is
definitely<00:00:19.109> like<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.100> best

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
definitely like the one of the best

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.740 
definitely like the one of the best
cards<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.910> our<00:00:21.000> rules<00:00:21.210> especially<00:00:21.390> if<00:00:21.689> you

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
cards and our rules especially if you

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.140 
cards and our rules especially if you
get<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.960> go<00:00:22.050> first<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> problem<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.460> was

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
get to go first but the problem I was

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.820 
get to go first but the problem I was
seeing<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.689> Dark<00:00:24.900> Worlds<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.560> can't

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
seeing what Dark Worlds is you can't

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.279 
seeing what Dark Worlds is you can't
really<00:00:26.070> main<00:00:26.430> deck<00:00:26.670> Maxie<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.180> Baylor<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
really main deck Maxie and Baylor the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.349 
really main deck Maxie and Baylor the
problem<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.760> activate<00:00:30.029> drag

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
problem is because if I activate drag

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.849 
problem is because if I activate drag
down<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> grave<00:00:30.869> obviously<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> have

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
think you're pretty much good to go

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
think you're pretty much good to go
anyways<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.840> yeah<00:01:00.989> drag<00:01:01.320> down<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> grave

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
anyways but yeah drag down to the grave

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.369 
anyways but yeah drag down to the grave
really<00:01:02.190> good<00:01:02.489> card<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.480> um<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.229> why<00:01:04.350> I

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
really good card but um this is why I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.109 
really good card but um this is why I
think<00:01:04.710> dark<00:01:05.010> we'll<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.489> gotten<00:01:05.850> really

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
think dark we'll just have gotten really

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.719 
think dark we'll just have gotten really
less<00:01:06.360> popular<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.140> because<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:08.430> can't

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
less popular it's just because you can't

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.000 
less popular it's just because you can't
run<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> Maxine<00:01:09.450> Baylor<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.020> main<00:01:10.200> deck<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
run the Maxine Baylor in main deck and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730 
run the Maxine Baylor in main deck and
be<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.850> really<00:01:12.270> fast<00:01:12.840> because<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.560> my

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
be really really fast because in my

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.289 
be really really fast because in my
opinion<00:01:13.830> Dark<00:01:14.250> Worlds<00:01:14.340> need<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.820> fast<00:01:15.150> like

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
opinion Dark Worlds need to be fast like

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
opinion Dark Worlds need to be fast like

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
graph of them to where they have to deal
with<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> 27<00:01:27.509> beater<00:01:28.439> every<00:01:28.860> turn<00:01:29.100> or<00:01:29.310> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
with the 27 beater every turn or you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
with the 27 beater every turn or you
know<00:01:29.610> 3,000<00:01:30.180> essentially<00:01:30.600> once<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
know 3,000 essentially once you have the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
know 3,000 essentially once you have the
field<00:01:32.460> effect<00:01:32.790> um<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.900> know<00:01:34.020> gaining<00:01:34.259> 300<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
field effect um you know gaining 300 so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.219 
field effect um you know gaining 300 so
yeah<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.479> something<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.960> wanted<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
yeah it's just something I wanted to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.469 
yeah it's just something I wanted to
talk<00:01:37.590> about<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.369> i<00:01:38.759> haven't<00:01:39.240> seen

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
talk about just because i haven't seen

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
talk about just because i haven't seen
Dark<00:01:39.780> Worlds<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> want<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> do

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
Dark Worlds and I kind of want to do

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.760 
Dark Worlds and I kind of want to do
some<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.780> commentary<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.960> Dark<00:01:43.229> Worlds<00:01:43.409> but

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
some like commentary on Dark Worlds but

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230 
some like commentary on Dark Worlds but
I<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:44.250> haven't<00:01:44.490> seen<00:01:44.700> any<00:01:44.880> dark<00:01:45.119> pool

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
I really haven't seen any dark pool

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.359 
I really haven't seen any dark pool
players<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.750> that's<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.530> wind-ups<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
players and that's because wind-ups and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.249 
players and that's because wind-ups and
injectors<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.299> popular<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.110> thing

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
injectors are really popular the thing

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.840 
injectors are really popular the thing
is<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.799> sectors<00:01:50.280> yeah<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.670> blow<00:01:50.820> up

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
is like in sectors yeah they can blow up

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
is like in sectors yeah they can blow up
or<00:01:51.000> graph<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.329> blow<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.570> your<00:01:51.720> gate<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.649> thing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
or graph a blow up your gate the thing

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.080 
or graph a blow up your gate the thing
is<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.130> could<00:01:53.220> still<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:53.759> graph<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
is you could still like get graph the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.490 
is you could still like get graph the
next<00:01:54.329> turn<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
next turn and you can just like kind of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.399 
next turn and you can just like kind of
beat<00:01:55.680> them<00:01:55.799> down<00:01:56.869> but<00:01:57.869> yeah<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
beat them down but yeah I don't think it

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.749 
beat them down but yeah I don't think it
has<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.710> bad<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> matchup<00:01:59.250> against<00:01:59.579> in

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
has that bad of a matchup against in

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.510 
has that bad of a matchup against in
sectors<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.869> against<00:02:01.290> wind<00:02:01.530> ups<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sectors but I think against wind ups the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
sectors but I think against wind ups the
problem<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.939> because<00:02:03.149> wind-ups<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:04.049> don't

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
problem is because wind-ups they don't

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
problem is because wind-ups they don't
discard<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.159> send<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.579> card<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:05.909> your

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
discard they just send a card from your

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.639 
discard they just send a card from your
hand<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> graveyard<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.320> don't<00:02:07.560> get

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
hand to the graveyard so you don't get

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
hand to the graveyard so you don't get
your<00:02:07.740> dark<00:02:07.979> holes<00:02:08.129> effects<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.759> that's<00:02:09.390> just

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
your dark holes effects so that's just

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.530 
your dark holes effects so that's just
something<00:02:09.720> also<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.610> remember<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.970> would<00:02:12.390> be

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
something also to remember it would be

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.700 
something also to remember it would be
awesome<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.959> think<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
awesome I think that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.200 
awesome I think that
dark<00:02:13.920> world<00:02:14.070> would<00:02:14.220> cease<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.670> much<00:02:14.850> more<00:02:15.000> play

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
dark world would cease so much more play

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.090 
dark world would cease so much more play
if<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.840> wind-ups<00:02:16.200> effects<00:02:16.470> were<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.950> know

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
if the wind-ups effects were you know

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.980 
if the wind-ups effects were you know
discard<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> card<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.810> know<00:02:18.900> you

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
discard the card that you know you

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.950 
discard the card that you know you
target<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.010> yeah<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.270> yeah<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.780> one

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
target so yeah but yeah this is one

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.510 
target so yeah but yeah this is one
thing<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.140> want<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.290> note<00:02:22.440> because<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:23.040> can't
