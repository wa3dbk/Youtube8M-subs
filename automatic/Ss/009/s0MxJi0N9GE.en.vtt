00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
been pretty good as well I usually

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.679 
been pretty good as well I usually
average<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.100> 4<00:01:05.489> hours<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.970> screen<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.420> time

average about 4 hours of screen on time
with<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.020> usage<00:01:07.439> obviously<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.490> could<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
with my usage obviously it could be a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.520 
with my usage obviously it could be a
little<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.270> better<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.810> four<00:01:10.140> hours<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
little bit better but four hours is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.230 
little bit better but four hours is
pretty<00:01:10.680> decent<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.340> opinion<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.119> able
