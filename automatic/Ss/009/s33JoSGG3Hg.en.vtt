00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
his name was Kane and the reason why not

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.600

because I was trying to be a troll or
anything<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.720> was<00:02:42.840> basically<00:02:43.140> because<00:02:44.030> he<00:02:45.030> was

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
anything it was basically because he was

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.220 
anything it was basically because he was
using<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.080> script<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:47.480> basically<00:02:48.480> would

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
using a script that basically would

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.350 
using a script that basically would
allow<00:02:49.560> him<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.860> AFK<00:02:50.370> or<00:02:50.550> away<00:02:50.970> from<00:02:51.000> keyboard

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
the entire day it would still somewhat

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.720 
the entire day it would still somewhat
play<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.900> game<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.110> him<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.830> he<00:02:56.520> would<00:02:56.610> just

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
play the game for him and he would just

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.250 
play the game for him and he would just
take<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.000> commander<00:02:57.480> spot<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.930> sit<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.200> the

much she was terrible so I had some kind

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.810 
much she was terrible so I had some kind
of<00:03:06.090> elaborate<00:03:06.480> scheme<00:03:06.980> where<00:03:07.980> two<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.550> my

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
of elaborate scheme where two of my

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.790 
of elaborate scheme where two of my
buddies<00:03:09.030> or<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.450> think<00:03:09.810> three<00:03:10.020> of<00:03:10.110> us<00:03:10.260> we

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
buddies or I think three of us we

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.820 
buddies or I think three of us we
actually<00:03:11.100> joined<00:03:11.520> his<00:03:12.180> team<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.590> could

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
actually joined his team and you could

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.370 
actually joined his team and you could
somewhat<00:03:14.310> prone<00:03:14.970> push<00:03:15.330> as<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:15.780> going<00:03:16.020> prone

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
somewhat prone push as in going prone

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.810 
somewhat prone push as in going prone
and<00:03:16.620> nudging<00:03:17.550> his<00:03:17.970> body<00:03:18.300> ever<00:03:19.080> so<00:03:19.380> slightly

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
and nudging his body ever so slightly

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.460 
and nudging his body ever so slightly
through<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.030> Titan<00:03:21.360> corridors<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.110> finally

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
through the Titan corridors and finally

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.800 
through the Titan corridors and finally
into<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.890> core<00:03:23.160> reactor<00:03:23.670> at<00:03:24.270> least<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.600> one<00:03:24.630> of

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
into the core reactor at least on one of

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.630 
into the core reactor at least on one of
the<00:03:24.870> side<00:03:25.140> corridors<00:03:25.680> where<00:03:25.890> we<00:03:26.010> could<00:03:26.190> go

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
the side corridors where we could go

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.010 
the side corridors where we could go
through<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.910> force<00:03:27.150> field<00:03:27.210> and<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.630> knife<00:03:27.810> home

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
through the force field and a knife home

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.680 
through the force field and a knife home
then<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.740> switched<00:03:29.010> teams<00:03:29.220> simply<00:03:30.210> potted<00:03:30.570> up

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
then I switched teams simply potted up

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.260 
then I switched teams simply potted up
and<00:03:30.900> then<00:03:31.080> knifed<00:03:31.530> him<00:03:31.710> so<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:33.090> was<00:03:33.240> just

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
and then knifed him so that was just

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.190 
and then knifed him so that was just
showing<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.080> he<00:03:34.380> was<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> bot<00:03:35.180> essentially

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
showing that he was a bot essentially

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.860 
showing that he was a bot essentially
because<00:03:37.200> if<00:03:37.470> anyone<00:03:37.920> was<00:03:38.370> there<00:03:38.700> playing<00:03:39.120> he

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
because if anyone was there playing he

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.270 
because if anyone was there playing he
would<00:03:40.020> obviously<00:03:40.290> notice<00:03:40.770> your<00:03:40.890> character

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
would obviously notice your character

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.610 
would obviously notice your character
just<00:03:41.460> getting<00:03:41.790> pushed<00:03:42.230> through<00:03:43.230> out<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.440> map

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
just getting pushed through out the map

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.910 
just getting pushed through out the map
and<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.070> pushing<00:03:44.580> took<00:03:44.790> 15<00:03:45.270> minutes<00:03:45.300> for<00:03:45.720> real

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
and the pushing took 15 minutes for real

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.550 
and the pushing took 15 minutes for real
it<00:03:46.920> took<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.190> while<00:03:47.460> so<00:03:48.050> that<00:03:49.050> was<00:03:49.200> pretty<00:03:49.380> much

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
it took a while so that was pretty much

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.670 
it took a while so that was pretty much

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
the scout and the medic would use where

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.820 
the scout and the medic would use where
they'd<00:04:51.000> they'd<00:04:51.419> first<00:04:51.780> can<00:04:52.020> cuss<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.530> and
