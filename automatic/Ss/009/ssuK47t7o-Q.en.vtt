 Model comes with electronics with onboard 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.320
 tuner again with the music echoes 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.859
 also insert six-sided model with 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.450
 a slightly reduced body with it 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.369
 her no feedback problems on the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.719
 stage has very very nice model leaves 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.390
 play wonderful also as e 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.740
 guitarist so there you do not have to 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.579
 paganini can play around with 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.579
 to get the part right 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.290
 as a real highlight and eyecatcher 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.020
 on the Namm Show we have 7 and 8 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.050
 side classic guitars in the assortment 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.170
 and for this to happen, that is 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.810
 the seven-sided model with massive 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.590
 spruce blanket no electronics but 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.480
 really quite classic 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.870
 Classical corpus too deep 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.700
 means resides here really well and the 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.680
 mensur is so that we still here 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.670
 have very defined sound also on the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.590
 deep b side and for the guys for the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.240
 we can not go deep enough 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.090
 yet another model in the range 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.910
 that's the trade was hannes namely 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.800
 is that that goes and we 208 it 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.840
 We can already think 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.970
 times 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.890
 that means you can really go in there 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.050
 the very deep registers also penetrate 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.910
 This instrument has no electronics 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.550
 on board that means really classic 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.380
 student model for playing massive 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.440
 Duty ceiling locked is locked 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.540
 wood on the sides of mahogany and a 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.709
 very broad but incredibly good too 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.540
 record great model so who's there 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.470
 should want to venture into other fields 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.470
 definitely try the part
