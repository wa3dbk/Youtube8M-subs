we'll go ahead and turn it up a little
bit<00:02:46.070> just<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.690> screw<00:02:48.690> right<00:02:48.840> down<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.230> or

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
bit just this screw right down here or

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.990 
bit just this screw right down here or
actually<00:02:49.980> I'll<00:02:50.280> let<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.400> warm<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.850> little

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
actually I'll let it warm up a little

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.210 
actually I'll let it warm up a little
bit<00:02:51.180> before<00:02:51.570> we<00:02:51.600> do<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.840> I'm<00:02:52.740> going<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.920> start

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
bit before we do that I'm going to start

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.560 
bit before we do that I'm going to start
it<00:02:53.340> let<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.850> warm<00:02:54.030> up<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.240> little<00:02:54.330> bit

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
it let it warm up a little bit

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.250 
it let it warm up a little bit
off-camera<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:56.100> we'll<00:02:56.250> be<00:02:56.370> back<00:02:57.260> okay

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
off-camera and then we'll be back okay

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.660 
off-camera and then we'll be back okay
the<00:02:58.410> idea<00:02:58.530> will<00:02:58.769> Justin<00:02:59.100> screw<00:02:59.280> didn't<00:02:59.489> help

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the idea will Justin screw didn't help

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.370 
the idea will Justin screw didn't help
much<00:02:59.880> but<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.209> did<00:03:00.300> find<00:03:00.630> one<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> problems

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
much but I did find one of the problems

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.699 
much but I did find one of the problems
I<00:03:02.310> can't<00:03:02.760> see<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.959> watch<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.380> I've<00:03:04.590> got

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
I can't see it but watch this I've got

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.190 
I can't see it but watch this I've got
to<00:03:04.800> split<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.310> my<00:03:05.519> fuel<00:03:06.150> line<00:03:06.209> there<00:03:06.780> we<00:03:06.900> go

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
to split in my fuel line there we go

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.320 
to split in my fuel line there we go
so<00:03:07.800> that's<00:03:08.400> one<00:03:08.580> problem<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.060> we're<00:03:09.180> going<00:03:09.300> to

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
so that's one problem and we're going to

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.479 
so that's one problem and we're going to
pop<00:03:09.510> up<00:03:09.570> problems<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:11.340> all<00:03:11.400> you

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
pop up problems like that so all you

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.850 
pop up problems like that so all you
have<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.730> cut<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.000> shorter<00:03:12.530> cut<00:03:13.530> off<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> good

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
have to cut that shorter cut off a good

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.470 
have to cut that shorter cut off a good
section<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.459> or<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.880> get<00:03:15.030> another<00:03:15.209> piece

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
section of it or just get another piece

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.199 
section of it or just get another piece
go<00:03:16.380> ahead<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.680> turn<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.950> off<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:20.120> that'll<00:03:21.120> do

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
go ahead and turn it off and that'll do

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.690 
go ahead and turn it off and that'll do
it<00:03:21.269> for<00:03:21.420> now<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.250> system<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:24.560> coolant<00:03:25.700> it's

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
it for now the system is coolant it's

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.380 
it for now the system is coolant it's
already<00:03:26.970> been<00:03:27.500> fully<00:03:28.820> it's<00:03:29.820> back<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.239> its

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
already been fully it's back to its

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.150 
already been fully it's back to its
normal<00:03:30.750> level<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.440> we're<00:03:31.590> good<00:03:31.739> there<00:03:31.950> that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
normal level so we're good there that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.330 
normal level so we're good there that
probably<00:03:32.370> show<00:03:33.090> up<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.390> camera<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:34.830> we're

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
probably show up on camera and we're

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.020 
probably show up on camera and we're
good<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.550> go<00:03:35.580> so<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.510> next<00:03:36.660> video<00:03:36.989> we<00:03:37.260> will

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
good to go so in the next video we will

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.940 
good to go so in the next video we will
probably<00:03:39.030> address<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.420> break<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.410> then

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
probably address the break and then

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.650 
probably address the break and then
we'll<00:03:41.100> have<00:03:41.280> many<00:03:41.550> couple<00:03:41.970> videos<00:03:42.360> after<00:03:42.630> that

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
we'll have many couple videos after that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.479 
we'll have many couple videos after that
we'll<00:03:43.650> get<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.890> idly<00:03:44.280> properly<00:03:44.820> up<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.019> vinyl

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
we'll get it idly properly up to vinyl

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.449 
we'll get it idly properly up to vinyl
be<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.519> little<00:03:47.790> bit<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.030> do<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.450> and

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
be a little bit to do with that and

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.500 
be a little bit to do with that and
we'll<00:03:50.459> take<00:03:50.610> her<00:03:50.730> for<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:50.940> spin<00:03:50.970> once<00:03:51.330> we<00:03:51.450> get

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
we'll take her for a spin once we get

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.199 
we'll take her for a spin once we get
that<00:03:51.660> front<00:03:51.930> brick<00:03:52.170> fixed<00:03:52.410> because<00:03:52.940> use<00:03:53.940> most

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
that front brick fixed because use most

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.670 
that front brick fixed because use most
of<00:03:54.330> your<00:03:54.420> front<00:03:54.630> brake<00:03:54.750> from<00:03:54.959> your<00:03:55.140> eyes<00:03:55.290> so

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
I'm not going to just bouncing into a

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.690 
I'm not going to just bouncing into a
curve<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.769> then<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.100> video<00:03:59.310> are<00:03:59.400> for<00:03:59.580> that

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
curve and then the video are for that

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.180 
curve and then the video are for that
we'll<00:03:59.850> have<00:03:59.970> some<00:04:00.150> cleanup<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.920> just<00:04:01.920> stuff

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
making it look pretty strong motor get

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.900 
making it look pretty strong motor get
good<00:04:05.760> compression<00:04:06.709> hoping<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.890> fix<00:04:08.459> does<00:04:08.730> it

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
good compression hoping that fix does it

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.309 
good compression hoping that fix does it
it<00:04:09.030> feels<00:04:09.270> really<00:04:09.540> really<00:04:09.660> good

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319

of<00:04:10.680> course<00:04:10.860> I've<00:04:11.040> written<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.459> yet<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.850> it

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
of course I've written it yet and it

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.960 
of course I've written it yet and it
starts<00:04:12.600> really<00:04:12.990> really<00:04:13.290> as<00:04:14.130> you<00:04:14.310> see<00:04:14.550> it<00:04:14.700> was<00:04:14.940> a

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
starts really really as you see it was a

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.060 
starts really really as you see it was a
cup<00:04:15.240> of<00:04:15.390> kicks<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.870> mean<00:04:16.080> surprise<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.709> figure<00:04:16.950> to

take<00:04:17.220> about<00:04:17.430> 10<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.989> case<00:04:19.520> so<00:04:20.520> that's<00:04:20.640> it

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
take about 10 not the case so that's it

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:21.110 
take about 10 not the case so that's it
for<00:04:20.940> now
