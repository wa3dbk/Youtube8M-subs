00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 hello friends talk to them hardwicke and they 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.259
 I welcome a thousand and one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.720
 curiosities of the video games chapter 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.519
 24 good as it is already beginning to be 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.860
 custom now let's talk about a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.730
 little subway rent but 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.260
 specifically metal gear solid rising 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.150
 revenge ans good should not be any 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.529
 surprise that this game like all 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 the metal gear solid games was 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.430
 developed by konami and like many of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.990
 the games made by konami although this 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.210
 it's not exclusion for the grammy has a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.130
 use for the konami with what you have to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.410
 to do is that when you are in the menu of the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.510
 game you have to put the konami code 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.890
 up up down down down left 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.050
 right left right 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.980
 and in doing so will cause Raiden say 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.980
 the title of the game out loud 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.239
 but besides that, it will unlock the two 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.950
 higher difficulty levels of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.450
 game is not supposed to konami code 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.100
 to do it are easier no more 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 difficult but it's not the only thing 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.640
 we have in this game good in the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.530
 first chapter of the game is possible 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.539
 meet a little white kitten 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.309
 that is near a beach and this cat 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.510
 It turns out to be a ninja cat because you can 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.010
 throw any kind of attack 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 any type of cut and the cat 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.339
 just dodge them but that's not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.570
 is the most interesting appearance of the cat 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.400
 ninja inside the game 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.020
 you have to go to the third chapter where 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.880
 you will meet with a kind of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.040
 kinematics I kind of kinematics 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.200
 because the camera is not stuck in a 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.460
 only place you can move it and that's 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.080
 exactly what you have to do to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.270
 find ninja cat you just have to 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.770
 turn the camera to the right side and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.600
 there you just have to wait a moment 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.560
 until the little kitten appears and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.560
 I start to make your own 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.860
 but these are not the only 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.469
 curiosities that I have about metal gear 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.390
 solid 'but not exactly about rising 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.670
 revenge ans but this time we're going to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.770
 back again to metal gear solid 3 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.020
 did you know that there is a whole minigame 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.750
 hidden inside metal gear solid 3 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.179
 it's a little game called guys savage 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.819
 and it's a hack and slash style game in 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.399
 third person with very rare filters and 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.229
 a very overwhelming atmosphere and it turns out 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.969
 that this game is a nightmare that 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.039
 He has solid snake while he is inside 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.659
 of a prison to access this 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.750
 mini game you need to save the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.630
 split when retained in gros 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.789
 great knicks go a tongue twister and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.799
 after being tortured by the color of 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.959
 bag if you record the game in that 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.849
 moment and then you leave and go back to 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.590
 enter and load this game you will be 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.940
 directly within this game then 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.650
 to end the game snakes it 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.489
 will wake up and resume the game as if 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.709
 nothing would have happened 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.360
 some official sources reveal that 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.160
 this game was going to be really a 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.230
 complete game but that was canceled and 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.329
 this is why a small part was included 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.040
 Inside metal gear solid 3 now 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.290
 completely change the subject and we are going to 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.700
 talk about bully if you go out the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.709
 school on a certain path is 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.870
 in contrast to a small cavern 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.519
 this cavern to take it will leave you 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.860
 directly on a kind of beach 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.989
 Hidden if you see from the shore of the beach 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.360
 to the left you can tell 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.700
 that there is in the water there is a kind of 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.440
 pirate ship sunk without anything satia 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.030
 well not directly to the ship 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.319
 pirate but you have to swim towards 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.599
 a little to the right of the boat 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.790
 pirate where there is another shore that is in 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.500
 a small island without waves get to this 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.780
 place you can meet with a pirate 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.250
 really and obviously it 's being bully 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.140
 when you find it they have nothing 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.459
 more than making him beat up a 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.110
 Once defeated the pirate, you will have 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.849
 unlocked a pirate hat to use 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.349
 in your character and now like the 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.970
 past chapters let's talk about 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.099
 hitman absolution because there are some 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.200
 curiosities that we did not see a pretty 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.989
 interesting happens with the extermination mission 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.459
 industries factory compound within 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.650
 this mission you can enter the building 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.329
 called excel or title industries 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.040
 of the mission once inside you can 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.260
 find yourself with some pretty things 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.720
 interesting in notably a 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.340
 atomic bomb hanging from the ceiling and as 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.500
 you can imagine seeing that bomb 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.870
 atomic the dibise for exactly in the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.370
 point just on the tip and you can 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.940
 see a pretty hidden scene 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.940
 interesting 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.209
 another stereo that's pretty weird is 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.460
 can find in the factory mission 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.110
 test facility after going through the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.580
 elevator in this place you have to go 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.320
 to the left towards a door 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.970
 where you can find a hallway 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.100
 long that at the end has a live pig 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.170
 what you have to do is shoot at 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.500
 this pig and then see what it is that 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.500
 pass 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.750
 and a short stress that can be found 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.490
 in fall 3 is a small door that 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.680
 can find back a lot of 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.880
 debris apparently I have not yet 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.130
 adore did not like that people 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.350
 I was looking for esther ex and 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.300
 he just put funk you when opening the 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.280
 door and to finish a curiosity 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.100
 quite interesting from josh ghosts 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.930
 inside the game there is an island that is 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.580
 the top left of the map in 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.710
 which one can go and is quite 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.840
 set aside so it's best that you go 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.910
 there with a plane and when you approach this 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.530
 island the plane will explode alone and this is 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.750
 to make a reference to the series of 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.729
 lost television plus it's your 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.410
 the plane will get even closer when you get closer 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.669
 a lot when you go down you 'll go back to 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.949
 find with all kinds of things 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.260
 strange inside this island all by 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.720
 course making references to the series 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.460
 lost television for example you can 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.320
 find the plane and even the famous 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.720
 smoke monster can be found at 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.160
 this island good friends that was all for 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.449

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.150
