00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
part of the jaw look at that for

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.600 
part of the jaw look at that for
articulation<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.590> guy<00:02:19.770> has<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.250> ton<00:02:20.580> of

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
articulation this guy has a ton of

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.130 
articulation this guy has a ton of
articulation<00:02:21.600> we'll<00:02:21.690> start<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> head

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
articulation we'll start with a head

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.810 
articulation we'll start with a head
here<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> ball<00:02:23.340> joint<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.790> you

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
here and it's not a ball joint so you

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.700 
here and it's not a ball joint so you
can<00:02:24.120> move<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.570> up<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.170> down<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.560> all<00:02:25.680> over

can move that up and down and all over

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.130 
can move that up and down and all over
the<00:02:26.010> place<00:02:26.220> great<00:02:27.060> pose<00:02:27.300> ability<00:02:27.750> there<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
the place great pose ability there and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.530 
the place great pose ability there and
on<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> shoulders<00:02:29.100> here<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:30.060> does<00:02:30.300> have<00:02:30.510> a

swivel and it is soft pliable rubber
type<00:02:33.840> plastic<00:02:34.680> there<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.640> spin<00:02:36.030> this

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
type plastic there so you can spin this

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.370 
type plastic there so you can spin this
all<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> way<00:02:36.540> around<00:02:36.660> without<00:02:37.020> worrying

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
all the way around without worrying

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.780 
all the way around without worrying
about<00:02:37.500> breaking<00:02:37.710> your<00:02:38.070> figure<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.640> does

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
about breaking your figure and it does

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.060 
about breaking your figure and it does
go<00:02:38.940> up<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.330> down<00:02:39.450> as<00:02:39.690> well<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.170> then<00:02:40.710> at<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
go up and down as well and then at the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.100 
go up and down as well and then at the
waist<00:02:41.310> here<00:02:41.730> he<00:02:42.120> does<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.570> small<00:02:42.780> ab

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
waist here he does have a small ab

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.200 
waist here he does have a small ab
crunch<00:02:43.500> which<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.070> also<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> ball<00:02:44.790> joint<00:02:44.820> up

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
crunch which is also on a ball joint up

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.210 
crunch which is also on a ball joint up
in<00:02:45.330> there<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.990> you<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.380> move<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.770> every

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
in there so you can just move this every

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.950 
in there so you can just move this every
which<00:02:47.370> way<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.550> want<00:02:47.880> here<00:02:48.630> at<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> elbow

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
which way you want here at the elbow

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.010 
which way you want here at the elbow
there<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.770> an<00:02:50.610> up-and-down<00:02:51.120> movement<00:02:51.660> as<00:02:51.780> well

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
there is an up-and-down movement as well

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.040 
there is an up-and-down movement as well
and<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.800> spin<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.370> there<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.880> that's<00:02:54.300> very<00:02:54.840> nice

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
and a spin in there so that's very nice

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.620 
and a spin in there so that's very nice
and<00:02:55.350> there<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> small<00:02:56.640> bullet<00:02:57.000> ball<00:02:57.360> joint

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
and there is a small bullet ball joint

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.850 
and there is a small bullet ball joint
in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.810> wrist<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.470> move<00:02:58.680> them<00:02:58.800> around

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
in the wrist so you can move them around

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.970 
in the wrist so you can move them around
and<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.670> fingers<00:03:00.000> too<00:03:00.270> are<00:03:00.540> soft<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.650> can

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and the fingers too are soft so you can

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.070 
and the fingers too are soft so you can
move<00:03:02.610> them<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> little<00:03:03.240> bit<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.930> don't

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
move them a little bit and you don't

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.300 
move them a little bit and you don't
have<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.260> worry<00:03:04.380> about<00:03:04.440> breaking<00:03:04.740> them<00:03:05.130> so

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
have to worry about breaking them so

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.940 
have to worry about breaking them so
there's<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.360> soft<00:03:06.630> plastic<00:03:06.900> there<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.590> at

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
there's like a soft plastic there and at

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.500 
there's like a soft plastic there and at
the<00:03:08.010> hip<00:03:08.160> joints<00:03:08.520> here<00:03:08.670> there<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.060> ball

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
the hip joints here there is a ball

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.140 
the hip joints here there is a ball
joint<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.110> can<00:03:10.320> just<00:03:11.310> pose<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.820> this

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
joint so you can just pose that this

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.390 
joint so you can just pose that this
thing's<00:03:12.360> just<00:03:12.570> full<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.440> articulation<00:03:14.280> it's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
thing's just full of articulation it's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.210 
thing's just full of articulation it's
crazy<00:03:14.810> spin<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.020> up<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.320> down<00:03:16.470> at<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.800> knee

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
crazy spin and up and down at the knee

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.080 
crazy spin and up and down at the knee
