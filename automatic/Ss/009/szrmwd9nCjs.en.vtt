00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
so you add in an almost every fret and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.570 
so you add in an almost every fret and
this<00:03:29.170> part<00:03:29.439> sell<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.859> chocolates

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.620 

and<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.850> would<00:03:38.000> start<00:03:38.300> from<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:39.020> 7th<00:03:39.590> fret

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
and you would start from the 7th fret

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.300 
and you would start from the 7th fret
just<00:03:41.630> like<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:42.320> do<00:03:42.530> on<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.770> second<00:03:43.130> string

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
just like you do on the second string

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.810 
just like you do on the second string
that<00:03:43.550> walk<00:03:43.790> down<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:45.380> yeah<00:03:46.370> it's<00:03:46.580> the<00:03:46.640> same

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
that walk down but yeah it's the same

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.860 
that walk down but yeah it's the same
thing<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.450> walk<00:03:48.200> down<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.680> show<00:03:49.010> before

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
thing is the walk down is show before

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.890 
thing is the walk down is show before
except<00:03:50.870> it's<00:03:51.830> on<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.130> E<00:03:52.160> string<00:03:52.550> this<00:03:52.760> time<00:03:53.030> so

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
except it's on the E string this time so

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:08.140 
except it's on the E string this time so
it<00:03:54.350> goes<00:04:02.770> you<00:04:03.770> would<00:04:03.950> do<00:04:04.190> ah<00:04:05.590> on<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.430> 3rd<00:04:07.730> fret

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
it goes you would do ah on the 3rd fret

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:34.030 
it goes you would do ah on the 3rd fret
you<00:04:08.990> go

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.280 

so<00:04:35.040> will<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.669> be<00:04:35.880> sued<00:04:36.330> on<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:37.230> third<00:04:37.530> fret

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
so will you be sued on the third fret

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:54.360 
so will you be sued on the third fret
and<00:04:45.440> then<00:04:47.330> go<00:04:48.330> down

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.210 

so<00:04:56.919> after<00:04:57.919> that<00:04:58.780> there's<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.840> part<00:05:00.110> art<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.860> risk

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
so after that there's a part art a risk

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:12.790 
so after that there's a part art a risk
that<00:05:01.520> goes<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:09.650> E<00:05:09.680> string<00:05:10.220> again<00:05:10.870> she'll<00:05:11.870> shut

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
that goes the E string again she'll shut

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.320 
that goes the E string again she'll shut
