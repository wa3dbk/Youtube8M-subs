00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 this class number 7 and now let's see 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.069
 the way we can encourage our 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.059
 character and make him walk 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.020
 this is important that we wolves 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.539
 let's be first and to see the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.090
 positions of the legs that will have 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.550
 our character and for that we are going to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.420
 make a small illustration of the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.380
 pneumatic that will contain the line of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.550
 time let's do the first example 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.410
 of the first position and it is precisely 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.790
 I suppose our character 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.790
 let's draw profile 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.059
 and we are going to do something very simple 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.760
 and we have our profile character 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:59.160
 something very important that we have to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:02.310
 do and it 's precisely the position of 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.400
 of the legs and for it first 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:11.330
 our position will have legs 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.330
 open 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.780
 let's say that this is 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.610
 my position my right leg 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.610
 and this is the left leg 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.860
 ok second let's do again the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.860
 character 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:41.210
 but now 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.210
 the right leg should be straight 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.359
 the left leg to start giving 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.359
 this step that we would give 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:02.760
 that is the second now third position 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.760
 again we make the character 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.670
 and the right leg 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.880
 is what should be left towards 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.880
 behind 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.530
 and the left leg 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.530
 He would have to be longer 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.230
 forward 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.200
 if they realize we have invested in 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.930
 these three steps we have invested the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.980
 leg that was there back was the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.769
 left we have invested it towards 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.709
 front to back and forward 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:47.299
 leaves ok let's go to position number 4 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.299
 let's do the character again 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.850
 and we're going to see that the right leg should 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:01.810
 again be forward to 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.810
 This will put the left leg 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.330
 straight 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.330
 and the right leg 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.460
 this would be the right leg and the leg 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.860
 left 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.860
 and the fifth and last position 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.390
 our character should have 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.240
 the same initial position 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.310
 right leg 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.020
 has the left 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:52.230
 with this we would be creating the 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.230
 animation of our character walking
