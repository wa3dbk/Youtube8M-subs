be able to recognize bliss is a little
bit<00:00:24.150> more<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.600> safety<00:00:24.990> rotation<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.650> things

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
a year to learn definitely at the

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.100 
a year to learn definitely at the
quarterback<00:02:05.000> position<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.540> think<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:05.810> good<00:02:05.990> to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
quarterback position I think is good to

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.740 
quarterback position I think is good to
redshirt<00:02:06.320> just<00:02:06.800> because<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.240> whole<00:02:08.510> lot

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
redshirt just because it's a whole lot

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.449 
redshirt just because it's a whole lot

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
lineman protections I mean things like

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.270 
lineman protections I mean things like
that<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.260> not<00:02:18.410> easy<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.830> come<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.040> and
