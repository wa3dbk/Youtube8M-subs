titanium so heat is gonna stay contained
in<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.400> reflect<00:01:32.759> back<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.780> know

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869

see this thing has no problem producing
some<00:01:47.759> awesome<00:01:48.240> flames<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> very<00:01:49.290> little

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
some awesome flames with a very little

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.800 
some awesome flames with a very little
bit<00:01:49.710> about<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.790> very<00:01:51.000> small<00:01:51.299> amount<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> fuel

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
bit about the very small amount of fuel

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 
bit about the very small amount of fuel
and<00:01:52.500> we're<00:01:52.770> able<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.159> bring<00:01:53.939> things<00:01:54.149> at

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and we're able to bring things at

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.030 
and we're able to bring things at
temperature<00:01:54.570> pretty<00:01:54.750> quickly<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.740> just

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
temperature pretty quickly so I just

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.859 
temperature pretty quickly so I just
wanted<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> talk<00:01:57.180> some<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.540> about<00:01:57.780> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
point of reference of the size there's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.449 
point of reference of the size there's
our<00:02:05.490> Swiss<00:02:05.759> tool<00:02:06.030> right<00:02:06.479> there<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.459> this

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
our Swiss tool right there and this

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.400 
our Swiss tool right there and this
thing<00:02:08.700> when<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:08.849> all<00:02:09.149> packed<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
thing when it's all packed up as you

thing when it's all packed up as you
guys<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.619> seen<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.920> previous<00:02:11.069> videos<00:02:11.550> slides

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
guys have seen in previous videos slides

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.940 
guys have seen in previous videos slides
perfectly<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.840> little<00:02:13.080> fire<00:02:13.260> kit

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
perfectly in this little fire kit

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.120 
perfectly in this little fire kit
so<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.780> think<00:02:15.780> we've<00:02:16.050> talked<00:02:16.260> about<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.890> size

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
so I think we've talked about the size

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.130 
so I think we've talked about the size
how<00:02:17.520> easy<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.000> put<00:02:18.180> together<00:02:18.330> enough

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
how easy it is to put together enough

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.100 
how easy it is to put together enough
here<00:02:19.380> recently<00:02:19.890> my<00:02:20.670> ex<00:02:20.880> real<00:02:21.060> quick<00:02:21.300> and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
to find a little bit more stable balance

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.170 
to find a little bit more stable balance
platform<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.920> start<00:02:29.190> cooking<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:29.970> thing

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
cool thing about this little stove since

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.449 
cool thing about this little stove since
it's<00:02:53.459> titanium<00:02:53.819> it's<00:02:54.660> pretty<00:02:55.319> strong<00:02:55.590> strong

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
it's titanium it's pretty strong strong

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.910 
it's titanium it's pretty strong strong
enough<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:58.220> cast<00:02:59.220> iron<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.720> now<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.650> can't

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
enough to cast iron and now you can't

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.740 
enough to cast iron and now you can't
see<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.430> we're<00:03:02.760> gonna<00:03:02.819> actually<00:03:03.569> change

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
see it so we're gonna actually change

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.559 
see it so we're gonna actually change
the<00:03:04.110> shot<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.769> thing<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.190> real<00:03:05.400> quick

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
the shot of this thing a real quick

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.750 
the shot of this thing a real quick
perfect<00:03:06.569> angle<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:09.569> now<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.959> see<00:03:10.760> we're

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
perfect angle so now you can see we're

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.360 
perfect angle so now you can see we're
gonna<00:03:11.819> be<00:03:12.030> able<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.709> fry<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.830> some<00:03:13.860> eggs<00:03:14.100> here

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
gonna be able to fry up some eggs here

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.140 
gonna be able to fry up some eggs here
rather<00:03:15.209> quickly<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:17.130> course<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.610> never<00:03:17.730> fry

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
rather quickly of course I never fry

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.509 
rather quickly of course I never fry
eggs<00:03:18.359> without<00:03:18.510> some<00:03:19.130> bacon<00:03:20.130> grease<00:03:22.400> that's<00:03:23.400> it

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
eggs without some bacon grease that's it

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.610 
eggs without some bacon grease that's it
I'm<00:03:23.670> guessin<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.299> we<00:03:24.600> can<00:03:24.780> put<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> good<00:03:25.290> amount

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
I'm guessin see we can put a good amount

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.289 
I'm guessin see we can put a good amount
of<00:03:25.950> large<00:03:26.160> fuel<00:03:26.489> whether<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:26.850> gonna<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.060> easy

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
of large fuel whether it's gonna be easy

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.580 
of large fuel whether it's gonna be easy
to<00:03:27.510> maintain

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
to maintain

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.009 
to maintain
just<00:03:29.120> slowly<00:03:30.120> sliding<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.600> there<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.750> didn't

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
just slowly sliding in there I didn't

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.050 
just slowly sliding in there I didn't
use<00:03:31.109> one<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.609> strike<00:03:32.609> light<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
use one of the strike light so to

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.030 
use one of the strike light so to
balance<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.660> rock<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.500> we've<00:03:34.890> already

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
balance on this rock and we've already

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.069 
balance on this rock and we've already
melted<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.060> go<00:03:36.209> ahead<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.420> crack<00:03:36.930> some

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
melted that so go ahead and crack some

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.300 
melted that so go ahead and crack some
eggs<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:38.549> make<00:03:39.030> yourself<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.359> little<00:03:39.450> snack

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:55.589 

look<00:03:44.310> at<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.519> it's<00:03:44.730> hot<00:03:44.910> amazing

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.759 

you<00:03:56.599> know<00:03:56.689> of<00:03:56.780> course<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.170> probably<00:03:57.409> should<00:03:57.650> use

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
you know of course I probably should use

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.099 
you know of course I probably should use
a<00:03:57.829> smaller<00:03:58.250> pin<00:03:58.609> for<00:03:58.879> this<00:03:58.969> but<00:03:59.239> you<00:03:59.780> know<00:03:59.930> the

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
a smaller pin for this but you know the

this<00:04:10.010> back<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.489> center<00:04:10.790> where<00:04:10.970> we're

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
this back to the center where we're

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:30.890 
this back to the center where we're
getting<00:04:11.299> more<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.569> heat

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.290 

alright<00:04:31.900> guys<00:04:32.080> as<00:04:32.289> you<00:04:32.409> guys<00:04:32.500> see<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:33.300> uh

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
alright guys as you guys see that uh

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.589 
alright guys as you guys see that uh
that<00:04:35.169> took<00:04:35.379> nothing<00:04:35.819> even<00:04:36.819> the<00:04:36.909> larger<00:04:37.330> pot

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
that took nothing even the larger pot

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.600 
that took nothing even the larger pot
like<00:04:37.900> this<00:04:38.169> even<00:04:38.949> with<00:04:39.009> all<00:04:39.159> your<00:04:39.189> frying<00:04:39.520> pan

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
like this even with all your frying pan

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:47.420 
like this even with all your frying pan
like<00:04:39.849> this<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.120> mean<00:04:40.210> this<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.539> my<00:04:41.439> big<00:04:41.680> boy

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.390 

there's<00:04:48.430> some<00:04:48.580> more<00:04:48.759> wood<00:04:49.449> in<00:04:49.569> there<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:51.280> way

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
there's some more wood in there that way

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.300 
there's some more wood in there that way
you<00:04:51.460> guys<00:04:51.669> can<00:04:51.939> see<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.150> little<00:04:52.360> bit<00:04:52.509> better<00:04:53.310> how

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
you guys can see a little bit better how

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.570 
you guys can see a little bit better how
we're<00:04:54.490> working<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.680> this<00:04:57.219> wood<00:04:57.430> can

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
we're working and this is this wood can

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.939 
we're working and this is this wood can
be<00:04:57.610> broken<00:04:57.849> down<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.210> lot<00:04:58.509> finer<00:04:59.289> a<00:04:59.409> lot<00:04:59.560> smaller

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
be broken down a lot finer a lot smaller

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.980 
be broken down a lot finer a lot smaller
and<00:05:00.819> I<00:05:00.909> would<00:05:01.000> probably<00:05:01.330> get<00:05:01.419> better<00:05:01.569> results

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
and I would probably get better results

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.420 
and I would probably get better results
but<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.139> kind<00:05:02.349> of<00:05:02.379> want<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.560> show<00:05:02.770> the

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
but I kind of want to show the

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.969 
but I kind of want to show the
versatility<00:05:03.909> here<00:05:04.240> how<00:05:04.419> this<00:05:04.599> thing<00:05:04.779> can<00:05:04.870> take

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
versatility here how this thing can take

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.140 
versatility here how this thing can take
some<00:05:05.979> larger<00:05:06.340> pieces<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.669> fuel<00:05:06.879> wood<00:05:07.029> to

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
some larger pieces of fuel wood to

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:25.320 
some larger pieces of fuel wood to
sustain<00:05:07.479> it<00:05:23.189> so<00:05:24.189> guys<00:05:24.310> this<00:05:24.520> thing<00:05:24.729> is<00:05:24.879> pretty

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
sustain it so guys this thing is pretty

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.800 
sustain it so guys this thing is pretty
awesome

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
awesome

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.390 
awesome
I<00:05:25.900> wouldn't<00:05:26.199> suggest<00:05:26.289> necessarily<00:05:27.069> cooking

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
I wouldn't suggest necessarily cooking

I wouldn't suggest necessarily cooking
it<00:05:27.550> on<00:05:27.639> unstable<00:05:28.000> rock<00:05:28.419> like<00:05:28.719> me<00:05:28.930> nice<00:05:29.439> flat

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
it on unstable rock like me nice flat

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.129 
it on unstable rock like me nice flat
surface<00:05:29.949> will<00:05:30.340> probably<00:05:30.669> be<00:05:30.729> best<00:05:30.990> but<00:05:31.990> we're

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
surface will probably be best but we're

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.680 
surface will probably be best but we're
going<00:05:32.349> for<00:05:32.560> a<00:05:32.590> good<00:05:33.159> shot<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.669> in<00:05:33.909> good

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
going for a good shot and in good
