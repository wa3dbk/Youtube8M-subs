that are between 9 inches wide and 16

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.580 
that are between 9 inches wide and 16
and<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.830> half<00:00:13.860> inches<00:00:14.429> wide<00:00:15.020> this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> gateway

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and a half inches wide this is a gateway

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.640 
and a half inches wide this is a gateway
laptop<00:00:17.490> that's<00:00:17.820> called<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.180> 17<00:00:18.810> inch<00:00:19.109> gateway

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
laptop that's called a 17 inch gateway

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
laptop that's called a 17 inch gateway
but<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.699> manufacturers<00:00:21.510> usually<00:00:21.660> refer<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
but the manufacturers usually refer to a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.220 
but the manufacturers usually refer to a
diagonal<00:00:22.680> measurements<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> 17<00:00:25.080> inch

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
diagonal measurements so a 17 inch

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.740 
diagonal measurements so a 17 inch
gateway<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.890> actually<00:00:26.369> less<00:00:26.670> than<00:00:26.910> 16<00:00:27.390> inches

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
gateway is actually less than 16 inches

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.700 
gateway is actually less than 16 inches
wide<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.920> unit<00:00:29.250> will<00:00:29.400> fit<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.640> fine<00:00:30.710> the

so<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.570> aligned<00:00:52.289> approximately<00:00:53.129> where

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so that it's aligned approximately where

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
so that it's aligned approximately where

the curvature starts to fall off on the
edge<00:00:56.420> we're<00:00:57.420> gonna<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.870> same<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
edge we're gonna do the same for the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.020 
edge we're gonna do the same for the
other<00:00:59.879> half
