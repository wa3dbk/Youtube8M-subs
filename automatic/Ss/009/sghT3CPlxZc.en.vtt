 dedicated to the great product afsona 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.510
 the topic did not arise from scratch and I 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.389
 once heard of wonderful properties 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.700
 oksanu personally did not experience myself 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.470
 on his family and now finally 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.779
 just met my mom 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.550
 there was severe liver toxicity from 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.920
 drugs as well as she 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.230
 very energetic liver turned out 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 moody and cleaned up poorly even with 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.250
 using good medicine in this and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.890
 Hepatologist advised her to include 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.719
 food drink from oats and said that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.210
 such a capricious liver is now this 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.510
 drink and her for life but I sure 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 immediately to the internet what was there about him 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.520
 written and good 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.530
 studied and I was pleased with the dossier on oats 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140
 it really is a valuable nutritious 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.930
 drink I hasten to share with you and by the way 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.699
 we already accept it with the whole family and so 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 first about the beneficial properties and 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.039
 made up the composition of oats come in very 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.340
 valuable components for the body such 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.220
 as vitamins b6 b one cent to zinc 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.439
 minerals phosphorus calcium iron magnesium and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.110
 gray also contains thiamine 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.850
 beneficial to the body fats and large 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.610
 soluble vegetable quantity 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.560
 fiber which is especially valuable for good 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.170
 intestinal work nutritional value 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.250
 oats due to the composition 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.650
 its grain portion is 18 percent protein 60 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 percent of carbohydrates and only five 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.579
 percent of fats with regular 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.619
 eating oats 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.659
 normal stool clears intestines 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.900
 recover its microflora 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.890
 the process of cleaning the grains are removed bran 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.619
 and embryos 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.990
 leaving only the endosperm to them the problem 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.680
 that in the absence of bran germ 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 grain loses 25 percent of protein together 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.640
 with multiple nutrients 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.009
 substances 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.000
 hence the most useful 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.790
 abuses unpolished 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.670
 see strong grain infusion of oats 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.579
 gently cleanses the liver; oats composition enters 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.829
 amino acids that help the liver 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.869
 produce lecithin which is necessary 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.569
 for the normalization of metabolic processes 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.879
 also helps clean the artery walls 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.120
 against body fat 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.489
 referred to as sclerotic 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.260
 Ashkami dissolving them soluble 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.269
 plant fiber which is located 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.310
 in all slows down digestion so 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.950
 way to increase blood sugar 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.000
 going on for a longer time 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.560
 some diabetics who 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.220
 followed a diet with a lot 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.709
 content 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.319
 soluble fiber and self use 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.739
 reduced the dose of drugs and where lunch 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.829
 oats are gluten free therefore shown 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.019
 allergy sufferers beta glucans 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.569
 are all in helping to reduce risk 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.459
 cardiovascular disease obverse 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.840
 considered a natural life source 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.060
 power and energy if you turn it on 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.019
 daily diet then weight loss 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.150
 will be 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.329
 in a natural way without debilitating 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.280
 diets and starvation cereal contains complex 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.049
 carbohydrates as complex carbohydrates are known 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.870
 able to provide slow 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.329
 energy release during the day 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.250
 reducing cravings for sweets and snacks with 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.440
 quick extrusion of energy what 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.849
 undoubtedly help in losing weight over 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.590
 contain high amounts of fiber 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.079
 which reduces the number of 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.670
 consumed food and increase the period 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.310
 time between meals 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.410
 helps prevent constipation and improve 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.139
 intestinal metabolism that contributes 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.599
 weight loss of course since he is still 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.310
 and few calories then it makes it 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.980
 a great choice for those who follow 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.260
 behind its figure the grass has a low 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.510
 glycemic index and that means that 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.120
 after eating of sunny rises 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.430
 blood sugar levels and fit traction 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.290
 to sweet decoction and infusion obtained 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.760
 oat grains are able to normalize 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.190
 fat metabolism in the body 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.780
 thereby accelerating fat burning and 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.769
 loss of extra pounds of oats is considered 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.620
 tonic and tonic 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.629
 it improves and renews the blood 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.940
 prevent the formation of blood clots when 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.790
 coronary heart disease and hypertension 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.989
 increases white blood cell count 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.480
 normalizes metabolism promotes 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.239
 enhance immunity ability to 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.699
 self-cleaning restrain senile 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.530
 withering and by the way our 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.129
 many athletes use this 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.709
 drink 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.130
 all my life but unfortunately spoon 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.970
 tar is still present in everything and so 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.019
 renal contraindications 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.000
 failure 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.520
 hypersensitivity to some 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.380
 components and general intolerance 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.720
 product 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.930
 some diseases of the gallbladder 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.010
 meaning gallstone disease with 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.780
 this diagnosis is better 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.170
 consult a doctor as 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.080
 oats 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.850
 improves the flow of bile and if the feeder 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.460
 there is then any moment they will start 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.400
 move and this is not good and now 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.010
