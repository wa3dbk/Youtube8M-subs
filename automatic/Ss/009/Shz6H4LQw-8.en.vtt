00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.390 
why use a rope alter here's a little
experiment<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.200> can<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:10.500> at<00:00:10.620> home<00:00:10.800> grab<00:00:11.340> a

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
experiment you can do at home grab a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.180 
experiment you can do at home grab a
regular<00:00:11.639> halter<00:00:12.209> grab<00:00:13.110> both<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.469> rope<00:00:13.980> halter

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
regular halter grab both a rope halter

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.670 
regular halter grab both a rope halter
and<00:00:14.519> notice<00:00:15.209> how<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.539> regular<00:00:15.990> halter<00:00:16.470> is

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
and notice how the regular halter is

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.950 
and notice how the regular halter is
much<00:00:16.920> heavier<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.640> your<00:00:17.820> hand<00:00:18.030> which<00:00:18.690> means

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
much heavier on your hand which means

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.439 
much heavier on your hand which means
it'll<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.350> more<00:00:19.679> comfortable<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.429> your<00:00:20.939> horse

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
it'll be more comfortable for your horse

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.009 
it'll be more comfortable for your horse
but<00:00:22.380> now<00:00:22.500> grab<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> volunteer<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.750> them

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
but now grab a volunteer and have them

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.890 
but now grab a volunteer and have them
pull<00:00:25.320> down<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.740> both<00:00:25.859> halters<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.550> notice<00:00:27.060> how

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
pull down on both halters and notice how

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.290 
pull down on both halters and notice how
the<00:00:28.589> rope<00:00:28.800> halter<00:00:29.009> is<00:00:29.730> much<00:00:30.060> more

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the rope halter is much more

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.170 
the rope halter is much more
uncomfortable<00:00:30.599> than<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:32.460> regular<00:00:32.790> halter

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
uncomfortable than the regular halter

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.940 
uncomfortable than the regular halter
when<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.600> being<00:00:33.780> pulled<00:00:34.080> against<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
when it's being pulled against and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.619 
when it's being pulled against and
that's<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.490> the<00:00:35.700> rope<00:00:35.879> is<00:00:36.090> thinner<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
that's because the rope is thinner so

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.690 
that's because the rope is thinner so
the<00:00:37.050> rope<00:00:37.320> halter<00:00:37.559> really<00:00:37.980> discourages<00:00:38.550> your

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the rope halter really discourages your

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.660 
the rope halter really discourages your
horse<00:00:38.910> from<00:00:39.690> leaning<00:00:40.170> against<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
horse from leaning against you so the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.279 
horse from leaning against you so the
first<00:00:41.789> step<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> choosing<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.899> right<00:00:43.110> rope

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
first step to choosing the right rope

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.040 
first step to choosing the right rope
altars<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.860> consider<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.370> size<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:45.090> regular

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
altars to consider the size a regular

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
altars to consider the size a regular
average<00:00:46.289> size<00:00:46.680> halter<00:00:47.070> will<00:00:47.190> fit<00:00:47.340> most<00:00:47.550> horses

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
average size halter will fit most horses

her quite well you might want to
consider<00:00:52.829> choosing<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.399> next<00:00:53.640> size<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.969> if

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
consider choosing the next size up if

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.790 
consider choosing the next size up if
you<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> warm<00:00:54.840> blood<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> large<00:00:55.530> head

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you have a warm blood with a large head

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.799 
you have a warm blood with a large head
or<00:00:56.399> maybe<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> next<00:00:56.940> size<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.780> have

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
or maybe the next size down if you have

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.430 
or maybe the next size down if you have
an<00:00:57.989> arab<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> fine<00:00:58.829> head<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> next

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
an arab with a fine head so the next

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.259 
an arab with a fine head so the next
aspect<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> consider<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.699> choosing<00:01:02.730> our

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
aspect to consider when choosing our

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.240 
aspect to consider when choosing our
rope<00:01:03.539> halter<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:04.440> kind<00:01:04.620> of<00:01:04.680> rope<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> use

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
rope halter is what kind of rope to use

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
rope halter is what kind of rope to use
this<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> soft<00:01:06.510> rope<00:01:06.840> halter<00:01:07.050> soft

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this here is a soft rope halter soft

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
this here is a soft rope halter soft
rope<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.310> milder<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.150> more<00:01:09.299> comfortable<00:01:09.570> for

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
rope is milder and more comfortable for

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.109 
rope is milder and more comfortable for
the<00:01:09.930> horse<00:01:09.990> however<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:11.310> also<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.759> stiff

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the horse however we also have the stiff

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
the horse however we also have the stiff
rope<00:01:12.330> option<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.350> horses<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.100> lean

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
rope option so horses that like to lean

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.090 
rope option so horses that like to lean
a<00:01:14.310> lot<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.700> our<00:01:14.820> extra<00:01:15.210> pushy<00:01:15.799> one<00:01:16.799> thing<00:01:17.009> we

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
a lot in our extra pushy one thing we

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.920 
a lot in our extra pushy one thing we
consider<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> stiff<00:01:18.360> rope<00:01:18.630> halter

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
consider is that the stiff rope halter

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.380 
consider is that the stiff rope halter
holds<00:01:19.650> its<00:01:19.799> shape<00:01:19.890> better<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:21.210> less

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
holds its shape better and it's less

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.690 
holds its shape better and it's less
likely<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:22.020> tangled<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> soft<00:01:22.920> altar

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.249 

another<00:01:26.700> consideration<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> thickness

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
another consideration is the thickness

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
another consideration is the thickness
of<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.439> rope<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.040> I've<00:01:29.579> got<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
of your rope right here I've got a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.090 
of your rope right here I've got a
thicker<00:01:30.150> rope<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.840> that's<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.320> milder<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
thicker rope and that's a lot milder and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.850 
thicker rope and that's a lot milder and
a<00:01:33.060> thinner<00:01:33.450> rope<00:01:33.720> will<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.200> more<00:01:34.350> bite<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
a thinner rope will have more bite and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.580 
a thinner rope will have more bite and
put<00:01:35.009> more<00:01:35.159> pressure<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> horse<00:01:36.590> some

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
put more pressure on the horse some

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.139 
put more pressure on the horse some
features<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:38.970> rope

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
features that you can get for your rope

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.600 
features that you can get for your rope
halter<00:01:39.390> are<00:01:39.750> knots<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> nose<00:01:40.590> band<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
halter are knots for the nose band you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
halter are knots for the nose band you
can<00:01:41.729> either<00:01:41.880> get<00:01:42.119> two<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.450> four<00:01:42.689> knots<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
can either get two or four knots and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.830 
can either get two or four knots and
knots<00:01:43.229> put<00:01:43.860> pressure<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> horse<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.689> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
knots put pressure on the horse when you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
knots put pressure on the horse when you
apply<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:47.189> encourage<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> horse<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.149> give

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
apply it to encourage the horse to give

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.870 
apply it to encourage the horse to give
to<00:01:48.420> pressure<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.500> more<00:01:49.710> knots<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to pressure the more knots you have the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.730 
to pressure the more knots you have the
more<00:01:51.060> pressure<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> horse's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
more pressure there is on the horse's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.850 
more pressure there is on the horse's
nose<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> another<00:01:54.750> feature<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.290> consider<00:01:55.649> is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
nose so another feature to consider is

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.069 
nose so another feature to consider is
whether<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.369> want<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.700> twisted<00:01:57.210> crown<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.840> just

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
whether you want a twisted crown or just

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.380 
whether you want a twisted crown or just
a<00:01:58.170> regular<00:01:58.290> crown<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.549> twisted<00:01:59.909> crown<00:02:00.149> will

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
a regular crown the twisted crown will

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.999 
a regular crown the twisted crown will
apply<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.840> pressure<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.409> horses<00:02:01.770> pull

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
apply more pressure on the horses pull

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.920 
apply more pressure on the horses pull
so<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.180> ask<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> horse<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.659> drop

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
so if you want to ask the horse to drop

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.779 
so if you want to ask the horse to drop
their<00:02:04.110> head<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:04.530> example<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.340> won't<00:02:05.490> need<00:02:05.610> as

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
their head for example you won't need as

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.660 
their head for example you won't need as
much<00:02:06.000> force<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:07.200> remember<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.460> more

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
much force now remember that the more

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
much force now remember that the more
features<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.180> get<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.600> your<00:02:09.690> halter<00:02:09.990> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
stronger it will be in the less course

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.760 
stronger it will be in the less course
you'll<00:02:12.510> need

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.590 

so<00:02:15.770> another<00:02:16.010> option<00:02:16.100> are<00:02:16.910> these<00:02:17.060> little<00:02:17.240> metal

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
so another option are these little metal

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.570 
so another option are these little metal
rings<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:18.170> can<00:02:18.350> easily<00:02:18.740> clip<00:02:19.220> your<00:02:19.370> horse
