00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
okay we're going to demonstrate four

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.089 
okay we're going to demonstrate four
types<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.740> drops<00:00:23.090> on<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.830> moderate<00:00:25.830> little

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
types of drops on this moderate little

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.279 
types of drops on this moderate little
drops<00:00:26.279> about<00:00:26.490> three<00:00:26.699> feet<00:00:27.140> we're<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
drops about three feet we're going to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.310 
drops about three feet we're going to
start<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> side<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.460> front<00:00:30.140> project<00:00:31.140> out

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
start with the side to front project out

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
start with the side to front project out
and<00:00:31.560> turn<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> front<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.880> roll

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and turn to the front so you can roll

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:49.930 
and turn to the front so you can roll
out<00:00:36.710> get<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:37.890> spot<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:40.170> shoot<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:40.950> there

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.740 

next<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.090> we're<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
next one we're just going to do a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
next one we're just going to do a
forward<00:00:52.110> hop<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:53.370> mount<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.789> way<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.149> will

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
forward hop will mount this way it will

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
forward hop will mount this way it will
jump<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> same<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.500> we'll<00:00:55.710> mount<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
jump the same way so we'll mount the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.979 
jump the same way so we'll mount the
same<00:00:56.219> way<00:00:56.370> only<00:00:56.699> straight<00:00:57.120> forward<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.570> then

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
same way only straight forward and then

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.790 
same way only straight forward and then
hop<00:00:58.199> down<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.710> so

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.110 

okay<00:01:07.800> there's<00:01:08.010> two<00:01:08.220> types<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> drops<00:01:08.850> left

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
okay there's two types of drops left

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.540 
okay there's two types of drops left
pretty<00:01:09.450> much<00:01:09.920> we're<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.190> one<00:01:11.310> called

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
pretty much we're going to do one called

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.030 
pretty much we're going to do one called
a<00:01:11.700> rolling<00:01:12.120> drop<00:01:12.560> which<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> different<00:01:13.890> from

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
a rolling drop which is different from

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
a rolling drop which is different from
rolling<00:01:14.550> hop<00:01:14.820> where<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.510> you<00:01:15.540> stop<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
rolling hop where when you stop you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.470 
rolling hop where when you stop you
actually<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.550> petals<00:01:17.880> parallel<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
actually have your petals parallel and

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.630 
actually have your petals parallel and
you<00:01:18.540> stop<00:01:18.750> pedaling<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.230> hop<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you stop pedaling and hop like on a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.180 
you stop pedaling and hop like on a
stair<00:01:20.910> set<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.230> rolling<00:01:22.470> drop<00:01:22.920> which

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
stair set this is a rolling drop which

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.440 
stair set this is a rolling drop which
means<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.550> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.730> keep<00:01:23.850> pedaling<00:01:24.330> as

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
means you're going to keep pedaling as

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.520 
means you're going to keep pedaling as
you<00:01:24.600> drop<00:01:25.070> which<00:01:26.070> has<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> couple<00:01:26.880> advantages

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
you drop which has a couple advantages

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.570 
you drop which has a couple advantages
the<00:01:28.530> main<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.860> being<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.250> doesn't<00:01:29.490> really

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
the main one being it doesn't really

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.610 
the main one being it doesn't really
matter<00:01:29.760> where<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.150> pedals<00:01:30.480> are<00:01:30.660> when<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
matter where your pedals are when you

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.130 
matter where your pedals are when you
launch<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.310> where<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.150> land<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.780> long<00:01:33.990> as

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
launch and where you land as long as

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
launch and where you land as long as
you're<00:01:34.230> pedaling<00:01:34.710> all<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.280> way<00:01:35.370> down<00:01:35.550> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you're pedaling all the way down you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.000 
you're pedaling all the way down you
will<00:01:35.850> catch<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:36.360> air<00:01:36.600> let's<00:01:37.590> give<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.890> one

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
will catch some air let's give that one

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:50.570 
will catch some air let's give that one
a<00:01:38.040> dry<00:01:48.350> okay<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> fourth<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.860> final<00:01:49.890> drop<00:01:50.370> is

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
a dry okay the fourth and final drop is

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.900 
a dry okay the fourth and final drop is
the<00:01:51.300> rolling<00:01:51.690> hop<00:01:52.370> similar<00:01:53.370> to<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:53.610> i<00:01:53.640> use

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
the rolling hop similar to what i use

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.250 
the rolling hop similar to what i use
and<00:01:53.940> what<00:01:54.180> other<00:01:54.330> people<00:01:54.570> use<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.870> on<00:01:54.990> stair

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
and what other people use like on stair

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.830 
and what other people use like on stair
sets<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:56.700> allows<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.750> bit

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
sets it allows you to get a little bit

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.800 
sets it allows you to get a little bit
further<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.440> more<00:01:58.950> projection<00:01:59.540> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.660> get

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
further out more projection you can get

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.750 
further out more projection you can get
more<00:02:00.930> speed<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
more speed and then as you get to the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.090 
more speed and then as you get to the
edge<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.750> edge<00:02:03.979> hopefully<00:02:04.979> your

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
edge right to the edge hopefully your

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.380 
edge right to the edge hopefully your
cranks<00:02:05.400> are<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:05.670> position<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.180> stop

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
cranks are in the right position is stop

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.669 
cranks are in the right position is stop
pedaling<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.350> pop<00:02:07.890> off<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:09.260> your<00:02:10.260> pedals<00:02:10.560> are

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
pedaling and pop off and your pedals are

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.750 
pedaling and pop off and your pedals are
in<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.830> same<00:02:10.980> position<00:02:11.340> when<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.489> land

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
in the same position when you land

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.910 
in the same position when you land
making<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.270> easier<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.630> roll<00:02:12.750> out<00:02:12.959> let's<00:02:13.739> try

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
making it easier to roll out let's try

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:25.220 
making it easier to roll out let's try
that<00:02:14.040> one

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.330 

alright<00:02:26.230> well<00:02:26.380> those<00:02:26.530> are<00:02:26.650> your<00:02:26.770> four<00:02:26.950> basic

drops I hope that helps some of the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.660 
drops I hope that helps some of the
newer<00:02:29.590> writers<00:02:29.950> out<00:02:30.070> there<00:02:30.130> maybe<00:02:30.460> and
