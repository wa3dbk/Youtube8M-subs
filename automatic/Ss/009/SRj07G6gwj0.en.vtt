you're<00:01:35.280> actually<00:01:35.430> talking<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.299> someone<00:01:36.689> out

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
you're actually talking to someone out

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440

out<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.590> public<00:01:37.740> your<00:01:38.460> hands<00:01:39.000> aren't<00:01:39.180> always

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
out in public your hands aren't always

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.969 
out in public your hands aren't always
in<00:01:39.600> your<00:01:39.780> lap<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.170> you're<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.619> talking<00:01:40.950> like

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
in your lap and you're just talking like

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.740 
in your lap and you're just talking like
this<00:01:41.220> because<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.729> would<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.970> silly<00:01:42.180> but

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
this because that would be silly but

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.499 
this because that would be silly but
instead<00:01:43.590> you're<00:01:44.130> gesturing<00:01:44.579> when<00:01:45.360> you're

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
instead you're gesturing when you're

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.179 
instead you're gesturing when you're
talking<00:01:45.899> maybe<00:01:46.290> you're<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.560> pointing<00:01:47.070> at

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
talking maybe you're not pointing at

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.950 
talking maybe you're not pointing at
anything<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.570> arms<00:01:48.840> are

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
anything but you know what your arms are

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.289 
anything but you know what your arms are
moving<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.310> could<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> realistic

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
moving and and that could be a realistic

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.939 
moving and and that could be a realistic
portion<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.930> well<00:01:52.700> give<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.909> try
