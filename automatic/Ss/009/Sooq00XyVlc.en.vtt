it like with the upgrades of all the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.600 
it like with the upgrades of all the
other<00:01:22.380> systems<00:01:22.770> were<00:01:22.860> having<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
other systems were having and there is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.050 
other systems were having and there is
no<00:01:23.939> MP<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:25.409> inferior<00:01:25.770> system<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
no MP not inferior system but but you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
no MP not inferior system but but you
know<00:01:27.150> all<00:01:27.479> systems<00:01:28.020> pretty<00:01:28.500> much<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.799> going

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
know all systems pretty much are going

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.760 
know all systems pretty much are going
to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.189> equal<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.840> think<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.350> important<00:01:31.740> for

on it and i think the ipad could almost
do<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> same<00:02:49.019> thing<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:51.030> totally<00:02:51.300> well<00:02:51.660> n<00:02:51.840> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
do the same thing it totally well n and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.930 
do the same thing it totally well n and
it's<00:02:52.470> not<00:02:52.650> something<00:02:52.860> necessarily<00:02:53.130> specific

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
it's not something necessarily specific

it's not something necessarily specific
though<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> little<00:02:55.050> more<00:02:55.230> baked<00:02:55.470> into

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
though it is a little more baked into
