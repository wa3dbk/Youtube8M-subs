00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.490 
images um however works fine it's not
the<00:03:27.890> best<00:03:28.490> mod<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.630> think<00:03:29.960> this<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.140> this

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
the best mod but I think this is this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.770 
the best mod but I think this is this
guy's<00:03:30.800> first<00:03:31.130> mod<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.850> for<00:03:32.060> his<00:03:32.180> first<00:03:32.480> mod

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
guy's first mod and for his first mod

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.460 
guy's first mod and for his first mod
this<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.350> great<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:34.720> plus<00:03:35.720> it's<00:03:35.750> also<00:03:36.110> very

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470

favorite cuz like it can't go up

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.210 
favorite cuz like it can't go up
anything<00:04:05.450> but<00:04:06.019> it<00:04:06.260> works<00:04:06.530> for<00:04:06.650> flat<00:04:07.010> lands

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
anything but it works for flat lands

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.880 
anything but it works for flat lands
just<00:04:07.519> fun<00:04:08.000> oh<00:04:10.840> let's<00:04:11.840> see<00:04:12.110> what<00:04:12.350> else<00:04:12.380> there

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
just fun oh let's see what else there

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.970 
just fun oh let's see what else there
speedboat<00:04:13.810> this<00:04:14.810> one's<00:04:15.140> probably<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.739> best

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
speedboat this one's probably the best

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.100 
speedboat this one's probably the best
in<00:04:16.190> my<00:04:16.370> opinion<00:04:17.530> I'll<00:04:18.530> cry<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:18.919> up<00:04:20.769> back<00:04:21.769> here

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
in my opinion I'll cry it up back here

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.870 
in my opinion I'll cry it up back here
as<00:04:24.110> you<00:04:24.380> see<00:04:24.410> it's<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.830> very<00:04:24.860> fast<00:04:25.610> on<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:28.460> crash

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
as you see it's a very fast on to crash

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.940 
as you see it's a very fast on to crash
it<00:04:29.210> gives<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.480> all<00:04:29.570> your<00:04:29.720> material<00:04:30.260> or<00:04:30.470> most

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
it gives you all your material or most

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.140 
it gives you all your material or most
of<00:04:31.160> them<00:04:31.280> i<00:04:31.400> should<00:04:31.610> say<00:04:33.520> but<00:04:34.520> it's<00:04:34.820> really

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
of them i should say but it's really

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.690 
of them i should say but it's really
hard<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.539> crash<00:04:35.780> this

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.850 

but<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:43.510> get<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.690> point<00:04:43.990> I'll<00:04:44.320> crash<00:04:44.650> the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
but you get the point I'll crash the

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.220 
but you get the point I'll crash the
helicopter<00:04:45.430> for<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.730> guys<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.780> as<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.050> see

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
helicopter for you guys and as you see

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.610 
helicopter for you guys and as you see
it<00:04:50.320> gives<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:50.620> most<00:04:50.890> your<00:04:51.100> resources<00:04:51.520> back

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
it gives you most your resources back

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.570 
it gives you most your resources back
the<00:04:53.620> helicopter<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:55.200> probably<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:57.310> best

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
the helicopter is probably the best

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.220 
the helicopter is probably the best
worked<00:04:58.000> out<00:04:58.240> this<00:04:58.540> one<00:04:58.750> you<00:04:58.870> have<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.020> go<00:04:59.170> to

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
worked out this one you have to go to

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.930 
worked out this one you have to go to
third<00:04:59.470> person<00:04:59.890> for<00:05:00.160> or<00:05:00.310> else<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.580> doesn't<00:05:00.730> work

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
third person for or else it doesn't work

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.560 
third person for or else it doesn't work
very<00:05:01.000> well<00:05:04.680> it's<00:05:05.880> supposed<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.970> be<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.120> German

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
very well it's supposed to be a German

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.220 
very well it's supposed to be a German
helicopter<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:09.190> think<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.300> icon<00:05:10.900> looks<00:05:11.140> a

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
helicopter and I think that icon looks a

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.200 
helicopter and I think that icon looks a
bit<00:05:11.410> like<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:11.800> 10th<00:05:12.010> prestige<00:05:12.250> God<00:05:12.730> forearm

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
bit like the 10th prestige God forearm

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.150 
bit like the 10th prestige God forearm
bone<00:05:13.450> but<00:05:15.690> it's<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:16.810> good<00:05:17.230> helicopter<00:05:17.470> the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
bone but it's a good helicopter the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.890 
bone but it's a good helicopter the
rotor<00:05:18.430> definitely<00:05:19.000> does<00:05:19.120> not<00:05:19.150> fit<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.690> and

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
rotor definitely does not fit it and

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.430 
rotor definitely does not fit it and
yeah<00:05:20.230> it<00:05:20.350> crashes<00:05:20.890> really<00:05:21.430> easily<00:05:21.790> which

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
yeah it crashes really easily which

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.800 
yeah it crashes really easily which
makes<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.590> good
