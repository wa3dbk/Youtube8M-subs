essentially what it does is allows any
sort<00:05:32.370> of<00:05:32.400> rivers<00:05:32.789> and<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.419> know<00:05:33.479> stream<00:05:33.900> like

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
sort of rivers and you know stream like

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.379 
sort of rivers and you know stream like
water<00:05:34.650> features<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.580> all<00:05:35.760> move<00:05:36.030> in<00:05:36.210> one

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
water features to all move in one

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.600 
water features to all move in one
direction<00:05:36.570> with<00:05:37.080> a<00:05:37.110> certain<00:05:37.530> current<00:05:37.740> so<00:05:38.430> the

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
direction with a certain current so the

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.250 
direction with a certain current so the
way<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:38.760> did<00:05:39.000> that<00:05:39.030> I<00:05:39.360> kind<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:39.930> know<00:05:40.050> have

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
way I did that I kind of you know have

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.870 
way I did that I kind of you know have
these<00:05:40.380> guys<00:05:40.650> spawn<00:05:41.130> in<00:05:41.280> with<00:05:41.370> command<00:05:41.639> blocks

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
these guys spawn in with command blocks

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.330 
these guys spawn in with command blocks
in<00:05:42.030> boats<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.660> AI<00:05:42.810> is<00:05:42.990> turned<00:05:43.410> off<00:05:43.710> so

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
in boats and the AI is turned off so

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.040 
in boats and the AI is turned off so
much<00:05:44.580> like<00:05:44.820> if<00:05:45.030> you<00:05:45.270> were<00:05:45.389> to<00:05:45.539> go<00:05:45.660> in<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:45.840> boat

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
much like if you were to go in a boat

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.810 
much like if you were to go in a boat
you<00:05:46.320> don't<00:05:46.710> actually<00:05:46.889> do<00:05:47.160> any<00:05:47.430> steering

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
you don't actually do any steering

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.540 
you don't actually do any steering
whatsoever<00:05:48.539> and<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.260> current<00:05:49.620> what<00:05:50.340> did<00:05:50.460> I

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
whatsoever and the current what did I

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.760 
whatsoever and the current what did I
just<00:05:50.580> drop<00:05:50.880> you<00:05:51.510> know<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:51.780> current<00:05:52.110> goes<00:05:52.409> from

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
just drop you know the current goes from

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.580 
just drop you know the current goes from
A<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.010> B<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:54.539> will<00:05:54.690> take<00:05:54.960> you<00:05:55.200> you<00:05:55.470> know

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
A to B and it will take you you know

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.260 
A to B and it will take you you know
along<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:55.950> stream<00:05:56.280> so<00:05:56.490> it's<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.729> really<00:05:57.030> really

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
along the stream so it's a really really

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.460 
along the stream so it's a really really
good<00:05:57.479> way<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.659> move

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
good way to move

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.950 
good way to move
across<00:05:58.950> water<00:05:59.250> and<00:05:59.640> it's<00:06:00.360> pretty<00:06:00.510> damn<00:06:00.690> cool

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
across water and it's pretty damn cool

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.710 
across water and it's pretty damn cool
as<00:06:01.110> well<00:06:01.260> I<00:06:01.290> think<00:06:01.460> so<00:06:02.460> as<00:06:02.670> well<00:06:02.880> as<00:06:02.910> that<00:06:03.480> if

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
as well I think so as well as that if

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.300 
as well I think so as well as that if
you<00:06:03.870> also<00:06:04.020> want<00:06:04.260> to<00:06:04.290> check<00:06:04.500> out<00:06:04.680> this<00:06:04.830> biome

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
you also want to check out this biome

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.670 
you also want to check out this biome
