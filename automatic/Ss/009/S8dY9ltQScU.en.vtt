00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.650
 without doubt the absence of an entry 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.309
 hdmi on the camera becomes something 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.870
 relatively negative and another point 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.860
 negative too that I could perceive 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.670
 this camera is that she feed it 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.760
 by batteries and so some users can 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.180
 opt for the battery instead of the battery 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.490
 but here's a tip in the case of some 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.340
 long-term events 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.129
 if you buy some product or the thesis 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.940
 even this camera and powered by 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.149
 pyre 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.820
 you can take spare batteries is 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.300
 together with your camera and when 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.620
 these charged batteries are 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.039
 quickly change and continue to pull 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.510
 photos and making videos 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.510

 cloudy but stabilizing images 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.590
 the camera is very good 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.869

 It is forbidden to shower in this place. 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:04.350

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.539
