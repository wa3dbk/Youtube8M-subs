00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.379
 Hello dear friends with you otin 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.920
 Today I will review the mod as you 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.359
 probably expected minecraft 176 yes yes 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.020
 today is our ninth of april and came out 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.619
 minecraft 176 we all waited one 1.8 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.899
 but came out 1.7.6 to make sure that you 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.450
 I did not cheat on f3 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.100
 as you see in the upper right in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.270
 the upper left is written crafting 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.730
 action 6 is not much what they are 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.550
 plainly and did not make this into this 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.950
 update the main thing is that they made 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.539
 these are skins and name changes 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.399
 and some options let me tell you 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.800
 more about skins 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.350
 they changed the server side errors 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.410
 about throwing off the color light information 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.719
 them to a minimum that is the server will be 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.450
 see your skins and sometimes you know how you are 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.539
 when you go to the server you can see 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.119
 just that move it carry that is 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.920
 minimized it later change 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.569
 skin no longer requires restart 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.109
 restart the client and you can just 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:21.389
 restart the menu and then go again 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.609
 on the server and iskin will change later 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:25.200
 removed repeat well and download the same 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.149
 skins and siberian can not be 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.389
 repeatedly for example can not run 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.039
 acted chic only with different nicknames 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:33.359
 still 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.279
 server traffic consumption has been reduced 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.649
 to a minimum is also a very good thing as 

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:39.719
 in theory, it should be much less lag 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.950
 then name change 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:46.109
 This is added but it will work with 1.8 then 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.719
 there is it not so simple to say 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.739
 predicted something or made us understand 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.270
 what will be exactly in 1.8 that is, as long as 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.429
 but only I myself support 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.039
 change nick full feature 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.139
 will work with version 1.8 we will be able to change 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.109
 some we used jungle then 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:06.070
 there are pirates fly by but basically like 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.520
 fly by themselves can change 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.210
 and options is the minimum value of the function 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.970
 f in 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.520
 or fov who calls as changed to 30a 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.230
 It was 70 I honestly do not know what it is but I 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.850
 I think that maykravt not so stupid 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.180
 companies and janka faces 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.850
 that will do something that will worsen 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.890
 our game in general is probably all that I am 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.310
 wanted to say about this update of course 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.110
 we expected more likely but but how 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.360
 says the gift horse in the mouth is not 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.490
 look like me too because of him 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.070
 It does not even seem to lag honestly 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.989
 became less and although it can with each 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.160
 version of me so clean some bikes 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.440
 but it is no longer considered as though 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.560
 additions are just fixes so 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.760
 say in general everyone thanks for watching
