00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.939
 based on the practice of caring for men's land in dividing surpluses 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.989
 permaculture is already used today by more than 10,000 people worldwide. 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.070
 roofs used in this practice 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.410
 is the living roof or green roof 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 weighted lawn like this one is where we are 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.970
 I know you up on a wooden structure you do intermediation 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.750
 you get replanted nor general 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.160
 a plant that does not want to go deeper 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.700
 being another story good 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.610
 is one of the advantages is that we have very good thermal increase this summer 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.340
 roof that traditionally Russian of Scandinavia 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.200
 but very cold parents beside cold or hot secluded heat but Lusa lamented 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.190
 same 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.890
 so you have a construction 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.350
 it's on a living roof that you 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.979
 I have a contract and I want to keep it. 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.979
 arthur mud walls so better still 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.790
 yesterday the actions of the white house 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.650
 here a cultural center not devaluing to five years this 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.430
 mechanism 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.440
 Where do you live with your partner at the end? 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.290
 it will take that people use the system all or state to rain we are with 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 song was composed per cent per year and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 filipe this 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.630
 chambers of commerce companies that collect water from the state 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.110
 running water through a gutter v 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.420
 is stored requiring parking 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.450
 today we have the storage capacity of 110 thousand liters 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.930
 attention to the situation of rebuilding more points to reach the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.100
 50 thousand liters the system is well done 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.460
 we made a goat live on that road and rolled up mud that runs through 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.040
 she 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 the search for these bullets here 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.090
 then passes through this filter is a mechanical filter debate the question is 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.380
 to hold the coarse particles of the pair 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.410
 area and organic matter 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.249
 the technique we use is the iron cement 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.389
 this is a handmade technique known in the management by armed action blackout 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.169
 we use this technique because anyone can do it need 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.269
 be a bricklayer 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.369
 so this will cost a lot 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.369
 in addition to it we can afford large storage capacity 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.259
 it consists of using an iron mesh 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:32.199
 strong cement contract and there are a lot of people to do it looks like people here 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.159
 Friday not to show 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.159
 but if here 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.849
 We can build tanks with a capacity of up to 300 thousand liters. 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:40.729
 small bomb 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.629
 it took for it to filter 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.510
 which is the charcoal filter gravel and sand 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.069
 it's been a long time coming down the floor 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.419
 is filtered and stored in that box of minors 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.279
 of the carton was distributed by gravity 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.499
 then all the energy that is spent is only this from here to the bread 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.729
 insomnia is a very little energy tender 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.449
 who today do not get to win generating a bill of light do what you 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:07.849
 they see it runs down the floor 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.579
 arrives with this quality that reinforces its 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.949
 and I keep myself during the dry season than in the minutes with this 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.659
 water only she from the rain 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.580
 the water left good quality heartache it usually the city but like now 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.870
 even with a tiny bit of limestone on the bottom of the reservoir you neutralize 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.239
 that 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.730
 and is a good montra consumption
