00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.380
 hello today job information 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.370
 with the wing on the prior means for this 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:19.630
 I put the moment easily from the general 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:24.430
 what white destination do you see here 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:28.840
 further means that I will continue to stack 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:32.349
 two layers of glass veils one layer 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.940
 150 glass mats and one layer 300 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:44.710
 glass mat I will indicate all this 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:49.000
 roller now take a closer look here 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:57.670
 book poem laval immediately 2 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:05.259
 I have two such flaps so huge 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 so to speak, then it means ready 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:20.170
 ready this is a cycle of 150 and glass mat 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:28.270
 300 here they are the difference noticeable date here 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:32.890
 hand you can see it here it is practically 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.320
 the hand is not visible and I will continue to use 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.439
 Here's a spoon spoon for resin 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:43.720
 divorced here may be required here 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:48.670
 so a curved brush gloves 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:52.479
 and a respirator means here that by the matrix 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.049
 so here what are the nuances in the well 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.180
 first here there inside here here 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:03.729
 little corner yes then he's here by stamping 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.399
 here they are 1 2 3 4 and here it is just 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.790
 wand which is here and in them pretty 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.580
 it will be difficult to lay 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.590
 material to those corners and here still 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.380
 corners 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:23.650
 here is a corner 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:28.470
 and so would remove so on because the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.470
 here is the corner here it is here here 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.640
 that's all you need to beat means 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:44.290
 how do I want to do that is i still 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:49.989
 I will breed with resin means power 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:53.599
 I will make a mush here is this Sarah forces and 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:59.590
 neatly these places under smooth all 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:02.180
 angles after that i will put 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.849
 it means a layer of glass veil 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.760
 but I will only lay the veil on 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.970
 the front surface that is here in this 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.389
 part will not come here 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.290
 then I will not come here either 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:21.590
 I will not go with two layers in these parts 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.099
 I'll get a glass mat to put it here. 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:31.760
 glass mat that's all neatly 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:37.190
 I roll a roller that's the principle so far all 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:41.540
 I'll take off something 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.370
 getting to work you are so continuing 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.940
 work on the wing 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:53.239
 you can see it means applied aerosil 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:57.199
 here here with resin ga leveled 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:01.989
 be all the bumps and angles by 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:01.989
 opportunities here too 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.910
 on this way 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.420
 here 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.740
 here 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.740
 now proceed to the laying of glass is not 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:55.460
 it means so here is the wing 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:57.990
 I mean spent laying the material 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.630
 impregnated with polyester resin total 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.750
 destination 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.580
 manufacturer firm kristik here again 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.720
 I repeat 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:12.630
 two layers of glass wore out one layer 150 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.990
 glass mat and the second layer 300 glass mat 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:21.620
 all this rolled roller that is here 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.620
 Now at the moment such a picture 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.720
 tried to roll everything carefully 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:50.590
 the word say i first do you wing 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:55.030
 by the way 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.030
 bubble noticed 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:10.969
 first doing wing and so later 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.819
 I will correct the bubble is not fast for me 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:20.840
 everything worked out for everything about everything for me 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:24.919
 gone somewhere for two and a half hours that here 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:32.270
 it took about two hours well 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:40.509
 gone see the result will continue 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:44.349
 apparently stay in touch 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.349
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
