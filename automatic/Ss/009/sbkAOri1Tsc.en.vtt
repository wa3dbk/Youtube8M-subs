now<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.760> mcpoyle<00:00:02.760> is<00:00:03.540> going<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.110> start<00:00:04.410> so<00:00:05.040> we

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
now the mcpoyle is going to start so we

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.670 
now the mcpoyle is going to start so we
have<00:00:05.279> filled<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.609> muck<00:00:05.759> inside<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.359> cone<00:00:06.680> so

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
have filled the muck inside this cone so

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.720 
have filled the muck inside this cone so
look<00:00:07.859> at<00:00:08.040> your<00:00:08.280> design<00:00:09.059> sample<00:00:10.400> and<00:00:11.400> start

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
look at your design sample and start

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.169 
look at your design sample and start
doing<00:00:12.120> them<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:13.170> perfect<00:00:13.969> okay

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
doing them but perfect okay

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
doing them but perfect okay
before<00:00:15.900> starting<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.770> if<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.100> flow<00:00:17.310> of

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
before starting to see if the flow of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.370 
before starting to see if the flow of
the<00:00:17.609> map<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.970> proper<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.510> sell-off<00:00:18.900> both<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
the map is proper you sell-off both a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.859 
the map is proper you sell-off both a
little<00:00:19.560> slot<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:21.150> test<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.689> you're

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
little slot like this and test if you're

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.279 
little slot like this and test if you're
able<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.980> continuous<00:00:23.519> lines<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.119> her

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
able to do continuous lines with her

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.439 
able to do continuous lines with her
work<00:00:25.289> -<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.189> test<00:00:26.430> your<00:00:26.640> consistency<00:00:27.269> of

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
work - just to test your consistency of

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.310 
work - just to test your consistency of
rock<00:00:27.900> work<00:00:28.109> okay<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.730> now<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.060> fine<00:00:30.359> now<00:00:30.630> so

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
rock work okay so now it's fine now so

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:42.470 
rock work okay so now it's fine now so
I'm<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> mock<00:00:32.279> work<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:41.480> don't

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
I'm going to do the mock work here don't

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
I'm going to do the mock work here don't
worry<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> mock<00:00:43.230> work<00:00:43.469> goes<00:00:43.710> wrong<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
worry if the mock work goes wrong it is

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.299 
worry if the mock work goes wrong it is
water-soluble<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.289> even<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> goes<00:00:47.010> wrong

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
water-soluble so even if it goes wrong

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.819 
water-soluble so even if it goes wrong
you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.640> rub<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.879> off<00:00:48.239> while<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.320> still<00:00:49.410> wet

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you can rub it off while it's still wet

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.020 
you can rub it off while it's still wet
or<00:00:50.700> even<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.300> dries<00:00:51.800> we<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.980> use<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
or even if it dries we can use the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.260 
or even if it dries we can use the
cotton<00:00:54.270> bud<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> toothpick<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.270> wet

cotton bud or a toothpick and just wet

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.049 
cotton bud or a toothpick and just wet
it<00:00:57.300> leave<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.859> minute<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.820> then<00:00:59.910> if

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it leave it on for a minute and then if

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
it leave it on for a minute and then if
you<00:01:00.180> remove<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> toothpick<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.590> comes

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you remove it with a toothpick it comes

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.830 
you remove it with a toothpick it comes
off<00:01:02.070> easily<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:04.760> not<00:01:05.760> only<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.330> mock<00:01:06.540> work

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
off easily so not only this mock work

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.109 
off easily so not only this mock work
anything<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.549> redone<00:01:08.970> or

anything in this can be redone or

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.399 
anything in this can be redone or
corrected<00:01:09.630> except<00:01:10.500> sticking<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> stones

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
corrected except sticking the stones

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.780 
corrected except sticking the stones
because<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.590> stones<00:01:13.920> yes<00:01:14.250> taken<00:01:14.610> using

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
because these stones yes taken using

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.679 
because these stones yes taken using
ferry<00:01:15.570> call<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.450> possible<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> be

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
ferry call so that is not possible to be

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.719 
ferry call so that is not possible to be
undone<00:01:19.170> okay<00:01:20.060> except<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.270> anything<00:01:21.780> else

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
try on a new boarder okay that fear will

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.819 
try on a new boarder okay that fear will
stop<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.930> from<00:01:40.850> moving<00:01:41.850> further<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.500> don't

just<00:01:46.500> start<00:01:46.740> working<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.680> can<00:01:49.680> turn<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
just start working on it I can turn the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.530 
just start working on it I can turn the
board<00:01:51.020> because<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:53.579> might<00:01:53.790> accidentally

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
board because you might accidentally

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and remember one more thing should

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.530 
and remember one more thing should
always<00:02:00.960> work<00:02:01.409> from<00:02:01.799> top<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> bottom<00:02:02.540> because

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
always work from top to bottom because

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.020 
always work from top to bottom because

when I am working in this part my hands

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.749 
when I am working in this part my hands
will<00:02:06.180> touch<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.990> bottom<00:02:07.380> part<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.399> doesn't

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
will touch the bottom part so it doesn't

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.070 
will touch the bottom part so it doesn't
matter<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.239> when<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> am<00:02:09.539> working<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
going back to the top part what will

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.910 
going back to the top part what will
happen<00:02:15.599> is<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.900> might<00:02:16.110> disturb<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> design

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
happen is I might disturb the design

into the foil wall or if you want some
more<00:02:33.720> depth<00:02:34.079> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.680> let<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.189> dry<00:02:35.519> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
more depth you can let this dry and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.360 
more depth you can let this dry and
start<00:02:36.510> filling<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.109> areas<00:02:37.439> in<00:02:37.470> between<00:02:37.859> these

second layer over the already given

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.460 
second layer over the already given
marker<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.880> give<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.390> first<00:03:48.630> layer<00:03:48.930> let<00:03:49.320> it

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
marker just give the first layer let it

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.530 
marker just give the first layer let it
dry<00:03:49.710> and<00:03:49.980> then<00:03:50.550> highlight<00:03:50.820> like<00:03:51.240> this

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
dry and then highlight like this

dry and then highlight like this
highlight<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.050> outlines<00:03:53.300> using<00:03:54.300> thin<00:03:54.570> lines

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
highlight the outlines using thin lines

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.010

so<00:03:55.710> that<00:03:55.890> when<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.220> do<00:03:56.460> the<00:03:56.670> foil<00:03:57.330> work<00:03:57.720> over

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
so that when you do the foil work over

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.150 
so that when you do the foil work over
this<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:59.370> will<00:03:59.490> get<00:03:59.610> embossed<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.770> give<00:04:01.770> you<00:04:01.950> a

this it will get embossed and give you a

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.690 
this it will get embossed and give you a
three-dimensional<00:04:03.090> finish<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:05.250> giving<00:04:05.580> the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
three-dimensional finish so giving the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.700 
three-dimensional finish so giving the
first<00:04:05.880> level<00:04:06.330> alone<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.810> leaving<00:04:07.380> it<00:04:07.500> like

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
first level alone and leaving it like

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.260 
first level alone and leaving it like
that<00:04:08.120> will<00:04:09.120> make<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.480> look<00:04:09.690> very<00:04:09.870> blunt
