00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.380
 halli hello my dear and sincere 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.569
 Welcome back to a new episode 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.849
 red bull racing experience this time 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.290
 again with the inscription ipad 2 the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.519
 not really texting for anything outside it 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.049
 Also, you were interested in it like that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.030
 that's how it works and how it works 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.830
 after a bit einstein the graphic 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.480
 and a state parameter 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.130
 steam set everything has no problem 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.960
 and it works really well 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.279
 I say I had to downsize the graphic 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.710
 screw and still have during the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 recording no constant 75ps though 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 i like him without taking 140 or 30 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.920
 So that's what it's all about for me 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.260
 still relatively little sense 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280
 assetto corse consuming the recording 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 I do not have that much anyway 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.239
 constant 570 ps I do not know why 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.040
 I do not have to look that we're there 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.300
 Change something so you get from the outside 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.110
 have a nice have the ford mustang 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.520
 gt dtm and the beautiful is that me 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.500
 now you can use the buttons 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.610
 although in this ok swift camera 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.140
 in there is then right to left 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.489
 and back works anyway and here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.809
 we can be so beautiful 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.469
 umgucken but I want to say we are lying 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.469
 right here 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.230
 because the game is already enough for me 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.460
 a few times crashed because of the optics 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.180
 probably because otherwise no 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.290
 crashes are there and accordingly yes 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.720
 we have to see that was somehow 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.860
 quickly you drive through a bit 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.840
 can so that ye few round 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.790
 can and can show that is 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 I work well while driving 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.930
 can even just respond to that yes 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 update came out is a pretty 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.850
 great curiosity so has to download 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.229
 and that was really awesome 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.119
 everything is there now is the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.720
 chain server there is now one 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.030
 Transmission model a flexible 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.680
 drivetrain, so to speak, too 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.110
 is simulated acoustically so to speak, the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.850
 ranger then so if the enemy okay 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.970
 I wanted to pursue it because it was 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.380
 once when you give gas you dessin 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.590
 Ground waves on the street 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.859
 microphones then you hear the power again 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.930
 not completely on the floor and then 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:02.009
 this 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.009
 that would sound like that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.880
 I can not describe it that accurately 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.260
 but the drivetrain is on everyone 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.890
 case flexible yes then she gave up 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.250
 small reminder what driving physics of the eu 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.270
 or the ki 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.380
 Of course all the vehicles were on 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.710
 this new transmission system 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.710
 customized 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.650
 By the way, are on the hungaroring 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.519
 on the way on the grand prix track 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.540
 defended by racing but that 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.170
 does not seem to work with me yet 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.870
 inscription I know I have it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.299
 grad not shown as menus and so 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.680
 further are not complete yet 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.700
 that means if we do that 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.689
 Now look at us I know so 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.220
 escape press jawoll 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.359
 and then the game is in pause mode 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.950
 I can stay here without it 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.120
 look and have quasi meter and always so 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.400
 easily shimmer through the cockpit 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.629
 but the menus are unfortunately not as 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.790
 could still be with the mouse somewhere 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.189
 and look but that makes everything 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.189
 still little sense so and so 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:08.010
 we just keep 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.450
 So so really suitable for the whole 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.709
 not yet not yourself 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.720
 Optimized that just so fast 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.159
 Implementation that you hold it 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.709
 can do and that works 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.859
 really good I have to say a nice 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.669
 feeling for the track and the vehicle very much 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.669
 nice drift around 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.689
 graphically looks very natural 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.430
 a bit mau from that is now synonymous 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.159
 owed only to the spontaneous attitude 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.139
 I had to do that a bit 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.650
 Fine tuning I can tell you can be determined 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.650
 rausholen more 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.349
 too fast in the curve driven in too 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.130
 slowed down late 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.250
 of course, the route is stupid 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.840
 completely unknown to me 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.190
 of course, no sense directly 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.190
 to venture already on here 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.629
 we still try with the ki 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.629
 keep up here 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.129
 it has stopped again, yes 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.719
 I just had that I want the whole thing 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.719
 Just start again and then we turn 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.799
 again, of course, annoying 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:18.130
 new game new luck we are still sitting 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.810
 again in patterns and there they come 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.340
 first partly out of the box, yes me 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.310
 I hope so how can we possibly 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.810
 drive a two-round longer 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.000
 but if that's all the time now 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.070
 it will be a short crash 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.660
 it would not be great for a long time 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.160
 try it differently 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.539
 I have already in the forum 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.770
 read in the sector forum that often 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.770
 Crashes are with the writing 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.880
 but maybe we will at least come 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.850
 a few rounds without mastering and fan 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.080
 and graduate and maybe again 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.820
 a bit of a mercedes of it and 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.710
 Fighting edge would have bock 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.840
 then see vehicles from up close with 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.410
 so much detail yes ok route knowledge 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.410
 would be of advantage 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.340
 of course as always with the logitech the 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:19.810
 they 20 traveling without driving aids on 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:23.430
 generally manual switch between 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.430
 gases everything off 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.330
 the new suspension was part heard 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.580
 noises there is new suspension 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.570
 Noise is a bit like now 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.990
 if they cover you more 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.990
 so to speak 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.890
 but sounds really pure in general 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.180
 were yes with the update a lot 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.570
 things are improved and attacked 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.710
 Dedicated server is now available 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.600
 I have already said, the menu 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.790
 has been cleaned up since there is no now 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.110
 change more between these customers 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.070
 menus and this dig menus but yes 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.590
 that all looks a bit now 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.940
 we are much more united 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.940
 these villigsters are still late 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.940
 inside annoying annoying not good 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:44.680
 that's all clear so sharp 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.680
 out 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.050
 and then it stopped again 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.479
 exactly the same then okay then 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.949
 sets the rather live from here before it 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.270
 even before I get sick, yes 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.460
 Of course you are not seeing anything right now 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.960
 the annoyingly unemployed more beautiful like that 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.580
 the advisory board is working it works 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.139
 well we have let's see how good 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.270
 will work permanently if then 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.340
 sometimes the game from the beta outside 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.330
 is and so on, that's all 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.470
 not right now 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.850
 requirements for testing but 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.830
 we have to see how it works in 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.600
 future the beginning is already done 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.590
 but the running but not optimal 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.520
 and I would also be honest 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.940
 just a little bit bad I know 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.470
 not why 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.370
 Well, how does the next episode 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.370
 good bye bye
