locks<00:03:20.980> as<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.489> need<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:22.030> make<00:03:22.329> sure<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.660> you

braids around my head like a beehive
sometimes<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.650> takes<00:03:32.859> longer<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.489> than

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
sometimes it takes longer to do than

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.460 
sometimes it takes longer to do than
others<00:03:34.000> which<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.599> why<00:03:34.720> I'm<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.049> speed

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
others which is why I'm going to speed

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.259 
others which is why I'm going to speed
up<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.799> next<00:03:36.130> section<00:03:36.310> because<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.120> could

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
up this next section because it could

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.610 
up this next section because it could
take<00:03:37.389> me<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.569> while<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.870> get<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:38.079> exactly<00:03:38.500> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
take me a while to get it exactly the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.379 
take me a while to get it exactly the
way<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.889> want<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:39.790> once<00:03:40.000> I've<00:03:40.209> done

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
way that I want it but once I've done

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.300 
way that I want it but once I've done
that<00:03:40.450> then<00:03:41.260> you'll<00:03:41.530> see<00:03:41.709> what<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:41.919> looks<00:03:42.099> like

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
that then you'll see what it looks like

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.609 
that then you'll see what it looks like
