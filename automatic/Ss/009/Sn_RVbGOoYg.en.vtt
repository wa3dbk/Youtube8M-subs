00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.120
 and no need for a hood there is always the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.210
 hate to chords that repeats itself for me 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.849
 the song and there are three barrel chords 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.210
 but I know at this fund are not very 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:26.210
 complicated so here to cut them off or 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 7.1 F sharp minor C sharp minor 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.050
 shoe 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.050
 six miners 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.330
 mimouni everything 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:46.160
 and there no price there is the chorus missed 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.899
 their front is favor of the minor do 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.360
 sharp minor 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.360
 F sharp minor of diesel 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.920
 Yes 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 stop and I cross rsu ce2 with the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.970
 last empty ropes 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.539
 and then you have the interlude where he does 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:22.600
 often there agreements it's a there a do 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.390
 sharp minor there 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.729
 C sharp minor towards the folder 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.729
 half-hour fa sharp minor 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.439
 finally people start beyond 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:42.520
 odiennÃ© the raddho sharp minor the fa 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.640
 sharp sharp do sharp minor arrives and 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.700
 wealth 2 whose technique at all 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.070
 start actually they use a piano 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.920
 so when for the first verse is 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.490
 the first at the bottom makes you valves 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.490
 like that 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.410
 so here and after at the second verse 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.319
 he will add the guitar and so at this 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.330
 moment there you will stall yourself on the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.890
 rhythm of the guitar in fact and so the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.200
 rhythmic it's a little different from 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:34.320
 fit and his low bao bao bao small bar 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.970
 in bar the little bass and the three bases 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:47.810
 so the a65 and that at that moment I repeat 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.810
 bao bao pao small bar in bar 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.730

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.460
