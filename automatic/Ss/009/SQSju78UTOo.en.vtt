00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.939
 intense match that is expected this Saturday in the annexes of the hill in 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.120
 the shock that is going to measure aranda album with smoke harbingers and that is 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.780
 the appeal of the provincial derby joins what is at stake nothing more and nothing 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.399
 less than the permanence 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:17.140
 the set of avellaneda that match very much needed points since it 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.499
 find bottom with just one point in your locker 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.169
 in the last day the rock of aranda fell clearly before the wolf 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.729
 segovia by 42 8 in a match marked by the poor start of the ribereños 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.970
 it's not the virtues and the shortcomings that said that honda 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.680
 is having this year 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.910
 on the one hand 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.070
 the virtues that we are technically improving we are a team and has confessed 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 years that goes to structure team work 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.370
 by the way that plus the defects the flaws is that 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.360
 we do not know yet to have a competitive mentality 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.450
 more than in the world contributing that you enter ten minutes before the game and 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.910
 be in the party 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.390
 and we're late, the kids did not know how to concentrate, maybe not a 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.120
 work of the board or coaches of 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.770
 to warm up well 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.450
 and we entered deconcentrated 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.780
 before the university of burglars riggers the theft of sand is played 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.040
 great part of its options of permanence 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.400
 the riverside are last with a point while the team of the capital is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.420
 ninth with 3 so everything that is not a victory of the trained set 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.180
 by walter salazar would leave the aranda with a foot and a half in second 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.880
 for this reason from the ribereña entity the support of the hobby is requested yes for that reason 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.780
 we would like despite the climate of tension 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 that we were world 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.630
 We have the support of your family and friends who are usually hearing I do not know 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.400
 what 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.070
 surprisingly we are in an assistant between 50 and 100 people at 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.660
 rugby matches 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.340
 but merchant a derby knowing what we play all the aids and all the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.500
 present that by going to encourage them I put special thanks 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.920
 From the technical standpoint they emphasize to repeat the performances of 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.179
 previous days 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.179
 The team's gift has come out with very little intensity since the beginning 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.520
 one of the keys to have the triumph will be in the concentration from the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.500
 initial beep and in the contribution of veteran players since walter 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.340
 salazar will be able to count on his entire staff they already have 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.750
 a depth 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.340
 already before other teams that yes there was a routine of concentration and is what 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.129
 they do is repeat that routine 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.469
 with which to do them what they do is that the kids 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.040
 describe themselves we look a little at that routine and therefore that concentration 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.919
 in or are all the work of these veterans in the field yes no the arq lo 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.709
 vital that is how they manage to put the rest of the team in competition 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.939
 we depend on us first that's fundamental is not that we depend on that 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.709
 other equipment pinchen depend on that finally those defects that you commented 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.479
 is exceeded 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.919
 Well, starting to look for that competitiveness and that concentration that 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.639
 what we need because these kids there are great players 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.809
 but let's not say maybe they have caught with so little time three years 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.419
 in an evolution we have by dispossession 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.929
 and those who cross to know how to wear for santa enter that concentration and be 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:06.989
 competitive against a pole
