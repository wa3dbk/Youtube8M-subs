00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:07.279
 of robotics 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.019
 the cpem trial 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.490

 we have to stop it we can not 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.810
 I know everything about robotics we can be a lot 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.590
 more someone else wants to get on that thing 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.590
 I do not ask for more 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.760

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.660
 carbon the armor could affect the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.660
