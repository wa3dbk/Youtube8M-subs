kinda<00:01:33.909> but<00:01:34.149> I<00:01:34.450> know<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.759> obviously<00:01:37.270> only

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
kinda but I know it's obviously only

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.389 
kinda but I know it's obviously only
skinnable<00:01:38.890> nothing<00:01:39.579> else<00:01:39.759> I<00:01:40.950> mean<00:01:41.950> why<00:01:42.189> would

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
skinnable nothing else I mean why would

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.240

you put me on on this cottages and
threaten<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.789> illogical<00:01:46.329> in<00:01:46.450> any<00:01:46.689> way<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.729> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
threaten the illogical in any way so the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.850 
threaten the illogical in any way so the
s<00:01:50.969> this<00:01:51.969> which<00:01:52.299> is<00:01:52.509> probably<00:01:52.929> the<00:01:53.170> reason<00:01:53.500> why

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
s this which is probably the reason why

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.380 
s this which is probably the reason why
most<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.849> people<00:01:55.239> actually<00:01:55.630> I'm<00:01:56.399> got<00:01:57.399> to

that is by far the worst thing about the
scar<00:02:15.519> um<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:17.310> mean<00:02:18.310> it's<00:02:18.609> fast<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.389> that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750
