now what is biodiesel biodiesel fever is
a<00:00:23.340> clean-burning<00:00:24.350> alternative<00:00:25.350> field<00:00:25.619> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a clean-burning alternative field that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.769 
a clean-burning alternative field that
comes<00:00:26.160> from<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.580> hundred<00:00:26.640> percent<00:00:26.849> renewable

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
comes from one hundred percent renewable

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.589 
comes from one hundred percent renewable
resources<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:29.220> considered<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.000> fuel<00:00:30.390> of

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
resources it is considered the fuel of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.889

the<00:00:30.960> future<00:00:31.880> that's<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.059> biodiesel<00:00:33.719> does

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the future that's right biodiesel does

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.799 
the future that's right biodiesel does
not<00:00:34.200> contains<00:00:34.800> petroleum<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.660> be

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
not contains petroleum but it can be

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.750 
not contains petroleum but it can be
mixed<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.320> petroleum<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:38.190> produce<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
mixed with petroleum to produce a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
mixed with petroleum to produce a
biodiesel<00:00:39.300> blend<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.469> used<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
biodiesel blend that can be used in a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.520 
biodiesel blend that can be used in a
variety<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.640> vehicles<00:00:43.520> now<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:44.760> popular<00:00:45.300> is

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
variety of vehicles now how popular is

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.889 
variety of vehicles now how popular is
biodiesel<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.149> gas<00:00:48.329> prices<00:00:48.750> are

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
biodiesel as you know the gas prices are

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.080 
biodiesel as you know the gas prices are
rising<00:00:49.140> every<00:00:49.440> day<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.969> more

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
rising every day and more and more

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.709 
rising every day and more and more
people<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.079> are<00:00:52.410> looking<00:00:53.100> into

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
people like you are looking into

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
people like you are looking into
alternative<00:00:54.719> fuel<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> currently<00:00:56.190> biodiesel

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
alternative fuel and currently biodiesel

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
alternative fuel and currently biodiesel
is<00:00:57.180> considered<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> best<00:00:58.460> solution

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
is considered one of the best solution

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.849 
is considered one of the best solution
in<00:00:59.640> terms<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.149> alternative<00:01:00.719> fuel<00:01:01.020> why<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
in terms of alternative fuel why is

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.549 
in terms of alternative fuel why is
there<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:03.390> bio<00:01:03.750> diesel<00:01:03.989> fuel<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
there so you see bio diesel fuel is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.789 
there so you see bio diesel fuel is
cheaper<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.549> burns<00:01:06.360> cleaner<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.170> is

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
cheaper it burns cleaner and is

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.700 
cheaper it burns cleaner and is
environmentally<00:01:08.549> friendly

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
environmentally friendly

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.430 
environmentally friendly
now<00:01:11.520> here's<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> interesting<00:01:11.850> thing<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:13.290> you

now here's the interesting thing do you
know<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.310> biodiesel<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:15.299> home

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
know that you can make biodiesel at home

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.100 
know that you can make biodiesel at home
that's<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.210> make<00:01:18.390> biodiesel<00:01:18.720> at

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that's right you can make biodiesel at

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.820 
that's right you can make biodiesel at
home<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.450> now<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.510> don't<00:01:21.840> need<00:01:21.930> some
