bearer will be really proud to run with
and<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:15.120> had<00:00:15.270> to<00:00:15.389> reflect<00:00:15.660> these<00:00:16.410> celebratory

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369

fact that it holds the Olympic flag

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.159 
fact that it holds the Olympic flag
makes<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.340> most<00:00:23.550> powerful

it kind of represents the Olympic spirit
the<00:00:28.710> eternal<00:00:28.739> Olympic<00:00:29.460> values<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.840> when<00:00:30.930> we

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
the eternal Olympic values and when we

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.840 
the eternal Olympic values and when we
think<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.380> games<00:00:31.860> off<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.220> can<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.460> focused

on athletes willing gold medals but it's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
on athletes willing gold medals but it's
about<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.489> more<00:00:35.700> than<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.360> a

about much more than that it is about a

Olympic movement the torch relay was

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.820 
Olympic movement the torch relay was
about<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.720> eight<00:00:45.900> thousand<00:00:46.290> runners<00:00:46.470> and<00:00:46.740> he

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
about the eight thousand runners and he

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.980 
about the eight thousand runners and he

torch to somehow reflect those runners
in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.200> design<00:00:52.500> our<00:00:52.740> final<00:00:53.100> concept<00:00:53.490> was<00:00:53.700> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
in the design our final concept was to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.190 
in the design our final concept was to
have<00:00:54.000> eight<00:00:54.270> thousand<00:00:54.630> holes<00:00:54.870> that

have eight thousand holes that

have eight thousand holes that
represented<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.730> each<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.150> the

represented one for each one of the
runners<00:00:57.450> and<00:00:57.810> for<00:00:58.500> each<00:00:58.620> mile<00:00:58.950> of<00:00:59.130> the<00:00:59.220> relay

the<00:00:59.910> series<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.270> perforations<00:01:00.660> which<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.140> put

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
the series of perforations which we put

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.440 
the series of perforations which we put
into<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.620> torch<00:01:01.860> lonely<00:01:02.550> make<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.880> physically

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
into the torch lonely make it physically

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.329 
into the torch lonely make it physically
like<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.930> was<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:04.409> visually<00:01:04.799> light<00:01:04.979> which

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
like it was make it visually light which

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.440 
like it was make it visually light which
gives<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.210> sense<00:01:06.360> of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
gives it a sense of

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.380 
gives it a sense of
something<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.530> talk<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.860> our<00:01:08.979> time<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:10.210> one

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
something of a talk to our time but one

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.820 
something of a talk to our time but one
of<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.540> challenges<00:01:11.049> we<00:01:11.439> didn't<00:01:11.680> want

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
of the challenges we didn't want

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.020 
of the challenges we didn't want
something<00:01:12.159> which<00:01:12.340> was<00:01:12.520> going<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.820> come<00:01:12.939> back

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
something which was going to come back

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.490 
something which was going to come back
the<00:01:13.150> heat<00:01:13.330> from<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.720> top<00:01:13.930> from<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.229> flame

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
the heat from the top from the flame

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.429 
the heat from the top from the flame
down<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.640> torchbearers<00:01:16.299> hand<00:01:16.570> that

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
down to the the torchbearers hand that

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.590 
down to the the torchbearers hand that
challenge<00:01:17.920> was<00:01:18.310> until<00:01:18.850> I<00:01:18.880> answered<00:01:19.360> by<00:01:19.540> the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
challenge was until I answered by the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.480 
challenge was until I answered by the
perforations<00:01:20.080> because<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:21.040> wind<00:01:21.220> moves

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
perforations because the wind moves

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.249 
perforations because the wind moves
through<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.880> torch<00:01:22.119> for<00:01:22.420> perforations<00:01:22.840> allow

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
through the torch for perforations allow

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.380 
through the torch for perforations allow
the<00:01:23.320> metal<00:01:23.619> to<00:01:23.740> cool<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.220> said<00:01:24.940> that<00:01:25.119> torch

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
the metal to cool and said that torch

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.120 
the metal to cool and said that torch
never<00:01:25.690> gets<00:01:25.899> hot<00:01:26.110> there<00:01:26.560> are<00:01:26.649> several<00:01:26.860> things

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
never gets hot there are several things

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.130 
never gets hot there are several things
that<00:01:27.399> influenced<00:01:27.880> our<00:01:27.970> decision<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.570> have<00:01:29.049> it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
that influenced our decision to have it

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.279 
that influenced our decision to have it
trying<00:01:29.440> in<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.740> shape<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:30.970> torch<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:32.049> first

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
trying in a shape to the torch the first

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.020 
trying in a shape to the torch the first
thing<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.070> Olympic<00:01:33.399> motto<00:01:33.580> which<00:01:33.909> is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
thing is the Olympic motto which is

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.969 
thing is the Olympic motto which is
faster<00:01:34.420> higher<00:01:34.600> stronger<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.710> other<00:01:35.830> thing

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
faster higher stronger the other thing

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.649 
faster higher stronger the other thing
is<00:01:36.100> that<00:01:36.610> it's<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.820> third<00:01:37.060> time<00:01:37.330> that<00:01:37.360> games

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
is that it's the third time that games

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.469 
is that it's the third time that games
have<00:01:37.750> been<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:38.080> London<00:01:38.259> so<00:01:38.649> in<00:01:38.740> 1908<00:01:39.270> 1948<00:01:40.270> and

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
have been in London so in 1908 1948 and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.700 
have been in London so in 1908 1948 and
then<00:01:40.600> obviously<00:01:41.250> 2012<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:43.179> also<00:01:43.600> from<00:01:44.590> a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
then obviously 2012 and also from a

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.880 
then obviously 2012 and also from a
practical<00:01:44.890> perspective<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:47.380> actually<00:01:47.649> much

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
practical perspective it's actually much

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.120 
practical perspective it's actually much
easier<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.520> hold<00:01:48.759> a<00:01:49.119> triangular<00:01:49.569> form<00:01:49.869> and<00:01:50.500> it

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130

with
I<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:28.050> moment<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.710> torch<00:02:28.980> begins<00:02:29.850> its

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
I think moment the torch begins its

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.320 
I think moment the torch begins its
journey<00:02:30.410> from<00:02:31.410> Land's<00:02:31.620> n<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.670> moment<00:02:32.880> when

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
journey from Land's n is the moment when

journey from Land's n is the moment when
the<00:02:33.360> game's<00:02:33.800> countdown<00:02:34.830> really<00:02:35.220> does<00:02:35.400> start
