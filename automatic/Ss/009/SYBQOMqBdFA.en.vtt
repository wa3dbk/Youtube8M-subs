 that's what he got 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.420

 for this, I press contra ldpm English 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.959

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.959
 behind the corner stretching images 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.829
 that's about what I did 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.010
 frame composition 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.260
 just awful 5 9 99 percent seen 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.489
 my framework 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.729
 m 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.559
 generally captive 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.579
 I do not know how to even say this train 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.439
 sense of style if possible 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.189
 train 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.169
 those who frame you please 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.769
 follow some rules of composition 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.009
 although the dublin image itself is 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.029
 do in the center of the negotiations 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.909
 hangs 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.439
 so in this case on my head by the market 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.219
 instead of leaving the heart 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.509
 options two or framed 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:05.539
 to reflect 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.089
 on bonds also 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.209
 for this 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.069
 transform 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.049
 clip khorezm palm 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.559

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.069
 volume 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.349
 but this is not a joke 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.139
 charge standard 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.139
 tool slightly pushing 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.269
 need to be ready 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.049
 filed by the photo and so I 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.679
 would still be done 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.080

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.899
 using sleep polyphenols 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.899
 made a selection 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.739
 now he pressed kontrol jay english 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.329
 This combination copies the new layer. 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.809
 let's go to perseverance 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:10.059
 now it means and goes back transform clip 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.049
 chrysanthemum 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.969
 now kontrol in g transformation 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.629
 well if you drive beyond the transformation area 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:19.669
 front sight 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.029
 you can rotate 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.159
 respectively, farewell 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.159
 I put about 100 bp 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.370
 it will be necessary a little now 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.979
 something will be replaced there yet 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.779
 than wipe other eraser 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.779
 plastic in this case make proud 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.370
 and so here is the north 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.570
 the cabin barely holds its summer kontrol 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.570
 I click on the second layer they need kontrol 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.009

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.159
 like ours or either right click 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.819
 succeeds 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.499
 otherwise there was a small joint 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:06.499
 using patch tulu 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.499

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.909
 need to reflect 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.039
 in general days 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.689
 and once again I will say something like that 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.589
 Iranian pulls 99 percent absolute 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:35.409

 much stylish much 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.499
 bottom looks like this in Kharkov where there is no 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:50.960
 rose bouquet envelope 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.949
 two hearts of enemies 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.949
 and I do not know what is there Pokemon Petersburg 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.919
 Minimalism looks much more elegant 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.550
 when we are talking about registration 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.300
 photos you want to show your pain 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.389
