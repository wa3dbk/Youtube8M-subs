00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:09.379 
we're going to play in a 15 gallon tree

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:11.020 
we're going to play in a 15 gallon tree
the<00:00:09.950> first<00:00:10.190> step<00:00:10.370> to<00:00:10.460> do<00:00:10.549> and<00:00:10.670> so<00:00:10.790> is<00:00:10.910> we're

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
the first step to do and so is we're

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.490 
the first step to do and so is we're
going<00:00:11.119> to<00:00:11.209> make<00:00:11.330> a<00:00:11.360> 4-foot<00:00:11.869> side<00:00:12.110> ring<00:00:12.350> we're

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
going to make a 4-foot side ring we're

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.529 
going to make a 4-foot side ring we're
taking<00:00:12.770> the<00:00:12.830> 4-foot<00:00:13.250> circle<00:00:13.639> aside<00:00:13.940> so<00:00:14.510> we

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
taking the 4-foot circle aside so we

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.540 
taking the 4-foot circle aside so we
have<00:00:14.809> a<00:00:14.840> nice<00:00:15.020> spot<00:00:15.289> to<00:00:15.440> do<00:00:15.529> the<00:00:15.650> tree<00:00:15.889> so<00:00:16.460> I'm

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
have a nice spot to do the tree so I'm

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.590 
have a nice spot to do the tree so I'm
going<00:00:16.699> to<00:00:16.730> do<00:00:16.850> is<00:00:16.970> I'm<00:00:17.060> going<00:00:17.090> to<00:00:17.240> take<00:00:17.390> two

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
going to do is I'm going to take two

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:26.310 
going to do is I'm going to take two
steps<00:00:17.840> from<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.230> flag<00:00:19.000> market

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.760 

now<00:00:27.320> that<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:27.529> have<00:00:27.740> all<00:00:27.770> this<00:00:28.100> marked<00:00:29.770> I'll

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
now that I have all this marked I'll

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:54.660 
now that I have all this marked I'll
make<00:00:30.980> my<00:00:31.160> circle

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.310 

now<00:00:55.670> we've<00:00:55.940> got<00:00:56.120> our<00:00:56.239> soldering<00:00:56.690> made<00:00:56.989> it'll

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
now we've got our soldering made it'll

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.690 
now we've got our soldering made it'll
make<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.620> lot<00:00:57.739> easier<00:00:57.770> when<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.340> gentleman

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
make it a lot easier when the gentleman

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.100 
make it a lot easier when the gentleman
cuts<00:00:58.910> his<00:00:59.059> grass<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.690> can<00:00:59.809> just<00:00:59.989> go<00:01:00.079> right

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
cuts his grass you can just go right

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.110 
cuts his grass you can just go right
around<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.620> tree<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.579> we're<00:01:01.699> only<00:01:01.790> playing

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
around the tree and we're only playing

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.119 
around the tree and we're only playing
the<00:01:02.180> 15<00:01:02.570> down<00:01:02.750> tree<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.079> it's<00:01:03.230> not<00:01:03.350> that<00:01:03.410> big<00:01:03.800> a

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
the 15 down tree so it's not that big a

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.980 
the 15 down tree so it's not that big a
lot<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.670> people<00:01:04.879> say<00:01:05.030> dig<00:01:05.239> your<00:01:05.360> hole<00:01:05.510> twice<00:01:05.780> as

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
lot of people say dig your hole twice as

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.749 
lot of people say dig your hole twice as
wide<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:06.500> we<00:01:06.860> have<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.010> trick<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.369> doing<00:01:07.520> that

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
wide but we have a trick to doing that

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.460 
wide but we have a trick to doing that
without<00:01:08.030> physically<00:01:08.509> removing<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.080> dirt<00:01:09.229> out

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
without physically removing the dirt out

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.230 
without physically removing the dirt out
of<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.740> hole<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.400> we'll<00:01:10.550> get<00:01:10.670> our<00:01:10.820> hole<00:01:11.000> dug

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
of the hole so we'll get our hole dug

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.370 
of the hole so we'll get our hole dug
and<00:01:11.420> then<00:01:11.509> we'll<00:01:11.630> show<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:11.840> how<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.080> do<00:01:12.259> the

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
and then we'll show you how to do the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.880 
and then we'll show you how to do the
rest

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.990 

all<00:01:20.890> right<00:01:21.010> now<00:01:21.159> that<00:01:21.280> we've<00:01:21.490> got<00:01:21.520> our<00:01:21.700> hole

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
all right now that we've got our hole

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.940 
all right now that we've got our hole
dug<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.420> is<00:01:22.570> roughly<00:01:23.200> what<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.590> want<00:01:23.770> your

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
dug this is roughly what you want your

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.770 
dug this is roughly what you want your
hole<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.190> look<00:01:24.340> like<00:01:24.549> for<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.790> 15<00:01:25.210> gallon<00:01:25.360> tree

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
hole to look like for a 15 gallon tree

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.630 
hole to look like for a 15 gallon tree
now<00:01:26.500> we're<00:01:26.650> going<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.799> add<00:01:26.979> in<00:01:27.130> some<00:01:27.280> planting

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
now we're going to add in some planting

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.190 
now we're going to add in some planting
materials<00:01:28.090> here<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.299> have<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.509> mixture<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:28.960> the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
materials here I have a mixture of the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.880 
materials here I have a mixture of the
peat<00:01:30.009> moss<00:01:30.090> pine<00:01:31.090> bark<00:01:31.360> mulch<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:32.049> some

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
peat moss pine bark mulch and some

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.950 
peat moss pine bark mulch and some
mushroom<00:01:33.220> compost<00:01:33.729> we're<00:01:34.540> also<00:01:34.659> going<00:01:34.900> to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
mushroom compost we're also going to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.050 
mushroom compost we're also going to
throw<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.200> some<00:01:35.409> Holly<00:01:35.770> tone<00:01:36.100> where's<00:01:36.880> that

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
throw in some Holly tone where's that

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.870 
throw in some Holly tone where's that
bio<00:01:37.240> zone<00:01:37.540> I<00:01:37.570> think<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:37.960> bio<00:01:38.110> tune<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.790> a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
bio zone I think it's a bio tune it's a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.219 
bio zone I think it's a bio tune it's a
good<00:01:40.060> root<00:01:40.360> stimulator

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
good root stimulator

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:50.910 
good root stimulator
it's<00:01:41.350> got<00:01:41.530> my<00:01:41.680> cries<00:01:42.009> in<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:50.470> want<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.740> mix

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
it's got my cries in it you want to mix

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.320 
it's got my cries in it you want to mix
all<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:51.280> up<00:01:51.340> real<00:01:51.820> nice<00:01:54.600> let<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:55.750> soil<00:01:56.080> up

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
all this up real nice let that soil up

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.490 
all this up real nice let that soil up
and<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:58.420> we'll<00:01:58.600> place<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.990> tree<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.409> to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
and then we'll place the tree and to

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.399 
and then we'll place the tree and to
make<00:01:59.649> sure<00:01:59.679> we've<00:01:59.979> got<00:02:00.009> our<00:02:00.190> depth<00:02:00.520> right<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
make sure we've got our depth right and

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.219 
make sure we've got our depth right and
it<00:02:02.560> will<00:02:02.679> raise<00:02:02.800> it<00:02:02.950> up<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.130> little<00:02:03.220> more<00:02:04.229> ahead

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
it will raise it up a little more ahead

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.899 
it will raise it up a little more ahead
more<00:02:05.440> we<00:02:05.830> don't<00:02:05.920> want<00:02:06.130> our<00:02:06.190> tree<00:02:06.429> too<00:02:06.670> deep

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
more we don't want our tree too deep

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:19.600 
more we don't want our tree too deep
because<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.240> can<00:02:07.390> drown<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.630> tree

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.950 

yeah<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.120> now<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.270> we've<00:02:21.540> got<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.840> right

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
yeah and now that we've got the right

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.520 
yeah and now that we've got the right
depth<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:24.600> want<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.840> make<00:02:24.960> sure<00:02:24.990> we<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
depth we want to make sure we have the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.950 
depth we want to make sure we have the
good<00:02:25.560> side<00:02:25.950> facing<00:02:26.490> towards<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> street<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
good side facing towards the street the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.120 
good side facing towards the street the
wide<00:02:28.140> side<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> believe<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.720> side

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
wide side and I believe that is the side

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.130 
wide side and I believe that is the side
about<00:02:35.130> being<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.760> 15-gallon<00:02:36.450> tree<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.960> pretty
