 There are many types of sausages in Germany. Brait Bullst is the best for Curry Brust. But even Japanese sausages are fine. 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:54.090
 Soak oil in a heated frying pan and simmer over Brat Brust. 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.870
 If you get burnt, turn over and carefully. 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:11.140
 Let's warm the sauce while baking brat. (Approximately 2 minutes on medium heat) 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.520
 Let's check the burntness of Brad Brast. Oh, just like that.

 After that, cut it and put it on a plate and put it on a warm sauce. Even if you add curry powder to your liking GOOD !! Please be with the beer.
