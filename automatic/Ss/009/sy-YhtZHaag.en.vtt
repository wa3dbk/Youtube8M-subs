00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.200
 hello friends and friends today 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.549
 I come to bring you this beautiful 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.559
 craftsmanship of these beautiful flowers 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.460
 made with enamel look how beautiful 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.650
 remains 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.110
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.820
 glazes of the color that you wish in 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.759
 this case we chose blue and 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.040
 golden white glue we will need 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.739
 also a hair hook for 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.169
 make this beautiful crochet ends 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.500
 accessory ballpoint pens the color of 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.509
 size that you say nail clippers already 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.059
 that I do not have a special clamp as well 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.370
 Work is facilitated 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.940
 we're going to need scissors and a clamp 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.609
 molding a wire a sweet wire 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.730
 we call them here in our country but 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:49.239
 you can go to any hardware store 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.179
 or craft shop from your fence to your 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.789
 right home I'm going to pick up the pen 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.249
 small and I will make a flower we are going to 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.280
 go wrapping the right thing in a way 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.109
 round to assemble the petals of the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.930
 little flower we are going to make a petal of 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.050
 four flowers let's be careful with 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.060
 the correct wire 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.330
 and every time we're going to make a petal 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.790
 let's go sealing the right thing 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.420
 let's go to sealing it for 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.940
 we stay super well we keep sealing 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.490
 what to do the 4 petals 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.630
 right then we do very 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.640
 carefully I had painted the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:37.650
 nails but I think that after that I'm going 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:41.290
 to get a little carried out good then 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.920
 we keep winding our cable 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.350
 right and here we have cut with the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.970
 nail clippers for that I told them since not 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.080
 I have a special clip because the cut 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.910
 It will not work 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.430
 remember to take a pin a nail clipper 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.070
 excuse a nail clipper that does not use 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.600
 that mom has already rejected so 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.140
 that fits us well here is the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.450
 result let's put together the flower the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.880
 let's put together very carefully also 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.650
 and they're going to see that we're going to be super 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.810
 nice super cute correct we continue 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.480
 hello hello 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.940
 and we assemble it carefully with care 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.430
 and here is the result look at what 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.170
 pretty has left us you can 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.269
 make the best way 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.640
 you want a dragonfly one 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.370
 butterfly here already had one of three 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.290
 little leaves and look what we got super 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.590
 pretty is also like kind of a 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.810
 fan the rule we go well pretty for 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.000
 that we look good very beautiful we take 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.569
 the pizza to mold I say pinza 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.709
 molding machine 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.260
 I do not know then let's take the clamp 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.530
 all right 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.390
 well we mold it well because they remember 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.670
 that we're going to throw white glue on him and 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.599
 we all have to be uniform 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.360
 then we go take a piece of paper for 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.569
 not associate what we have down to 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.360
 throw the correct rubber started in the 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.159
 White rubber uniformly remember 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.260
 that we have to be very careful is 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.569
 a little complicated but after that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.700
 they will realize that work 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.040
 that we are going to do the result is going to 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.329
 to be very beautiful you can 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.250
 use to make earrings to buy 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.670
 crochet hooks to make a 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.609
 little flower and put some little hooks 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.900
 some tweezers or crochet for the hair 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.530
 right to give them to friends 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.870
 because not to sell them yes and we have left 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.569
 super nice here we are putting it together and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.159
 we have to be very careful is a 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.950
 little complicated if they do not take 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:51.489
 expired because the end result is going to 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.260
 to be very beautiful, very beautiful, I assure you 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.590
 from here we have 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.610
 what we call carefully 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.950
 we are finishing 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.650
 let's finish sealing it with 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.640
 correct caution of not 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.600
 not 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.000
 that we do not get hurt here already we 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.269
 damaged but do not worry let's continue 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.139
 here 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.349
 taking care here here I'm going to 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.789
 remove the remnants of glue that we 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:30.470
 it was on the sides and little by little we're going 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.909
 spreading right here we have been 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.830
 our final result I will take the 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:39.500
 enamel is enamels is a little bit 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.210
 hard to open but do not worry I'll 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.740
 I know so that it does not dry 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.319
 because the glazes are a bit 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.750
 delicate and the seals and so I do not know 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.759
 what are we going to get the gold that is already 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.539
 open and we do not have to do so much 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.729
 effort then we are going to spread it in 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.740
 this case I do not let it dry then for 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.050
 that you saw step by step but 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.759
 the idea is that you let them dry 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.130
 at least one night 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.110
 first the white glue and then when 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.840
 already the white glue is dry then 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.240
 we will proceed to cast the enamel of 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.099
 color you want correct in this 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.599
 case it will harm us a little but 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.909
 it's only because I want them to see the 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.879
 step by step and follow it correct but 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.139
 remember to let it dry one night 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.080
 Right 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.030
 they can already place it in children or in a 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.380
 sponge to stay and so 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.660
 can be taken out then remember 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.510
 that you must be very careful and here 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:40.050
 I'm doing it right 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:43.530
 here we go little by little 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.539
 they are going to see that very nice that there 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.200
 damaged but do not worry let's go again 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:51.740
 to the ring 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:55.220
 we're going to launch the arena and here we go 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.380
 Here we have to remember, look what 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.949
 pretty the geos remember to let dry if 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.949
 I repeat it 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:08.460
 here we have here we had one already 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:10.350
 right made of white glue either 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.020
 I let it dry I'm going to take the trouble 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.950
 blue enamel sorry that blue glue 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.960
 the blue enamel then so that 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.940
 enamel I love this color I like 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.100
 very much but you can choose the 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.860
 color that you want right there 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.230
 we took it a little bit there, it damaged us 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.230
 a petal but do not worry we're going 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.710
 to fix remember to let it dry 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:38.500
 correct little by little 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.500
 there they were giving us 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:45.130
 but well, here I am going to finish, I think 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.840
 this is going to be the end and good 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.720
