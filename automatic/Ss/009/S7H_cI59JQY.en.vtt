00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.859 

okay<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.680> one's<00:01:04.890> actually<00:01:05.129> an<00:01:05.640> Allen<00:01:06.060> which

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
okay this one's actually an Allen which

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.570 
okay this one's actually an Allen which
I<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> toolkit

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.610 

so<00:01:14.120> you<00:01:14.180> can<00:01:14.300> see<00:01:14.450> sometimes<00:01:14.720> there<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.380> small

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
so you can see sometimes there the small

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.640 
so you can see sometimes there the small
flathead<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.900> sometimes<00:01:17.900> there<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> Alan

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
flathead and sometimes there the Alan

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.240 
flathead and sometimes there the Alan
and<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:18.980> we<00:01:19.070> have<00:01:19.190> an<00:01:19.310> allen<00:01:19.580> key<00:01:19.610> here<00:01:24.250> we're

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
and so we have an allen key here we're

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.570 
and so we have an allen key here we're
going<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.400> loosen<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.970> set<00:01:26.210> screw<00:01:27.430> but<00:01:28.430> you

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
going to loosen that set screw but you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.860 
going to loosen that set screw but you
don't<00:01:28.760> want<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.030> pull<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.240> all<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.450> way<00:01:29.600> out

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
don't want to pull it all the way out

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.340 
don't want to pull it all the way out
just<00:01:30.970> loose<00:01:31.970> enough<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:32.420> where<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.690> lock<00:01:32.930> will

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
just loose enough so where the lock will

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.520 
just loose enough so where the lock will
start<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.680> spin<00:01:34.300> there<00:01:35.300> we<00:01:35.420> go<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.930> so

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
start to spin there we go and so

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.620 
start to spin there we go and so
basically<00:01:36.890> this<00:01:37.340> lock<00:01:37.610> is<00:01:37.790> threaded<00:01:38.270> we're

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
basically this lock is threaded we're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.050 
basically this lock is threaded we're
going<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.840> unthread<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.770> there<00:01:46.550> you<00:01:46.670> go

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
going to unthread it and there you go

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.100 
going to unthread it and there you go
your<00:01:47.840> locks<00:01:48.110> out<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:49.810> basically<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:51.050> just

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
your locks out and basically you just

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.290

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.180 
we're going to tighten that set screw
back<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.290> don't<00:02:40.560> want<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.830> tighten<00:02:41.130> it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
back in but you don't want to tighten it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.590 
back in but you don't want to tighten it
too<00:02:41.400> tight<00:02:41.670> because<00:02:41.700> that'll<00:02:42.150> make<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.420> key

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
too tight because that'll make the key

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.720 
too tight because that'll make the key
hard<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.990> turn<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.860> we'll<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.190> tight

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
hard to turn so we'll do it just tight

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.850 
hard to turn so we'll do it just tight
enough<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.300> secures<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> lock<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.710> now

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
enough so it secures to the lock and now

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.940 
enough so it secures to the lock and now
it's<00:02:47.010> not<00:02:47.160> spinning<00:02:48.710> okay

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
it's not spinning okay

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:01.330 
it's not spinning okay
now<00:02:50.430> we're<00:02:50.520> going<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.700> replace<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.150> cover

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.130 

again<00:03:02.000> we're<00:03:02.150> going<00:03:02.330> back<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.780> larger

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
again we're going back to the larger

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:21.940 
again we're going back to the larger
Phillips<00:03:03.500> head

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.570 

covers<00:03:22.610> back<00:03:22.880> on

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
covers back on

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.070 
covers back on
let's<00:03:24.790> double<00:03:25.120> check<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.570> make<00:03:25.630> sure<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.840> key

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
let's double check and make sure the key

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.550 
let's double check and make sure the key
works<00:03:27.480> here's<00:03:28.480> our<00:03:28.660> new<00:03:28.810> key<00:03:31.080> there<00:03:32.080> we<00:03:32.170> go

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
works here's our new key there we go

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.370 
works here's our new key there we go
change<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.190> lot
