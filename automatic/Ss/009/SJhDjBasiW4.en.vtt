really<00:04:32.500> short<00:04:32.740> but<00:04:32.920> that's<00:04:33.010> of<00:04:33.220> course<00:04:33.430> it<00:04:33.640> fit

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
really short but that's of course it fit

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.220 
really short but that's of course it fit
in<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.060> shell<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.390> I'm<00:04:34.480> happy<00:04:34.780> with<00:04:34.870> that<00:04:34.930> I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
in a shell and I'm happy with that I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.040 
in a shell and I'm happy with that I
like<00:04:35.460> how<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.610> short<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.240> think<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.750> goes<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:37.990> his

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
like how it short I think it goes in his

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.330 
like how it short I think it goes in his
hand<00:04:38.260> better<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.740> it<00:04:38.830> kind<00:04:38.980> of<00:04:39.010> looks<00:04:39.160> like<00:04:39.220> a

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
hand better and it kind of looks like a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.570 
hand better and it kind of looks like a
tomahawk<00:04:40.500> try<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.560> get<00:04:41.710> in<00:04:41.800> his<00:04:41.890> hand<00:04:44.580> like

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
tomahawk try to get in his hand like

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:54.750 
tomahawk try to get in his hand like
that<00:04:46.680> see<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:52.210> yeah<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:54.190> know<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.370> got<00:04:54.610> more

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
that see but yeah you know I got more

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.040 
that see but yeah you know I got more
weapons<00:04:55.090> than<00:04:55.150> all<00:04:55.480> of<00:04:55.660> them

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
weapons than all of them

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.780 
weapons than all of them
so<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.290> think<00:04:56.410> that's<00:04:56.620> cuz<00:04:56.770> he's<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:56.920> leader

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.430 

that's<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.910> lie<00:05:02.760> but<00:05:03.760> um<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.420> see<00:05:05.080> show<00:05:05.320> how

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
that's a lie but um I see show how

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.080 
that's a lie but um I see show how
articulated<00:05:06.100> they<00:05:06.160> aren't<00:05:06.430> they<00:05:06.550> move<00:05:06.760> I

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
articulated they aren't they move I

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.670 
articulated they aren't they move I
don't<00:05:07.720> know<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.900> names<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.260> them<00:05:08.350> so<00:05:08.560> I'm<00:05:08.650> just

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
don't know the names of them so I'm just

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.090 
don't know the names of them so I'm just
gonna<00:05:08.830> say<00:05:09.100> I<00:05:09.220> move<00:05:09.310> here<00:05:09.580> they<00:05:09.730> move<00:05:09.910> here

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
gonna say I move here they move here

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.080 
gonna say I move here they move here
here<00:05:12.100> the<00:05:12.430> wrists<00:05:12.940> slow<00:05:13.720> under<00:05:14.050> that<00:05:14.170> name<00:05:15.090> the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
here the wrists slow under that name the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.990 
here the wrists slow under that name the
knees<00:05:16.330> Bend<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:17.110> think<00:05:17.770> it's<00:05:17.890> a<00:05:17.950> double<00:05:18.280> no<00:05:18.850> it's

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
knees Bend I think it's a double no it's

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.520 
knees Bend I think it's a double no it's
not<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.150> double<00:05:19.390> joint<00:05:19.630> they're<00:05:20.170> gonna<00:05:20.290> do<00:05:20.410> the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
not a double joint they're gonna do the

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.490 
not a double joint they're gonna do the
splits<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:24.450> flavor<00:05:25.450> in<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.660> ball<00:05:25.870> joint<00:05:26.350> and

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
splits and flavor in the ball joint and

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.440 
splits and flavor in the ball joint and
of<00:05:26.590> course<00:05:26.830> their<00:05:27.100> shell<00:05:27.460> open<00:05:28.150> so<00:05:28.300> I<00:05:28.330> guess

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
of course their shell open so I guess

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.850 
of course their shell open so I guess
you<00:05:28.570> can<00:05:28.660> cut<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:28.990> articulation<00:05:29.530> if<00:05:29.770> you

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
you can cut that articulation if you

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.880 
you can cut that articulation if you
want<00:05:32.430> that's<00:05:33.430> basically<00:05:33.790> it<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.740> find<00:05:35.740> it

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
want that's basically it I find it

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.370 
want that's basically it I find it
easier<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.400> move<00:05:36.700> these<00:05:37.350> than<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.470> originals

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
easier to move these than the originals
