00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
I think it was one of the best inning I

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.490 
I think it was one of the best inning I
have<00:02:31.730> ever<00:02:31.970> played<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.480> t20<00:02:33.050> s<00:02:33.110> because<00:02:33.470> I

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
have ever played in t20 s because I

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.160 
have ever played in t20 s because I
never<00:02:33.800> got<00:02:33.950> 100<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:35.120> know<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.540> people

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
never got 100 and you know and people

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.720

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
who are talking about inertia box would

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.910 
who are talking about inertia box would
get<00:02:37.910> under<00:02:38.060> D<00:02:38.269> in<00:02:38.330> t20<00:02:38.780> because<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.680> game

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
get under D in t20 because the game

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.979 
get under D in t20 because the game
belongs<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.880> save<00:02:41.090> all<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.269> way<00:02:41.540> he's<00:02:41.750> betting

belongs to save all the way he's betting

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.650 
belongs to save all the way he's betting
so<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.680> for<00:02:43.459> six<00:02:43.640> over<00:02:43.880> didn't<00:02:44.090> go<00:02:44.209> our<00:02:44.330> way<00:02:44.480> so

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
so and for six over didn't go our way so

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.320 
so and for six over didn't go our way so
we<00:02:45.200> lost<00:02:45.380> three<00:02:45.620> wickets<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.160> we<00:02:46.310> was<00:02:46.459> as<00:02:46.610> 29

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
we lost three wickets and we was as 29

runs<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:47.930> six<00:02:48.110> hours<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.440> thought<00:02:48.620> yes<00:02:48.920> they

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
runs in for six hours I thought yes they

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.640 
runs in for six hours I thought yes they
don't<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:49.970> 4/5<00:02:50.630> bowler<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.350> I<00:02:51.470> can

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
don't have a 4/5 bowler so if I can

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.140 
don't have a 4/5 bowler so if I can
target<00:02:51.890> fourth<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.459> fifth<00:02:52.640> wall<00:02:52.850> or<00:02:52.970> maybe

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
target fourth and fifth wall or maybe

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.300 
target fourth and fifth wall or maybe
target<00:02:53.569> is<00:02:53.660> achievable<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.890> moment<00:02:55.190> I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
target is achievable and the moment I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.530 
target is achievable and the moment I
hit<00:02:55.640> 22<00:02:56.420> runs<00:02:56.569> in<00:02:57.130> Shawn<00:02:58.130> Malhotra<00:02:58.579> is<00:02:58.640> over<00:02:58.940> so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
hit 22 runs in Shawn Malhotra is over so

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.700 
hit 22 runs in Shawn Malhotra is over so
I<00:03:00.140> thought<00:03:00.769> now<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.950> get<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.400> moment
