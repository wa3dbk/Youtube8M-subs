so<00:03:29.170> one<00:03:29.470> day<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.650> decided<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.310> could<00:03:30.459> actually

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
so one day I decided I could actually

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.880 
so one day I decided I could actually
use<00:03:30.819> them<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.480> hide<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.780> bunch<00:03:32.109> of<00:03:32.290> my<00:03:32.470> clutter
