00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.080
 I'm jose manuel garcÃ­a and I do not have 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.370
 diy idea but prow paints 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.309
 believe that even I can do it 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.309
 this is the pro challenge 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.640
 sure that put to houses or farms 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.230
 you have some nice metal part 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.120
 sure but that has not supported the step 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.830
 of time and has been turned off by the 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.390
 oxide pieces for example like this 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.060
 door in your case can be a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 railing can be a gate as well 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.690
 I do not believe you are capable of facing a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 project like this I think that industry 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 this has the good solution we already have 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.239
 our door disassembled and prepared 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.650
 to work on it but that's what 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.390
 first is to protect our area 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.030
 work and for that we have put a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.200
 plastic as you can see occupies another the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 work zone so that they do not stain us 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 what we should not and so as you see it 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.530
 here volcanic good now we play 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.110
 know what we have to do with this from 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.610
 rust and the truth that looks to be 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.230
 a little bit complicated because to see in 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.230
 First of all we have to remove the oxide 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.470
 then we have to use the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.640
 primer so that then the paint does not 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.560
 we fall 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.390
 and we have to look for the enamel with the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.390
 color we want and apply 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.830
 with prow paintings we have knox test 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.660
 with that we will be much easier 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.190
 everything we have to do and for that 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.060
 let's see what tools and what 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.060
 materials we need 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.390
 obviously we are going to need painting 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.970
 there are multiple colors and you 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.250
 you can choose the one you like I 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
 I'm going to be left with this red reminder that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.090
 If you do not know how to calculate the amount correctly 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.380
 of surface consult the professional 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.880
 for the window 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.950
 We're going to need to clean up a little 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.990
 our door in my case I will use 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.730
 a very soft steel wool you will see 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 that I will not need to sand with force 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.080
 to protect the lock and others 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.810
 details I will use ink that does not 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.160
 we want to paint where you do not owe this 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 paint can be applied of many 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.670
 ways but how my door has a 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.030
 fine grid in my case I will use 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.640
 brushes and rollers then I explain more 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.710
 about this painting especially if 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.290
 let's use roller is better than 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.700
 place in a bucket well in addition to 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.010
 be clean we also save and 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.570
 we protect the one in the boat as 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.670
 I'm a bit of a rookie in this and I do not want 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.050
 stain all of paint is never 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.690
 more have the protective plastic for 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.780
 place on the floor 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.230
 the fights are coming and we are ready to 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.670
 start as I told our in addition 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.720
 that we observe some measures of 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.310
 caution 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.130
 first of all I'm going to prepare this area 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.170
 to work as well as I am today 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.080
 working outdoors if you go to 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.730
 paint indoors assure you of not 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.160
 just protect everything you can 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.710
 to go but to do it in a good area 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.650
 ventilated in my case I can dismantle the 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.540
 that's why he prepared some horses like that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.520
 I will work more comfortable and I avoid staining 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.080
 where I do not leave good we already have here the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.310
 neighborhoods but the first thing is to clean well 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.220
 the surface that we are going to work 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.440
 as you can see we have the oxide we have 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.880
 this fuzz there is always something 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.990
 dirt as you can check 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.240
 well, we all have to do it 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.750
 disappear we take a few hands of 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.070
 steel 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.070
 and we started working 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.830
 the goal is to leave the surface 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.050
 Clean dry and degreased if the rust 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.150
 it is not homogeneous and parts have remained 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.520
 brilliant the ideal is that we leave 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.850
 to qualify them this is to stop 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.320
 shine if we are going to use a thinner 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.210
 because our piece has grease or other 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.400
 substances a tip that he gave me makes 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.290
 time a friend is better to put the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.069
 product in the rag instead of the rag 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.049
 in the product 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.909
 well we have already cleaned the surface the 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.650
 we have ready to paint but there are 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.150
 to cover you have to protect the areas 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.980
 that we do not want them to get dirty 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.019
 paint for example the knobs the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.510
 armor the hinges so we 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.030
 we put to it the novices like me 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.579
 we tend to go back and never 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.709
 rather it is about protecting the 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.200
 areas that we do not want to paint 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.930
 return them as a gift if then not 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.419
 you want to have problems spending only the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.400
 just amount of good tape we have 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.469
 clean surface we already have all good 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.879
 protected with what comes the fun 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.260
 what to paint it 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.519
 we could do it with a gun like 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.930
 I already told you but in this case as 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.120
 we have so many holes we would lose 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.180
 a lot of paint and it's a shame with what 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.389
 which I will use a roller for 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.259
 outer part is worth and a brush for 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.530
 the straight lines so we already have everything going 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.530
 checking 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.289
 as we do not want to waste or that 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.330
 spoil the paint on the boat that does not 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.580
 we are using let's throw small 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.619
 quantities of paint in the bucket with 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.089
 the roller we take a little and remove the 

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:49.589
 surplus for that serves the rough part 

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:51.389
 we are going to apply full layers of 

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.490
 knox test on the door like this 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.330
 dry product very fast we can give a 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.770
 layer and in a very short time the next 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.139
 as the roller is running 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.939
 without paint we cojemos more of the bucket and 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.990
 we go little by little where a hand 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.990
 full of each time 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.820
 the first hand of the frame is already given 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.250
 but we still have the inner lines 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.320
 this is where we will use the brush of 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.230
 again we take some paint from the 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.600
 bucket we remove the surplus and we go 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.290
 giving a layer each one will have its 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.880
 technique 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:35.440
 I'm going to choose to do the first 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:36.880
 vertical and then the horizontal ones and already 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.050
 we have been spared reading the second hand 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.050
 of paint that had to be given but 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.150
 well I think it has not been bad if 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.710
 I would have my mother anyway I want to just 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.090
 is to place the door see how it has 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.490
 already left to see if it is necessary to give some 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.170
 retouch more once we have 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.570
 placed on your site is a good time 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.910
 to make a last revision give some 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.190
 retouch if we have overlooked something and 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.290
 remove the protective tape only if 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.000
 we have finished painting and everything is 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.760
 dry 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.070
 what do you think has been fantastic 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.950
 that we had a rusty door and 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.820
 checking c's a pair of hands and 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.780
 spectacular and tunisia but it's like that 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.780
 another test challenge has gotten
