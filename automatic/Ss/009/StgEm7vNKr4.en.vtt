00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
in other respects I realize like this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660 
in other respects I realize like this

or you face retirement and in it and in

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.130 
or you face retirement and in it and in
the<00:01:14.700> case<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.240> professional<00:01:15.570> athlete<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the case of a professional athlete I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.359 
the case of a professional athlete I
think<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.500> heightened<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:16.979> you've

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
think it's heightened because you've

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.130 
think it's heightened because you've
done<00:01:17.430> something<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:18.119> particularly<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.869> 18

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
done something in particularly for 18

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.190 
done something in particularly for 18
years<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.680> you've<00:01:20.580> come<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.479> customer<00:01:21.930> doing

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
years that you've come a customer doing

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
years that you've come a customer doing
you've<00:01:22.350> built<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.740> life<00:01:23.670> around<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.299> you're

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
you've built your life around and you're

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.950 
you've built your life around and you're
even<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:25.170> identity<00:01:25.680> around<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:27.240> feel

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
even your identity around and to feel

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800 
even your identity around and to feel
for<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> moment<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:29.150> that's<00:01:30.150> disappeared

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
for a moment like that's disappeared

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.140 
for a moment like that's disappeared
this<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> frightening<00:01:32.009> place<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.939> also

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
this is a frightening place but to also

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.920 
this is a frightening place but to also
move<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> future<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
move on to see the future and to have to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.120 
move on to see the future and to have to
move<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.680> something<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.040> think

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
move on to that is something I think

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760 
move on to that is something I think
everybody<00:01:38.670> goes<00:01:38.759> through<00:01:39.560> in<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
everybody goes through in the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.950 
everybody goes through in the
franchise's<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.970> rebuild<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:42.630> so

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
franchise's in is gonna rebuild here so

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.100 
franchise's in is gonna rebuild here so
there's<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> lot<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.630> options<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:45.840> there's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
there's not a lot of options or there's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.590 
there's not a lot of options or there's
not<00:01:46.229> even<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.590> real<00:01:46.799> rush<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:48.030> something<00:01:48.509> I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
not even a real rush to do something I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.609 
not even a real rush to do something I
think<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:49.020> me<00:01:50.509> frankly<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
think with me frankly I think if if I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.340 
think with me frankly I think if if I
looked<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.729> from<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> outside<00:01:54.090> even

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
looked at it from the outside even

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.780 
looked at it from the outside even
