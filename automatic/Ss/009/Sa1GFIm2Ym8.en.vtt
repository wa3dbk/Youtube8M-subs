remembered that Luna for I screwed up

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.930 
remembered that Luna for I screwed up
with<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.019> one<00:00:10.200> pit<00:00:10.500> part<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.190> fell<00:00:11.550> into<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
with this one pit part and I fell into a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.150 
with this one pit part and I fell into a
pit<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.450> something<00:00:13.170> very<00:00:13.380> similar<00:00:13.679> happened

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
pit and something very similar happened

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.269 
pit and something very similar happened
where<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.400> flashed<00:00:14.730> several<00:00:15.420> images<00:00:16.010> so<00:00:17.010> fast

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
where it flashed several images so fast

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.769 
where it flashed several images so fast
I'd<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.699> time<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> register<00:00:18.359> any<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
I'd have time to register any of the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.060

apparently<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> went<00:00:44.190> farther<00:00:44.460> than<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.730> thought

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
apparently I went farther than I thought

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.010 
apparently I went farther than I thought
I<00:00:45.030> did<00:00:46.280> going<00:00:47.280> forward<00:00:47.969> when<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.539> screw<00:00:48.930> up
