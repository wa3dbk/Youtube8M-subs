00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
Ah "Tangled."

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.980
Originally called "Rapunzel."

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.120
In a nutshell, after "The Princess and the Frog"
didn’t do nearly as well as Disney had hoped it would

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.980
they decided that the reason was because
boys saw "princess" in the title,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.960
and they didn't wanna see a movie
with a princess name in it.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.260
So they went for a
gender-neutral adjective instead.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.420
Imagine how much ink they would’ve saved on
print advertising if they’d done this since the beginning.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.560
So let’s get started.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.220
[Dramatically]
We begin in the kingdom of Corona.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.600
Our fair setting.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.240
And I mean that literally, Corona is
entirely populated by white people.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.320
It’s pretty much the closest a Disney movie has ever
gotten to be a completely made-up-from-scratch fantasy land.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.820
And given how much Corona looks
like the Disney parks,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.580
you would think that they would have as much
diversity as Disney’s promotional photography,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.280
but you would be wrong.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.320
[forced awkward laughter at racism]
[claps]

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.480
There are two!

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.140
Count em, two people who might possibly be
people of color in this movie.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.300
Since Rapunzel is a German fairytale, people like to
say that Corona is Germany,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
and that’s silly for the same reason
that saying Arendelle is Norway.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.480
A popular defense for the lack of PoC in
"Tangled" is "historical accuracy."

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.780
[sarcastically]
I love that one.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.400
[Annoying Internet Voice]
"There just weren't a lot of people of color in Germany
back then, it was mostly white people."

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.480
Apparently.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.920
First of all that’s not true.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.700
There were people of color
in Europe before 2015.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.900
We just don’t like to talk about it, because ya know…

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.780
[whispers]
racism.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.460
For more information on this sort of thing,
be sure to check out MedievalPOC on Tumblr.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.540
Second of all, even if the majority of people in Germany,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.660
at the time that the movie so clearly and
obviously states that it takes place in–

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.780
which it doesn’t

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.680
–why is that an excuse?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.640
Pascal the chameleon is an animal native to Africa,
and yet, he’s found his way into this movie.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.300
But no people of color did.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.540
And besides…it’s a movie.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.680
We literally have the technology to
recreate dead people.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.200
[gross sobbing over the perfection of
Audrey Hepburn chocolate commercial]
Guys I thought this was real, for like 30 seconds.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.500
My point being, it’s not that it can’t be done
or that Disney is unwilling

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.600
to bend geography to suit their creative purposes,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.680
it’s just that they didn’t care about stretching their creative muscles when it came to world-building here.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.700
Sad but true.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.900
But what about the lanterns?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.680
The lanterns were creative, right?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.880
I will say that the lantern scene is hands down,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.640
one of the most beautiful sequences of animation
that Disney has ever created.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.420
Probably one of the most beautiful animation
sequences in history.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.040
But the practice of sky lanterns is a
pre-existing phenomenon,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.040
and is found in several different areas of the world.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.280
Most famously East Asian cultures, including but
not limited to: China, Taiwan, and Thailand.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.660
This tradition is also found in
Portugal, Brazil, and Mexico.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.040
But who cares, right?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.400
Like, why am I even talking about this?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.240
They’re just lanterns.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.300
Well actually no.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.760
The lanterns have cultural weight and importance
to the places they come from,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.280
and to remove them and strip its
meaning is cultural appropriation.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.480
I know that’s kind of a buzz phrase nowadays,
you hear it a lot around Halloween time.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.560
and sometimes it gets confused with
multiculturalism and cultural assimilation,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.480
both of which are also different
things from one another.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.560
Basically what makes cultural appropriation
different from those things

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.060
and makes it bad is its power imbalance.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.180
It’s specifically when a dominant culture takes
something from an oppressed culture,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.560
and uses it in a way that disregards its
original meaning and purpose.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.620
This is a really broad topic and not the only way that
cultural appropriation manifests itself,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.960
but that’s for another video.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.440
I’ll include some links in the description box if
you guys are so inclined to investigate.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.480
Back to "Tangled."

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.540
The lanterns wouldn’t have been such a big deal if the story
was already set in a place where those lanterns existed.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.860
And it also would’ve been so
cool to have it set in one of those places.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.420
And the best thing is, it wouldn’t
have really changed the story.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.680
We could’ve had the same core story and the same
characters that we love, and it could've been in Thailand.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.460
And that would've been so cool!

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.720
Yes, undoubtedly it would’ve had its own problems,
but representation most likely wouldn’t have been one of them.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.160
You might remember earlier I said:

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.480
[Earlier]
There are two!

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.060
Count em, two people who might possibly be people of color in this movie.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.040
Upon close examination, I have found that
in the Snuggly Duckling pub there is…

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.540
drumroll please.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.980
[Enthusiastic drumroll provided by lovely assistant]

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.980
An Asian-looking guy.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.960
And we never seen him again.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.060
He’s not in the song, he doesn’t help rescue Flynn.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.160
And he just um…kinda…

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.020
kinda looks like a stereotype?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.200
[Awkward staring]

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.460
And the second person who could be
a person of color is Mother Gothel.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.380
[Mother Knows Best from Tangled]:
Gothel: ♪ Mother knows best! ♪ [villain laugh]

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.860
But how does that make any sense given
that most of the times that we see

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.840
Rapunzel and Gothel next to each other,
that Gothel is actually paler?

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.880
Well this is where an interesting but not new
phenomenon called racial coding comes in.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.220
Racial coding is giving traits or physical attributes to a
character typically associated with a certain race of people,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.460
without actually stating that that character is that race.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.600
If you’ve watched my Frozen video, this might sound
a bit familiar because I talked a little bit about queer coding,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.360
which is giving a character traits usually
associated with how gay people are perceived.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.840
Both of these things are born
out of racism and homophobia,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.500
and I don’t just mean a hatred
of these groups, I mean a fear,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.020
which is why race coding and queer coding are things
usually reserved for villains and antagonists.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.080
Racial coding is a win-win situation for the
perpetrator if it’s done successfully.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.720
1: Your audience subconsciously notices Gothel’s
hooked nose, sharp features, dark eyelashes, dark and kinky hair–

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.420
–in other words, these characteristics that would not be
used to describe desirable white features–

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.480
–but your audience doesn’t realize that they
recognize those characteristics because

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.200
they see them over and over again,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.620
and that they have deep roots in racism.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.400
For this case specifically anti-semitic propaganda.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.940
2: Some people recognize the coding for what it is
and they say something about it.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.460
But since other people don’t recognize it as coding,
you have a lot of plausible deniability.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.560
Meaning you can’t get in any real trouble for it.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.560
And Disney did it pretty well here.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.000
They still did it.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.940
Granted, the racist implications
probably weren’t deliberate,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.100
but that’s because racism is so ingrained in our culture
that we don’t always see that it’s there.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.500
Gothel’s coding has several different possibilities.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.080
A lot of people feel that her features along
with her overbearing personality

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.600
are meant to play on the Jewish mother stereotype.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.620
Others feel that Gothel looks
Italian or possibly Armenian.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.620
But what most people agree on is
that Gothel doesn’t look white.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.520
And that’s not to say that there isn’t any white person in
the entire world that doesn't look like Gothel,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.740
but she definitely doesn’t look like any of the other obviously white people in this movie.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.680
And we wouldn’t have to be nitpicking over bone structure
if there were other people that looked like Gothel.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.900
If Rapunzel was a person of color,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.900
there wouldn’t be this dichotomy between
the beautiful, soft face, golden haired

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.800
feminine ideal of white beauty in the heroine

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.300
with the vain, selfish, abusive,
ethnic looking villainess Gothel.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.460
Which is something that’s been portrayed
in media for a really long time.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.640
Her racial coding is also problematic
because it puts a whole new light

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.260
on the emotional abuse that she inflicts on Rapunzel.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.180
Because of course Gothel is abusive, she’s the villain,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.520
and she's not Rapunzel’s real and loving white mother.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.360
But that is something I will get into
more in the next "Tangled" video.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.380
