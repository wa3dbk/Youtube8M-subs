00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
injuries both eyes were damaged we don't

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.839 
injuries both eyes were damaged we don't
know<00:05:42.970> if<00:05:43.180> he<00:05:43.330> penetrated<00:05:43.960> his<00:05:44.050> brain<00:05:44.440> but

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
know if he penetrated his brain but

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.120 
know if he penetrated his brain but
enough<00:05:45.849> that<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:46.530> severely<00:05:47.530> affected<00:05:47.979> his

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
enough that it severely affected his

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.600 
enough that it severely affected his
mentality<00:05:48.580> apparently<00:05:49.389> so<00:05:50.080> he's<00:05:50.470> he's<00:05:51.280> got<00:05:51.580> a

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
mentality apparently so he's he's got a

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.510 
mentality apparently so he's he's got a
lot<00:05:51.820> of<00:05:51.880> facial<00:05:52.620> buckshot<00:05:53.620> he<00:05:54.010> carries<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.430> lot

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
lot of facial buckshot he carries a lot

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.490 
lot of facial buckshot he carries a lot
of<00:05:54.580> weight<00:05:54.789> right<00:05:55.000> there<00:05:55.270> what<00:05:56.169> about<00:05:56.260> his

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
of weight right there what about his

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.680 
of weight right there what about his
eyes<00:05:56.729> both<00:05:57.729> of<00:05:57.909> them<00:05:58.030> are<00:05:58.210> injured<00:05:58.510> and

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.170 
eyes both of them are injured and
permanently<00:05:59.260> I'm<00:05:59.560> sure<00:05:59.770> now<00:06:00.580> whether<00:06:00.789> he<00:06:01.000> can

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
permanently I'm sure now whether he can

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.170

somewhat<00:06:04.659> when<00:06:05.380> they<00:06:05.530> heal<00:06:05.889> but<00:06:06.130> they're<00:06:06.490> the

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
somewhat when they heal but they're the

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.249 
somewhat when they heal but they're the
only<00:06:06.849> time<00:06:07.150> will<00:06:07.330> tell<00:06:07.360> us<00:06:07.539> how<00:06:07.780> extensive

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
that injury is it's actually kind of

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.659 
that injury is it's actually kind of
trade<00:06:10.479> in<00:06:10.659> the<00:06:10.750> eye<00:06:10.780> oh<00:06:11.169> yeah<00:06:11.500> so<00:06:11.710> both<00:06:12.220> eyes<00:06:12.430> if

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
many this sucks everyone hundreds what

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.160 
many this sucks everyone hundreds what
let<00:06:20.790> me<00:06:20.910> leave<00:06:21.120> that<00:06:21.270> in<00:06:21.390> there<00:06:21.510> or<00:06:21.720> take<00:06:22.020> it

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
let me leave that in there or take it

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.130 
let me leave that in there or take it
out<00:06:22.320> or<00:06:22.500> what<00:06:22.620> do<00:06:22.890> you<00:06:22.950> normally<00:06:23.040> doing<00:06:23.430> that

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
out or what do you normally doing that

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.340 
out or what do you normally doing that
but<00:06:25.520> typically<00:06:26.520> if<00:06:26.820> you<00:06:27.300> can<00:06:27.570> get<00:06:27.900> them<00:06:28.110> out

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
but typically if you can get them out

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.530 
but typically if you can get them out
now<00:06:28.830> not<00:06:29.070> of<00:06:29.220> the<00:06:29.370> eye<00:06:29.400> now<00:06:29.970> I'm<00:06:30.090> not<00:06:30.300> convinced

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
now not of the eye now I'm not convinced

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.090 
now not of the eye now I'm not convinced
it<00:06:30.840> will<00:06:30.930> take<00:06:31.170> them<00:06:31.320> that<00:06:31.530> that's<00:06:31.740> up<00:06:31.920> to

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
it will take them that that's up to

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.650 
it will take them that that's up to
specialists<00:06:32.700> to<00:06:32.930> to<00:06:34.820> say<00:06:35.820> if<00:06:36.120> they<00:06:36.300> should<00:06:36.540> be

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
specialists to to say if they should be

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.270 
specialists to to say if they should be
removed<00:06:36.960> or<00:06:37.110> not<00:06:37.290> but<00:06:37.500> chances<00:06:37.890> are<00:06:38.040> they'll

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
removed or not but chances are they'll

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.140 
removed or not but chances are they'll
leave<00:06:38.580> them<00:06:38.850> I<00:06:39.060> would<00:06:39.990> think<00:06:40.200> and<00:06:41.010> then<00:06:41.490> mother

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
leave them I would think and then mother

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.910 
leave them I would think and then mother
nature<00:06:42.240> is<00:06:42.540> pretty<00:06:42.750> kind<00:06:42.990> if<00:06:43.320> we<00:06:43.500> can<00:06:43.620> just<00:06:43.650> get

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
nature is pretty kind if we can just get

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.140 
nature is pretty kind if we can just get
them<00:06:43.980> to<00:06:44.190> heal<00:06:44.370> then<00:06:44.730> we<00:06:44.850> worry<00:06:45.090> about

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
them to heal then we worry about

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.930 
them to heal then we worry about
secondary<00:06:45.930> glaucoma<00:06:46.590> issues<00:06:47.280> like<00:06:47.460> that<00:06:47.730> but
