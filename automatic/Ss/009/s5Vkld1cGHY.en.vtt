about this mask is sometimes with masks

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.580 
about this mask is sometimes with masks
after<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> take<00:00:51.840> them<00:00:51.989> off<00:00:52.140> when<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> wash

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
after you take them off when you wash

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.770 
after you take them off when you wash
them<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> everything<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:54.360> skin<00:00:54.570> can

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
them up and everything your skin can

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
them up and everything your skin can
feel<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.170> bit<00:00:55.379> dry<00:00:55.949> or<00:00:57.620> they<00:00:58.620> cracked

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
feel a little bit dry or they cracked

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.799 
feel a little bit dry or they cracked
unless<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.789> cracked<00:01:00.030> feeling<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.510> sort<00:01:00.719> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
unless they cracked feeling but sort of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.189 
unless they cracked feeling but sort of
um<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.550> does<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.809> bit

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
um and this does not do that one bit

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
um and this does not do that one bit
because<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.920> has<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> lot<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> moisturizers<00:01:06.240> in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
because it has a lot of moisturizers in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.750 
because it has a lot of moisturizers in
it<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> avocado<00:01:07.220> your<00:01:08.220> skin<00:01:08.430> feels

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it like the avocado your skin feels

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.969 
it like the avocado your skin feels
really<00:01:08.909> clean<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.020> feels<00:01:10.260> moisturize

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
really clean but it feels moisturize

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.859 
really clean but it feels moisturize
when<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.369> done<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> usually<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.750> don't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
when you're done and usually I don't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.090 
when you're done and usually I don't
even<00:01:13.049> need<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> put<00:01:13.470> moisturizer<00:01:13.710> on

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
even need to put moisturizer on

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
even need to put moisturizer on
afterwards<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:14.909> my<00:01:15.060> skin<00:01:15.299> feels<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.750> soft

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
afterwards because my skin feels so soft

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.670 
afterwards because my skin feels so soft
and<00:01:16.400> moisturized<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.470> great
