00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

okay<00:00:00.690> so<00:00:00.750> what<00:00:01.110> we're<00:00:01.230> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.380> look<00:00:01.560> at<00:00:01.709> now

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
okay so what we're going to look at now

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.910 
okay so what we're going to look at now
is<00:00:02.220> building<00:00:02.669> out<00:00:02.820> config<00:00:03.510> class<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:04.859> is

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
is building out config class and this is

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.010 
is building out config class and this is
going<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.190> allow<00:00:05.549> us<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.790> draw<00:00:06.240> any<00:00:06.569> option

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
going to allow us to draw any option

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.100 
going to allow us to draw any option
that<00:00:07.109> we<00:00:07.259> want<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.220> really<00:00:08.490> cool<00:00:08.820> way<00:00:09.150> from

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
that we want in a really cool way from

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.680 
that we want in a really cool way from
our<00:00:10.200> config<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:11.429> we<00:00:11.519> created<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.240> init

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
our config that we created it in init

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.200 
our config that we created it in init
dot<00:00:12.840> PHP<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.219> defined<00:00:14.610> our<00:00:14.790> configuration

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
dot PHP so we defined our configuration

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.010 
dot PHP so we defined our configuration
here<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.770> course<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.400> could<00:00:17.699> when<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.539> are

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
here of course we could when we are

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.620 
here of course we could when we are
accessing<00:00:19.529> our<00:00:19.740> config<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.300> set<00:00:21.510> this

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
accessing our config because we set this

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.230 
accessing our config because we set this
as<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.900> global<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:23.220> could<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.609> course<00:00:23.640> do

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
as a global we could of course do

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.070 
as a global we could of course do
something<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.170> following<00:00:28.550> MySQL<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
something like the following MySQL and

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.440 
something like the following MySQL and
host<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.439> example<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.820> could<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.210> course

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
host for example so we could of course

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.860 
host for example so we could of course
do<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.610> but<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.059> little<00:00:36.329> messy<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
do this but this is a little messy and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.510 
do this but this is a little messy and
what<00:00:37.140> happens<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.829> ahead<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.190> change

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
what happens if we go ahead and change

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.270 
what happens if we go ahead and change
the<00:00:38.730> name<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.090> our<00:00:39.210> our<00:00:40.140> config<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.980> something

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the name of our our config to something

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.360 
the name of our our config to something
else<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.760> example<00:00:42.559> now<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:44.100> we're<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
else for example now what we're going to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.060 
else for example now what we're going to
do<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.640> build<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.329> class<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.140> essentially

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
do is build this class and essentially

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
do is build this class and essentially
it's<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.430> allow<00:00:47.700> us<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.059> access<00:00:48.239> our

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it's going to allow us to access our

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.549 
it's going to allow us to access our
config<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.579> super<00:00:51.059> easy<00:00:51.300> way<00:00:51.570> using<00:00:52.140> forward

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
config in a super easy way using forward

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.139 
config in a super easy way using forward
slash<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.070> almost<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> directory

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
slash is almost like a directory

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.600 
slash is almost like a directory
separator<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> end<00:00:55.620> result<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.370> want

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
separator so the end result that we want

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.400 
separator so the end result that we want
is<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.210> able<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.510> say<00:00:57.780> something<00:00:58.260> like<00:01:00.410> echo

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
is to be able to say something like echo

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.490 
is to be able to say something like echo
config<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> say<00:01:04.379> some

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
config get and then we want to say some

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.969 
config get and then we want to say some
that<00:01:04.680> MySQL<00:01:05.360> host<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.770> want

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that MySQL host and that's what we want

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
that MySQL host and that's what we want
to<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.150> output

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to do and that's going to then output

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.560 
to do and that's going to then output
one<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.140> seven<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.220> dot<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:12.299> what

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
one to seven or not dot one that's what

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.570 
one to seven or not dot one that's what
we<00:01:12.689> want<00:01:12.930> because<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.650> makes<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.220> sort<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
we want because it just makes it sort of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.350 
we want because it just makes it sort of

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
abstracts you know using native

abstracts you know using native
functionality<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.689> accessing<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:20.000> Global's

array<00:01:22.130> on<00:01:23.130> its<00:01:23.460> own<00:01:23.610> let's<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.570> ahead<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
array on its own let's go ahead and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
array on its own let's go ahead and
build<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.500> too<00:01:25.680> difficult<00:01:26.220> but

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
build this it's not too difficult but

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
build this it's not too difficult but
there's<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.869> things<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
there's a little things in here that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
there's a little things in here that
might<00:01:29.100> confuse<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.720> them<00:01:30.810> things

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
might confuse so it's one of them things

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
might confuse so it's one of them things
that<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.710> build<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.400> afterwards<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.060> can

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that we build but then afterwards we can

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.300 
that we build but then afterwards we can
sort<00:01:33.479> sit<00:01:33.689> back<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.960> relax<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.470> say<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.829> can

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
sort sit back and relax and say I can

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
sort sit back and relax and say I can
pull<00:01:35.490> config<00:01:35.909> from<00:01:36.000> anywhere<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.110> works

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
pull config from anywhere and this works

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.819 
pull config from anywhere and this works
at<00:01:37.740> any<00:01:37.950> level<00:01:38.310> deep<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.439> go

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
at any level deep as well you can go

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.730 
at any level deep as well you can go
into<00:01:41.329> I<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.409> could<00:01:43.560> say

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
into I don't know you could say

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.010 
into I don't know you could say
something<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.100> more<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:45.720> create<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
something like more and then create a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.980 
something like more and then create a
new<00:01:46.049> array<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.890> go<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.790> much<00:01:48.030> deeper<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
new array and go go much deeper into the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.620 
new array and go go much deeper into the
array<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.649> config<00:01:50.159> class<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.299> still

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
array and this config class would still

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660 
array and this config class would still
work<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.710> sort<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> bulletproof<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
work so it's sort of bulletproof in the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.069 
work so it's sort of bulletproof in the
sense<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.090> whatever<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.570> add<00:01:54.720> into<00:01:55.049> your

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
sense that whatever you add into your

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.480 
sense that whatever you add into your
config<00:01:55.560> you'll<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.340> able<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.610> access<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
config you'll be able to access so the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.709 
config you'll be able to access so the
class<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.149> called<00:02:00.329> config

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
class is going to be called config

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.389 
class is going to be called config
remember<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:01.710> need<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.920> require<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
remember we don't need to require this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.889 
remember we don't need to require this
any<00:02:02.610> works<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.880> already<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.270> an<00:02:03.390> autoloader

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
any works we already have an autoloader

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.510 
any works we already have an autoloader
so<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.409> test<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.100> index<00:02:05.340> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so we can test this out on the index to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.119 
so we can test this out on the index to
index<00:02:05.880> dot<00:02:06.060> PHP<00:02:06.439> we<00:02:07.439> don't<00:02:07.619> need<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.770> require

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
index dot PHP we don't need to require

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.800 
index dot PHP we don't need to require
it<00:02:08.280> anywhere<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.179> we're<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.569> one

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
it anywhere so we're going to have one

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.130 
it anywhere so we're going to have one
function<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:10.860> why

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
function in here or why

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.960 
function in here or why
method<00:02:11.530> rather<00:02:11.710> it's<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.550> be<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> static

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
method rather it's going to be a static

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.740 
method rather it's going to be a static
method<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:13.900> have<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.319> public<00:02:14.890> static

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
method so we have a public static

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.270 
method so we have a public static
function<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.830> just<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.160> be

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
function and this is just going to be

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.760 
function and this is just going to be
called<00:02:18.459> get<00:02:18.730> now<00:02:19.600> instead<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:19.959> get<00:02:20.290> we<00:02:20.500> want<00:02:20.650> to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
called get now instead of get we want to

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.520 
called get now instead of get we want to
define<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.250> path<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.180> path<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.410> we're

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
define the path so that path and we're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.140 
define the path so that path and we're
going<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.709> set<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.130> as<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> default<00:02:24.670> value<00:02:24.760> of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
going to set that as a default value of

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.270 
going to set that as a default value of
null<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.020> check<00:02:26.200> if<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.530> exists

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
null just so we can check if it exists

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.080 
null just so we can check if it exists
so<00:02:28.030> inside<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.080> want<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.380> say<00:02:29.530> if<00:02:30.090> path

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
so inside of here we want to say if path

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.699 
so inside of here we want to say if path
so<00:02:31.450> we<00:02:31.480> want<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.750> make<00:02:31.870> sure<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.170> path<00:02:32.440> has

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
so we want to make sure that path has

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.150 
so we want to make sure that path has
been<00:02:32.950> passed<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:34.060> method<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.709> now<00:02:35.950> what

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
been passed to this method so now what

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.590 
been passed to this method so now what
we're<00:02:36.280> going<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.430> do<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> create<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.150> variable

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
we're going to do is create a variable

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.229 
we're going to do is create a variable
to<00:02:37.860> basically<00:02:38.860> define<00:02:39.310> where<00:02:39.610> our<00:02:39.790> conflicts

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
to basically define where our conflicts

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.910 
to basically define where our conflicts
coming<00:02:40.569> from<00:02:40.750> just<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:41.170> we<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.410> make<00:02:41.560> things<00:02:41.800> a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
coming from just so we can make things a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.850 
coming from just so we can make things a
little<00:02:42.010> bit<00:02:42.250> easier<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.270> we<00:02:43.360> can<00:02:43.480> just<00:02:43.600> put

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
little bit easier so we can just put

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.750 
little bit easier so we can just put
essentially<00:02:44.860> going<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> say<00:02:45.250> config<00:02:45.880> equals

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
essentially going to say config equals

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.550 
essentially going to say config equals
Global's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
Global's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.199 
Global's
config<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.680> that's<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:51.790> now<00:02:51.910> have<00:02:52.090> this

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
config and that's it so we now have this

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.030 
config and that's it so we now have this
configure<00:02:52.810> variable<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.320> we<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.620> use<00:02:53.800> down

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
configure variable that we can use down

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.850 
configure variable that we can use down
here<00:02:54.510> makes<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.660> life<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.200> lot<00:02:56.260> easier<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.769> we'd

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
here makes it life a lot easier so we'd

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.800 
here makes it life a lot easier so we'd
have<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.160> keep<00:02:57.430> repeating<00:02:57.760> ourselves<00:02:58.239> with

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
have to keep repeating ourselves with

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.979 
have to keep repeating ourselves with
this<00:02:59.070> so<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.190> path<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:01.030> going<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.450> be<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.810> path

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
this so the path is going to be the path

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.720 
this so the path is going to be the path
that's<00:03:02.170> passed<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.160> let's<00:03:03.340> go<00:03:03.430> ahead<00:03:03.610> and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
that's passed in so let's go ahead and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.750 
that's passed in so let's go ahead and
just<00:03:04.140> just<00:03:05.140> use<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.800> class<00:03:06.160> basically<00:03:06.519> we

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
just just use this class basically we

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.009 
just just use this class basically we
haven't<00:03:07.000> built<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.330> entirely<00:03:07.630> yet

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
haven't built it entirely yet

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.570 
haven't built it entirely yet
let's<00:03:08.470> go<00:03:08.560> ahead<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.830> use<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.310> we<00:03:09.430> just

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
let's go ahead and use it like we just

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.100 
let's go ahead and use it like we just
saw<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.750> I'm<00:03:10.840> going<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.019> say<00:03:11.230> MySQL<00:03:12.209> host<00:03:13.209> so

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
saw so I'm going to say MySQL host so

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.690 
saw so I'm going to say MySQL host so
I'm<00:03:14.200> going<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.470> assume<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.340> going<00:03:15.489> to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
I'm going to assume this is going to

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.210 
I'm going to assume this is going to
output<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.260> that's<00:03:17.440> what<00:03:17.799> we<00:03:17.950> want<00:03:18.100> to

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
output this and that's what we want to

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.720 
output this and that's what we want to
achieve<00:03:18.340> by<00:03:18.850> creating<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.470> path<00:03:20.829> we

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
achieve by creating this so the path we

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.060 
achieve by creating this so the path we
want<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.030> explode<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:23.140> explode<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.739> going<00:03:23.950> to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
want to explode so explode is going to

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.069 
want to explode so explode is going to
take<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.519> character<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.180> we<00:03:25.299> want<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.540> explode

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
take a character that we want to explode

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.620 
take a character that we want to explode
by<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.709> it's<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.850> basically<00:03:28.120> give<00:03:28.600> us

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
by and it's going to basically give us

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.509 
by and it's going to basically give us
an<00:03:28.870> array<00:03:29.110> back<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:29.980> let's<00:03:30.100> go<00:03:30.220> ahead<00:03:30.400> and

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
an array back so let's go ahead and

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.819 
an array back so let's go ahead and
print<00:03:30.760> our<00:03:31.120> on<00:03:31.540> path<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.410> that's<00:03:32.530> just<00:03:32.739> going

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
print our on path and that's just going

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.560 
print our on path and that's just going
to<00:03:32.920> show<00:03:33.130> us<00:03:33.280> what<00:03:33.430> we<00:03:33.579> what<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.060> see<00:03:34.299> here

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
to show us what we what we see here

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.690 
to show us what we what we see here
let's<00:03:35.170> open<00:03:35.290> our<00:03:35.500> browser<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.100> refresh<00:03:36.190> and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
let's open our browser and refresh and

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.130 
let's open our browser and refresh and
we<00:03:36.790> can<00:03:36.940> see<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.150> we've<00:03:37.360> got<00:03:37.510> an<00:03:37.630> array<00:03:37.720> now

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
we can see that we've got an array now

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.280 
we can see that we've got an array now
of<00:03:38.290> two<00:03:38.500> elements<00:03:38.950> one<00:03:39.459> MySQL<00:03:40.150> one<00:03:40.360> host<00:03:40.630> so

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
of two elements one MySQL one host so

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.870 
of two elements one MySQL one host so
you<00:03:41.350> can<00:03:41.500> start<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.860> see<00:03:42.070> now<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:42.310> as<00:03:42.640> we've

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
you can start to see now that as we've

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.550 
you can start to see now that as we've
broken<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.390> up<00:03:43.540> it's<00:03:43.989> going<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.170> make<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.500> a

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
broken this up it's going to make it a

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.259 
broken this up it's going to make it a
lot<00:03:44.709> easier<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.220> find<00:03:45.700> what<00:03:45.850> we're<00:03:46.000> looking

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
lot easier to find what we're looking

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.789 
lot easier to find what we're looking
for<00:03:46.299> here<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:46.959> why<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.140> asked<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.440> out<00:03:47.590> and

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
for here and why I asked you out and

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.330 
for here and why I asked you out and
host<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.660> now<00:03:49.780> what<00:03:49.989> we<00:03:50.079> want<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.350> do<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.739> we

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
host so now what we want to do is we

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.280 
host so now what we want to do is we
want<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.640> loop<00:03:51.880> through<00:03:52.299> these<00:03:52.540> pieces<00:03:53.049> that

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
want to loop through these pieces that

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.800 
want to loop through these pieces that
we've<00:03:53.410> broken<00:03:53.920> up<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:54.610> we<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.150> course<00:03:55.420> create<00:03:55.780> a

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
we've broken up so we of course create a

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.840 
we've broken up so we of course create a
for<00:03:56.110> each<00:03:56.290> loop<00:03:56.320> to<00:03:56.860> loop<00:03:56.890> each<00:03:57.250> element<00:03:57.760> of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
for each loop to loop each element of

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.660 
for each loop to loop each element of
this<00:03:58.030> array<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:59.079> we<00:03:59.230> have<00:03:59.470> for<00:04:00.070> each<00:04:00.100> path

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
this array and we have for each path

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.460 
this array and we have for each path
which<00:04:01.299> is<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.630> array<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.170> we've<00:04:02.260> just

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
which is the array that we've just

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.060 
which is the array that we've just
created<00:04:02.680> as<00:04:03.480> bit<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:05.380> here<00:04:05.590> now<00:04:05.769> we<00:04:05.829> have

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
created as bit so in here now we have

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.050 
created as bit so in here now we have
access<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:06.549> bit<00:04:07.090> so<00:04:07.690> if<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.959> was<00:04:08.109> to<00:04:08.230> echo<00:04:08.650> bit<00:04:09.370> we

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
access to bit so if I was to echo bit we

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.479 
access to bit so if I was to echo bit we
would<00:04:10.239> get<00:04:10.530> just<00:04:11.530> pop<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.739> space<00:04:12.070> on<00:04:12.280> there

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
would get just pop a space on there

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.479 
would get just pop a space on there
you'd<00:04:13.299> see<00:04:13.329> that<00:04:13.630> we<00:04:13.690> get<00:04:13.930> MySQL<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:14.920> host<00:04:15.160> so

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
you'd see that we get MySQL and host so

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.460 
you'd see that we get MySQL and host so
we<00:04:15.579> now<00:04:15.730> have<00:04:15.970> access<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.630> each<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:17.019> these<00:04:17.140> bits

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
we now have access to each of these bits

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.490 
we now have access to each of these bits
that<00:04:18.340> we've<00:04:18.430> defined<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.900> we<00:04:20.019> want<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.229> check

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
that we've defined so we want to check

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.029 
that we've defined so we want to check
if<00:04:20.830> these<00:04:21.430> are<00:04:21.729> set<00:04:22.150> in<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.570> config<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.560> we<00:04:23.860> can

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
if these are set in the config so we can

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:24.790 
if these are set in the config so we can
use<00:04:24.220> the

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
use the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.350 
use the
set<00:04:27.400> language<00:04:28.400> construct<00:04:28.909> and<00:04:29.180> say<00:04:29.599> config

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
set language construct and say config

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.800 
set language construct and say config
bit<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:36.050> now<00:04:36.229> what's<00:04:36.470> going<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.620> happen<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:37.069> if

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
bit so now what's going to happen is if

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.610 
bit so now what's going to happen is if
config<00:04:39.759> so<00:04:40.759> this<00:04:40.879> config<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:42.050> bit<00:04:42.349> here

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
config so this config and this bit here

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.670 
config so this config and this bit here
is<00:04:42.680> set<00:04:43.360> then<00:04:44.360> we<00:04:44.509> can<00:04:44.659> go<00:04:44.750> ahead<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.229> set<00:04:45.650> it

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
is set then we can go ahead and set it

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.270 
is set then we can go ahead and set it
so<00:04:46.550> let's<00:04:47.000> go<00:04:47.150> ahead<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.389> check<00:04:47.750> this<00:04:47.900> out

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
so let's go ahead and check this out

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.790 
so let's go ahead and check this out
there<00:04:49.280> now<00:04:49.729> only<00:04:49.970> echoes<00:04:50.360> once<00:04:50.750> now<00:04:51.139> why<00:04:51.740> is

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
there now only echoes once now why is

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.460 
there now only echoes once now why is
this<00:04:52.220> well<00:04:52.610> if<00:04:52.909> we<00:04:53.449> look<00:04:53.720> at<00:04:53.810> this<00:04:53.930> code

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
this well if we look at this code

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.240 
this well if we look at this code
carefully<00:04:54.740> if<00:04:55.310> is<00:04:55.729> set<00:04:56.060> config<00:04:56.599> bit<00:04:57.129> that<00:04:58.129> will

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
carefully if is set config bit that will

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.080 
carefully if is set config bit that will
be<00:04:58.400> MySQL<00:04:58.870> host<00:04:59.870> isn't<00:05:00.229> set<00:05:00.560> inside<00:05:00.830> config<00:05:01.490> so

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
be MySQL host isn't set inside config so

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.240 
be MySQL host isn't set inside config so
what<00:05:02.240> we<00:05:02.360> really<00:05:02.659> need<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.840> do<00:05:03.080> here<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:03.740> we

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
what we really need to do here is we

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.800 
what we really need to do here is we
need<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.669> set<00:05:05.379> our<00:05:06.379> config<00:05:07.039> equal<00:05:07.639> to<00:05:07.969> config

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
need to set our config equal to config

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.649 
need to set our config equal to config
and<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.199> bit<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:09.979> here<00:05:10.520> we<00:05:10.969> say<00:05:11.150> config

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
and that bit so here we say config

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:17.320 
and that bit so here we say config
equals<00:05:12.550> config<00:05:14.560> bit<00:05:15.639> so<00:05:16.639> what's<00:05:16.819> now<00:05:17.030> going<00:05:17.090> to

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
equals config bit so what's now going to

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.300 
equals config bit so what's now going to
happen<00:05:17.599> is<00:05:17.750> we're<00:05:17.990> going<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.169> return<00:05:19.240> this

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
happen is we're going to return this

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.619 
happen is we're going to return this
we're<00:05:22.310> going<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.460> return<00:05:22.729> this<00:05:22.940> value<00:05:23.300> so

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
we're going to return this value so

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.119 
we're going to return this value so
return<00:05:25.360> config<00:05:26.360> now<00:05:27.199> let's<00:05:27.469> take<00:05:27.650> a<00:05:27.680> look<00:05:27.919> at

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
return config now let's take a look at

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.420 
return config now let's take a look at
what<00:05:28.280> happens<00:05:28.669> when<00:05:28.969> we<00:05:30.009> let<00:05:31.009> yeah<00:05:31.219> let's

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
what happens when we let yeah let's

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.999 
what happens when we let yeah let's
check<00:05:31.490> we're<00:05:31.729> out<00:05:32.289> there<00:05:33.289> we<00:05:33.409> go<00:05:33.529> and<00:05:33.770> we<00:05:33.860> have

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
check we're out there we go and we have

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.360 
check we're out there we go and we have
one<00:05:34.219> one<00:05:35.029> two<00:05:35.240> 7.1.1<00:05:35.900> done<00:05:36.560> or<00:05:36.710> done<00:05:36.860> order<00:05:37.159> one

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
one one two 7.1.1 done or done order one

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.390 
one one two 7.1.1 done or done order one
so<00:05:38.090> what<00:05:38.449> has<00:05:38.539> happened<00:05:38.569> here<00:05:39.169> is<00:05:39.370> for<00:05:40.370> each

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
so what has happened here is for each

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.240 
so what has happened here is for each
one<00:05:40.819> if<00:05:41.150> it's<00:05:41.479> set<00:05:41.810> we're<00:05:42.080> setting<00:05:42.529> the<00:05:42.650> config

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
one if it's set we're setting the config

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.200 
one if it's set we're setting the config
to<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.750> bit<00:05:45.529> that<00:05:45.740> we<00:05:45.830> want<00:05:46.069> so<00:05:46.400> for<00:05:46.849> the<00:05:46.969> first

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
to the bit that we want so for the first

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.659 
to the bit that we want so for the first
loop<00:05:47.479> we're<00:05:47.750> going<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:47.960> say<00:05:48.139> does<00:05:48.830> mysql

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
loop we're going to say does mysql

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.510 
loop we're going to say does mysql
existence<00:05:50.180> like<00:05:50.360> config<00:05:50.779> if<00:05:51.169> it<00:05:51.560> does<00:05:51.830> we're

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
existence like config if it does we're

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.990 
existence like config if it does we're
setting<00:05:52.909> config<00:05:53.509> to<00:05:54.050> mysql<00:05:54.979> so<00:05:55.639> then<00:05:55.789> for<00:05:55.940> the

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
setting config to mysql so then for the

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.990 
setting config to mysql so then for the
next<00:05:56.270> loop<00:05:56.629> does<00:05:57.110> host<00:05:57.469> exists<00:05:58.069> in<00:05:58.310> config

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
next loop does host exists in config

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.510 
next loop does host exists in config
because<00:05:59.330> now<00:05:59.509> config<00:06:00.020> equals<00:06:00.409> mysql<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:01.159> then

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
because now config equals mysql and then

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.580 
because now config equals mysql and then
we<00:06:01.610> end<00:06:01.819> up<00:06:01.879> with<00:06:02.029> this<00:06:02.090> piece<00:06:02.330> here<00:06:02.539> so<00:06:03.259> that

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
we end up with this piece here so that

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.519 
we end up with this piece here so that
is<00:06:03.740> literally<00:06:04.159> all<00:06:04.490> we<00:06:05.120> need<00:06:05.300> to<00:06:05.449> do<00:06:05.629> the<00:06:06.349> last

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529 
is literally all we need to do the last

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:08.709 
is literally all we need to do the last
thing<00:06:06.740> i'm<00:06:06.860> going<00:06:06.919> to<00:06:07.069> do<00:06:07.219> is<00:06:07.430> just<00:06:07.849> outside

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 
thing i'm going to do is just outside

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.110 
thing i'm going to do is just outside
this<00:06:09.050> I'm<00:06:09.349> going<00:06:09.469> to<00:06:09.529> return<00:06:09.860> false<00:06:10.250> so<00:06:10.909> if<00:06:10.940> we

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
this I'm going to return false so if we

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.689 
this I'm going to return false so if we
don't<00:06:11.300> have<00:06:11.599> anything<00:06:12.190> existing<00:06:13.190> here<00:06:13.370> so<00:06:13.550> for

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
don't have anything existing here so for

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.390 
don't have anything existing here so for
example<00:06:14.120> MySQL<00:06:14.690> host

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
example MySQL host

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.400 
example MySQL host
hello<00:06:16.400> and<00:06:17.169> if<00:06:18.169> we<00:06:18.319> do<00:06:18.500> var<00:06:19.270> dump<00:06:20.270> on<00:06:20.569> that

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
hello and if we do var dump on that

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.520 
hello and if we do var dump on that
and<00:06:23.190> we<00:06:24.060> go<00:06:24.210> ahead<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:24.720> open<00:06:24.810> our<00:06:25.050> browser<00:06:25.230> and

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
and we go ahead and open our browser and

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.400 
and we go ahead and open our browser and
refresh<00:06:25.740> you<00:06:26.370> can<00:06:26.520> see<00:06:26.760> oh<00:06:26.940> oh<00:06:27.300> of<00:06:27.900> course<00:06:27.960> no

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
refresh you can see oh oh of course no

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.590 
refresh you can see oh oh of course no
so<00:06:28.800> we<00:06:28.920> can<00:06:29.130> define<00:06:29.520> her<00:06:29.970> actually<00:06:30.420> the<00:06:30.510> way

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
so we can define her actually the way

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.150 
so we can define her actually the way
our<00:06:30.720> codes<00:06:30.990> written<00:06:31.230> we<00:06:31.290> can<00:06:31.530> define<00:06:31.950> this

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
our codes written we can define this

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160 
our codes written we can define this
because<00:06:32.550> this<00:06:32.940> doesn't<00:06:33.210> exist<00:06:33.600> so<00:06:33.810> it's<00:06:33.960> still

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
because this doesn't exist so it's still

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.440 
because this doesn't exist so it's still
returning<00:06:34.500> config<00:06:35.010> but<00:06:35.670> if<00:06:35.760> for<00:06:35.880> example<00:06:35.940> we

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
returning config but if for example we

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.150 
returning config but if for example we
were<00:06:36.600> to<00:06:36.750> say<00:06:37.040> hello<00:06:38.040> host<00:06:38.400> there<00:06:40.010> that<00:06:41.010> will

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
were to say hello host there that will

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.970 
were to say hello host there that will
then<00:06:41.340> be<00:06:42.410> of<00:06:43.410> course<00:06:43.650> because<00:06:43.830> we're

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
then be of course because we're

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.040 
then be of course because we're
returning<00:06:44.340> out<00:06:44.640> we<00:06:45.060> returning<00:06:45.360> our<00:06:45.510> config

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
returning out we returning our config

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.660 
returning out we returning our config
anyway<00:06:47.150> if<00:06:48.150> the<00:06:48.420> path<00:06:48.660> is<00:06:48.900> actually<00:06:49.080> set<00:06:49.590> so<00:06:50.400> I

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
anyway if the path is actually set so I

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.490 
anyway if the path is actually set so I
guess<00:06:50.940> in<00:06:51.090> that<00:06:51.150> case<00:06:51.510> the<00:06:51.720> only<00:06:51.750> way<00:06:52.260> that

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
guess in that case the only way that

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.780 
guess in that case the only way that
we're<00:06:52.650> only<00:06:52.770> gonna<00:06:53.100> we're<00:06:53.430> only<00:06:53.580> going<00:06:53.730> to

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
we're only gonna we're only going to

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.530 
we're only gonna we're only going to
return<00:06:54.060> false<00:06:54.390> is<00:06:54.750> if<00:06:56.000> that<00:06:57.000> like<00:06:57.150> that

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
return false is if that like that

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.360 
return false is if that like that
so<00:06:57.810> something<00:06:58.140> you<00:06:58.170> might<00:06:58.470> want<00:06:58.680> to<00:06:58.770> do<00:06:59.040> as<00:06:59.340> a

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
so something you might want to do as a

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.000 
so something you might want to do as a
sort<00:06:59.670> of<00:06:59.700> side<00:06:59.970> thing<00:07:00.330> is<00:07:00.570> actually<00:07:01.200> check<00:07:01.800> for

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
sort of side thing is actually check for

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.530 
sort of side thing is actually check for
things<00:07:02.130> like<00:07:02.280> this<00:07:02.520> because<00:07:02.790> obviously<00:07:03.120> this

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
things like this because obviously this

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.240 
things like this because obviously this
hasn't<00:07:03.750> been<00:07:03.930> factored<00:07:04.410> in<00:07:04.530> this<00:07:04.800> code<00:07:05.070> that

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
hasn't been factored in this code that

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.890 
hasn't been factored in this code that
I've<00:07:05.310> written<00:07:05.520> but<00:07:06.450> you<00:07:06.540> might<00:07:06.690> want<00:07:06.870> to

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
I've written but you might want to

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.270 
I've written but you might want to
actually<00:07:07.020> check<00:07:07.350> if<00:07:07.500> things<00:07:07.710> exist<00:07:08.100> I<00:07:08.250> mean

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
actually check if things exist I mean

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.850 
actually check if things exist I mean
this<00:07:08.790> isn't<00:07:09.090> necessarily<00:07:09.930> a<00:07:10.110> problem<00:07:10.170> because

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
this isn't necessarily a problem because

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.310 
this isn't necessarily a problem because
if<00:07:11.040> if<00:07:11.340> our<00:07:11.550> config<00:07:11.970> file<00:07:12.180> is<00:07:12.450> if<00:07:12.780> our<00:07:12.990> config

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
if if our config file is if our config

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.580 
if if our config file is if our config
stuff<00:07:13.530> is<00:07:13.710> there<00:07:14.300> then<00:07:15.300> we<00:07:15.660> we<00:07:16.080> saw<00:07:16.350> have

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
stuff is there then we we saw have

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.200 
stuff is there then we we saw have
control<00:07:17.040> over<00:07:17.070> that<00:07:17.370> it's<00:07:17.640> not<00:07:17.760> a<00:07:17.790> user

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
control over that it's not a user

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.570 
control over that it's not a user
controlled<00:07:18.720> thing<00:07:18.960> so<00:07:19.230> you<00:07:20.040> know<00:07:20.160> no<00:07:20.370> one's

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
controlled thing so you know no one's

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.160 
controlled thing so you know no one's
necessarily<00:07:21.300> going<00:07:21.480> to<00:07:21.570> be<00:07:21.630> there<00:07:21.840> to<00:07:21.990> mess

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.170 
necessarily going to be there to mess

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.880 
necessarily going to be there to mess
around<00:07:22.290> with<00:07:22.530> it<00:07:22.740> but<00:07:23.130> overall<00:07:24.350> if<00:07:25.350> we<00:07:25.620> would

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:25.890 
around with it but overall if we would

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.820 
around with it but overall if we would
change<00:07:26.190> this<00:07:26.310> back<00:07:26.520> to<00:07:26.550> MySQL<00:07:27.300> host<00:07:27.680> and<00:07:28.680> we

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
change this back to MySQL host and we

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.340 
change this back to MySQL host and we
refresh<00:07:29.250> we<00:07:29.280> can<00:07:29.550> now<00:07:29.850> get<00:07:30.210> specific<00:07:30.810> parts<00:07:31.170> of

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350 
refresh we can now get specific parts of

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.830 
refresh we can now get specific parts of
our<00:07:31.620> of<00:07:31.860> our<00:07:32.010> config<00:07:32.430> out<00:07:32.580> now<00:07:33.240> like<00:07:33.420> a<00:07:33.450> mention

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
our of our config out now like a mention

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.930 
our of our config out now like a mention
we<00:07:34.260> can<00:07:34.530> go<00:07:34.800> a<00:07:34.830> little<00:07:34.950> bit<00:07:35.130> further<00:07:35.490> so<00:07:35.910> you

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 
we can go a little bit further so you

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.570 
we can go a little bit further so you
can<00:07:36.330> create<00:07:36.660> a<00:07:36.780> new<00:07:37.140> array<00:07:37.740> inside<00:07:38.220> of<00:07:38.340> here

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 
can create a new array inside of here

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.300 
can create a new array inside of here
but<00:07:39.180> basically<00:07:39.990> now<00:07:40.140> we<00:07:40.200> can<00:07:40.530> access<00:07:40.740> all<00:07:41.190> of

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310 
but basically now we can access all of

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.270 
but basically now we can access all of
our<00:07:41.580> config<00:07:42.090> in<00:07:42.440> really<00:07:43.440> easy<00:07:43.740> to<00:07:44.070> remember

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 
our config in really easy to remember
