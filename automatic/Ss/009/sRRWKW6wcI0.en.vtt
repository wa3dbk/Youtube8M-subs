00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:10.309
 Hello junior high school two years science course the second minute 8-1 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:16.890
 Change this organism animal life you will learn about the discharge of unwanted substances 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:21.039
 Charge is in the Eagle full-time lecturer Let Thank you So start 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.930
 At first let's confirm about unnecessary substance in the body 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:31.940
 When life is active, cells perform various functions 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:37.820
 Lee can produce unnecessary substances such as carbon and ammonia in his body 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 These substances are not good for the body and must be taken out 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.890
 We call that work discharge 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:50.820
 At first it is carbon dioxide, but in the talk, it dissolves in the blood 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.050
 It is carried to the lungs by the flow of blood 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.280
 And yes it will be abolished by breathing 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 Another ammonia follows a complicated process 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.140
 House views that are relevant to the discharge of ammonia First, 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.140
 Let's confirm the work of 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.940
 Ammonia is highly toxic as it is 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.409
 It will be supported by those little bit more of the outside by the liver 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:27.700
 That is the urea that is written here 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:30.540
 And after this it is not the liver but another period to produce urea, but it will learn later 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.790
 As liver function 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.690
 Helps digest fat from the digestive tract 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.040
 This is quite important though 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.040
 Make bile 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.100
 Anything else 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:54.490
 Stores nutrients absorbed from the small intestine 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.440
 It is often the case that the name when it is stored is glycogen , but there is also a function that stores nutrients 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.440
 I will 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.880
 Furthermore , harmful substances in food 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:10.270
 For example, it has the function of decomposing alcohol etc. 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:13.300
 Thus, it is said that the liver has more than 500 functions when it is small . 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.220
 At first about these two 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.390
 Please say well remember 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.390
 Then let's move on to the next 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:33.960
 The kidneys are also involved in the discharge of urea that came out earlier 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.960
 Kidney comes with two around the waist 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.300
 It is an institution that is shaped like lame 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.000
 And 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:48.170
 In the blood 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.740
 Etc. Many became urea or unwanted materials are taken waist by this kidney 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.670
 It works like a filter so to speak 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:00.540
 And the unnecessary substance which is stricken with rare elephant is this 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.110
 Ureteral tube 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.670
 Through 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:16.650
 It has been transported to the bladder 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:16.650
 And in the assault, unnecessary substances are stored and finally discharged out of the body as strange. 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:29.350
 In this way, ammonia is supported by urea in the liver, which is collected in the kidneys, and finally the urine and 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.280
 Will be discharged 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.280
 Let's confirm firmly
