 in what a beautiful desire to buy more 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.600
 money for the can is down on 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.200
 the surprise 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.200
 I leave it 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.419
 so m with an error you have a f1 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.639
 in one city the Assistance 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.169
 braking because it is thus that 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.090
 easy to control the car 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.949
 is there suddenly so I had almost 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.780
 braking hosts during 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.120
 great tours and even in his video and 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.320
 also because they go back but from the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.220
 sotra swims because it's something 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.100
 thing leaves to hurry their 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.200
 families 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.100
 the fake so that's a little it can 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.640
 look yannick and ratonnades 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.640
 so 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.580
 completely demagogue as you see 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.800
 the assistance that I bought back 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.590
 as long as I say 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.120
 m without the moment I had no more 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.970
 three years i really keep 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.990
 instability even at siemens is a 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.210
 star game 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.320
 finally remaining would be precisely 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.780
 the stakes 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.780
 besides the stingers 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:07:07.220
 I think it put me at the back of it all 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:08.690
 but not okay as you ignore 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.259
 you see I just did two rounds that 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:14.419
 will report 8385 with machinists actually 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:16.550
 jumps or do we feel tools over 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:20.479
 Tournon reported on the 8th and 10th 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:25.190
 present this 4100 ex-ps and justin you are 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:27.460
 just by making the rate so this is 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.460
 really
