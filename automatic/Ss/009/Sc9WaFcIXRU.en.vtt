properly you're not going to stop get
your<00:01:47.529> suspension<00:01:47.709> checked<00:01:48.369> as<00:01:48.520> well

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
your suspension checked as well

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.659 
your suspension checked as well
the<00:01:49.359> suspension<00:01:50.079> absorbs<00:01:50.829> all<00:01:51.099> of<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.490> road

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:51.669 
the suspension absorbs all of the road

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:53.789 
the suspension absorbs all of the road
force<00:01:51.999> and<00:01:52.209> if<00:01:52.539> it's<00:01:52.719> loose<00:01:53.169> or<00:01:53.560> if<00:01:53.679> the

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
force and if it's loose or if the

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.809 
force and if it's loose or if the
components<00:01:54.249> aren't<00:01:54.399> working<00:01:54.669> correctly

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
components aren't working correctly

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.789 
components aren't working correctly
you're<00:01:55.419> just<00:01:55.599> simply<00:01:55.749> not<00:01:56.079> going<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.380> stop<00:01:56.619> as

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
you're just simply not going to stop as

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.889 
you're just simply not going to stop as
efficiently<00:01:57.279> as<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.520> could<00:01:57.969> all<00:01:58.389> of<00:01:58.749> these

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
efficiently as you could all of these

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.690 
efficiently as you could all of these
things<00:01:59.169> combined<00:01:59.590> you<00:02:00.009> should<00:02:00.219> simply<00:02:00.579> be

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
things combined you should simply be

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.130 
things combined you should simply be
able<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.999> avoid<00:02:01.359> an<00:02:01.689> accident<00:02:02.529> just<00:02:02.590> like<00:02:02.950> this
