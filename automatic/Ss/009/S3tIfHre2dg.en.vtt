00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
closer look at some of the small details

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.679 
closer look at some of the small details
unless<00:01:44.700> figure<00:01:45.590> his<00:01:46.590> hands<00:01:46.890> open<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.600> his

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
unless figure his hands open up and his

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
unless figure his hands open up and his
arms<00:01:48.960> move<00:01:49.170> around<00:01:49.909> just<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> other

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
arms move around just like the other

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.800 
arms move around just like the other
figure<00:01:52.670> just<00:01:53.670> weapon<00:01:54.030> right<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
figure just weapon right here the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
figure just weapon right here the
missiles<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.380> gonna<00:01:55.470> hinder<00:01:56.430> his<00:01:56.670> arm

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
missiles are gonna hinder his arm

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.770 
missiles are gonna hinder his arm
movement<00:01:57.930> his<00:01:58.380> head<00:01:58.590> rotates<00:01:59.780> that's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
movement his head rotates that's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.870 
movement his head rotates that's
basically<00:02:01.409> 180<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.369> can't<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
basically 180 because you can't get it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
basically 180 because you can't get it
all<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> way<00:02:03.240> around<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.290> actually<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
all the way around this is actually a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580 
all the way around this is actually a
rocket<00:02:05.189> launcher<00:02:06.229> essentially<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> rocket

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
rocket launcher essentially a rocket

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.350 
rocket launcher essentially a rocket
launcher<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.520> actually<00:02:08.759> shoots<00:02:09.179> out

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
launcher here that actually shoots out

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.500 
launcher here that actually shoots out
so<00:02:09.720> that's<00:02:09.810> pretty<00:02:10.110> cool

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.440 

that's<00:02:12.629> gone<00:02:13.310> shoots<00:02:14.310> out<00:02:14.459> pretty<00:02:14.700> well<00:02:14.909> too

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
that's gone shoots out pretty well too

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.679 
that's gone shoots out pretty well too
these<00:02:16.110> figures<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.709> really<00:02:16.950> poseable<00:02:17.689> but

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
these figures are really poseable but

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.420 
these figures are really poseable but
you<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:18.959> tell<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.470> mean<00:02:19.620> everything<00:02:20.159> in<00:02:20.280> this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
you can tell I mean everything in this

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.390 
you can tell I mean everything in this
is<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:21.110> meant<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.849> poseable<00:02:24.739> many<00:02:25.739> joints

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
is just meant to be poseable many joints

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
is just meant to be poseable many joints
so<00:02:26.970> yeah<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> mean<00:02:27.450> basically<00:02:28.049> anything<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
so yeah I mean basically anything you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.470 
so yeah I mean basically anything you
can<00:02:28.709> imagine

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
can imagine

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
can imagine
just<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.750> Bionicles<00:02:31.500> they<00:02:32.310> can<00:02:32.489> pose<00:02:32.849> in

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
just like the Bionicles they can pose in

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.500 
just like the Bionicles they can pose in
those<00:02:33.739> certain<00:02:34.739> situations<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:36.180> armor<00:02:36.480> on

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
those certain situations the armor on

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.309 
those certain situations the armor on
this<00:02:37.040> figure<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.430> these<00:02:39.299> are<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.599> plastic

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
this figure here these are like plastic

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.759 
this figure here these are like plastic
like<00:02:41.159> rubbery<00:02:41.760> plastic<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.720> then<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.379> hands

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
like rubbery plastic and then the hands

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.009 
like rubbery plastic and then the hands
are<00:02:43.859> like<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.129> hard<00:02:44.430> plastic<00:02:44.690> as<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.870> can

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
are like this hard plastic as you can

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.589 
are like this hard plastic as you can
see<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:46.709> squishy<00:02:47.239> but<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.359> chest

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
see like it's squishy but the chest

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.309 
see like it's squishy but the chest
piece<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.190> hard<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:51.120> let's<00:02:51.150> take<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> look<00:02:52.079> at

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
piece is hard so let's take a look at

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.530 
piece is hard so let's take a look at
the<00:02:52.560> stand<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.579> here's<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.819> better<00:02:53.970> look<00:02:54.090> at<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the stand so here's a better look at the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.009 
the stand so here's a better look at the
stand<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.109> comes<00:02:55.260> with<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.680> figure<00:02:56.069> you

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
stand that comes with the figure you

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.539 
stand that comes with the figure you
just<00:02:58.019> put<00:02:58.230> these<00:02:58.319> pieces<00:02:58.560> together<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
just put these pieces together and it

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.349 
just put these pieces together and it
can<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.959> rotate<00:03:00.959> around<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.970> piece<00:03:03.209> right

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
can just rotate around this piece right

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.780 
can just rotate around this piece right
here<00:03:03.420> fits<00:03:04.109> into<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.440> back<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.579> war

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
here fits into the back of the war

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.369 
here fits into the back of the war
machine<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.299> then<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.569> can<00:03:06.900> stick<00:03:07.109> them<00:03:07.260> in

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
machine and then you can stick them in

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.009 
machine and then you can stick them in
there<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:08.129> then<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.540> compose<00:03:09.540> them<00:03:09.690> at<00:03:09.810> all

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
there and then this compose them at all

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.649 
there and then this compose them at all
certain<00:03:10.620> directions<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:12.120> that's<00:03:12.269> pretty<00:03:12.480> cool

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
certain directions so that's pretty cool

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.420 
certain directions so that's pretty cool
you<00:03:13.290> also<00:03:13.470> want<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.769> make<00:03:13.920> sure<00:03:14.099> you're<00:03:14.310> not

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
you also want to make sure you're not

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.210 
you also want to make sure you're not
over<00:03:14.849> balancing<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.599> as<00:03:16.109> if<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:16.799> figure<00:03:17.129> is

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
over balancing it as if this figure is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.059 
over balancing it as if this figure is
almost<00:03:17.819> in<00:03:18.150> front<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.900> stands<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:19.889> he'll

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
almost in front of the stands so he'll

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.890 
almost in front of the stands so he'll
lean<00:03:20.400> over<00:03:20.609> so<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.209> balance<00:03:21.540> his

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
lean over so you have to balance his

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.960 
lean over so you have to balance his
body<00:03:22.319> part<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:22.949> it<00:03:23.040> doesn't<00:03:23.250> fall<00:03:23.370> over<00:03:23.730> but

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
body part so it doesn't fall over but

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.400 
body part so it doesn't fall over but
you<00:03:24.150> know<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.750> play<00:03:24.959> around<00:03:25.079> with<00:03:25.230> that

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
you know you can play around with that

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.319 
you know you can play around with that
that's<00:03:25.769> pretty<00:03:25.919> cool<00:03:26.129> this<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.790> really<00:03:27.120> cool

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
that's pretty cool this is a really cool

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.119 
that's pretty cool this is a really cool
piece<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.169> little<00:03:28.530> different<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
piece it's a little different and

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.039 
piece it's a little different and
honestly<00:03:29.819> I'm<00:03:29.970> not<00:03:30.150> really<00:03:30.209> good<00:03:30.750> at<00:03:30.900> giving

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
honestly I'm not really good at giving

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.930 
honestly I'm not really good at giving
reviews<00:03:31.650> on<00:03:31.859> anything<00:03:32.220> larger<00:03:32.760> than<00:03:32.790> a

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
reviews on anything larger than a

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.449 
reviews on anything larger than a
six-inch<00:03:33.449> figure<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.769> just<00:03:34.980> so

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
six-inch figure because it's just so

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.270 
six-inch figure because it's just so
much<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:36.359> a<00:03:36.569> figure<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.109> review<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.859> handle

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
much of a figure to review and handle

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.220 
much of a figure to review and handle
them<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.489> front<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.669> the<00:03:38.760> camera<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.239> thanks

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
them in front of the camera so thanks

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.170 
them in front of the camera so thanks
for<00:03:40.379> watching<00:03:40.650> my<00:03:40.739> review<00:03:40.799> hope<00:03:41.699> this<00:03:41.879> was<00:03:42.150> a

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
for watching my review hope this was a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.270 
for watching my review hope this was a
decent-enough<00:03:42.840> review<00:03:43.349> on<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.709> figure<00:03:43.919> and

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280
