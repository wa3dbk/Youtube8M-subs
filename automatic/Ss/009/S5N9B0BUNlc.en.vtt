00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.640
This time it is a blouse of knitted material.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.160
I bought it for 1000 yen at sale on Takeshita street.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.560
It is in a state as purchased.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:28.600
It was hung on a hanger rack, but fold wrinkles are terrible.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.940
I hope it is in a beautiful state without wrinkles in a shop.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.080
When you first wear it, if it is beautiful clothes it makes you feel good.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:48.840
I will introduce a method to clean up very quickly using Vertical Steam by T-fal Iron from now.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.980
As far as I can tell, Irons that can apply such steam are sold from only T-fal now.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.000
If irons which can apply the same amount of steam are sold from other manufacturers in the future, there is no problem which you choose.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.580
You can remove most wrinkles by steam ironing, but there is only one drawback.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.580
That means that the edge part such as the hem is more beautiful by pressing directly with an iron.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.440
Without pressing is OK if you do not care about the hem part.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.940
First press the hem with an iron.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.900
It is enough to slide the iron lightly.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:54.060
Just a little ironing like this makes the finish very good.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.840
Continue to press lightly.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.020
I arrange the fabric only for the part I want to press.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.500
This blouse has a lace in neck part and sleeves.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.960
You do not need to press the lace.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.640
I made the hem part clean, so I will finish the rest with steam.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.560
It has wrinkles like this.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.680
Let's get started.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:59.040
It is a point to put the fabric in a flat state as much as possible and to apply steam.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.740
If the fabric is steamed in a distorted state, the fabric will be fixed as it is.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.900
Always steam in a flat state.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.200
The front side is over. Just steaming for a short time makes it so beautiful.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.960
The fold wrinkles are completely gone.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.560
Next is the back side. The way is the same.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.420
Wrinkles in this part are terrible. Can you see it?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.420
Does not it reflect much?

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:00.020
Steam is very effective for knit fabric.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:07.360
Chiffon fabrics can be cleaned as well.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.280
That's it.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.220
One minute is enough.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:28.440
Clothes you bought newly are steam-ironed in the evening and dried as it is. Then you can wear it in the morning in a beautiful state.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.920
Recommended steam ironing method.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.640
There are points to note, depending on the fabric you may shrink with steam (especially chiffon).

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:51.060
Usually Sponging process is done so that it does not, but some clothes are not.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:05:01.660
For that reason please try to steam a little on the inconspicuous part once whether shrink or not.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
This time was a knit blouse.
