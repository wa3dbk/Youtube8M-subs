00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.299
 This is how one of the cells of the brain, or so-called neuron, actually looks. 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.480
 It's like crazy because we can take a picture of it. 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.300
 But for a long time we could not see or understand those entanglements of neurons completely within your brain. 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.240
 Some people also thought that we did not have any taste at all. 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:30.519
 In ancient Egypt, people believed that the brain was just a filler to keep the skull from collapsing. 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.190
 During embalming, the brain was often removed and discarded, while the heart was taken with you to the afterlife. 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.540
 Ancient Egyptians believed that the heart is the center of consciousness 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.579
 An idea called "central premise of the heart" 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.580
 In ancient Greece, Alkmin explained his eyes and discovered the optic nerve. 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.480
 I think there are connections between our sensory organs and the brain 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.740
 Alkmen therefore proposed a central hypothesis of the head 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.440
 And that the brain is the center of consciousness. 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.230
 I think that the lives of animals are going on inside the body, just as we know how nerve signals work today. 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.100
 Others such as Pythagoras, Plato and Hippocrates were in the central brain team. 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.460
 But some like Aristotle chirped outside the squadron and continued to prefer central heart. 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.700
 Aristotle believed that the brain and lungs are coolers of the heart. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.920
 Skip a thousand years forward to find French philosopher RenÃ© Descartes 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 Which I thought our nerves contained fluids 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.020
 The lives of the animals through our nerves to our muscles to move. 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.159
 The theory of muscle movement due to air or liquid swelling was known as 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.579
 (Theoretical theory) 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.420
 But it refuted similar to previous theories. 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.099
 Then in the 1820s, the theories of Franz Josef Gal formed the science of the brain. 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.300
 People thought that the mind would be of characteristic queens 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.420
 Such as thinking, self-esteem, or a tendency towards good or acceptance 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.540
 And that these queens have a separate place in the brain. 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.280
 Since the skull is shaped according to the brain, people widely recognized that 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.090
 The surface of the skull can serve as an index of mental competencies and tendencies. 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.960
 Brain science was practiced in the 1840s, until the British Brain Science Society was dissolved in 1967. 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.970
 As Karl Popper said, science must begin with superstitions and criticism. 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.270
 If we had not thought that the animals' lives would be in our veins 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.270
 Or that the brain just filler, 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.500
 Perhaps we could not develop the knowledge we now have about the brain, 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.480
 Or what we will know about your future brainstorming. 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
