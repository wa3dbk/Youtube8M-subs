northern side of the country now the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.900 
northern side of the country now the
reasons<00:03:10.140> equator<00:03:10.680> being<00:03:11.040> closer<00:03:11.370> so

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
reasons equator being closer so

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.620 
reasons equator being closer so
automatically<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.959> hotter<00:03:13.350> weather<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
automatically is hotter weather and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.890 
automatically is hotter weather and
chilies<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.650> believe<00:03:17.390> have<00:03:18.390> certain

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
chilies I is I believe have certain

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.560 
chilies I is I believe have certain
capsicum<00:03:19.410> oils<00:03:19.980> which<00:03:20.640> helps<00:03:21.090> dilate<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
capsicum oils which helps dilate the

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.020 
capsicum oils which helps dilate the
blood<00:03:21.720> vessels<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:23.310> increases<00:03:23.670> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
blood vessels and that increases the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.870 
blood vessels and that increases the
stipulation<00:03:24.720> as<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.620> result<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.250> perspire

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
stipulation as a result you perspire

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.720 
stipulation as a result you perspire
more<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.590> more<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> cooling

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
more and so it's more like a cooling

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.270 
more and so it's more like a cooling
system<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.930> when<00:03:31.350> you're<00:03:31.500> eating<00:03:31.739> chillis

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
system so when you're eating chillis

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.350 
system so when you're eating chillis
your<00:03:32.700> real<00:03:32.910> need<00:03:33.120> cooling<00:03:33.510> your<00:03:33.630> system<00:03:35.360> so
