diamond<00:02:06.210> stones<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.689> you're<00:02:06.810> using<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.259> real

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
diamond stones if you're using a real

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.990 
diamond stones if you're using a real
stone<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.220> want<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.520> sure<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.700> put<00:02:08.849> some

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
stone you want to be sure to put some

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.270 
stone you want to be sure to put some
oil<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.929> highly<00:02:10.229> recommend<00:02:10.860> three<00:02:11.190> in

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
oil on it I highly recommend three in

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.770 
oil on it I highly recommend three in
one<00:02:11.520> oil<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.000> keep<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.750> large<00:02:12.989> can<00:02:13.319> hand

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
one oil I keep a large can hand

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.890 
one oil I keep a large can hand
and<00:02:13.930> use<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.260> lots<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.770> different<00:02:14.830> things

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and use it for lots of different things

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.370 
and use it for lots of different things
okay<00:02:18.270> there<00:02:19.270> are<00:02:19.420> really<00:02:19.600> three<00:02:19.959> things<00:02:19.990> you

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
okay there are really three things you

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.930 
okay there are really three things you
need<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.590> remember<00:02:20.950> when<00:02:21.250> you're<00:02:21.430> sharpening

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
need to remember when you're sharpening

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.690 
need to remember when you're sharpening
with<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.660> diamond<00:02:23.080> stone<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:24.190> wet<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.459> with

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
with the diamond stone you wet it with

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.180 
with the diamond stone you wet it with
water<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.270> use<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.600> toothbrush<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.010> get

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
water I use a toothbrush so that I get

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.699 
water I use a toothbrush so that I get
the<00:02:27.340> water<00:02:27.550> pretty<00:02:28.240> much<00:02:28.360> everywhere<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
the water pretty much everywhere the

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.650 
the water pretty much everywhere the
knife<00:02:29.920> blade<00:02:30.250> especially<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.480> gets

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
knife blade especially as it gets

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.930 
knife blade especially as it gets
sharper<00:02:32.110> will<00:02:32.680> tend<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.010> push<00:02:33.280> more<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.730> more

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
sharper will tend to push more and more

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.479 
sharper will tend to push more and more
water<00:02:34.270> off<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:35.020> we'll<00:02:35.620> get<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.890> nice<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.100> wet

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
water off so we'll get it nice and wet

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.260 
water off so we'll get it nice and wet
before<00:02:36.940> we<00:02:37.060> start<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:39.610> do<00:02:39.760> not<00:02:39.940> want<00:02:40.180> to

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
before we start now you do not want to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.990 
before we start now you do not want to
hold<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> knife<00:02:40.780> at<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.140> angle<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:42.819> want

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
hold the knife at the angle a you want

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.430 
hold the knife at the angle a you want
to<00:02:43.060> hold<00:02:43.180> somewhere<00:02:43.600> between<00:02:43.750> B<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.200> D

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
to hold somewhere between B and D

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.220 
to hold somewhere between B and D
probably<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.190> little<00:02:45.400> closer<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:46.030> be<00:02:46.209> e<00:02:46.480> would

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
probably a little closer to be e would

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.500 
probably a little closer to be e would
be<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.440> flat<00:02:47.769> edge<00:02:48.070> D<00:02:48.670> would<00:02:48.910> be<00:02:48.940> good<00:02:49.269> for

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
be a flat edge D would be good for

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.410 
be a flat edge D would be good for
certain<00:02:49.690> tools<00:02:50.140> like<00:02:50.470> hatchets

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
certain tools like hatchets

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.330 
certain tools like hatchets
okay<00:02:52.420> now<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.900> I've<00:02:53.019> got<00:02:53.230> my<00:02:53.260> stone<00:02:53.709> nice<00:02:54.070> and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
okay now that I've got my stone nice and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.560 
okay now that I've got my stone nice and
wet<00:02:54.519> I'm<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.060> very<00:02:55.239> carefully

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
wet I'm going to very carefully

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.020 
wet I'm going to very carefully
establish<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.620> angle<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.220> want<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.489> push<00:02:57.760> this

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
want to try to sharpen your knife in one

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.430 
want to try to sharpen your knife in one
or<00:03:09.130> two<00:03:09.280> passes<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.420> want<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.630> make<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.780> lot<00:03:11.140> of

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
or two passes you want to make a lot of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.550 
or two passes you want to make a lot of
passes<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.459> if<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.239> accidentally<00:03:14.080> alter

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
passes so that if you accidentally alter

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.759 
passes so that if you accidentally alter
the<00:03:14.709> angle<00:03:15.190> which<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.400> critical<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.959> don't

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
the angle which is critical you don't

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.940 
the angle which is critical you don't
mess<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.400> blade<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:19.750> one<00:03:20.290> side<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.890> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
mess up the blade do one side of the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.000 
mess up the blade do one side of the
blade<00:03:21.329> several<00:03:22.329> times<00:03:22.660> it's<00:03:23.440> kind<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.860> good

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
blade several times it's kind of a good

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.770 
blade several times it's kind of a good
idea<00:03:24.160> especially<00:03:24.700> if<00:03:25.120> you're<00:03:25.269> just<00:03:25.450> getting

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
idea especially if you're just getting

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.310 
idea especially if you're just getting
started

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
started

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.680 
started
to<00:03:26.769> count<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.310> number<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.670> passes<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.510> you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
to count the number of passes that you

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.229 
to count the number of passes that you
make<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.230> balance<00:03:30.160> that<00:03:30.400> when<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.820> go<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
make and balance that when you go to the

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.900 
make and balance that when you go to the
other<00:03:31.360> side<00:03:32.130> we've<00:03:33.130> still<00:03:33.370> got<00:03:33.519> plenty<00:03:33.549> of

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
other side we've still got plenty of

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.670 
other side we've still got plenty of
water<00:03:34.090> on<00:03:34.390> this<00:03:34.540> stone<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:35.200> we'll<00:03:35.350> just<00:03:35.500> go

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
water on this stone so we'll just go

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.789 
water on this stone so we'll just go
right<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.190> other<00:03:36.220> side<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.380> we'll<00:03:38.380> try<00:03:38.739> to

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
right to the other side and we'll try to

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.420 
right to the other side and we'll try to
match<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.579> angle<00:03:40.030> we'll<00:03:40.360> go<00:03:40.600> across<00:03:41.220> all<00:03:42.220> my

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
match that angle we'll go across all my

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.690 
match that angle we'll go across all my
waters<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.090> way<00:03:43.269> let<00:03:43.480> me<00:03:43.510> move<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:44.700> we'll

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
waters in the way let me move that we'll

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.699
