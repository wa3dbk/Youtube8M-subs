this as a very bullish report a little

this as a very bullish report a little
surprisingly<00:00:43.590> perhaps<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.340> factored<00:00:44.789> that

surprisingly perhaps they factored that
in<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> little<00:00:45.300> bit<00:00:45.420> today<00:00:46.100> because<00:00:47.450> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
in a little bit today because the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.130 
in a little bit today because the
futures<00:00:48.870> were<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.200> handily<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:50.489> well<00:00:51.140> after

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.130

report<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.910> that<00:00:59.940> November<00:01:00.629> marketing's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
report was that November marketing's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920 
report was that November marketing's
were<00:01:01.699> one-point-six<00:01:02.699> percent<00:01:02.820> higher<00:01:03.570> than

were one-point-six percent higher than

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.460 
were one-point-six percent higher than
forecast<00:01:05.420> although<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> month<00:01:06.780> did<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.200> one

forecast although the month did have one

forecast although the month did have one
additional<00:01:07.770> slaughter<00:01:08.280> day<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.869> if

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
additional slaughter day so if

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
additional slaughter day so if
three-point-six<00:01:10.740> percent<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.430> take<00:01:11.820> out

that<00:01:12.240> saw<00:01:12.570> today<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.680> still<00:01:13.890> below

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that saw today it was still below

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
that saw today it was still below
year-ago<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.420> obviously<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> cattle<00:01:16.229> on

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
year-ago but obviously the cattle on

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
year-ago but obviously the cattle on
feed<00:01:16.320> total<00:01:16.950> has<00:01:17.100> been<00:01:17.340> trailing<00:01:18.299> year-ago

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
feed total has been trailing year-ago

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.789 
feed total has been trailing year-ago
levels<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:21.259> but<00:01:22.259> i<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.619> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
levels for some time but i think that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.969 
levels for some time but i think that
the<00:01:24.259> placement<00:01:25.259> number<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.530> always<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> little

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the placement number is always a little

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.420 
the placement number is always a little
bit<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:28.200> difficult<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.100> pin<00:01:29.400> down

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
bit of a of a difficult one to pin down

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
bit of a of a difficult one to pin down
but<00:01:29.970> those<00:01:30.180> placements<00:01:30.570> were<00:01:31.110> were<00:01:31.470> quite<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but those placements were were quite a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.880 
but those placements were were quite a
bit<00:01:31.979> lower<00:01:32.189> than<00:01:32.430> forecast<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.270> ninety<00:01:33.659> 15<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
bit lower than forecast at ninety 15 the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.569 
bit lower than forecast at ninety 15 the
average<00:01:35.040> gas<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.990> 95.2<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.369> brought

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
average gas was 95.2 so all this brought

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.399 
average gas was 95.2 so all this brought
the<00:01:38.700> cattle<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.030> feed<00:01:39.060> total<00:01:39.689> below<00:01:40.079> the

the cattle on feed total below the
year-earlier<00:01:40.920> level<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.720> also<00:01:42.899> nearly

year-earlier level and was also nearly

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
year-earlier level and was also nearly
one<00:01:44.009> percent<00:01:44.369> no<00:01:44.490> point<00:01:44.759> nine<00:01:44.970> percent<00:01:45.479> below

the<00:01:45.960> average<00:01:46.079> forecast<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.520> free<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.140> say

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the average forecast so so free as I say

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.340

three bullish numbers there if we look

three bullish numbers there if we look
