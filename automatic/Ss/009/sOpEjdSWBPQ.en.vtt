00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
like that and um you don't do one of

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
like that and um you don't do one of
these<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.769> shake<00:00:31.980> lot<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.579> instead

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370

very weird and you know you either get
too<00:00:51.030> little<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.449> too<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:52.110> never<00:00:52.289> seems

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
too little or too much it never seems

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.729 
too little or too much it never seems
like<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> right<00:00:53.550> amount<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.180> product

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
like you get the right amount of product

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
like you get the right amount of product
and<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.910> leaking<00:00:57.390> water<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:58.079> almost

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
and it's like leaking water are almost
right<00:00:58.680> now<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> weird<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.820> doing

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
right now this is weird it was not doing

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.039 
right now this is weird it was not doing
this<00:01:00.180> earlier<00:01:03.650> there<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> I'm<00:01:06.750> trying

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
this earlier there we go so I'm trying

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
this earlier there we go so I'm trying
to<00:01:07.080> swatch<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.619> let<00:01:07.920> me<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.340> there's<00:01:08.490> any

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to swatch it let me see if there's any

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.530 
to swatch it let me see if there's any
claims<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.330> there<00:01:10.490> anyway<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.330> was

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
claims on there anyway I think this was

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.030 
claims on there anyway I think this was
about<00:01:12.659> nineteen<00:01:13.290> dollars<00:01:13.580> for<00:01:16.040> three

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
about nineteen dollars for three

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.600 
about nineteen dollars for three
milliliters<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:22.759> 0.1<00:01:23.759> fluid<00:01:24.479> ounce<00:01:25.070> anyway<00:01:26.070> so

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
milliliters or 0.1 fluid ounce anyway so

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.520 
milliliters or 0.1 fluid ounce anyway so
this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> shade<00:01:27.750> looks<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.320> right

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
this is what the shade looks like right

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.920 
this is what the shade looks like right
there<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.310> salmon<00:01:30.150> color<00:01:30.390> corrector

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
there it's that salmon color corrector

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.620 
there it's that salmon color corrector
was<00:01:31.590> looking<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.240> ingredients<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.450> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
was looking at the ingredients of this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.030 
was looking at the ingredients of this
and<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.290> does<00:01:34.470> contain<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and I know it does contain a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.880 
and I know it does contain a
petroleum-based<00:01:35.820> product<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.740> you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
petroleum-based product in it so if you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
petroleum-based product in it so if you
have<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> problem<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.229> lot<00:01:40.770> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
have a problem with that I know a lot of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.490 
have a problem with that I know a lot of
people<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:42.450> don't<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.869> using<00:01:43.079> petroleum

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
people and don't like using petroleum

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100 
people and don't like using petroleum
based<00:01:43.979> products<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> fact<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
based products for the fact that it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.319 
based products for the fact that it
doesn't<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.829> can't<00:01:47.070> sink<00:01:47.369> into<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.790> skin<00:01:48.299> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
doesn't see can't sink into the skin so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.499 
doesn't see can't sink into the skin so
if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> find<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.640> when<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.240> wear

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
if you find that you know when you wear

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.139 
if you find that you know when you wear
a<00:01:51.840> concealer<00:01:52.409> whatever<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.979> moves<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
a concealer whatever it moves it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.480 
a concealer whatever it moves it
probably<00:01:55.079> contains<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.649> petroleum<00:01:56.280> based

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
probably contains a petroleum based

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.850 
probably contains a petroleum based
product<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.899> skin<00:01:58.320> really<00:01:58.740> isn't

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
product and your skin really isn't

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.090 
product and your skin really isn't
holding<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.579> place<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.180> me<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.860> very

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
holding it in place for me I have very

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
holding it in place for me I have very
dry<00:02:02.310> skin<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.969> I've<00:02:03.090> heard<00:02:03.240> people<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.719> dry

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
dry skin now I've heard people with dry

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.780 
dry skin now I've heard people with dry
skin<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.469> problem<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.979> don't<00:02:05.369> because

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
skin have that problem I don't because

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490 
skin have that problem I don't because
my<00:02:05.969> skin<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.360> wants<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.869> grab<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> hold<00:02:07.409> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
my skin just wants to grab a hold of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.390 
my skin just wants to grab a hold of
anything<00:02:07.829> any<00:02:08.310> sort<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.729> moisture<00:02:08.910> whatsoever

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
anything any sort of moisture whatsoever

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.160 
anything any sort of moisture whatsoever
so<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> don't<00:02:11.700> really<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> problem<00:02:12.300> with

so I don't really have a problem with

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.570
