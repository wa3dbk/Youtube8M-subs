 money came out the same year 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.460
 consecutively then right now it 's a 

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:55.239
 good time for what 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.770
 I go and grab two huge suitcases 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.770
 I knew a friend that one year 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.549
 not even a department was a 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.000
 chubby people take advantage I stayed 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.230
 there 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.460
 according to me, it was coming to be discovered 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.200
 to succeed I did not have English well no 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.630
 I was ready 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.689
 I knew absolutely no one 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.539
 I had no contact with any day 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.759
 people my manager casting director and 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.980
 absolutely nothing date do some 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.720
 projects for having gone 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.940
 some projects in mexico and I came back 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.840
 again with my bags and two suitcases 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.550
 because surely I was buying from the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 angels at the beginning is a very city 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.900
 hard and above all is another country and not 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.710
 know nobody is difficult really 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.670
 and from another country to look 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.880
 that living did not help me very much 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.220
 realize that it is very important 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.460
 number one without keeping your feet well 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.420
 posts in your country that is where I 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.390
 until then I had made my career 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.569
 I do not want and I want to do the actresses 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.599
 that leave mexico are going to forget about 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.160
 where did they come from, that's never going to be 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.700
 for me 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.400
 and obtaining preparing to study how 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.010
 do you want to get to 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.140
 do it in a country that barely 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.510
 you start to speak the language 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.069
 it's the next time I go back to the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.800
 angels I went to study 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.950
 specifically 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.590
 and if it works I think the first thing 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.360
 you have to have it is very clear what 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.820
 is what you want to do and that's what 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.970
 I think that suddenly it is also then 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.930
 I failed and right now I do not tell you 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.830
 I feel 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.660
 with a leaf and a pen 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.560
 so I 'm probably going back to here 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.590
 and I start serving but but no longer 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.540
 sign as without grief or fear and I 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.240
 they made a writer who has left her 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.980
 scripts that you write in a drawer if you do not 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.480
 I will teach it and I will go out and I will 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.350
 search and search touch doors and search 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.260
 funding for movies and 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.060
 all then this is the first 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.880
 movie visages are called I introduce you to 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.950
 laura an indie movie is fine 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.510
 pretty with beautiful together with chris 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.520
 cooley that the next 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.040
 this team like my school 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.200
 and you graduate with that because it's not what 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.310
 same go to school to do it 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.270
 physically and after that came leaves 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.480
 and you can 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.800
 we had the culture itself of 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.730
 celebrate that it is the third most movie 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.690
