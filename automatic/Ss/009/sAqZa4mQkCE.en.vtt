right<00:03:27.640> there<00:03:27.850> that's<00:03:28.620> what<00:03:29.620> makes<00:03:29.830> it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
right there that's what makes it

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.790 
right there that's what makes it
different<00:03:30.130> from<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.760> AO<00:03:30.790> long

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.710 

this<00:03:35.800> is<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.920> v2<00:03:36.220> by<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.430> way<00:03:36.630> there's<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.750> v1

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
this is a v2 by the way there's a v1

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.060 
this is a v2 by the way there's a v1
these<00:03:40.720> are<00:03:40.870> after<00:03:41.170> lubrication<00:03:41.590> but<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:41.950> can

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
these are after lubrication but you can

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.860 
these are after lubrication but you can
hear<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:42.310> they're<00:03:42.550> not<00:03:42.670> as<00:03:42.880> sandy<00:03:43.240> not<00:03:43.510> near

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
hear that they're not as sandy not near

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.790 
hear that they're not as sandy not near
nearly<00:03:44.770> as<00:03:44.890> Sandy's<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.460> one<00:03:45.610> as<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:47.350> box<00:03:47.590> is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
nearly as Sandy's this one as a box is

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.090 
nearly as Sandy's this one as a box is
one<00:03:47.980> is<00:03:48.100> crazy<00:03:48.370> fast<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.710> also<00:03:53.830> pretty

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
one is crazy fast but it's also pretty

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.340 
one is crazy fast but it's also pretty
bumpy<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:55.030> speed<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.540> causing<00:03:55.930> lock<00:03:56.110> up

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
bumpy and that speed is causing lock up

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.530 
bumpy and that speed is causing lock up
so<00:03:56.590> long<00:03:56.740> with<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.070> bumping<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:58.210> bumpy

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
so long with the bumping the bumpy

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.720 
so long with the bumping the bumpy
feeling<00:03:59.040> let's<00:04:00.040> go<00:04:00.190> into<00:04:00.340> corner-cutting

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
feeling let's go into corner-cutting

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.000 
feeling let's go into corner-cutting
because<00:04:01.030> they<00:04:01.510> know<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.290> said<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.740> this<00:04:02.830> has

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
because they know you said that this has

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.900 
because they know you said that this has
really<00:04:03.160> good<00:04:03.340> corn<00:04:03.640> coming<00:04:03.880> so<00:04:04.120> let's<00:04:04.270> say<00:04:04.470> 45

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
really good corn coming so let's say 45

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.870 
really good corn coming so let's say 45
really<00:04:06.910> easy<00:04:08.820> it's<00:04:09.820> not<00:04:10.000> effortless<00:04:10.540> but

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
really easy it's not effortless but

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.630 
really easy it's not effortless but
pretty<00:04:12.880> good<00:04:13.290> okay<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.320> little<00:04:14.620> bit<00:04:14.830> of<00:04:14.920> us<00:04:15.690> yeah

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
pretty good okay a little bit of us yeah

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.240 
pretty good okay a little bit of us yeah
okay<00:04:18.640> yeah<00:04:18.960> it<00:04:19.960> requires<00:04:20.320> some<00:04:20.560> force<00:04:20.860> right

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
okay yeah it requires some force right

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.510 
okay yeah it requires some force right
now<00:04:21.400> it's<00:04:21.580> pretty<00:04:21.640> tight<00:04:22.920> as<00:04:23.920> you<00:04:23.980> can<00:04:24.220> see

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
now it's pretty tight as you can see

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.320 
now it's pretty tight as you can see
it's<00:04:25.450> pretty<00:04:25.720> tight<00:04:25.930> a<00:04:26.430> skill<00:04:27.430> that<00:04:27.670> speed<00:04:28.150> is

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
it's pretty tight a skill that speed is

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.500 
it's pretty tight a skill that speed is
really<00:04:29.050> really<00:04:29.500> good<00:04:30.390> depending<00:04:31.390> on<00:04:31.390> the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
really really good depending on the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.810 
really really good depending on the
solver<00:04:32.200> I'm<00:04:32.380> not<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> person<00:04:32.830> who<00:04:33.100> likes<00:04:33.130> speed

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
solver I'm not a person who likes speed

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.000 
solver I'm not a person who likes speed
on<00:04:34.060> their<00:04:34.270> cubes<00:04:34.750> too<00:04:34.990> much<00:04:35.170> that's<00:04:35.770> why<00:04:35.980> I

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
on their cubes too much that's why I

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.390 
on their cubes too much that's why I
have<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.930> songs<00:04:37.930> design<00:04:38.290> as<00:04:38.530> my<00:04:38.710> main<00:04:38.950> because

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
have a songs design as my main because

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.430 
have a songs design as my main because
it's<00:04:40.240> not<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:40.570> fast<00:04:45.870> let<00:04:46.870> me<00:04:46.960> compare<00:04:47.230> to

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
it's not that fast let me compare to

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.600 
it's not that fast let me compare to
this<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:48.160> one<00:04:49.050> way<00:04:50.050> faster<00:04:50.560> but<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:51.490> never

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
this this one way faster but you never

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.940 
this this one way faster but you never
know<00:04:51.850> I<00:04:52.030> could<00:04:52.240> warm<00:04:52.510> up<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:52.930> view<00:04:53.200> once<00:04:53.710> I

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
know I could warm up to this view once I

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.910 
know I could warm up to this view once I
I<00:04:54.550> use<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.120> lot<00:04:55.270> more<00:04:55.450> let's<00:04:56.410> take<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> look<00:04:56.770> at<00:04:56.860> a

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
I use a lot more let's take a look at a

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.220 
I use a lot more let's take a look at a
mechanism<00:04:57.370> real<00:04:57.490> quickly<00:04:57.670> before<00:04:58.060> I<00:04:58.660> end<00:04:59.080> off

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
mechanism real quickly before I end off

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.800 
mechanism real quickly before I end off
this<00:04:59.380> video<00:04:59.680> okay<00:05:00.640> so<00:05:00.700> as<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.240> can<00:05:01.360> see<00:05:01.540> here

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
this video okay so as you can see here

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.430 
this video okay so as you can see here
this<00:05:02.560> is<00:05:02.620> an<00:05:02.890> edge<00:05:06.990> some<00:05:07.990> kind<00:05:08.170> of<00:05:08.230> looks<00:05:08.380> like

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
this is an edge some kind of looks like

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.780 
this is an edge some kind of looks like
the<00:05:08.650> lowly<00:05:08.830> designs<00:05:09.510> from<00:05:10.510> before<00:05:11.640> from<00:05:12.640> what

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
the lowly designs from before from what

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.400 
the lowly designs from before from what
I<00:05:12.820> heard<00:05:13.030> on<00:05:13.180> other<00:05:13.450> videos<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:14.020> center

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
I heard on other videos the center

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.640 
I heard on other videos the center
design<00:05:14.680> is<00:05:14.800> what's<00:05:14.980> really<00:05:15.100> different<00:05:16.650> but

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
design is what's really different but

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.210 
design is what's really different but
even<00:05:17.890> that's<00:05:18.040> not<00:05:18.160> really<00:05:18.790> original<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:21.190> the

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
even that's not really original and the

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.520 
even that's not really original and the
corner<00:05:21.610> looks<00:05:21.820> pretty<00:05:22.660> much<00:05:22.780> identical<00:05:22.930> to

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
corner looks pretty much identical to

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.200 
corner looks pretty much identical to
some<00:05:23.680> other<00:05:23.770> stuff<00:05:25.230> but<00:05:26.230> yeah<00:05:26.610> if<00:05:27.610> you're

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
some other stuff but yeah if you're

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.620 
some other stuff but yeah if you're
looking<00:05:28.510> for<00:05:28.540> really<00:05:29.020> fast<00:05:29.700> with<00:05:30.700> a<00:05:30.970> cube<00:05:31.570> with

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
looking for really fast with a cube with

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.130 
looking for really fast with a cube with
them<00:05:32.400> typical<00:05:33.400> sandy<00:05:33.820> mo<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.270> feel<00:05:34.570> then<00:05:34.990> this

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
them typical sandy mo you feel then this

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.470 
them typical sandy mo you feel then this
is<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.320> one<00:05:35.500> for<00:05:35.530> you<00:05:35.850> if<00:05:36.850> you<00:05:36.970> like<00:05:37.000> fast

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
is the one for you if you like fast

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.870 
is the one for you if you like fast
cubes<00:05:38.140> and<00:05:38.500> you<00:05:38.860> have<00:05:39.070> like<00:05:39.100> a<00:05:39.250> thing<00:05:39.580> she<00:05:39.790> has

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
cubes and you have like a thing she has

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.330 
cubes and you have like a thing she has
a<00:05:39.910> main<00:05:40.210> this<00:05:41.020> will<00:05:41.530> probably<00:05:41.770> Trump<00:05:42.160> that

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
a main this will probably Trump that

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.830 
a main this will probably Trump that
because<00:05:42.610> it's<00:05:42.760> a<00:05:42.820> mo<00:05:42.970> you

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
because it's a mo you

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.379 
because it's a mo you
but<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.680> still<00:05:44.949> has<00:05:45.190> that<00:05:45.220> speed<00:05:45.730> for<00:05:46.060> people

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
but it still has that speed for people

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.439 
but it still has that speed for people
who<00:05:46.449> like<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.990> speed<00:05:47.350> speedier<00:05:47.980> cubes<00:05:48.340> as<00:05:49.270> I

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
who like the speed speedier cubes as I

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.900 
who like the speed speedier cubes as I
said<00:05:49.630> on<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:49.990> type<00:05:50.680> person<00:05:51.070> who<00:05:51.250> prefers<00:05:51.460> a

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
said on the type person who prefers a

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.439 
said on the type person who prefers a
slower<00:05:52.630> more<00:05:52.960> accurate<00:05:53.500> turning<00:05:53.800> puzzle<00:05:54.430> so<00:05:55.120> I

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
slower more accurate turning puzzle so I
