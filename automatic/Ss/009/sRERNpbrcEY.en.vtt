00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.720 

today<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.380> talking<00:00:01.530> about<00:00:01.800> using<00:00:02.639> your

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
today we're talking about using your

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
today we're talking about using your
backhand<00:00:02.939> slice<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.720> match<00:00:03.959> effectively

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.880 

you<00:00:36.750> know<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.500> can't<00:00:37.710> use<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you know I can think you can't use a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
you know I can think you can't use a
slice<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.640> slow<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.149> weak<00:00:39.329> but

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
slice because it's slow and weak but

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:50.439 
slice because it's slow and weak but
it's<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:40.110> pretty<00:00:40.379> effective

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.630 

so<00:00:51.079> we<00:00:51.469> start<00:00:51.769> to<00:00:51.859> point<00:00:52.010> out<00:00:52.160> my<00:00:52.280> surgeon<00:00:52.579> is

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
so we start to point out my surgeon is

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.490 
so we start to point out my surgeon is
back<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.149> then<00:00:53.480> we<00:00:53.600> run<00:00:53.809> him<00:00:53.929> with<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:54.289> roller

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
back and then we run him with the roller

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.149 
back and then we run him with the roller
forehand<00:00:56.440> he<00:00:57.440> hits<00:00:57.589> the<00:00:57.679> ball<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:57.829> my<00:00:57.980> back

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
forehand he hits the ball to my back

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.860 
forehand he hits the ball to my back
much<00:00:58.370> very<00:00:58.609> logical<00:00:59.089> he's<00:00:59.329> back<00:00:59.510> in<00:00:59.629> court

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
much very logical he's back in court

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.700 
much very logical he's back in court
down<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.769> lines<00:01:00.949> he<00:01:01.070> hit<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.250> cross<00:01:01.460> court

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
down the lines he hit the cross court

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.840 
down the lines he hit the cross court
notice<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.829> slice<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:04.250> we're<00:01:04.369> hitting<00:01:04.519> this

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
notice a slice that we're hitting this

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.139 
notice a slice that we're hitting this
now<00:01:05.089> okay<00:01:05.960> because<00:01:06.680> if<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.100> was<00:01:07.310> me<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.940> I

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
now okay because if this was me and I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.460 
now okay because if this was me and I
had<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.390> same<00:01:08.600> shot<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:08.990> me<00:01:09.110> I'll<00:01:09.200> hit<00:01:09.350> this

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
had the same shot to me I'll hit this

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.980 
had the same shot to me I'll hit this
return<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.070> I'll<00:01:10.130> come<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.610> but<00:01:11.509> my<00:01:11.780> point

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
return and I'll come in but my point

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.630 
return and I'll come in but my point
doesn't<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.440> come<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.619> net<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:12.979> I<00:01:13.009> get<00:01:13.610> a

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
doesn't like to come to net so I get a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.670 
doesn't like to come to net so I get a
little<00:01:13.759> more<00:01:13.939> leeway<00:01:14.149> here<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.350> now<00:01:15.439> I<00:01:15.470> get

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
little more leeway here so now I get

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.550 
little more leeway here so now I get
this<00:01:15.770> splice<00:01:16.159> too<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:17.869> know<00:01:18.020> I'm<00:01:18.259> dictating

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
this splice too you know I'm dictating

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.130 
this splice too you know I'm dictating
with<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:18.890> slice<00:01:19.100> I'm<00:01:19.280> not<00:01:19.430> even<00:01:19.580> moving<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:20.149> low

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
with the slice I'm not even moving a low

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.169 
with the slice I'm not even moving a low
slice<00:01:21.649> toe<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.130> hand<00:01:22.399> there<00:01:22.580> is<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.759> very

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
slice toe to hand there is a very

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.529 
slice toe to hand there is a very
difficult<00:01:23.509> shot<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.080> hit<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:25.330> even<00:01:26.330> when<00:01:26.450> he

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
difficult shot to hit and even when he

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.669 
difficult shot to hit and even when he
goes<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.810> run<00:01:27.200> around<00:01:28.869> she<00:01:29.869> goes<00:01:29.899> too<00:01:30.200> far<00:01:30.470> for

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
goes to run around she goes too far for

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.289 
goes to run around she goes too far for
someone<00:01:30.979> hands<00:01:31.190> I'm<00:01:31.280> his<00:01:31.549> short<00:01:31.909> back<00:01:32.119> and

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
someone hands I'm his short back and

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.370 
someone hands I'm his short back and
she's<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.450> really<00:01:32.659> anointed<00:01:32.990> two-handed

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
she's a really anointed two-handed

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.930 
she's a really anointed two-handed
backhand<00:01:33.740> he<00:01:34.190> goes<00:01:34.369> they're<00:01:34.580> running<00:01:34.880> around

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
backhand he goes they're running around

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.899 
backhand he goes they're running around
forehand<00:01:35.630> look<00:01:36.229> at<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.500> depth<00:01:36.830> it's<00:01:37.580> gonna<00:01:37.759> be

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
forehand look at the depth it's gonna be

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.300 
forehand look at the depth it's gonna be
really<00:01:38.090> hard<00:01:38.360> for<00:01:38.420> him<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.659> go<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> 2<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.440> going

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
really hard for him to go to 2 and going

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.100 
really hard for him to go to 2 and going
to<00:01:40.369> 1<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:40.640> logical<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:41.090> I'm<00:01:41.179> here<00:01:41.569> see<00:01:41.780> Omkar

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
to 1 is logical but I'm here see Omkar

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.930 
to 1 is logical but I'm here see Omkar
slanted<00:01:42.649> over<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:42.950> one<00:01:43.069> side<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.399> court<00:01:43.700> to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
slanted over to one side of the court to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.600 
slanted over to one side of the court to
survive<00:01:44.929> using<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:45.380> slice<00:01:45.709> you<00:01:45.979> have<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.459> go

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
survive using this slice you have to go

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.880 
survive using this slice you have to go
deep<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.060> let<00:01:47.780> slide<00:01:48.170> toward<00:01:48.560> him<00:01:48.649> you<00:01:48.709> can't

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
deep and let slide toward him you can't

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.649 
deep and let slide toward him you can't
have<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.130> slice<00:01:49.369> comes<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:50.000> monster

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
have that slice comes in a just monster

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.270 
have that slice comes in a just monster
straight<00:01:50.869> up<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.110> has<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.229> slide<00:01:51.560> towards<00:01:52.130> that

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
straight up it has to slide towards that

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.160 
straight up it has to slide towards that
might<00:01:52.399> hit<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.640> slice<00:01:52.909> there's<00:01:53.569> a<00:01:53.690> slice<00:01:53.899> hit

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
might hit the slice there's a slice hit

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.840 
might hit the slice there's a slice hit
and<00:01:54.469> then<00:01:54.890> he's<00:01:55.009> off<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.250> court<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.729> don't

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
and then he's off the court you don't

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.539 
and then he's off the court you don't
even<00:01:55.939> see<00:01:56.119> him<00:01:56.270> no<00:01:56.869> now<00:01:57.530> he<00:01:57.590> knows<00:01:58.159> I'm

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
even see him no now he knows I'm

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.830 
even see him no now he knows I'm
dictating<00:01:58.759> too<00:01:58.969> much<00:01:59.090> with<00:01:59.210> my<00:01:59.390> backhand

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
dictating too much with my backhand

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.480 
dictating too much with my backhand
using<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.409> slice<00:02:00.619> he's<00:02:00.799> gonna<00:02:00.920> try<00:02:01.130> change<00:02:01.399> a

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
using this slice he's gonna try change a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.849 
using this slice he's gonna try change a
pattern<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.000> now<00:02:02.539> he's<00:02:02.719> off<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.140> court<00:02:03.380> if<00:02:03.740> he

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
pattern and now he's off the court if he

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.529 
pattern and now he's off the court if he
goes<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.250> 2<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.579> opens<00:02:04.880> up<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.000> cross-court

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
goes to 2 it opens up the cross-court

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.569 
goes to 2 it opens up the cross-court
but<00:02:06.289> going<00:02:06.439> to<00:02:06.530> 1<00:02:06.679> will<00:02:06.770> keep<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:06.979> close<00:02:07.189> but

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
but going to 1 will keep it close but

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.400 
but going to 1 will keep it close but
now<00:02:07.820> see<00:02:08.239> he<00:02:08.390> knows<00:02:08.570> I'm<00:02:08.780> going<00:02:09.079> to<00:02:09.170> use<00:02:09.259> my

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
now see he knows I'm going to use my

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.979 
now see he knows I'm going to use my
slice<00:02:09.619> forever<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.480> he's<00:02:11.480> running<00:02:11.720> around<00:02:11.840> a

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
slice forever and he's running around a

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.870 
slice forever and he's running around a
lot<00:02:12.290> covered<00:02:12.799> cross<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.430> line<00:02:13.579> shot

into a forehand he nails a pretty good
for<00:02:19.220> hand<00:02:19.370> here<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:20.000> bear<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.570> get<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.780> it

for hand here and I bear to get to it
and<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:21.079> use<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.350> short<00:02:21.769> angle<00:02:22.100> cross<00:02:22.930> okay<00:02:24.340> but

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and I use a short angle cross okay but

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.620 
and I use a short angle cross okay but
there's<00:02:25.519> too<00:02:25.640> much<00:02:25.670> core<00:02:25.940> seeing<00:02:26.150> as<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.480> get

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
there's too much core seeing as I get

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.270 
there's too much core seeing as I get
there<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.989> go<00:02:27.290> shorten<00:02:27.739> a<00:02:27.799> couple<00:02:27.980> she<00:02:28.100> has<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
there I go shorten a couple she has to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.490 
there I go shorten a couple she has to
run<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.459> get<00:02:28.609> this<00:02:28.700> shot<00:02:29.000> he<00:02:29.930> gets<00:02:30.109> this<00:02:30.230> shot

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
run to get this shot he gets this shot

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.140 
run to get this shot he gets this shot
now<00:02:30.530> I'm<00:02:30.799> coming<00:02:31.040> cross-court<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.850> court<00:02:32.060> is

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
now I'm coming cross-court the court is

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.520 
now I'm coming cross-court the court is
open<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.540> down<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.810> line<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.079> open<00:02:33.230> I'm

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
open the down the line is open I'm

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.660 
open the down the line is open I'm
really<00:02:33.769> coming<00:02:34.010> across<00:02:34.130> right<00:02:34.220> exactly

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
really coming across right exactly

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.569 
really coming across right exactly
cross-court<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.510> he<00:02:36.380> goes<00:02:36.739> down<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.400> line

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
cross-court and he goes down the line

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.120 
cross-court and he goes down the line
which<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:38.420> thought<00:02:38.630> was<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:39.109> good<00:02:39.470> shot<00:02:39.739> but<00:02:40.040> it's

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
which I thought was a good shot but it's

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.960 
which I thought was a good shot but it's
just<00:02:40.280> too<00:02:40.400> slow

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
just too slow

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.309 
just too slow
he<00:02:41.180> gets<00:02:41.359> the<00:02:41.540> position<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:44.690> go<00:02:44.810> la<00:02:45.019> because

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
he gets the position and I go la because

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.690 
he gets the position and I go la because
it's<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.560> higher<00:02:45.799> percent<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:46.459> I'd<00:02:46.549> gone

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
it's a higher percent if I'd gone

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's a higher percent if I'd gone
cross-court<00:02:47.269> pass<00:02:47.299> being<00:02:48.139> honest<00:02:48.410> like<00:02:48.470> that

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
cross-court pass being honest like that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.110 
cross-court pass being honest like that
position<00:02:49.100> going<00:02:49.220> backwards<00:02:49.609> if<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:49.790> really

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
position going backwards if I'm really

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.970 
position going backwards if I'm really
hard<00:02:50.389> than<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:50.989> look<00:02:51.560> how<00:02:51.650> hard<00:02:51.859> it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
hard than you do and look how hard it's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.789 
hard than you do and look how hard it's
overhead<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.489> because<00:02:52.790> court<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.450> open<00:02:54.019> okay

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
overhead is because court is open okay

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.580 
overhead is because court is open okay
and<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:56.090> green<00:02:56.329> is<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.540> easier<00:02:56.989> shot<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.470> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
and the green is the easier shot in the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.960 
and the green is the easier shot in the
yellow<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:58.130> yellow<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.519> really<00:02:58.760> tough

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
yellow the yellow is a really tough

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.240 
yellow the yellow is a really tough
overhead<00:02:59.450> to<00:03:00.349> go<00:03:00.500> there<00:03:00.680> we've<00:03:00.830> been<00:03:00.920> really

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
overhead to go there we've been really

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.920 
overhead to go there we've been really
tough<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.760> would<00:03:01.849> be<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> really<00:03:02.180> hard<00:03:02.450> shot<00:03:02.750> so

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
tough it would be a really hard shot so

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.540 
tough it would be a really hard shot so
I'm<00:03:02.989> covering

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
I'm covering

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.910 
I'm covering
and<00:03:03.730> mourn<00:03:03.940> in<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.150> forehand<00:03:04.510> here<00:03:04.810> okay<00:03:05.710> and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
and mourn in the forehand here okay and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.490 
and mourn in the forehand here okay and
it<00:03:06.490> opens<00:03:06.910> up<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.510> down<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.840> line<00:03:08.020> very

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
it opens up the down the line very

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.200 
it opens up the down the line very
easily<00:03:11.310> hits<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.460> overhead<00:03:12.670> right<00:03:12.820> at<00:03:13.000> me

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
easily hits the overhead right at me

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.000 
easily hits the overhead right at me
strike<00:03:13.390> with<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.600> slice<00:03:13.900> inside<00:03:14.770> out<00:03:14.890> because

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
strike with a slice inside out because

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.960 
strike with a slice inside out because
it<00:03:15.160> would<00:03:15.250> been<00:03:15.370> really<00:03:15.550> hard<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.790> hit<00:03:15.850> that

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
it would been really hard to hit that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.340 
it would been really hard to hit that
flat<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:17.640> that's<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.850> really<00:03:19.360> smart<00:03:19.750> shot<00:03:20.140> but

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
flat and that's a really smart shot but

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.920 
flat and that's a really smart shot but
look<00:03:20.440> how<00:03:20.530> far<00:03:20.560> away<00:03:20.740> it<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.130> from<00:03:21.660> him<00:03:22.660> and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
look how far away it is from him and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.680 
look how far away it is from him and
gets<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.290> shot<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.250> he<00:03:24.340> blows<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:25.390> by<00:03:25.630> just

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
gets a shot and he blows it so by just

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.450 
gets a shot and he blows it so by just
being<00:03:26.110> very<00:03:26.200> consistent<00:03:26.680> your<00:03:26.950> slice<00:03:27.190> gonna

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
being very consistent your slice gonna

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:36.630 
being very consistent your slice gonna
keep<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.790> deep<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.780> Liam<00:03:29.440> around<00:03:35.640> let's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
keep that deep and Liam around let's

00:03:36.640 --> 00:04:06.320 
keep that deep and Liam around let's
slice

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.390 

you
