join<00:03:56.069> so<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.639> can<00:03:56.729> do<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.090> ring<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.840> he's

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
join so you can do the ring like he's

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.839 
join so you can do the ring like he's
pointing<00:03:58.379> it<00:03:58.470> not<00:03:58.590> like<00:03:58.739> he's<00:03:58.889> about<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.250> fist

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
pointing it not like he's about to fist

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.360 
pointing it not like he's about to fist
bump<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.269> but<00:04:01.139> it's<00:04:01.409> just<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:01.979> really<00:04:02.040> bad

joint<00:05:00.170> right<00:05:00.320> here<00:05:00.350> his<00:05:01.070> construct<00:05:01.670> is<00:05:01.850> an

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
joint right here his construct is an

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.830 
joint right here his construct is an
energy<00:05:02.480> blast<00:05:02.720> kind<00:05:03.020> of<00:05:03.140> looking<00:05:03.350> thing<00:05:03.590> um

energy blast kind of looking thing um

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.180 
energy blast kind of looking thing um
put<00:05:05.840> that<00:05:05.990> in<00:05:06.140> there<00:05:06.380> looks<00:05:06.950> like<00:05:07.070> you

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
put that in there looks like you

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.280 
put that in there looks like you
shooting<00:05:07.520> at<00:05:07.670> something<00:05:07.940> also<00:05:08.720> can<00:05:08.930> connect

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
shooting at something also can connect

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.600 
shooting at something also can connect
to<00:05:09.380> other<00:05:09.560> ones<00:05:09.860> so<00:05:10.370> let<00:05:10.580> me<00:05:10.670> get<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:11.210> Hells

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
to other ones so let me get a Hells

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.730 
to other ones so let me get a Hells
energy<00:05:13.610> which<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:13.910> on<00:05:14.120> these<00:05:14.510> those<00:05:14.690> fists<00:05:15.200> you

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
energy which it on these those fists you

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.280 
energy which it on these those fists you
can<00:05:15.980> stick<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.490> in<00:05:16.940> there<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:17.360> have<00:05:17.840> a<00:05:17.870> giant

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
can stick that in there and have a giant

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.760 
can stick that in there and have a giant
fist<00:05:19.450> punch<00:05:20.450> out<00:05:20.720> but<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.140> can't<00:05:21.170> really<00:05:21.650> get

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
fist punch out but you can't really get

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.720 
fist punch out but you can't really get
it<00:05:21.890> to<00:05:22.070> stand<00:05:23.060> down<00:05:23.920> yeah<00:05:24.920> he<00:05:25.130> cannot<00:05:25.400> stand

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
it to stand down yeah he cannot stand

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.020 
it to stand down yeah he cannot stand
with<00:05:25.940> this<00:05:26.090> at<00:05:26.420> all<00:05:26.810> he<00:05:27.620> doesn't<00:05:28.010> have<00:05:28.100> tighten

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
with this at all he doesn't have tighten

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.710 
with this at all he doesn't have tighten
up<00:05:29.120> joints<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.840> it's<00:05:30.260> just<00:05:31.060> very<00:05:32.060> very<00:05:32.270> weird

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
up joints and it's just very very weird

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.940 
up joints and it's just very very weird
you<00:05:32.930> could<00:05:33.110> probably<00:05:33.380> get<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.680> with<00:05:33.770> other

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
you could probably get it with other

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.010 
you could probably get it with other
constructs<00:05:34.490> well<00:05:35.210> it<00:05:35.300> does<00:05:35.450> look<00:05:35.480> I<00:05:35.750> wish<00:05:35.930> I

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
constructs well it does look I wish I

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.480 
constructs well it does look I wish I
could<00:05:36.170> I<00:05:36.200> just<00:05:36.440> like<00:05:36.530> put<00:05:36.680> it<00:05:36.800> like<00:05:36.950> this<00:05:36.980> that

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
could I just like put it like this that

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.370 
could I just like put it like this that
looks<00:05:37.640> pretty<00:05:37.730> cool<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.240> was<00:05:38.990> gonna<00:05:39.080> leave<00:05:39.260> it

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
looks pretty cool I was gonna leave it
