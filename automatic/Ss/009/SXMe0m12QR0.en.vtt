00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.140 
this video but about the ending of the
origins<00:00:28.830> easter<00:00:29.250> egg<00:00:29.369> because<00:00:30.000> I've<00:00:30.119> seen

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
origins easter egg because I've seen

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.939 
origins easter egg because I've seen
ngtzombies<00:00:30.720> completely<00:00:31.529> easter<00:00:31.740> egg<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ngtzombies completely easter egg and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.900 
ngtzombies completely easter egg and
this<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> official<00:00:32.430> ending<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:34.640> it<00:00:35.640> just

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
this is the official ending and it just

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.270 
this is the official ending and it just
seems<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.870> ends<00:00:37.079> off<00:00:37.230> too<00:00:37.469> loosely<00:00:38.010> it's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
seems like it ends off too loosely it's

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.319 
seems like it ends off too loosely it's
a<00:00:38.489> lot<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:39.030> completely<00:00:39.719> finished<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:41.329> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
a lot not completely finished and the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.840 
a lot not completely finished and the
end<00:00:42.510> sentence<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.100> hear<00:00:44.460> when<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
end sentence as you as you hear when you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.190 
end sentence as you as you hear when you
if<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> watch<00:00:45.390> my<00:00:45.420> other<00:00:45.629> video<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.170> is

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
if you watch my other video which is

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.690 
if you watch my other video which is
actually<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.680> ending<00:00:48.020> then<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.920> use<00:00:50.309> here

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
actually the ending then you use here

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.660 
actually the ending then you use here
that<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.449> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.170> makes<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.739> loose<00:00:53.160> off<00:00:53.430> if

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
that it kind of makes it loose off if

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
that it kind of makes it loose off if
they<00:00:54.059> hadn't<00:00:54.480> put<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> wouldn't

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
they hadn't put that in then it wouldn't

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.340 
they hadn't put that in then it wouldn't
have<00:00:56.070> been<00:00:56.160> too<00:00:56.460> loosely<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.539> tied<00:00:57.870> off<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
have been too loosely like tied off and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.790 
have been too loosely like tied off and
then<00:00:58.469> end<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.609> story<00:00:59.850> line<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.989> think<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
then end of story line but I think the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.579 
then end of story line but I think the
fact<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.309> max<00:01:02.640> says<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.840> norm<00:01:04.049> access<00:01:04.409> but

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
fact that max says well norm access but

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
fact that max says well norm access but
Samantha<00:01:05.010> says<00:01:05.220> them<00:01:05.720> my<00:01:06.720> father<00:01:06.960> has<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> plan

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
Samantha says them my father has a plan

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
Samantha says them my father has a plan
or<00:01:07.619> something<00:01:08.360> that<00:01:09.360> kind<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:10.430> gives<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
or something that kind of gives me the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.390 
or something that kind of gives me the
theory<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.909> maybe<00:01:14.909> there's<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.570> actual<00:01:15.900> zombie

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
theory of maybe there's an actual zombie

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.710 
theory of maybe there's an actual zombie
apocalypse<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> world<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.479> moment

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
apocalypse in the world at that moment

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.609 
apocalypse in the world at that moment
as<00:01:19.020> well<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.509> they<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:24.630> that's<00:01:25.409> how

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
as well and they are like that's how

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.260 
as well and they are like that's how
they've<00:01:25.890> thought<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.369> storyline<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
they've thought of this storyline and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.620 
they've thought of this storyline and
they<00:01:27.450> want<00:01:27.689> them<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.380> heroes<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.479> kind<00:01:30.479> of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
they want them the heroes to kind of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
they want them the heroes to kind of
help<00:01:30.900> them<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.920> way<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:32.460> why<00:01:32.610> they

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
help them in a way that's why they

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.569 
help them in a way that's why they
wishing<00:01:33.240> them<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.659> real<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
wishing them to be real so that's just

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.300 
wishing them to be real so that's just
my<00:01:36.090> theory<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.950> how

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
my theory on it I don't know how

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.590 
my theory on it I don't know how
plausible<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.240> could<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
plausible it could be and but if you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990 
plausible it could be and but if you
seen<00:01:42.840> his<00:01:42.960> name<00:01:43.110> boy<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.130> who<00:01:44.820> would

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
seen his name boy on the but who would

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.450 
seen his name boy on the but who would
draw<00:01:45.329> he<00:01:45.630> would<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> an<00:01:46.079> mp40<00:01:46.590> drawn<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
draw he would have an mp40 drawn on the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
draw he would have an mp40 drawn on the
wall<00:01:47.610> maybe<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.270> could<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.600> another<00:01:48.840> map<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
wall maybe this could be another map and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
wall maybe this could be another map and
black<00:01:49.740> ops<00:01:49.920> 2<00:01:50.100> zombies<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.549> DLC<00:01:51.030> 5<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.450> no<00:01:51.570> one

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
black ops 2 zombies as DLC 5 that no one

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.310 
black ops 2 zombies as DLC 5 that no one
knows<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:52.110> yeah<00:01:52.229> or<00:01:53.030> maybe<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
knows well yeah or maybe this is in the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.350 
knows well yeah or maybe this is in the
next<00:01:55.619> chart<00:01:55.799> game<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.790> probably<00:01:57.180> gonna

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
next chart game which is probably gonna

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.730 
next chart game which is probably gonna
be<00:01:57.420> called<00:01:57.659> either<00:01:57.840> black<00:01:58.229> ops<00:01:58.409> 3<00:01:58.619> or

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
be called either black ops 3 or

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520 
be called either black ops 3 or
something<00:01:59.100> different<00:01:59.390> which<00:02:00.390> hopefully<00:02:00.719> they

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
something different which hopefully they

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 
something different which hopefully they
make<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> better<00:02:01.979> job<00:02:02.600> really<00:02:03.600> cuz<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.140> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
make a better job really cuz the this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.590 
make a better job really cuz the this
this<00:02:05.250> game<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.790> been<00:02:05.850> good<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.210> easter<00:02:06.509> eggs

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
this game it's been good for easter eggs

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.460 
this game it's been good for easter eggs
nose<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.320> been<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> bit<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.459> there

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
nose up it's just been a bit in there

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.740 
nose up it's just been a bit in there
