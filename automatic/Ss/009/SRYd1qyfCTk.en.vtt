 Compa with the version of Android 5 points 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.870
 Logical 0.2 I have decided to make this video 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.590
 to get them out of doubt and to also 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.780

 record in his xperia very well in the

 last video of the channel I posted the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.830
 easiest way I found up 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.550
 now to clean any device 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.800
 android 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.700
 I'm talking about the application who 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.430
 Rip this application also root 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.399
 the xperia z1 that compact tone with 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.129
 android lollipop and good if you already 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.690
 have seen and have rooted and if not yet 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.600
 they have done well, I tell them from 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.640
 since they use that method since it is the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.870
 simpler you have found up to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.800
 now and it works 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.170
 about all that works and well this goes 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.260

 king room applications with usher and a 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.410
 Chinese application that then we're going to 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.570
 uninstall as soon as you have 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.690

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.219
 let's go to configuration 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.069
 and well let's go to near the 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:26.040

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.740
 and here in compilation number we are going to 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.370
 play seven times in a row 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.980
 until this message comes out now 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.830
 you are a developer once this 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.220
 message we return and we will be enabled 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.790
 this is the development options 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.939
 we enter there 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.069
 we give in activate here is active or 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.760
 deactivate and the web I will return to 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.599
 activate we will accept and good here 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.150
 let's go down to where it says 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:03.490
 debug usb let's mark this 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:07.060
 checkbox we accept and ready 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.460
 We have already rooted and we have already 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.770
 done the previous steps to install the 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.630
 dual record 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.250
 and well once done this is not going to 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:22.020
 be necessary to move anything on your cell phone 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.020
 so let's go to the pc 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.340
 we're here on the computer 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.800
 now we are going to have to download the 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.650
 necessary files to install the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.430
 dual recovery there are two different files 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.820
 of edward record and one for the z1 and the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.370
 another one for the compact z1 both are going to 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.880
 be in the post which I will leave the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.190
 link in the description of this video 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.650
 when they have downloaded those files 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.410
 will be a yes in my case as 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.410
 you can see here I have the what which 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.930
 record and for the z1 I know it's the z1 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.300
 compact the z1 simply to say z one 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.690
 what current recovery the version in the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.660
 2.8 point 15 which is the one that has 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.210
 compatibility with android 5.0 lollipop 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.850
 the other half in because it's the version 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.030
 previous 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.550
 well once we have downloaded it 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.910
 decompress and we will be this 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.910
 binder 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.930
 the above is the old version 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.860
 just half in the as I told you 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.560
 we open the folder 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.530
 and we find these three 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.659
 files we're just going to click on 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.689
 the one that says install and good is going to us 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:42.449
 open this black screen this window 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.669
 black better said and good in this 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:49.139
 moment is where we will have to connect 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:52.979
 through the usb cable our cell phone 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.409
 josh the OZ1 z1 compact once made the 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.469
 the previous steps that I showed you 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:01.289
 before in the configurations that 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.900
 I showed above very well now 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.029
 we connect our device to the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.650
 computer 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:12.020
 I'm going to connect mine I feel one 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.520
 compact and good I already recognized it 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.479
 computer 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:23.490
 and once we've done this we're going to 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:26.639
 type option 1 and write 1 and 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.139
 we press enter cell is with the 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.840
 blocked screen I suggest that the 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.479
 unlock and leave it free when you give 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.150
 the enter key then we press 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:40.229
 center and the program is going to start 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:43.050
 do their job and maybe they get a 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.400
 notification on your cell phone simply 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.530
 they will give you to accept and the application 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.479
 will continue to work very well now 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.860
 tells us that we press a key to 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.580
 continue 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.280
 and good is still working and now we 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.229
 says again that we press the key 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.780
 to continue but above tells us that 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.000
 the installation has finished 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.370
 we press the enter key and 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.410
 automatically it will close the 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.710
 black window and also in our 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.380
 cell is going to start restarting a 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.900
 Once it is restarted it will start 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.520
 automatically in the team win recovery 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:24.120
 project better known as tw rp and good 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.470
 already with this we are going to have our dual 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.120
 installed recovery 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.360
 the team wing record and project 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.690
 we're just going to give it to reebok and 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.780
 then then in system and restart 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.720
 our cell phone very well here already 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.570
 we can disconnect our device 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:47.380
 let's wait for it to start and when 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:49.210
 has finished initiating 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.360
 let's see in our menu 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.820
 applications that are already valid we are going to have 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.010
 installed an application that is called n 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.190
 of useful r this application in which 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.930
 manages the dual record we are going to open 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.300
 and we are going to find this 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.280
 interface maybe you get a 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.590
 King's notification is to give 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.450
 permits will give you a low 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.850
 allow and good we find 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.670
 these options we find the 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.520
 option to turn off and the option to go to 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:21.700
 recovery mode and well that would be all 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.030
 basically already with this you would have 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.370
 installed its dual record in its xperia z 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.560
 111 is a purchase I hope you have 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.810
 liked and served this video and good 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.500
