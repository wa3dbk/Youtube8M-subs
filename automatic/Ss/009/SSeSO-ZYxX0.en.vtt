00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.620

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.490

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.059
 chopper ita

 as we said 200 cubic centimeters 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
 a very interesting new option for the 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.810
 national market that the people of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.940
 warrior go you already have all your network of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.369
 dealers we were testing it for 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.150
 quite kilometers almost 2,000 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.700
 kilometers and it was very comfortable for us 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.240
 course what 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.600
 is designed for those who enjoy 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.970
 This style of motorcycles is a very 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.530
 interesting for those who already had some 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.660
 experience in a low displacement and 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.880
 is looking for a nice ride bike 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.300
 to make trips since it has a 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.960
 rank 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.660
 with a range of approximately 240 km 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.360
 which is a very interesting autonomy and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.460
 becomes an option rather than 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.240
 good for those who are lovers 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.850
 motorcycling matches to be able 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.890
 travel and wander all over the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.630
 design as you see it is very 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 attractive very well achieved with his 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 chrome The driving position is very 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.740
 comfortable 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.780
 everything works very well maybe inside 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.409
 the points 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.319
 what we found to improve is 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.149
 the gearbox is sometimes difficult 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.719
 find the dead point at the beginning 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:37.170
 until one takes his hand also a 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:39.179
 little vibration in the mirrors that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.689
 when you travel on the routes you do not 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.939
 can distinguish well certain objects and 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.209
 the position of the key that as many 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.630
 chaste has it under the box and 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:56.130
 it makes it a bit uncomfortable at the time of 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.850
 look for this device to start it 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.439
 the passenger travels really well 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.270
 seat is very comfortable as we said 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:10.500
 the arcs of the motorcycle in general are very 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.349
 but very good the walking is optimal and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.990
 has a speed between 90 and 110 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.410
 kilometer 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.270
 Perfectly suited for a trip in 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.100
 route as we said a motorcycle very 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.240
 attractive and we have the detail of 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.790
 kills dogs 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.400
 It serves much and more in our routes 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.700
 where there are sometimes small animals 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 loose also to highlight the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.720
 oil radiator that brings this motorcycle and 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.840
 that helps a lot in thermodynamics 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.480
 of this 250 cubic centimeter engine 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.910
 the suspension works very well there is 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.360
 be careful has its limits by 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.360
 where there are bumps or crosses 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.810
 ways you have to reduce the speed to 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.250
 avoid any surprise then the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.030
 performance is perfect as they 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.280
 we said in the bicycle brake 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.070
 they are in about seven points they work 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.770
 well accompanied with the box makes the 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.410
 motorcycle can be mastered without any kind of 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.930
 problems the operation of the clutch 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.390
 It is also acceptable and as we said 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.470
 it becomes a very good option 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.790
 for the one who is looking for a new motorbike 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.700
 to jump to a displacement one 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.410
 climbing more important I think that since 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.150
 many motorcyclists who went through their 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.370
 experience of a layer 110 centimeters 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.330
 cubic and who like this kind of 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.210
 motorcycles 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.300
 they have an option in this avenger 200 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.210
 excellent observe that nice design that 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.460
 has very attractive as we said the 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.380
 walking makes you not get tired can 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.080
 walk many hours a day and you 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.520
 becomes an important option for 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.760
 lovers of the encounters they want 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.830
 travel and do kilometers the companion 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.360
 As we said, it's going very well and if not 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.410
 they have the option of being able to carry 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.640
 luggage 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.920
 has a luggage rack on the side 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.640
 left and also if not above the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.550
 Moored passenger seat 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.800
 correctly 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.600
 in general terms as we said the 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.120
 instrumental is very good with a style 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.010
 well cast where we have a marker 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.959
 main good old style and the 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.570
 complementary in the tank 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.110
 fuel with what witnesses are 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.000
 of fuel as we told them too 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.009
 the punctual marker of naphtha 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.439
 Y 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.300
 an interesting design in what is the 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.300
 Tank drop is very good
