00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 So with us a training is a hairdresser 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.839
 Do not just wash your hair 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
 and blow dry but you get one 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.090
 complete insight already directly into the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.910
 beauty area skincare in macon 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.560
 Design of faces and of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.640
 manicure on special hair baths or 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.670
 body treatments depending on where 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.590
 You can cover that - has 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.820
 the beautiful with us so if you in the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.210
 training has become pretty quick 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.010
 built with the head massages that the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 custom love my head massages and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.340
 So I already have regular customers 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.720
 we call everybody yes they like it then 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.540
 Also like a head massage from the 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.540
 salome so the book me almost equal 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.500
 also 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.030
 so I'm unlikely to do much 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.720
 fun to color 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 to change the color and do it 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.100
 just huge fun when you are there 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.240
 just let off steam and the customer 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.960
 finally satisfied at home 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.960
 may send 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.869
 I like it especially the people 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.490
 to make happy and see them 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.259
 just with a smile from the salon 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.000
 come and it is even more beautiful then 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.740
 of course if they come back then me 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.740
 tell how satisfied they were 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.200
 I already said that for the make up 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.539
 area responsible this is my colleague 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.750
 foot up the other prune 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.560
 So we do everything but men 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.600
 anyway, if you have one 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.319
 specialization and can then do so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.000
 of course, work great together 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.640
 it's really every day is the new 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.789
 what we can and can do and the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
 Customers trust us so much that it does 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.659
 it is especially nice to new 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.179
 to be creative 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.249
 i have my own customer at the 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.759
 cash on the phone make appointments 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:01.380
 actually the complete program 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.240
 I am responsible for the orders 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.299
 that also gives me a great feeling that 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.950
 I answer because that's for 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.200
 me so the most important thing 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.720
 I clearly say that hairdressers do not 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.010
 just wash and blow dry it is 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.769
 often enter the people 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 to realize his needs that you 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.220
 get more with me than new ones 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.500
 haircut a nice color for that 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.799
 you can get over them but you 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.530
 we can be served more exclusively 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.920
 it's just a philosophy you get 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.920
 puts 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.610
 we do not just look at the hair but 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.070
 we make a beautiful skin we do 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.200
 a nice make-up that the scalp in 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.240
 order and styling needs 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.890
