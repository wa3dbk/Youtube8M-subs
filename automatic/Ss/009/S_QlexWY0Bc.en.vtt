graveyards as you'll see here in a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.120 
graveyards as you'll see here in a
second<00:02:47.390> I'm<00:02:48.390> gonna<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.990> guy<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.590> then

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
second I'm gonna get that guy and then

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.620 
second I'm gonna get that guy and then
swing<00:02:50.580> around<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.770> they're<00:02:52.770> going<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.980> follow

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
swing around and they're going to follow

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.680 
swing around and they're going to follow
since<00:02:54.630> it's<00:02:54.840> such<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> short<00:02:55.560> pull<00:02:55.950> range<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
since it's such a short pull range and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.150 
since it's such a short pull range and
immediately<00:02:57.690> tap<00:02:57.990> your<00:02:58.200> wisdom<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:58.890> can

once<00:03:02.520> they're<00:03:02.760> about<00:03:02.910> halfway<00:03:03.240> you'll<00:03:04.020> be

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
once they're about halfway you'll be

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.380 
once they're about halfway you'll be
about<00:03:04.530> dead<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.160> that's<00:03:05.430> when<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.820> bubble<00:03:06.209> up

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
about dead so that's when you bubble up

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.380 
about dead so that's when you bubble up
and<00:03:06.739> here<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:07.770> actually<00:03:07.980> use<00:03:08.430> lay<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:08.910> hands

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
because as you can see my shields not

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.420 
because as you can see my shields not
loaded<00:03:12.870> up<00:03:13.020> yet<00:03:16.940> see<00:03:17.940> they're<00:03:18.150> almost<00:03:18.410> about

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
loaded up yet see they're almost about

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.030 
loaded up yet see they're almost about
half<00:03:20.430> way<00:03:20.700> right<00:03:21.000> now

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.630 

and

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.860 

getting<00:03:28.390> pretty<00:03:28.600> low<00:03:28.750> try<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.080> heal<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:30.870> since

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
getting pretty low try to heal and since

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.690 
getting pretty low try to heal and since
there's<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.140> many<00:03:32.319> on<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.770> it's<00:03:32.920> still<00:03:33.280> even

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
there's so many on you it's still even

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.699 
there's so many on you it's still even
with<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:34.000> holy<00:03:34.209> tree<00:03:34.720> it's<00:03:35.200> still<00:03:35.470> going<00:03:35.530> to

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
with the holy tree it's still going to

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.059 
with the holy tree it's still going to
be<00:03:35.770> hard<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.660> use<00:03:37.870> lay<00:03:38.050> on<00:03:38.170> hands<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.680> then<00:03:38.950> you

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
be hard so use lay on hands and then you

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.559 
be hard so use lay on hands and then you
finish<00:03:39.250> them<00:03:39.580> up<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.740> that's<00:03:41.740> pretty<00:03:42.340> much<00:03:42.569> in

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
finish them up and that's pretty much in

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.260 
finish them up and that's pretty much in
a<00:03:44.140> nutshell<00:03:44.380> how<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.890> pull<00:03:45.310> large<00:03:45.610> amounts

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
a nutshell how you pull large amounts

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.949 
a nutshell how you pull large amounts
and<00:03:46.590> survive<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:48.120> generally<00:03:49.120> do<00:03:49.270> a<00:03:49.300> pull<00:03:49.630> every

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
and survive I generally do a pull every

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.080 
and survive I generally do a pull every
five<00:03:50.170> minutes<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.980> way<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> can<00:03:51.490> get<00:03:51.640> a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
five minutes that way I can get a

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.170 
five minutes that way I can get a
quarter<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.990> bumper<00:03:53.500> pool<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.970> get<00:03:55.150> a

loot these guys probably 10 12 as a much

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.990 
loot these guys probably 10 12 as a much
bigger<00:04:18.970> pool<00:04:19.299> than<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.630> last<00:04:19.870> one<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.820> i'm

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
bigger pool than the last one and i'm

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.740 
bigger pool than the last one and i'm
going<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.180> slow<00:04:22.510> down<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:24.180> big<00:04:25.180> pool<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:25.720> that

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
going to slow down the big pool so that

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.390 
going to slow down the big pool so that
y'all<00:04:26.020> can<00:04:26.050> get<00:04:26.320> an<00:04:26.410> idea<00:04:26.500> as<00:04:26.860> i<00:04:27.010> said<00:04:27.250> before
