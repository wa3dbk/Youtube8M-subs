00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
legs kind of have benzene and to me this

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.680

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
addition as the next one I have is the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.849 
addition as the next one I have is the
cow<00:02:03.209> now<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.539> cow<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.079> gonna<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.380> incredibly

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
cow now the cow is gonna be incredibly

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.429 
cow now the cow is gonna be incredibly
hard<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> show<00:02:05.310> off<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:06.029> apparently<00:02:06.450> okay

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
hard to show off because apparently okay

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.559 
hard to show off because apparently okay
this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.679> weird<00:02:07.859> but<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.250> others<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:09.030> kind

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
this is weird but it's others will kind

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.380 
this is weird but it's others will kind
of<00:02:09.690> move<00:02:09.899> around<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:11.240> kinda<00:02:12.240> need<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
of move around so this I kinda need it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.140 
of move around so this I kinda need it
to<00:02:12.569> move<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.160> yeah<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.459> see<00:02:14.580> look<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
to move so yeah as you can see look the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.470 
to move so yeah as you can see look the
jiggling<00:02:15.780> they're<00:02:16.349> jiggling<00:02:17.269> so<00:02:18.269> that's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
jiggling they're jiggling so that's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.210 
jiggling they're jiggling so that's
really<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:18.959> awkward<00:02:19.379> so<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.799> only<00:02:19.980> does<00:02:20.129> it

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
really really awkward so I only does it

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.500 
really really awkward so I only does it
when<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.430> walks<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
when it walks and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.479 
when it walks and
really<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:22.260> him<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.500> walk<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.709> any<00:02:23.010> other<00:02:23.250> way

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
really get him to walk in any other way

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.910 
really get him to walk in any other way
so<00:02:23.790> as<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.629> can<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.140> moves<00:02:25.409> just<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.680> little

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
so as you can see it moves just a little

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.380 
so as you can see it moves just a little
bit<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.400> I'm<00:02:26.519> not<00:02:26.670> gonna<00:02:26.790> stare<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.209> anymore

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
bit and I'm not gonna stare it anymore

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.990 
bit and I'm not gonna stare it anymore
because<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.019> kind<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.470> wrong<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.819> next

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
because it is kind of wrong and the next

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880 
because it is kind of wrong and the next
one<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.689> slime<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:31.470> one's<00:02:31.680> very

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
one is the slime and this one's very

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.399 
one is the slime and this one's very
very<00:02:32.189> good<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> little<00:02:33.239> one<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.900> God's<00:02:34.140> sake

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
very good a little one for God's sake

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.869 
very good a little one for God's sake
just<00:02:34.769> get<00:02:35.010> out<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.310> you're<00:02:35.459> ruining<00:02:35.819> the

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
just get out of here you're ruining the

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.789 
just get out of here you're ruining the
whole<00:02:35.909> thing<00:02:36.420> let's<00:02:37.079> try<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.439> get<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> big

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
whole thing let's try and get a big

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.390 
whole thing let's try and get a big
slime<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.340> no<00:02:38.640> no<00:02:39.980> here<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.069> go<00:02:41.190> here<00:02:41.370> we

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
slime in here no no here we go here we

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.339 
slime in here no no here we go here we
go<00:02:41.459> as<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.879> can<00:02:42.000> see<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.480> front<00:02:42.690> his<00:02:43.019> face

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
go as you can see at the front his face

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.780 
go as you can see at the front his face
will<00:02:43.620> wiggle<00:02:43.799> around<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.370> think<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.670> is

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
will wiggle around and I think that is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.250 
will wiggle around and I think that is
really<00:02:45.030> really<00:02:45.390> cool<00:02:45.540> feature<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.110> just

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
really really cool feature it just

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.690 
really really cool feature it just
really<00:02:46.440> makes<00:02:46.680> them<00:02:46.890> look<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.159> little<00:02:47.190> bit<00:02:47.489> more

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
really makes them look a little bit more

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.130 
really makes them look a little bit more
realistic<00:02:48.120> we'll<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.629> have<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> little<00:02:48.900> bit

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
realistic we'll just have a little bit

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.899 
realistic we'll just have a little bit
more<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.409> jelly<00:02:49.650> texture<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.849> think

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
more of a jelly texture and I just think

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.280 
more of a jelly texture and I just think
that<00:02:51.030> makes<00:02:51.269> him<00:02:51.390> look<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.870> little<00:02:52.200> bit

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
that makes him look that a little bit

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.869 
that makes him look that a little bit
better<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.769> doesn't<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.220> sizes<00:02:53.549> I

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
better and it doesn't on all sizes I

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.339 
better and it doesn't on all sizes I
just<00:02:54.030> want<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.209> get<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.390> big<00:02:54.540> one<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.079> show<00:02:55.260> you

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
just want to get the big one to show you

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.360 
just want to get the big one to show you
what<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.530> looks<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.769> an<00:02:55.890> old<00:02:56.040> guard<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.310> is

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
what it looks like an old guard this is

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.210 
what it looks like an old guard this is
going<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.879> wrong<00:02:57.150> now<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.870> one's<00:02:58.290> very<00:02:58.530> much

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
going so wrong now this one's very much

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.680 
going so wrong now this one's very much
to<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.549> with<00:02:59.639> the<00:02:59.790> slime<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.269> it's<00:03:00.389> at<00:03:00.569> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
to do with the slime but it's at the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.300 
to do with the slime but it's at the
magma<00:03:01.079> cubes<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.500> spawn<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.889> guy<00:03:02.099> in<00:03:02.159> here

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
magma cubes that spawn this guy in here

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.920 
magma cubes that spawn this guy in here
and<00:03:02.489> he<00:03:02.700> doesn't<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.359> like<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.629> wobbly

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
and he doesn't have like the wobbly

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.629 
and he doesn't have like the wobbly
features<00:03:04.260> if<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.409> have<00:03:04.500> one<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:04.829> he<00:03:04.980> dies<00:03:05.220> in

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
features if you have one but he dies in

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.940 
features if you have one but he dies in
a<00:03:06.180> very<00:03:06.480> strange<00:03:06.840> fashion<00:03:07.109> did<00:03:07.409> did<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.920> see

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
a very strange fashion did did you see

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.530 
a very strange fashion did did you see
that<00:03:08.250> he<00:03:08.549> kind<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.879> like<00:03:09.060> because<00:03:09.329> of<00:03:09.420> his

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
that he kind of like because of his

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.379 
that he kind of like because of his
springy<00:03:09.870> kind<00:03:10.139> of<00:03:10.639> demeanor<00:03:11.639> when<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.150> slay

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
springy kind of demeanor when you slay

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.360 
springy kind of demeanor when you slay
him<00:03:12.599> he<00:03:12.810> will<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.170> flop<00:03:13.620> over<00:03:13.769> like<00:03:14.069> this<00:03:14.280> is

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
him he will just flop over like this is

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.789 
him he will just flop over like this is
called<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.790> hamburger<00:03:15.450> for<00:03:15.840> some<00:03:16.109> reason<00:03:16.530> but

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
called the hamburger for some reason but

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.500 
called the hamburger for some reason but
I<00:03:17.280> guess<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.849> kind<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.030> looks<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.329> if<00:03:18.450> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
I guess it kind of looks like if you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.599 
I guess it kind of looks like if you
push<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> hamburger<00:03:19.139> over<00:03:19.500> if<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.190> kind<00:03:20.579> of

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
push a hamburger over if you do kind of

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.069 
push a hamburger over if you do kind of
