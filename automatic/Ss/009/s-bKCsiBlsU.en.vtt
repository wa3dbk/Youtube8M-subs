all right the process is complete so
let's<00:03:34.010> go<00:03:34.250> ahead<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.580> let's<00:03:34.700> double<00:03:35.030> check

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
let's go ahead and let's double check

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.410 
let's go ahead and let's double check
this<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:36.100> just<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:37.910> guys<00:03:38.000> know<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.360> is

this and just so you guys know this is

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.330 
this and just so you guys know this is
very<00:03:38.540> first<00:03:38.870> time<00:03:38.990> I'm<00:03:39.140> doing<00:03:39.380> this<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.130> I'm

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
very first time I'm doing this so I'm

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.830 
very first time I'm doing this so I'm
just<00:03:40.490> assuming<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.090> works<00:03:41.210> out<00:03:41.360> fine<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
just assuming that it works out fine and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.980 
just assuming that it works out fine and
I'm<00:03:41.960> sure<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.320> will<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.790> we<00:03:44.300> go<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.810> game

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
I'm sure it will so we go to the game

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.980 
I'm sure it will so we go to the game
section<00:03:45.620> we<00:03:46.520> go<00:03:46.670> down<00:03:46.940> yes<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.660> can<00:03:47.810> stall
