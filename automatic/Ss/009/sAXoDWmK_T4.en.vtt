00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
for this part from what I'm telling now

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.510 
for this part from what I'm telling now
all<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:41.800> I'm<00:02:41.890> gonna<00:02:42.010> keep<00:02:42.160> shaking<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:44.490> had<00:02:45.490> a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
all right I'm gonna keep shaking I had a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.580 
all right I'm gonna keep shaking I had a
carbonated<00:02:46.120> drink<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.690> here<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.170> seems<00:02:47.380> to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
carbonated drink in here that seems to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.440 
carbonated drink in here that seems to
cause<00:02:47.739> more<00:02:47.980> issues<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.820> also<00:02:48.940> use<00:02:49.150> fresh

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
cause more issues you can also use fresh

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.390 
cause more issues you can also use fresh
fruit<00:02:49.810> juice<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.440> things<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.100> that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
fruit juice and things like that so that

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.620 
fruit juice and things like that so that
might<00:02:51.580> be<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.730> better<00:02:51.880> way<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> go<00:02:52.390> than<00:02:52.420> a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
might be a better way to go than a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.360 
might be a better way to go than a
carbonated<00:02:53.140> drink<00:02:53.530> because<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:53.980> pressure

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
carbonated drink because this pressure

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.949 
carbonated drink because this pressure
does<00:02:54.700> keep<00:02:54.910> kicking<00:02:55.270> out<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.600> they<00:02:55.690> can<00:02:55.840> it

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
does keep kicking out and they can it

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.790 
does keep kicking out and they can it
spurred<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.470> little<00:02:56.709> bit<00:02:56.860> oh<00:02:58.500> well<00:02:59.500> now<00:02:59.620> it's

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
spurred a little bit oh well now it's

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.229 
spurred a little bit oh well now it's
getting<00:02:59.980> kind<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.250> thick<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.760> can't<00:03:01.000> shake

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
getting kind of thick and I can't shake

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.750 
getting kind of thick and I can't shake
it<00:03:01.300> as<00:03:01.540> much<00:03:01.750> anymore<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:02.200> can<00:03:02.380> tell<00:03:02.620> which<00:03:03.610> is

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
it as much anymore I can tell which is

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.940 
it as much anymore I can tell which is
better<00:03:03.970> too<00:03:04.300> because<00:03:04.570> it's<00:03:05.080> not<00:03:05.260> splattering

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
better too because it's not splattering

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.750 
better too because it's not splattering
out<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.310> there<00:03:06.430> as<00:03:06.550> bad<00:03:06.730> me<00:03:07.030> more<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
out of there as bad me more the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.460 
out of there as bad me more the
carbonated<00:03:10.239> beverage<00:03:10.720> really<00:03:10.989> wasn't<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.320> good

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
carbonated beverage really wasn't a good

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.880 
carbonated beverage really wasn't a good
idea<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.920> wouldn't<00:03:12.340> do<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:13.500> all<00:03:14.500> right<00:03:14.709> let's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
idea I wouldn't do that all right let's

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.690 
idea I wouldn't do that all right let's
pop<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.130> off<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.670> see<00:03:15.970> how<00:03:16.060> slushy<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.900> looks

pretty<00:03:21.700> slushy<00:03:25.110> but<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.200> course<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.650> part<00:03:26.980> of

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
pretty slushy but of course the part of

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.789 
pretty slushy but of course the part of

this<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.670> do<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.970> had<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.210> little<00:04:28.390> bit<00:04:28.510> of

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
this to do it had a little bit of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.810 
this to do it had a little bit of
leakage<00:04:28.900> issues<00:04:29.340> let<00:04:30.340> me<00:04:30.400> look<00:04:30.550> at<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:30.700> couple

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
leakage issues let me look at a couple

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.880 
leakage issues let me look at a couple
of<00:04:31.000> napkins<00:04:31.420> I<00:04:31.540> have<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:32.020> definitely<00:04:32.230> would<00:04:32.740> not

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
of napkins I have I definitely would not

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.610 
of napkins I have I definitely would not
give<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.640> four<00:04:34.240> or<00:04:34.450> five<00:04:34.720> year<00:04:34.990> old<00:04:35.140> kid<00:04:35.380> this

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
give a four or five year old kid this

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.140 
give a four or five year old kid this
thing<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.860> go<00:04:35.980> off<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.400> Shake<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:36.940> going<00:04:37.090> to

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
thing to go off and Shake is going to

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.200 
thing to go off and Shake is going to
end<00:04:37.270> up<00:04:37.330> being<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.630> mess<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.430> think<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.550> would

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
end up being a mess I think I would

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.790 
end up being a mess I think I would
write<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:40.720> little<00:04:40.930> bit<00:04:41.140> lower<00:04:41.350> than<00:04:41.560> ice

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
write this a little bit lower than ice

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.150 
write this a little bit lower than ice
cream<00:04:41.830> magic<00:04:42.670> you<00:04:43.630> still<00:04:43.840> got<00:04:43.960> these<00:04:44.140> ice<00:04:44.590> cube

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
cream magic you still got these ice cube

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.970 
cream magic you still got these ice cube

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
maybe two and a half it's definitely

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.880 
maybe two and a half it's definitely
gonna<00:05:04.150> be<00:05:04.210> more<00:05:04.450> mess<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:04.960> work<00:05:05.170> unless<00:05:05.680> you

but that's the slushy magic i'll put a

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.330 
but that's the slushy magic i'll put a
link<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.930> where<00:05:14.110> I<00:05:14.140> ordered<00:05:14.470> mine<00:05:14.680> online<00:05:14.950> just

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.470 

well<00:05:44.140> I<00:05:44.170> pulled<00:05:44.620> all<00:05:44.950> of<00:05:44.980> the<00:05:45.400> ice<00:05:45.700> QB<00:05:46.240> things

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
well I pulled all of the ice QB things

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.870 
well I pulled all of the ice QB things
out<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.870> it<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.230> I<00:05:47.800> did<00:05:48.070> get<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.400> know

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
out of it and I did get you know

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.470 
out of it and I did get you know
probably<00:05:49.270> eight<00:05:49.600> ounces<00:05:50.170> of<00:05:50.530> slushy<00:05:51.130> stop<00:05:51.700> so

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
probably eight ounces of slushy stop so

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.910 
probably eight ounces of slushy stop so
you<00:05:52.570> can<00:05:52.720> pour<00:05:52.900> this<00:05:53.050> into<00:05:53.200> another<00:05:53.350> copper

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920
