use a punch down tool and also how the
cable<00:00:10.920> an<00:00:11.910> rj45<00:00:12.769> cat6<00:00:13.849> jack<00:00:14.849> as<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.780> can<00:00:15.960> see

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
cable an rj45 cat6 jack as you can see

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.580 
cable an rj45 cat6 jack as you can see
this<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> keystone<00:00:17.070> jack<00:00:17.420> that<00:00:18.420> goes<00:00:19.320> into

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
this is a keystone jack that goes into

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.450 
this is a keystone jack that goes into
the<00:00:19.980> wall<00:00:20.189> plates<00:00:21.619> that<00:00:22.619> use<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.980> fact<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.340> this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the wall plates that use in fact in this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.970 
the wall plates that use in fact in this
case<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.150> cat5e<00:00:24.869> jack<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.560> says<00:00:25.740> right

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
case it's a cat5e jack it says right

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.660 
case it's a cat5e jack it says right
there<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.400> cat5<00:00:27.330> cat6<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.199> cat5e<00:00:28.650> will<00:00:29.519> have

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
there a cat5 cat6 and cat5e will have

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.540 
there a cat5 cat6 and cat5e will have
the<00:00:29.849> same<00:00:30.060> type<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.359> setup<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.140> will<00:00:32.130> work<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the same type of setup and will work the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
the same type of setup and will work the
same<00:00:32.730> way<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.180> they'll<00:00:33.480> almost<00:00:33.630> look

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
same way it will they'll almost look

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.040 
same way it will they'll almost look
identical<00:00:34.160> they're<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.370> rated<00:00:36.050> differently

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
identical they're just rated differently

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.729 
identical they're just rated differently
but<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> 110<00:00:39.239> punch<00:00:39.780> down<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
but this is a 110 punch down so the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.049 
but this is a 110 punch down so the
wires<00:00:40.950> will<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.340> between<00:00:41.520> there<00:00:43.879> first<00:00:44.879> thing

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
wires will go between there first thing

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
wires will go between there first thing
we're<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.809> show<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.170> how<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
we're going to do is show you how to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.069 
we're going to do is show you how to
strip<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> wire<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> important

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
strip the wire and this is important

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
strip the wire and this is important
because<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> don't<00:00:50.250> strip<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> right<00:00:50.879> you

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
because if you don't strip it right you

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.430 
because if you don't strip it right you
can<00:00:51.239> Nick<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> wire<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> could<00:00:52.289> cause

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
can Nick the wire and it could cause

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.700 
can Nick the wire and it could cause
problems<00:00:53.899> okay<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> first<00:00:55.199> thing<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.530> want

to do is you want to cut off a small
piece<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> exterior<00:00:59.809> cable<00:01:00.809> I

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
piece of the out of the exterior cable I

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.560 
piece of the out of the exterior cable I
just<00:01:02.190> want<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.850> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.120> try<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.359> hard

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
as you can not to Nick the cable that's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.700 
as you can not to Nick the cable that's
underneath<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.110> will<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.409> pull<00:01:07.680> right

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
underneath and it will just pull right

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.340 
underneath and it will just pull right
off<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.340> soon<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.170> there<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.200> go

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
off as soon as you do it there you go

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
off as soon as you do it there you go
and<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:11.159> different<00:01:11.700> sets<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
and you have your different sets of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
and you have your different sets of
twisted<00:01:13.140> pair<00:01:13.170> you'll<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.680> four<00:01:13.950> sets

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
twisted pair you'll have four sets

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.660 
twisted pair you'll have four sets
now<00:01:14.790> notice<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.840> there's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.650> string<00:01:17.009> so

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
now notice also that there's a string so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.520 
now notice also that there's a string so
first<00:01:18.119> thing<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.259> you're

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
first thing you want to do is you're

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.719 
first thing you want to do is you're
going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> pull<00:01:19.979> down<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.430> string<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going to pull down on the string to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.469 
going to pull down on the string to
reveal<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.080> cable<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.390> when<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
reveal more of the cable so when you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
reveal more of the cable so when you
pull<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> pull<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
pull down on there you want to pull it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
pull down on there you want to pull it
apart<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> cut<00:01:30.900> off<00:01:31.130> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
apart and then you want to cut off the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.859 
apart and then you want to cut off the
part<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.579> was<00:01:33.020> revealed<00:01:34.020> earlier<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
part that was revealed earlier so you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
part that was revealed earlier so you
want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> cut<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.579> little<00:01:38.850> 1<00:01:39.150> inch

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
want to cut off that that little 1 inch

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
want to cut off that that little 1 inch
or<00:01:39.509> two<00:01:39.659> inch<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.170> cut<00:01:40.770> off<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
or two inch that you cut off and the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
or two inch that you cut off and the
reason<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.540> possibly<00:01:43.110> could

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
reason you do this is you possibly could

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.929 
reason you do this is you possibly could
have<00:01:43.470> nicked<00:01:43.619> those<00:01:43.890> where<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:44.820> you're

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
have nicked those where if you're

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.490 
have nicked those where if you're
pulling<00:01:45.299> down<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.720> string<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.290> no

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
pulling down on the string there is no

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.530 
pulling down on the string there is no
possibility<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.189> nicking<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> cables<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.390> all

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
possibility of nicking the cables at all

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.440 
possibility of nicking the cables at all
so<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.560> separate<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.340> pair's<00:01:50.610> again<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so you separate the pair's again you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.450 
so you separate the pair's again you
have<00:01:51.540> four<00:01:51.810> pairs<00:01:52.079> eight<00:01:52.409> conductors<00:01:53.009> that's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
have four pairs eight conductors that's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.069 
have four pairs eight conductors that's
what<00:01:53.759> Ethernet<00:01:54.360> calls<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:56.490> an

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
what Ethernet calls for that's what an

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.730 
what Ethernet calls for that's what an
rj45<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.490> cat5e<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.600> cat6

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
rj45 is and that's what cat5e and cat6

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
rj45 is and that's what cat5e and cat6
require<00:02:03.020> ok<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:06.020> cables<00:02:07.020> are

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
require ok so now I have the cables are

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.749 
require ok so now I have the cables are
going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.350> twist<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.829> minimum<00:02:08.280> amount<00:02:08.670> of

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
going to twist the minimum amount of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.479 
going to twist the minimum amount of
cable<00:02:09.000> possible<00:02:09.959> I'm<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.160> make<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.400> as

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
cable possible I'm going to make it as

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.630 
cable possible I'm going to make it as
tight<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.819> possible

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
tight as possible

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.690 
tight as possible
close<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> twist<00:02:14.110> as<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.470> can<00:02:14.740> just<00:02:15.520> going

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
close to the twist as I can just going

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.430 
close to the twist as I can just going
to<00:02:15.790> set<00:02:15.970> them<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.270> there<00:02:16.480> right<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:16.990> each<00:02:17.200> of

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
to set them in there right now each of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.150 
to set them in there right now each of
the<00:02:17.730> four<00:02:18.730> pairs<00:02:19.890> again<00:02:20.890> in

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
the four pairs again in

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.610 
the four pairs again in
telecommunications<00:02:22.150> we<00:02:23.020> always<00:02:23.230> discuss

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
telecommunications we always discuss

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.830 
telecommunications we always discuss
things<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.130> pairs<00:02:25.740> not<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:26.860> single<00:02:27.220> wires<00:02:27.840> so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
things in pairs not in single wires so

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.000 
things in pairs not in single wires so
you're<00:02:28.930> gonna<00:02:29.050> put<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.350> down<00:02:30.090> there<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.920> it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
you're gonna put it down there and it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.710 
you're gonna put it down there and it
will<00:02:33.070> generally<00:02:33.640> stay<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.090> place<00:02:34.300> they<00:02:34.540> have<00:02:34.660> a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
will generally stay in place they have a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:52.630 
will generally stay in place they have a
chance<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.110> punch<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.560> down

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.940 

let<00:02:53.640> me<00:02:56.630> show<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.690> how<00:02:57.900> tight<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
let me show you how tight that is the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.710 
let me show you how tight that is the
tighter<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.430> keep<00:02:59.850> those<00:03:00.060> twists<00:03:00.600> all

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
tighter you can keep those twists all

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.420 
tighter you can keep those twists all
the<00:03:00.840> way<00:03:00.960> up<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> end<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.710> better<00:03:01.920> off<00:03:02.160> it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the way up to the end the better off it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.910 
the way up to the end the better off it
is<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.210> better<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.750> will<00:03:03.900> work<00:03:04.110> now<00:03:04.740> I'll

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
is and better it will work now I'll

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:14.750 
is and better it will work now I'll
punch<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.340> down<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.900> know<00:03:13.050> this<00:03:13.670> yeah<00:03:14.670> I'm

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
punch it down and you know this yeah I'm

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.940 
punch it down and you know this yeah I'm
going<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.940> turn<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.270> blade<00:03:15.480> towards<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.140> so

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
going to turn the blade towards you so

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.460 
going to turn the blade towards you so
you<00:03:17.070> can<00:03:17.280> see<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:18.450> I'm<00:03:18.600> using<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.080> cutting

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
you can see that I'm using the cutting

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.990 
you can see that I'm using the cutting
side<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.550> blade<00:03:22.190> right<00:03:23.190> there<00:03:23.460> you<00:03:23.820> see

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
side of the blade right there you see

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.210 
side of the blade right there you see
it's<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.390> cutting<00:03:24.720> side<00:03:24.990> that's<00:03:25.740> actually

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
it's a cutting side that's actually

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.670 
it's a cutting side that's actually
doing<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.520> cut<00:03:26.760> notice<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.630> one<00:03:28.260> side<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.530> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
doing a cut notice that one side of the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.530 
doing a cut notice that one side of the
blade<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.190> little<00:03:29.700> bit<00:03:29.880> longer<00:03:30.150> than<00:03:30.480> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
blade is a little bit longer than the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.510 
blade is a little bit longer than the
other<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.230> get<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.680> focus<00:03:31.890> right<00:03:32.310> there

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
other and get this in focus right there

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.810 
other and get this in focus right there
and<00:03:32.730> that's<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> cutting<00:03:34.290> blade<00:03:35.130> right<00:03:35.400> there

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
and that's the cutting blade right there

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.510 
and that's the cutting blade right there
the<00:03:36.420> cutting<00:03:36.840> side<00:03:37.020> so<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.380> this<00:03:37.470> case<00:03:37.860> this

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
the cutting side so in this case this

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.250 
the cutting side so in this case this
time<00:03:38.790> we're<00:03:39.000> going<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.150> turn<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.540> over<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.050> the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
time we're going to turn it over and the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.990 
time we're going to turn it over and the
cutting<00:03:40.560> blade<00:03:40.770> is<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.550> way

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.370 

want<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.060> follow<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.480> diagram<00:03:48.720> when<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
want to follow the diagram when the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.440 
want to follow the diagram when the
jacks<00:03:49.650> different<00:03:50.280> manufacturers<00:03:51.060> have

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
jacks different manufacturers have

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.390 
jacks different manufacturers have
different<00:03:51.900> diagrams<00:03:52.440> just<00:03:52.620> follow<00:03:53.130> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
different diagrams just follow the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.390 
different diagrams just follow the
colors<00:03:53.730> it's<00:03:54.000> right<00:03:54.180> underneath<00:03:54.390> the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
colors it's right underneath the

the diagram that tells you how to put

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.050 
the diagram that tells you how to put
the<00:04:01.320> wires<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.070> again<00:04:02.700> different

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
the wires in and again different

the wires in and again different
manufacturers<00:04:03.660> have<00:04:03.930> different<00:04:04.080> settings<00:04:04.650> as

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
manufacturers have different settings as

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.300 
manufacturers have different settings as
long<00:04:05.700> as<00:04:05.910> it's<00:04:06.440> rated<00:04:07.440> at<00:04:07.560> what<00:04:07.740> it's<00:04:07.860> rated<00:04:08.160> at

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
long as it's rated at what it's rated at

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.500 
long as it's rated at what it's rated at
that's<00:04:08.580> what<00:04:08.730> it's<00:04:08.880> going<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.060> be<00:04:09.180> good<00:04:09.300> for

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
that's what it's going to be good for

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.670 
that's what it's going to be good for
Cat<00:04:10.070> Cat<00:04:11.070> fight<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.520> E<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:13.500> course

when you're all done you want to put the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.810 
when you're all done you want to put the
caps<00:04:15.060> on<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:19.680> use<00:04:19.830> pliers<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.400> push<00:04:20.670> them

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
caps on and you use pliers to push them

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.550 
caps on and you use pliers to push them
down<00:04:20.970> if<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.270> want<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:23.370> works<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.760> as<00:04:23.970> well

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
down if you want it works just as well

down if you want it works just as well
and<00:04:25.560> that's<00:04:26.010> how<00:04:26.160> you<00:04:26.280> cable<00:04:26.790> cat5e<00:04:28.340> notice<00:04:29.340> on

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
and that's how you cable cat5e notice on

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.670 
and that's how you cable cat5e notice on
this<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.270> it's<00:04:30.450> it's<00:04:30.780> nice<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.260> tight<00:04:31.380> there

you know that bolts little while you can

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.870 
you know that bolts little while you can
see<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.240> there<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:58.170> on<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.740> back<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:59.550> will

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
see it there and on the back it will

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.240 
see it there and on the back it will
have<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.630> will<00:05:00.780> say<00:05:00.960> up<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.590> can<00:05:01.740> see<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.070> you

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
have it will say up you can see it you

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.420 
have it will say up you can see it you
want<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.520> keep<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.180> in<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.390> up<00:05:03.540> position<00:05:03.780> and

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
want to keep that in the up position and

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.550 
want to keep that in the up position and
then<00:05:05.430> when<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:05.760> attach<00:05:06.540> your<00:05:06.780> cable<00:05:07.260> your

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
then when you attach your cable your

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.650 
then when you attach your cable your
cable<00:05:07.950> I<00:05:08.280> mean<00:05:08.790> your<00:05:08.910> jack<00:05:09.150> should<00:05:09.390> be<00:05:09.480> in<00:05:09.570> the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
cable I mean your jack should be in the

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.370 
cable I mean your jack should be in the
out<00:05:09.750> position

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
out position

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.350 
out position
notice<00:05:11.190> that<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.930> that<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:14.360> conductors

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
notice that the that the the conductors

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.840 
notice that the that the the conductors
there<00:05:15.660> are<00:05:16.170> always<00:05:16.440> protected<00:05:16.680> from<00:05:17.310> dust<00:05:17.550> so

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
there are always protected from dust so

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.640 
there are always protected from dust so
dust<00:05:18.240> is<00:05:18.390> coming<00:05:18.750> down<00:05:18.870> on<00:05:18.930> them<00:05:19.260> like<00:05:19.290> this

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
dust is coming down on them like this

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.740 
dust is coming down on them like this
you<00:05:19.860> don't<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.880> dust<00:05:21.090> and<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.360> dirt<00:05:21.480> never

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
you don't the dust and the dirt never

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.810 
you don't the dust and the dirt never
gets<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.140> it<00:05:22.320> so<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.040> conductors<00:05:23.460> are<00:05:23.490> always

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
gets on it so the conductors are always

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.170 
gets on it so the conductors are always
on<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.060> up<00:05:24.210> side<00:05:24.510> of<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:25.050> jack<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.940> what<00:05:27.090> you

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
on the up side of the jack and what you

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.930 
on the up side of the jack and what you
do<00:05:27.330> is<00:05:28.550> you<00:05:30.440> snap<00:05:31.440> it<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.710> like<00:05:31.890> this<00:05:32.100> see<00:05:32.850> how

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
do is you snap it in like this see how

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.660 
do is you snap it in like this see how
it<00:05:33.090> goes<00:05:33.480> right<00:05:33.750> in<00:05:33.870> just<00:05:34.170> like<00:05:34.290> that<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:35.460> snaps

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
it goes right in just like that it snaps

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.630 
it goes right in just like that it snaps
right<00:05:35.880> in<00:05:36.180> looks<00:05:36.630> good<00:05:37.250> when<00:05:38.250> you<00:05:38.340> put<00:05:38.520> this

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
right in looks good when you put this

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.460 
right in looks good when you put this
back<00:05:38.700> on<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.240> wall<00:05:39.450> and<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:39.900> attach<00:05:40.290> the
