kind<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.629> like<00:00:06.750> having<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.990> bit<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.379> work<00:00:07.919> in

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
kind of like having a bit of a work in

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.129 
kind of like having a bit of a work in
bed<00:00:08.370> with<00:00:08.610> my<00:00:08.760> over<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.150> last<00:00:09.300> few<00:00:09.480> months<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
bed with my over the last few months and

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.049 
bed with my over the last few months and
I<00:00:10.800> took<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> idea<00:00:11.550> from<00:00:11.759> Glenn<00:00:12.450> Branca<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.380> he

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
I took the idea from Glenn Branca and he

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.609 
I took the idea from Glenn Branca and he
when<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.089> saw<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.540> didn't<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.230> by<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.500> I

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
when I saw that I didn't but by the I

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
when I saw that I didn't but by the I
thought<00:00:16.830> Bart<00:00:17.100> Hopkin<00:00:17.580> musical<00:00:18.570> instrument

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
thought Bart Hopkin musical instrument

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.240 
thought Bart Hopkin musical instrument
design<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:21.410> go<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.500> brand<00:00:22.710> his<00:00:22.830> instrument

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
design and go and brand his instrument

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.460 
design and go and brand his instrument
according<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:23.970> anyway<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.230> he<00:00:25.320> had

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
according to that but anyway and he had

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.230 
according to that but anyway and he had
the<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:25.710> pickup<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> side<00:00:26.789> which<00:00:26.970> picks

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the one pickup on the side which picks

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.749 
the one pickup on the side which picks
up<00:00:27.420> basically<00:00:29.449> sympathetic<00:00:31.579> vibrations<00:00:32.579> from

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
up basically sympathetic vibrations from

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.790 
up basically sympathetic vibrations from
these<00:00:32.940> strings<00:00:33.239> when<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.540> hit<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.960> harmonic

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
these strings when you hit the harmonic

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
these strings when you hit the harmonic
node<00:00:35.010> points<00:00:35.460> when<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.120> thought<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> using

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
node points when you thought of using

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.470 
node points when you thought of using
the<00:00:37.559> sway<00:00:37.800> bar<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:38.610> I'll<00:00:39.180> demonstrate

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the sway bar or just I'll demonstrate

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:55.760 
the sway bar or just I'll demonstrate
that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.710 

these<00:00:55.860> markers<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.790> horn<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.180> filter

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
these markers like the horn and filter

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.420 
these markers like the horn and filter
for<00:00:58.530> something<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.040> little<00:00:59.220> bit<00:00:59.400> more

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
for something a little bit more

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.070 
for something a little bit more
permanent<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.210> I've<00:01:00.420> heard<00:01:00.690> inlay<00:01:01.050> or

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
permanent on now I've heard inlay or

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.010 
permanent on now I've heard inlay or
something<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:04.170> red<00:01:04.410> mark<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.780> sort<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> going

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
something the red mark is sort of going

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
something the red mark is sort of going
this<00:01:07.260> way<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.740> guess<00:01:07.980> for<00:01:08.220> guitarists<00:01:08.790> out

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
this way I guess for guitarists out

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.170 
this way I guess for guitarists out
there<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.720> would<00:01:09.840> refer<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.230> the<00:01:10.470> 12th<00:01:10.860> fret

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
there that would refer to the 12th fret

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.420 
there that would refer to the 12th fret
seventh<00:01:12.180> fret<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> 5th<00:01:12.780> fret<00:01:13.310> well<00:01:14.310> these

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
seventh fret on the 5th fret well these

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.760 
seventh fret on the 5th fret well these
other<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.120> blue<00:01:15.450> yellow<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.810> green<00:01:15.960> dots<00:01:16.440> are

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
other the blue yellow and green dots are

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.750 
other the blue yellow and green dots are
sort<00:01:17.760> of<00:01:17.790> harmonics<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.510> various<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.979> varying

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
sort of harmonics of various or varying

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.650 
sort of harmonics of various or varying
strengths<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.720> guess<00:01:25.010> yeah<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.820> orange<00:01:27.300> dots

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
strengths I guess yeah the orange dots

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.810 
strengths I guess yeah the orange dots
are<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.500> guess<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.160> equal

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
are kind of the I guess that equal

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.380 
are kind of the I guess that equal
temperament<00:01:30.270> frets<00:01:30.990> fret<00:01:31.830> positionings

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.030 

yeah<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.660> I've<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.110> difference<00:01:37.710> they've<00:01:37.890> been

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
yeah so I've a difference they've been

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.880 
yeah so I've a difference they've been
branches<00:01:38.580> guitar<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.410> one<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> saw<00:01:40.860> in

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
branches guitar or the one that I saw in

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.150 
branches guitar or the one that I saw in
Bob<00:01:41.190> Hopkins<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.820> anyway<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.800> I've<00:01:43.800> added<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
Bob Hopkins but anyway and I've added a

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.400 
Bob Hopkins but anyway and I've added a
second<00:01:44.490> picks<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.540> you've<00:01:45.780> got<00:01:45.930> kind<00:01:46.290> of

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
second picks up on so you've got kind of

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.969 
second picks up on so you've got kind of
if<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.490> switch<00:01:47.729> off<00:01:47.880> their<00:01:48.470> whole<00:01:49.470> monix<00:01:49.770> pick

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
if I switch off their whole monix pick

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:00.410 
if I switch off their whole monix pick
up<00:01:56.630> like<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.410> of<00:01:58.500> lap<00:01:58.710> steel<00:01:58.979> guitar<00:01:59.420> with

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
up like in kind of lap steel guitar with

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.620 
up like in kind of lap steel guitar with
bass<00:02:00.720> pickups<00:02:00.929> on<00:02:01.319> full<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:03.060> go<00:02:03.209> over<00:02:03.450> here

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
bass pickups on full you go over here

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:16.449 
bass pickups on full you go over here
kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.899> blended<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.380> two<00:02:04.410> sides

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.010 

yeah<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:19.190> I'll<00:02:20.190> say<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.940> cause<00:02:21.270> briefly

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
yeah so I'll say you just cause briefly

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.390 
yeah so I'll say you just cause briefly
some<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.380> construction<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> element

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
some of the construction the element

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.020 
some of the construction the element
sees<00:02:23.580> Rathbun's<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.450> tuning<00:02:24.920> because<00:02:26.030> it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
sees Rathbun's for tuning because it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.240 
sees Rathbun's for tuning because it
seems<00:02:27.300> most<00:02:27.450> sensible<00:02:27.930> yes<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:31.470> body's<00:02:32.010> made

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
seems most sensible yes the body's made

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.630 
seems most sensible yes the body's made
from<00:02:32.459> Sycamore<00:02:33.739> locally<00:02:34.739> sourced<00:02:36.590> okay

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
from Sycamore locally sourced okay

maple<00:02:44.190> because<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.550> wanted<00:02:44.790> something<00:02:45.060> kind<00:02:45.209> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
maple because I wanted something kind of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.390 
maple because I wanted something kind of
hard<00:02:45.800> with<00:02:46.800> fret<00:02:47.310> wire<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:49.250> yes<00:02:50.250> they

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
hard with fret wire is the yes they

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.320 
hard with fret wire is the yes they
captured<00:02:50.820> like<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> saddle

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
captured like the saddle

yeah<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.630> single<00:02:54.959> called<00:02:55.140> pickups<00:02:55.620> which<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
yeah to single called pickups which a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.070 
yeah to single called pickups which a
little<00:02:56.940> bit<00:02:57.060> frustrating<00:02:57.540> business<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> lot<00:02:57.989> of

of this end yeah I need to put a
selector<00:03:16.470> switch<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.800> because<00:03:17.040> at<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.220> moment

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
selector switch in because at the moment

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.580 
selector switch in because at the moment
he<00:03:17.940> turned<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.269> falling<00:03:18.510> down<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> warning<00:03:19.049> its

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
he turned the falling down a warning its

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.930 
he turned the falling down a warning its
volume<00:03:19.890> down<00:03:20.040> than<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.280> other<00:03:20.400> which<00:03:20.610> is<00:03:20.760> gone

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
volume down than the other which is gone

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.680 
volume down than the other which is gone
frustrating<00:03:21.660> foot<00:03:21.900> ok<00:03:23.450> buttons<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.570> to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
frustrating foot ok buttons and to

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.140 
frustrating foot ok buttons and to
separate<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.260> divide<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.299> doesn't<00:03:28.880> yeah<00:03:29.910> and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
separate and divide so doesn't yeah and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.479 
separate and divide so doesn't yeah and
this<00:03:30.810> pickup<00:03:31.200> up<00:03:31.350> this<00:03:31.500> side<00:03:31.739> needs<00:03:31.950> padding

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
this pickup up this side needs padding

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.180 
this pickup up this side needs padding
so<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.850> doesn't<00:03:33.120> pick<00:03:33.239> up<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.860> resonance<00:03:34.860> as

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
so it doesn't pick up the resonance as

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.060 
so it doesn't pick up the resonance as
the<00:03:35.430> body<00:03:35.700> itself<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.079> more<00:03:37.709> purely

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
the body itself so it's more purely

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.330 
the body itself so it's more purely
focused<00:03:38.489> on<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.730> strings<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:41.010> I've<00:03:41.100> done<00:03:41.220> this

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
focused on the strings so I've done this

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.410 
focused on the strings so I've done this
felt<00:03:43.100> yeah<00:03:44.959> general<00:03:45.959> overview
