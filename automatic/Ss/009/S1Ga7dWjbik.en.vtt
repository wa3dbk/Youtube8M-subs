note<00:00:04.950> 2<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:07.170> shape<00:00:07.529> as<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.799> next

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
note 2 and this is a shape as the next

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.650 
note 2 and this is a shape as the next
shape<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.790> why<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.179> called<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
shape that is why it's called the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.789 
shape that is why it's called the
x-shaped<00:00:10.170> TPU<00:00:11.130> case<00:00:11.460> silicone<00:00:11.940> gel<00:00:12.509> skin<00:00:12.809> so

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
x-shaped TPU case silicone gel skin so

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.849 
x-shaped TPU case silicone gel skin so
you<00:00:14.519> can<00:00:14.670> see<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.480> comes<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.230> two

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
you can see here that it comes in two

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.160 
you can see here that it comes in two
different<00:00:17.390> materials<00:00:18.390> over<00:00:18.720> here<00:00:18.869> first<00:00:19.050> we

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
different materials over here first we

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.109 
different materials over here first we
have<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.439> silicon<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.640> kind<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.939> feels

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
have this silicon and it kind of feels

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.480 
have this silicon and it kind of feels
like<00:00:21.449> giddy<00:00:21.869> back<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.529> now<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.980> is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
like giddy back right now or is

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.970 
like giddy back right now or is
something<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.539> galaxy<00:00:24.930> devices<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.500> then

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
something the galaxy devices and then

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.070 
something the galaxy devices and then
you<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.760> sort<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.060> cool<00:00:27.330> great<00:00:27.660> feel

about<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.600> also

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
about this one is so you can see also

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.090 
about this one is so you can see also
that<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.379> been<00:00:49.559> thinking<00:00:49.980> about

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that they have been thinking about

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
that they have been thinking about
buttons<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.480> they<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:51.750> cut<00:00:52.110> off<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
buttons so they are not cut off for the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.970 
buttons so they are not cut off for the
buttons<00:00:53.149> which<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.539> making<00:00:54.870> its<00:00:55.649> having

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
buttons which is also making its having

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.279 
buttons which is also making its having
a<00:00:56.160> soft<00:00:56.399> feel<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.690> let's<00:00:57.870> put<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.039> one

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
a soft feel so let's put the on this one

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
a soft feel so let's put the on this one
we<00:01:01.289> also<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.980> same<00:01:02.010> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.430> material

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
we also have the same kind of material

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.039 
we also have the same kind of material
same<00:01:03.449> version<00:01:03.799> of<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.390> galaxy

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
same version of this one for the galaxy

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.760 
same version of this one for the galaxy
s3<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> could<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.880> nice<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
s3 so that could be very nice to know so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
s3 so that could be very nice to know so
this<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.220> how<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> looks<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.600> put

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this is how it looks like when you put

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
this is how it looks like when you put
it<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.799> what<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> also<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.189> say<00:01:17.369> about<00:01:17.490> this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it on so what I also can say about this

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.450 
it on so what I also can say about this
one<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.890> doesn't<00:01:19.890> add<00:01:19.979> much<00:01:20.040> both

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
one is that it it doesn't add much both

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.630 
one is that it it doesn't add much both
to<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.990> from<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> fair<00:01:22.409> feature<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.460> this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to it from a fair feature here with this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
to it from a fair feature here with this
one<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> buttons<00:01:24.710> with<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.890> one

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
one is that the buttons with this one

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.960 
one is that the buttons with this one
feels<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.090> soft<00:01:28.820> because<00:01:29.820> this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
feels really really soft because this

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.760 
feels really really soft because this
habits<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.509> log<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.130> silicone<00:01:32.130> feeling<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.090> them

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
habits or log a silicone feeling to them

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.300 
habits or log a silicone feeling to them
and<00:01:35.840> also<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.110> course<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> cutout

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and also of course you do have a cutout

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
and also of course you do have a cutout
here<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.479> S<00:01:39.600> Pen<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.049> well<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.689> can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
here for the S Pen as well so you can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.310 
here for the S Pen as well so you can
take<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.560> use<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:45.360> quick<00:01:46.020> little

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
take it out to use it so a quick little

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.880 
take it out to use it so a quick little
look<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:47.030> at<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:49.100> flexible<00:01:50.210> case<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.890> 40,000

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
look here at this flexible case a 40,000

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.520 
look here at this flexible case a 40,000
galaxy<00:01:53.310> note<00:01:53.460> 2<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.110> want<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> pick<00:01:55.439> up

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
galaxy note 2 and if you want to pick up

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
galaxy note 2 and if you want to pick up
this<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.579> variant<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> want<00:01:57.659> to
