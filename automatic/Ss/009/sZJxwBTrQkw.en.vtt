training<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:49.100> focus<00:01:49.399> a<00:01:49.789> lot<00:01:49.970> more<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:50.539> big

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
training I focus a lot more on big

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.770 
training I focus a lot more on big
compound<00:01:51.649> exercises<00:01:52.429> like<00:01:52.940> squats<00:01:53.000> and

deadlifts and pull-ups and presses and

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.749 
deadlifts and pull-ups and presses and
then<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.080> supplement<00:01:57.860> those<00:01:58.009> big<00:01:58.310> compound

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759
