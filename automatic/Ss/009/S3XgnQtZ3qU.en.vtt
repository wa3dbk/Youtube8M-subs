cuz<00:00:28.380> patandjill<00:00:28.859> EQ<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
cuz patandjill EQ and it's just we just

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.220 
cuz patandjill EQ and it's just we just
know<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.269> gonna<00:00:30.539> flow<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.050> nice

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
know it's gonna flow really nice

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.590 
know it's gonna flow really nice
material<00:00:32.189> such<00:00:32.340> as<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:32.640> Jersey<00:00:33.059> or<00:00:33.149> cotton

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
material such as like Jersey or cotton

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.139 
material such as like Jersey or cotton
is<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> best<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.680> cutting<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.940> not

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
is the best for cutting because it's not

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.030 
is the best for cutting because it's not
going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> fray<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.870> I've<00:00:37.290> washed<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.890> at

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
going to fray like I've washed this at

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.590 
going to fray like I've washed this at
least<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.340> four<00:00:38.640> or<00:00:38.730> five<00:00:38.790> times<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
least like four or five times but the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.260 
least like four or five times but the
edge<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.140> still<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.710> super<00:00:41.100> clean<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:42.239> I

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
edge is still like super clean so I

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
edge is still like super clean so I
guess<00:00:42.690> stick<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.230> Jersey<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.800> Cotton's<00:00:44.190> if

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
guess stick with Jersey and Cotton's if

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.369 
guess stick with Jersey and Cotton's if
you're<00:00:45.120> all<00:00:45.239> gonna<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.570> needing<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.989> pair<00:00:46.320> of

how<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.619> would<00:01:10.710> fall<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.010> me<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.420> should

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
how it would fall on me and you should

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.359 
how it would fall on me and you should
always<00:01:12.720> snip<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> little<00:01:13.500> bit<00:01:13.890> longer<00:01:14.070> than<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
always snip a little bit longer than you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.410 
always snip a little bit longer than you
want<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> could<00:01:14.909> always<00:01:15.090> make<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
want because you could always make it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.780 
want because you could always make it
shorter<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.049> can't<00:01:16.320> reattach<00:01:17.250> other

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
shorter but you can't reattach other

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.789 
shorter but you can't reattach other
parts<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> shirt<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.229> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.590> want

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
parts of the shirt so you kind of want

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.570 
parts of the shirt so you kind of want
to<00:01:19.880> overestimate<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.240> bit

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.340 

the<00:01:26.580> whole<00:01:26.760> is<00:01:26.880> right<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:28.290> pretty

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the whole is right here it's pretty

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
the whole is right here it's pretty
conspicuous<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.250> made<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> mistake<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
conspicuous if you made a mistake and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.719 
conspicuous if you made a mistake and
you<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.330> want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.510> lay<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:31.619> shirt<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.280> flat

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you just want to lay your shirt out flat

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.750 
you just want to lay your shirt out flat
so<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:34.280> uneven<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
so it's not going to be uneven when you

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.430 
so it's not going to be uneven when you
cut<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> snip<00:01:37.170> straight

cut it I'm just going to snip straight

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.420

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
yourself and the edges are going to get

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.710 
yourself and the edges are going to get
a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.070> frayed<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.149> material
