00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
quick comparison of what this looks like

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.560 
quick comparison of what this looks like
with<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.689> 411<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.579> here's<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.299> many<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
with the 411 so here's my and many of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.920 
with the 411 so here's my and many of
you<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.750> seen<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.140> 411<00:01:46.649> many<00:01:47.189> many<00:01:47.549> times
