recovery I am wearing this brace that
they<00:06:11.530> fitted<00:06:11.890> me<00:06:11.920> for<00:06:12.960> maybe<00:06:13.960> a<00:06:14.080> day<00:06:14.500> after

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
they fitted me for maybe a day after

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.520 
they fitted me for maybe a day after
that<00:06:14.920> second<00:06:15.430> surgery<00:06:15.880> and<00:06:16.420> it's<00:06:17.200> made<00:06:17.380> of

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
that second surgery and it's made of

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.680 
that second surgery and it's made of
plastic<00:06:17.650> it's<00:06:18.430> it's<00:06:18.970> hard<00:06:19.330> it's<00:06:19.630> very

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
plastic it's it's hard it's very

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.170 
plastic it's it's hard it's very
restrictive<00:06:20.530> but<00:06:21.190> it's<00:06:21.340> to<00:06:21.580> keep<00:06:21.790> me<00:06:21.970> from

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
restrictive but it's to keep me from

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.590 
restrictive but it's to keep me from
bending<00:06:22.720> or<00:06:23.020> lifting<00:06:23.050> or<00:06:23.650> twisting<00:06:24.360> in<00:06:25.360> any

bending or lifting or twisting in any

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.660 
bending or lifting or twisting in any
way<00:06:25.810> that's<00:06:26.110> going<00:06:26.290> to<00:06:26.350> hurt<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.950> fusion<00:06:27.370> that

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
way that's going to hurt the fusion that

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.000 
way that's going to hurt the fusion that
they're<00:06:27.910> trying<00:06:28.270> to<00:06:28.360> make<00:06:28.840> happen<00:06:29.050> I<00:06:29.560> also

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
they're trying to make happen I also

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.270 
they're trying to make happen I also
have<00:06:30.280> this<00:06:30.460> little<00:06:30.700> battery<00:06:31.540> powered

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
have this little battery powered

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.150 
have this little battery powered
electrical<00:06:33.280> stimulator<00:06:34.120> and<00:06:34.770> my<00:06:35.770> husband

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
electrical stimulator and my husband

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.850 
electrical stimulator and my husband
just<00:06:36.250> puts<00:06:36.550> these<00:06:36.700> little<00:06:37.090> pads<00:06:37.860> around

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
just puts these little pads around

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.100 
just puts these little pads around
certain<00:06:39.100> parts<00:06:39.460> of<00:06:39.520> my<00:06:39.580> spine<00:06:40.030> right<00:06:40.840> on<00:06:40.990> the

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
certain parts of my spine right on the

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.780 
certain parts of my spine right on the
skin<00:06:41.440> and<00:06:41.740> it<00:06:41.860> sends<00:06:42.100> this<00:06:42.250> electrical

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
skin and it sends this electrical

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.150 
skin and it sends this electrical
current<00:06:42.990> up<00:06:43.990> and<00:06:44.200> down<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.440> spine<00:06:44.710> and

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
current up and down the spine and

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.820 
current up and down the spine and
this<00:06:45.550> really<00:06:45.820> helps<00:06:46.300> the<00:06:46.810> fusion<00:06:47.260> rate<00:06:47.500> the

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
this really helps the fusion rate the

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.740 
this really helps the fusion rate the
rate<00:06:47.980> of<00:06:48.310> it<00:06:48.580> all<00:06:48.850> kind<00:06:49.240> of<00:06:49.300> coming<00:06:49.600> together

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
rate of it all kind of coming together

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.660 
rate of it all kind of coming together
and<00:06:50.230> solidifying<00:06:52.620> the<00:06:53.620> alignment<00:06:54.310> of<00:06:54.430> my

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670 
and solidifying the alignment of my

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.830 
and solidifying the alignment of my
spine<00:06:55.150> is<00:06:55.600> just<00:06:56.440> remarkable<00:06:57.480> the<00:06:58.480> doctor

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
spine is just remarkable the doctor

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.470 
spine is just remarkable the doctor
showed<00:06:59.050> me<00:06:59.260> the<00:06:59.560> x-ray<00:07:00.160> during<00:07:01.120> my<00:07:01.240> first

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
showed me the x-ray during my first

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.990 
showed me the x-ray during my first
visit<00:07:01.660> back<00:07:02.110> with<00:07:02.560> them<00:07:02.830> and<00:07:03.100> I<00:07:03.550> just<00:07:03.790> couldn't

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
visit back with them and I just couldn't

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.310 
visit back with them and I just couldn't
believe<00:07:04.470> how<00:07:05.470> on<00:07:06.190> the<00:07:06.460> first<00:07:06.730> before<00:07:07.120> x-ray<00:07:07.960> I

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
believe how on the first before x-ray I

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.910 
believe how on the first before x-ray I
had<00:07:08.770> that<00:07:08.980> clear<00:07:09.310> s-curve<00:07:10.240> and<00:07:10.600> on<00:07:11.350> the<00:07:11.530> after

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:11.920 
had that clear s-curve and on the after

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.010 
had that clear s-curve and on the after
x-ray<00:07:12.430> it<00:07:12.820> was<00:07:13.030> completely<00:07:13.510> straight<00:07:13.810> I<00:07:13.840> don't

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
x-ray it was completely straight I don't

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.990 
x-ray it was completely straight I don't
that<00:07:14.230> could<00:07:14.350> be<00:07:14.470> any<00:07:14.620> straighter<00:07:15.040> so<00:07:15.820> that's

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
that could be any straighter so that's

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.940 
that could be any straighter so that's
just<00:07:16.150> remarkable

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:21.950 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.700 

recovery<00:07:22.950> is<00:07:23.630> going<00:07:24.630> way<00:07:24.900> too<00:07:24.960> slow<00:07:25.410> for<00:07:25.440> me

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
recovery is going way too slow for me

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.040 
recovery is going way too slow for me
but<00:07:26.160> I<00:07:26.190> am<00:07:26.520> reminded<00:07:27.300> all<00:07:27.420> the<00:07:27.570> time<00:07:27.780> that

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
but I am reminded all the time that

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.980 
but I am reminded all the time that
every<00:07:28.290> day<00:07:28.500> I'm<00:07:28.830> able<00:07:29.220> to<00:07:29.460> do<00:07:30.000> more<00:07:30.240> things<00:07:30.540> I

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
every day I'm able to do more things I

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.320 
every day I'm able to do more things I
cook<00:07:31.200> dinner<00:07:31.230> the<00:07:31.650> other<00:07:31.680> night<00:07:31.970> today<00:07:32.970> I<00:07:33.000> went

for<00:07:33.570> a<00:07:33.600> walk<00:07:33.660> around<00:07:34.440> my<00:07:34.620> neighborhood<00:07:34.650> it<00:07:35.340> was

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 
for a walk around my neighborhood it was

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.640 
for a walk around my neighborhood it was
a<00:07:35.460> nice<00:07:35.700> day<00:07:35.910> outside<00:07:36.090> so<00:07:36.750> these<00:07:37.320> are<00:07:37.440> things

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650 
a nice day outside so these are things

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.790 
a nice day outside so these are things
that<00:07:37.740> I<00:07:37.890> couldn't<00:07:38.280> do<00:07:38.430> a<00:07:38.700> week<00:07:39.000> ago<00:07:39.300> and<00:07:39.800> so

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 
that I couldn't do a week ago and so

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.680 
that I couldn't do a week ago and so
every<00:07:41.040> day<00:07:41.220> I'm<00:07:41.400> actually<00:07:41.790> able<00:07:42.150> to<00:07:42.300> progress

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690 
every day I'm actually able to progress

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.600 
every day I'm actually able to progress
a<00:07:42.810> little<00:07:43.170> bit<00:07:43.320> more<00:07:43.560> and<00:07:44.130> just<00:07:44.310> trying<00:07:44.550> to

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:44.610 
a little bit more and just trying to

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.060 
a little bit more and just trying to
keep<00:07:44.700> my<00:07:44.880> spirits<00:07:45.360> up<00:07:45.540> you<00:07:45.900> know<00:07:46.050> I've<00:07:46.320> been<00:07:46.350> a

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.070 
keep my spirits up you know I've been a

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.070 
keep my spirits up you know I've been a
little<00:07:47.160> depressed<00:07:47.970> through<00:07:48.360> the<00:07:48.480> process

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 
little depressed through the process

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.170 
little depressed through the process
which<00:07:49.230> is<00:07:49.260> pretty<00:07:49.650> pretty<00:07:50.460> common<00:07:51.060> I<00:07:51.150> guess

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 
which is pretty pretty common I guess

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.390 
which is pretty pretty common I guess
when<00:07:51.540> you<00:07:51.630> have<00:07:51.660> a<00:07:51.810> really<00:07:52.080> big<00:07:52.410> surgery<00:07:53.070> and

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:58.260 
quickly but I'm working through that and
