00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.139
 hi guys girls what are you like 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.879
 welcome once again to this channel 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.250
 I hope you are all very well in this 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.470
 today's video I bring you a look that 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.300
 I hope you like it a lot, it's the look that 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.369
 I'm taking it right now, as you can 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.680
 check as it has green tones 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.259
 golden and so on and I think it's a look 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.300
 very very nice for this season 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.040
 spring although good can be used 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.790
 throughout the year of course 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.649
 because it is that they are makeups that only 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.360
 do pretty timeless that you can 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.320
 use during all periods of 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.750
 year 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.610
 so nothing took away more time 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.790
 I leave with the video tutorial I hope that you 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.430
 like it and see you first thing 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.680
 to do is to put a pre-base in a color 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.620
 green in this case chosen this pencil 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.770
 the mack brand and the tone is the color 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.290
 minter that's good because it's going to work 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.150
 as a pre-base mode to intensify 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.520
 the color of the shadows that we are going to 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.350
 place next and as you see what 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.350
 I'm blurring with the help of the finger 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.630
 to then take a little bit of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.939
 the shadow to sumptuous lead also from the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.649
 Mark Mack and with the help of a brush 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.880
 flat to apply shadows as well as 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.340
 you see what I'm applying for all the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.530
 mobile eyelid surface blurring 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 very well integrating it very well with 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.899
 the green prebase we had 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.899
 put previously 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.710
 Now I'm going to take a little bit of this 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.130
 shadow so special that is the shadow 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.340
 mac pen that is a shadow like a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.560
 bluish green or intense oil very very 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.110
 Nice is very flattering and as you see the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.320
 we have placed in the outer third of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.750
 eye 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.909
 and with makelele powder sculptors 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.550
 sculpting powder what I'm going to do is 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.320
 so eliminate that cut from the shadow 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.810
 green blurring it very well in the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.940
 basin to make and create an effect of 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.310
 transition now I'm going to take this shadow 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.260
 in a vanilla color of the débora brand 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.270
 which is a mineral shadow and I'm going to 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.880
 apply just below the eyebrow to 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.009
 perfect a little bit the blur 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.380
 the shadow is kurt now what I'm going to 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.320
 to do is to put a shadow then of a 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.890
 golden effect with pretty enough 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.330
 pretty thick pigment glitter and what 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.010
 what we are going to do is nothing to put it 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.200
 on the mobile eyelid from the lacrimal 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.420
 until the center of the eye we return to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.810
 Apply a little bit of shadow pens 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.130
 to intensify that area, because 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.100
 the best since it was possible to erase a 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.380
 little by applying the gold and now with 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.019
 a very creamy pencil in a brown color 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.330
 what I'm going to do is mark the line 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.790
 water both on top of the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.570
 tabs like on the bottom like 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.570
 you will see below 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.810
 this is not going to make us smaller 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.400
 eye but it's just going to 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.800
 accentuate will give you a little more 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.300
 force with which the eye will be much 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.160
 more intense and it will be much more 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.800
 protagonist of the look now what I'm going to 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.920
 do is blur slightly with both 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.050
 Integrated brushes with shadow pens 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.030
 with the remains of the shadows and so 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.209
 create a small effect is very and fair 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.970
 below the lower lashes 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.280
 I'm going to curl the eyelashes this is a 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.350
 curler that works with heat and the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.260
 it's really good for me 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.599
 raise the curvature of the eyelashes 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.060
 and then I will apply enough 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.340
 Mask layers of my favorite mask 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.290
 of the moment that is deliplus max and 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.390
 volume the truth is that if you have not 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.909
 I recommend it to you because it is a 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.470
 passed at the beginning is a little lumps and 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.629
 is but once the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.310
 little boat a few days he takes the 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.140
 adequate consistency to leave some 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.530
 infarct lashes as you can be 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.530
 watching here 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.450
 let's not forget to mark a little in 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.090
 the lower lashes to give like this 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.370
 greater amplitude to the eye and give it an effect 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.469
 much more finished and much more 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.139
 sophisticated now I'm going to apply a 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:01.730
 I'm going to blur it 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.730
 with the help of a synthetic brush 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.030
 so we clean what makeup is 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.710
 and now I'm going to use this base of 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.420
 makeup and this sponge that is of the 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.980
 social techniques and the truth is me 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.959
 I like it a lot and I'll talk more 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.810
 go ahead about all the sponges of 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.310
 this guy that I've been testing and they're 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.920
 the attentive to the channel because I'm going to do 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.180
 a comparison of several brands and good 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.440
 I'm applying the base of 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.200
 make up with the help of this 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.600
 sponge moistened and with the most 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.640
 flat since I think that I have left 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.640
 pretty good to cover certain areas 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.719
 now I will put with the help of these 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.300
 loose powders from clinic that are 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:54.839
 translucent color neutral because 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.639
 a light layer for let's say notify and 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:59.610
 settle a little more the base of 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.349
 makeup since I have a oily skin and 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.599
 I want to avoid shining 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.819
 these bronzing powder to fill 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.610
 lagoon tones what I'm going to do is 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.620
 mark the cheekbone well for 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.210
 outlining slightly I do not want to 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.819
 Too much change the shape of my face 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.120
 you can simply mark a little 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:20.789
 cheekbone and tan it and with this blusher 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.129
 that is from the page of makeup chic that 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.710
 I'm going to leave you down the link in the box 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:28.379
 of information as well as the name I'm going to 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.300
 apply a little bit and you'll see the past 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.960
 what is this rouge since it leaves a 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.849
 Illuminator effect on the cheekbone with 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.819
 a golden touch that I think favors 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:41.099
 very much now that it starts to heat up 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.289
 the sun and give us a lot more look 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.059
 healthy and the truth is that this 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.480
 illuminator is fantastic as you have 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:50.870
 seen is beautiful 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:55.190
 with this mac styling pencil that is 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.560
 the bold and see and this lipstick of zoé va 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.050
 what is the 02 face and love what I am going to 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.430
 do what you are seeing 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.680
 Make up the contour of the lip 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.660
 profile it with the help of the profiler and 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.820
 then what I'm going to do is fill it 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.280
 with the lipstick that as you know are the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.790
 lipsticks that are very very creamy very 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.660
 pigments of an acceptable duration and 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.860
 also they are totally vegan and they are 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.780
 very comfortable to carry the truth despite 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.400
 to have a texture a little bit more more 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.400
 dense than a labial any 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.400
 here you can better appreciate the tone 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.730
 although it looks slightly more toasted than 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.600
 what is really maybe that effect 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:41.270
 of camera lighting 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.970
 Finally, I forgot to make up 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.640
 eyebrows not that it is very important 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.130
 mark those brows fill them outline 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.010
 so that the look is already super 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:55.570
 perfect and then we even change a 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.570
 little bit the face expression true 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.730
 Finally, I want to finish 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:06.160
 light up again with the vanilla shadow 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:09.070
 just under the eyebrows remind you that 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.770
 It was the shadow of Deborah and here you are 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.660
 seeing the final result what do you think 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.760
 I think it is very flattering very nice 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.920
 a very timeless makeup that can be 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.620
 use at any time of year and 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.750
 Well nothing that on my part is all 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.880
 said thank you very much for having seen 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.540
 this video and see you in the next 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.540
