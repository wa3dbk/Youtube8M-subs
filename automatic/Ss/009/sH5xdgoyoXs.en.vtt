battlefield free so I'm kind of new to
all<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.009> don't<00:01:26.189> know<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.460> command

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
all this I I don't know what command

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 
all this I I don't know what command
mode<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.090> typically<00:01:27.479> are<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.259> suspect<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
mode is typically are as a suspect and I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700 
mode is typically are as a suspect and I
think<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> real<00:01:31.170> time<00:01:31.439> strategy

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
think it's like a real time strategy

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 
think it's like a real time strategy
kind<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.159> thing<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.110> real-time

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
kind of thing so as in the real-time

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
kind of thing so as in the real-time
awards<00:01:35.159> an<00:01:35.340> unlocked<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.970> artillery<00:01:36.509> support

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
awards an unlocked so artillery support

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.030 
awards an unlocked so artillery support
like<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.640> your<00:01:38.640> scan<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.450> UAVs<00:01:40.040> mobile

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
like a a your scan so like UAVs mobile

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.770 
like a a your scan so like UAVs mobile
spawn<00:01:41.400> points<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:41.909> thinking<00:01:42.329> their

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
spawn points I'm thinking their

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.649 
spawn points I'm thinking their
elephants<00:01:43.380> from<00:01:43.590> Halo<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:45.060> they're<00:01:45.420> like

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
elephants from Halo because they're like

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.080 
elephants from Halo because they're like
big<00:01:45.960> tank<00:01:46.829> kind<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> things<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> it's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
big tank kind of things and it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
big tank kind of things and it's
something<00:01:48.360> you'd<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.750> able<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> spawn<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
something you'd be able to spawn in and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
something you'd be able to spawn in and
then<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.060> fight<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> battle

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
then get out and you know fight a battle

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.569 
then get out and you know fight a battle
which<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> gonna<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> nice

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
which is I think this is gonna be a nice

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
which is I think this is gonna be a nice

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
maybe if you get shot you can actually

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.410 
maybe if you get shot you can actually
see<00:03:15.990> blood<00:03:16.620> coming<00:03:16.800> out<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.730> characters

see blood coming out of the characters

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.580 
see blood coming out of the characters
body<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:20.700> might<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.120> might<00:03:21.750> not<00:03:21.930> able<00:03:22.290> to

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
body and it might you might not able to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.700 
body and it might you might not able to
see<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:22.950> visually<00:03:23.750> maybe<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.020> get<00:03:25.170> shot<00:03:25.290> on

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
see it visually maybe if you get shot on

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.530 
see it visually maybe if you get shot on
your<00:03:25.830> hand<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.220> might<00:03:26.400> be<00:03:26.940> able<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.240> see<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
your hand you might be able to see it I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.240 
your hand you might be able to see it I
think<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.840> might<00:03:27.930> be<00:03:27.990> like<00:03:28.260> more<00:03:28.530> third<00:03:28.800> person

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
think it might be like more third person

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.730 
think it might be like more third person
so<00:03:29.430> if<00:03:29.520> someone<00:03:29.760> saw<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.840> did<00:03:31.200> see<00:03:31.440> blood

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
so if someone saw you you did see blood

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.050 
so if someone saw you you did see blood
coming<00:03:31.770> off<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:34.430> an<00:03:35.430> interesting<00:03:35.940> idea

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
coming off you and an interesting idea

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.940 
coming off you and an interesting idea
I've<00:03:36.480> just<00:03:36.690> had<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.080> know<00:03:37.110> say<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.470> got<00:03:37.710> shot

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
I've just had you know say you got shot

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.580 
I've just had you know say you got shot

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
and blood started coming out what if the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.010 
and blood started coming out what if the
blood<00:03:40.770> actually<00:03:40.980> made<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> trail<00:03:42.240> so<00:03:42.600> you

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
blood actually made a trail so you

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.720 
blood actually made a trail so you
running<00:03:43.380> around<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.890> blood<00:03:44.100> was<00:03:44.280> coming<00:03:44.460> out

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
them but they've run off and you could

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.920 
them but they've run off and you could
see<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.280> blood<00:03:56.550> trail<00:03:56.790> how<00:03:57.300> cool<00:03:57.570> would<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.810> be

that'd<00:03:58.200> be<00:03:58.350> really<00:03:58.530> awesome<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.100> could<00:03:59.310> see

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
that'd be really awesome and I could see

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.550 
that'd be really awesome and I could see
battlefield<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:00.270> something<00:04:00.750> like<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:00.960> it

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
battlefield do something like that it

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.870 
battlefield do something like that it
would<00:04:01.710> only<00:04:01.740> last<00:04:02.070> for<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.340> short<00:04:02.370> amount<00:04:02.700> of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
would only last for a short amount of

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.580 
would only last for a short amount of
time<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.240> it<00:04:03.330> could<00:04:03.630> give<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.110> an<00:04:04.260> advantage

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
time but it could give you an advantage
