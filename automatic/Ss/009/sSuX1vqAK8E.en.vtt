it's<00:04:18.959> had<00:04:19.200> precisely<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.130> opposite<00:04:20.580> effect

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
it's had precisely the opposite effect

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.450 
it's had precisely the opposite effect
in<00:04:21.150> these<00:04:21.359> six<00:04:21.660> months<00:04:22.049> where<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.890> ended<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
in these six months where you ended the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.560 
in these six months where you ended the
extended<00:04:23.970> unemployment

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
extended unemployment

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.020 
extended unemployment
and<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.530> conservative<00:04:26.160> argument<00:04:26.340> was<00:04:26.880> if

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
and the the conservative argument was if

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.910 
and the the conservative argument was if
you<00:04:27.060> subsidize<00:04:27.690> something<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.380> get<00:04:28.500> more<00:04:28.740> of

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
you subsidize something and get more of

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.250 
you subsidize something and get more of
it<00:04:29.040> if<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.760> stop<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.240> upsetting<00:04:30.750> and<00:04:30.930> less

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
it if you stop this upsetting and less

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.070 
it if you stop this upsetting and less
of<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:32.130> these<00:04:32.340> six<00:04:32.730> months<00:04:33.120> coincide<00:04:33.780> with

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
of it so these six months coincide with

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.650 
of it so these six months coincide with
a<00:04:34.470> decrease<00:04:35.220> in<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.640> medium<00:04:36.120> length<00:04:36.420> of

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
a decrease in the medium length of

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.920 
a decrease in the medium length of
unemployment<00:04:37.170> from<00:04:38.040> 17<00:04:38.670> weeks<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.210> 13<00:04:39.660> weeks

unemployment<00:04:48.090> benefits<00:04:48.480> went<00:04:48.690> down<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.350> so

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
unemployment benefits went down and so

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.350 
unemployment benefits went down and so

did unemployment Scott why do we have to

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.270 
did unemployment Scott why do we have to
keep<00:04:51.600> re<00:04:52.020> learning<00:04:52.320> this<00:04:52.650> lesson<00:04:52.890> that's

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
keep re learning this lesson that's

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.730 
keep re learning this lesson that's
subsidizing<00:04:54.060> even<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.420> bad<00:04:54.690> thing<00:04:55.050> still<00:04:55.470> gives

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
subsidizing even a bad thing still gives

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.060 
subsidizing even a bad thing still gives
you<00:04:55.890> more<00:04:56.070> of<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.280> bad<00:04:56.580> thing<00:04:57.740> well<00:04:58.740> cuz<00:04:58.950> it

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
you more of that bad thing well cuz it

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.410 
you more of that bad thing well cuz it
seems<00:04:59.220> like<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.550> right<00:04:59.700> thing<00:04:59.730> to<00:05:00.000> do<00:05:00.180> at<00:05:00.300> the
