00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
was 50 I would have 200 through the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.580 
was 50 I would have 200 through the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
maybe I can't remember i think i was

around<00:00:34.710> their<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.280> yet<00:00:35.460> i<00:00:35.670> got<00:00:36.480> him<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
around their little but yet i got him it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.740 
around their little but yet i got him it
was<00:00:37.620> easy<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.129> didn't<00:00:38.460> even<00:00:38.489> jump<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.420> plus

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
was easy I didn't even jump down to plus

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
was easy I didn't even jump down to plus
six<00:00:40.020> much<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.559> did<00:00:40.739> plus<00:00:40.950> 10<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> way

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
six much as I did plus 10 all the way

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.250 
six much as I did plus 10 all the way
and<00:00:42.230> i<00:00:43.579> still<00:00:44.579> had<00:00:44.730> 24<00:00:45.239> title<00:00:45.570> matches<00:00:45.719> left<00:00:46.050> at

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and i still had 24 title matches left at

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.580 
and i still had 24 title matches left at
the<00:00:46.350> end<00:00:46.640> which<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.820> fringe<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.899> strange<00:00:49.200> but

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the end which is fringe just strange but

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.709 
the end which is fringe just strange but
I<00:00:49.620> figured<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.969> plus<00:00:51.420> 10

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I figured it out if you do plus 10

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.720 
I figured it out if you do plus 10

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
believe let's see let's see where is he

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.960 
believe let's see let's see where is he
let's<00:02:38.489> scroll<00:02:38.790> down<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> bit<00:02:39.180> he<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:40.970> yeah

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
