00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.920
 connected and the second side of the cap 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.950
 now we will sew it with a hook 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.250
 we need to sew to the side 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:20.279
 central we arrange inside the facial 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:27.869
 side we take a working thread attach 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:32.070
 thread for her and begin to bind 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.570
 Circuits among themselves on the main part 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.019
 grabbing the front half loop 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.190
 and on the side we grab the front 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.449
 half a loop 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.140
 and knit a column without nakida then 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:51.210
 next we capture half loop on 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 the first part and half the loop into 2 parts and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.710
 knit a single crochet in 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.089
 next loop 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.589
 the next 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:19.360
 single crochet into the next loop and 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:23.240
 so we will need to tie to the end 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.080
 a series we do not forget we only capture 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.210
 front half loop stitching one side 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.870
 the same is repeated with the second 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.979
 parties 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.290
 sew from the seamy side sewed 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.320
 one side to the central such 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.560
 the same way we sew and the second from two 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.560
 parties 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.630
 sew a hat turn it over face 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.770
 front part this will be the part where we are 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.430
 gained loops she lived on a cloud 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.210
 Wednesday we closed the loop now to us 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:07.570
 need to hook with a hook our 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:12.860
 we attach the ears thread and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.310
 we tie up the ears by crochets 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.310
 circle 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.230
 tying up the posts in each loop 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:26.450
 grabbing both halves in the first loop 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:36.440
 next loop knit column without nakida 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:39.640
 next loop next grabbing 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.640
 both halves 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:53.890
 the next and so the bars without 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:58.250
 nakida we tie our ear completely 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:03.730
 occipital part tying completely 1 ear 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.730
 we cut the working thread and close the loop 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.650
 then we attach the thread to the other ear 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.780
 and tie it the same way on the face 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.370
 to the side 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.310
 tied around and the second ear will continue 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.650
 undergirding the cap take the fur thread 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.780
 hook thicker I have number 3 and 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.240
 we attach a fur thread to the front 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.240
 parts to the beginning of the frontal part 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.670
 we will tie on the front side 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.540
 we knit with single crochets in 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:58.580
 each column of the previous row to the first 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:01.280
 knit column knit without nakida in 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:09.550
 the second column is tying the column without 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.550
 on the next bar 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.120
 so we will tie the fur thread over 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:32.250
 circle immediately the ear and the back of the head 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.319
 and the second ear before the frontal part 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.800
 knit one by one column without nakida in 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:41.259
 each column of the previous row tying 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.250
 before the start of the frontal part would give a link 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:49.870
 Visor loop is what we have on the hook 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:52.650
 change clothes on knitting needles 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.080
 now loops on the needles 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.280
 enter the hook into the next loop 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.220
 grab the working thread pull out and 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.310
 we knit a single crochet 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.539
 resulting loop 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.539
 throwing a knitting needle 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:17.219
 then enter the next loop hook 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.919
 grab the working thread pull out and 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:21.520
 we knit a single crochet 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.819
 resulting loop 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.080
 we dress on a knitting needle so we will 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.900
 gain loops 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.409
 enter the hook grab working thread 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.620
 we pull out a column without 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.620
 nakida 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.970
 get the loop on the knitting needle 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.600
 the next loop is captured working thread 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.870
 knit a column and throw it on 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.680
 knitting needle so we type loops on 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.590
 spoke until the end of the frontal part of typing 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:07.730
 the loop on the needle debug hook and boom 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:14.220
 knit knit knit first row 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:19.280
 knitting facial and all 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.280
 next loops of the same knit facial 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.470
 so knit facial loops until the end 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.120
 rows next rows will also knit 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:57.610
 face loops to the desired height 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:02.920
 tying the required height of the visor close 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:05.380
 loop I got 11 rows 12 row 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:11.650
 we will close loops knit on 2 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:15.700
 loops together 2 loops knit together 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:18.390
 face loop we throw 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.220
 on the left knitting needle the next 2 loops 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.420
 knit together and in this way 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.720
 close all the loops on the left spoke 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.960
 closing all the loops and a cap with ear-flaps ready 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.020
 left 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.050
 steam our ears and hide everything 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.010
 tails of threads hidden all tails 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.010
 hat ready
