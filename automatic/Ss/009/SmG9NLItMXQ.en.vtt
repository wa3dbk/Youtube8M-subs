00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
to go dry at an axle you see I wouldn't

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.580 
to go dry at an axle you see I wouldn't
really<00:00:23.490> mind<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:24.330> dry<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:25.050> something<00:00:25.439> like

Alma da boss for a few days

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
Alma da boss for a few days
well<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> guess<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.470> would<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.460> this

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
well I guess I would but not to this

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.120 
well I guess I would but not to this
point<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.109> problem<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.619> an<00:00:31.769> axle

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
point you know the problem with an axle

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.090 
point you know the problem with an axle
is<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.730> longer<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.510> do<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:34.050> get<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> piece<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
is the longer I do not get a piece the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.250 
is the longer I do not get a piece the
cheaper<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> wobble<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.510> weapons<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:37.050> get

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
cheaper the wobble the weapons will get

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
cheaper the wobble the weapons will get
so<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.890> I'm<00:00:38.010> gonna<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> piece<00:00:38.670> tomorrow<00:00:38.910> I'm

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so if I'm gonna get a piece tomorrow I'm

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.979 
so if I'm gonna get a piece tomorrow I'm
probably<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.620> lose<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.430> 200<00:00:42.180> million<00:00:42.420> if

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
probably gonna lose like 200 million if

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.690 
probably gonna lose like 200 million if
I<00:00:43.200> would<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> today<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> would<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.520> an

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
I would get it today I would get an

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.630 
I would get it today I would get an
extra<00:00:45.090> 200<00:00:45.600> million<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> main

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
extra 200 million so that is the main

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
extra 200 million so that is the main
thing<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.539> pissing<00:00:48.989> me<00:00:49.140> off<00:00:49.170> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
how to do this with the help of my few

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.179 
how to do this with the help of my few
friends<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.900> basically<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.770> easy<00:01:17.009> in

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
friends so basically it's very easy in

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.130 
friends so basically it's very easy in
the<00:01:17.280> beginning<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the beginning you just have to get it to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.899 
the beginning you just have to get it to
50,000<00:01:19.979> health<00:01:20.220> he<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.330> pull<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.909> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
50,000 health he can pull you in and to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.039 
50,000 health he can pull you in and to
prevent<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:24.869> actually

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
prevent that you can use actually

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.620 
prevent that you can use actually
anticipation<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.030> use<00:01:27.150> freedom

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
anticipation and you can use freedom

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
anticipation and you can use freedom
abilities<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.950> use<00:01:29.100> them

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
abilities but you have to use them

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.859 
abilities but you have to use them
before<00:01:30.180> he<00:01:30.479> pulls<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.250> obviously<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.970> once

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
before he pulls you in obviously so once

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.630 
before he pulls you in obviously so once
you<00:01:33.990> use<00:01:34.110> something<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.439> anticipation<00:01:35.130> for

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
you use something like anticipation for

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.300 
you use something like anticipation for
10<00:01:35.850> 10<00:01:36.329> seconds<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.049> will<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.409> completely

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
10 10 seconds you will be completely

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.179 
10 10 seconds you will be completely
safe<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.360> freely<00:01:40.049> use<00:01:40.259> abilities<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
safe so you can freely use abilities and

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.520 
safe so you can freely use abilities and
whatever<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:42.240> he's<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.960> gonna<00:01:43.140> pull<00:01:43.409> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
whatever because he's not gonna pull you

50% of it so you have to get it at

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.970 
50% of it so you have to get it at
around<00:02:29.840> 27,000<00:02:30.840> health<00:02:31.050> would<00:02:31.350> be<00:02:31.530> kind<00:02:31.860> of

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
around 27,000 health would be kind of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
around 27,000 health would be kind of
perfect<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.570> just<00:02:33.780> start<00:02:33.990> using

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
perfect and then you just start using

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.310 
perfect and then you just start using
the<00:02:34.470> rapid-fire<00:02:35.090> after<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.510> use<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320

finish it off without even cord hitting
you<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.990> know<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.290> blank<00:02:46.530> ball<00:02:46.770> sometimes
