00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.469 

and<00:04:16.250> pretty<00:04:16.699> much<00:04:16.820> that's<00:04:17.239> already<00:04:18.139> through

that<00:04:20.479> quick<00:04:21.070> now<00:04:22.070> what<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.370> do<00:04:24.580> so<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.610> figure<00:04:25.880> out

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
that quick now what I do so I figure out

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.430 
that quick now what I do so I figure out
how<00:04:26.120> much<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.479> want<00:04:31.780> you<00:04:32.780> know<00:04:32.870> I'll<00:04:33.050> probably

how much I want you know I'll probably

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.719 
how much I want you know I'll probably
start<00:04:34.160> around<00:04:34.330> there<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:36.440> then<00:04:37.280> when<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.460> pull

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
start around there and then when I pull

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.100 
start around there and then when I pull
this<00:04:37.880> through<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.419> just<00:04:38.750> make<00:04:38.930> sure<00:04:40.960> with<00:04:41.960> the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
this through I just make sure with the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.850 
this through I just make sure with the
flat<00:04:42.410> string<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:44.440> just<00:04:45.440> try<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.590> make<00:04:45.830> sure

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
flat string I just try to make sure

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:58.560 
flat string I just try to make sure
everything's<00:04:46.490> straight<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.389> not<00:04:47.479> twisted<00:04:47.539> up

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:41.460 

let's<00:04:59.570> see<00:05:00.010> kind<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.100> like<00:05:01.250> like<00:05:01.850> that

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.870 

now<00:05:42.470> just<00:05:42.740> cut<00:05:42.920> that<00:05:43.100> tip<00:05:43.310> off<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.760> you're

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
now just cut that tip off and you're

00:05:43.880 --> 00:06:14.369 
now just cut that tip off and you're
doing

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379
