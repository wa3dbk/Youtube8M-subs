00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
pot and then I'm going to let it boil

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.040 
pot and then I'm going to let it boil
for<00:03:10.400> about<00:03:10.790> four<00:03:11.150> minutes<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.870> always

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
for about four minutes and that always

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.199 
for about four minutes and that always
tends<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.650> work<00:03:12.830> for<00:03:13.070> me<00:03:13.190> now<00:03:13.700> we're<00:03:13.940> going<00:03:14.090> to

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
egg yolks here a teaspoon of heavy cream

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.310 
egg yolks here a teaspoon of heavy cream
and<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.700> also<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.540> pinch<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.080> cayenne

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
and I also have a pinch of cayenne

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.130 
and I also have a pinch of cayenne
pepper<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.100> then<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:22.730> 1/3<00:03:23.480> cup<00:03:23.690> of<00:03:23.720> lemon<00:03:24.110> juice

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
pepper and then a 1/3 cup of lemon juice

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.540 
pepper and then a 1/3 cup of lemon juice
but<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.500> would<00:03:24.680> even<00:03:24.890> use<00:03:25.040> half<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.370> that<00:03:25.489> I

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
but I would even use half of that I

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.130 
but I would even use half of that I
think<00:03:25.820> I'd<00:03:25.940> always<00:03:26.209> use<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.570> little<00:03:26.660> bit<00:03:26.900> too

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
think I'd always use a little bit too

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.100 
think I'd always use a little bit too
much<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.860> then<00:03:28.820> I'm<00:03:29.120> going<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.810> use<00:03:29.930> some

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
much and then I'm going to use some

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.170 
much and then I'm going to use some
butter<00:03:30.260> also<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.709> need<00:03:30.800> one<00:03:31.100> stick<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.640> salted

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
butter also you need one stick of salted

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.410 
butter also you need one stick of salted
butter<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.440> then<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:34.100> wanted<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.000> go<00:03:35.209> with

butter and so then I wanted to go with

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.990 
butter and so then I wanted to go with
using<00:03:35.840> my<00:03:36.020> blender<00:03:36.470> shaft<00:03:36.739> here<00:03:37.220> from<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.880> me

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
using my blender shaft here from the me

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.240 
using my blender shaft here from the me
alegro<00:03:38.300> meatsuit<00:03:39.050> oh<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.470> here<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.220> comes

up to me alegro for actually having it
kind<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.670> identified<00:03:47.239> in<00:03:47.510> their<00:03:47.690> instruction

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
kind of identified in their instruction

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.500 
kind of identified in their instruction
book<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:48.709> it<00:03:48.860> made<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.400> very<00:03:49.459> easy<00:03:49.970> for<00:03:50.150> me<00:03:50.390> to

book here it made it very easy for me to
go<00:03:50.720> here<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.110> figure<00:03:51.260> out<00:03:51.380> which<00:03:51.680> blade<00:03:52.280> I

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
go here and figure out which blade I

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.640 
go here and figure out which blade I
needed<00:03:52.700> which<00:03:52.880> was<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.209> aerator<00:03:53.600> blade<00:03:53.870> hope

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
needed which was the aerator blade hope

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.620 
needed which was the aerator blade hope
I<00:03:54.770> found<00:03:54.950> out<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.400> correctly<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.090> that's

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
I found out that correctly and that's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.570 
I found out that correctly and that's
kind<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.200> effect<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:57.920> wanted<00:03:58.370> with

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
I just did not like that

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.420 
I just did not like that
I<00:04:15.810> wish<00:04:16.169> like<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.560> future<00:04:16.709> models<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:17.340> you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
I wish like in future models if you

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.490 
I wish like in future models if you
could<00:04:17.579> possibly<00:04:17.730> just<00:04:18.570> as<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> suggestion<00:04:19.169> make

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
could possibly just as a suggestion make

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.319 
could possibly just as a suggestion make
it<00:04:19.739> somehow<00:04:20.070> where<00:04:20.400> we<00:04:20.519> did<00:04:20.700> not<00:04:20.850> have<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.180> use

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
it somehow where we did not have to use

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.480 
it somehow where we did not have to use
a<00:04:21.359> tool<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.720> get<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.350> blade<00:04:22.530> off<00:04:22.740> now<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.190> will

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
a tool to get the blade off now I will

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.820 
a tool to get the blade off now I will
say<00:04:23.730> that<00:04:24.000> using<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.660> tool<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:25.320> came<00:04:25.620> right

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
say that using the tool it came right

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.800 
say that using the tool it came right
off<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:26.280> was<00:04:26.430> not<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.700> problem<00:04:27.000> at<00:04:27.270> all<00:04:27.360> it's

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
I went a little overboard and when I

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.439 
I went a little overboard and when I
started<00:06:28.440> blending<00:06:28.650> I<00:06:28.979> noticed<00:06:29.340> I<00:06:29.430> said<00:06:29.669> why<00:06:30.389> is

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
started blending I noticed I said why is

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.930 
started blending I noticed I said why is
it<00:06:31.020> kind<00:06:31.320> of<00:06:31.440> spilling<00:06:32.070> and<00:06:32.460> you<00:06:32.610> see<00:06:32.820> right

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
it kind of spilling and you see right

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.249 
it kind of spilling and you see right
there<00:06:33.000> where<00:06:33.389> it's<00:06:33.539> coming<00:06:33.810> and<00:06:33.900> I<00:06:33.990> was<00:06:34.080> like

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
there where it's coming and I was like

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.450 
there where it's coming and I was like
oh<00:06:34.410> this<00:06:34.680> is<00:06:34.860> not<00:06:34.889> good

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
oh this is not good

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.029 
oh this is not good
this<00:06:35.580> is<00:06:35.699> not<00:06:35.880> good<00:06:36.120> and<00:06:36.360> so<00:06:36.990> after<00:06:37.229> a<00:06:37.500> research

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
this is not good and so after a research

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.379 
this is not good and so after a research
and<00:06:38.190> I<00:06:38.250> found<00:06:38.430> that<00:06:38.699> you<00:06:38.850> know<00:06:38.940> it<00:06:39.240> was

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
and I found that you know it was

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.330 
and I found that you know it was
operator<00:06:39.870> error<00:06:40.139> it<00:06:40.440> was<00:06:40.560> not<00:06:40.740> near<00:06:40.979> levels

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
operator error it was not near levels

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.230 
operator error it was not near levels
fault<00:06:41.610> I<00:06:42.560> exceeded<00:06:43.560> the<00:06:43.680> max<00:06:43.889> line<00:06:44.130> by<00:06:44.729> a<00:06:45.030> lot

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
fault I exceeded the max line by a lot

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.680 
fault I exceeded the max line by a lot
and<00:06:45.570> so<00:06:46.139> he<00:06:46.560> calls<00:06:46.860> me<00:06:47.220> to<00:06:47.250> have<00:06:48.000> my<00:06:48.240> spillage

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
and so he calls me to have my spillage

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.939 
and so he calls me to have my spillage
but<00:06:48.900> if<00:06:48.990> I<00:06:49.080> would<00:06:49.229> have<00:06:49.320> followed<00:06:49.500> directions

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:49.949 
but if I would have followed directions

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:51.620 
but if I would have followed directions
which<00:06:50.370> I<00:06:50.460> did<00:06:50.639> the<00:06:50.759> second<00:06:51.060> time<00:06:51.180> it<00:06:51.449> worked

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
which I did the second time it worked

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.870 
which I did the second time it worked
fine<00:06:51.840> and<00:06:52.350> so<00:06:52.800> the<00:06:53.039> smoothie<00:06:53.400> still<00:06:53.610> turned

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
fine and so the smoothie still turned

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.670 
fine and so the smoothie still turned
out<00:06:54.030> but<00:06:54.180> I<00:06:54.360> would<00:06:54.630> recommend<00:06:55.260> using<00:06:55.380> the

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
out but I would recommend using the

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.950 
out but I would recommend using the
beaker<00:06:56.070> and<00:06:56.100> the<00:06:56.639> blender<00:06:57.419> chef<00:06:57.660> when<00:06:57.870> you

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
beaker and the blender chef when you

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.629 
beaker and the blender chef when you
make<00:06:58.110> your<00:06:58.229> smoothies<00:06:58.710> versus<00:06:59.250> using<00:06:59.520> their

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
make your smoothies versus using their

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.980 
make your smoothies versus using their
chopper<00:06:59.880> the<00:07:00.060> chopper<00:07:00.360> is<00:07:00.449> more<00:07:00.630> for<00:07:00.870> like

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
chopper the chopper is more for like

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.600 
chopper the chopper is more for like
food<00:07:01.139> processing<00:07:01.800> like<00:07:01.949> your<00:07:02.100> veggies<00:07:02.460> and

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
food processing like your veggies and

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.939 
food processing like your veggies and
things<00:07:02.820> like<00:07:03.060> that<00:07:03.330> and<00:07:03.660> so<00:07:04.169> it<00:07:04.380> really<00:07:04.620> worked

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:04.949 
things like that and so it really worked

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.370 
things like that and so it really worked
