the right angle whereas on the GB one
that's<00:01:07.740> practically<00:01:08.280> impossible<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.909> fact<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that's practically impossible in fact is

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.030 
that's practically impossible in fact is
impossible<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> tune<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
impossible to tune like that you have to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.859 
impossible to tune like that you have to
go<00:01:11.280> round<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> other<00:01:11.939> side<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.479> tune<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
go round to the other side to tune it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
go round to the other side to tune it
and<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> really<00:01:13.560> isn't<00:01:13.740> very<00:01:13.950> comfortable<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and it really isn't very comfortable so

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.240 
and it really isn't very comfortable so
it's<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.090> tuner<00:01:15.540> friendly<00:01:16.130> for<00:01:17.130> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it's not very tuner friendly for this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130 
it's not very tuner friendly for this
reason<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.729> don't<00:01:17.880> put<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> GB<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
reason we don't put the GB one on to the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.560 
reason we don't put the GB one on to the
market<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> new<00:01:19.799> piano<00:01:20.130> although<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:21.180> find<00:01:21.420> a
