00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
simple thing Microsoft has a lot of

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.579 
simple thing Microsoft has a lot of
testing<00:00:52.120> things<00:00:52.359> they've<00:00:52.600> got<00:00:52.749> to<00:00:52.870> test<00:00:53.139> every

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
testing things they've got to test every

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.020 
testing things they've got to test every
patch<00:00:53.859> to<00:00:54.069> make<00:00:54.219> sure<00:00:54.370> it<00:00:54.489> works<00:00:54.670> with<00:00:54.850> all

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
patch to make sure it works with all

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.399 
patch to make sure it works with all
sorts<00:00:55.389> of<00:00:55.449> systems<00:00:55.659> it<00:00:55.960> doesn't<00:00:55.989> break

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
sorts of systems it doesn't break

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:57.959 
sorts of systems it doesn't break
anything<00:00:56.889> it<00:00:57.010> doesn't<00:00:57.190> have<00:00:57.370> any<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:57.940> know

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
anything it doesn't have any you know

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.579 
anything it doesn't have any you know
insecurities<00:00:58.929> it<00:00:59.139> doesn't<00:00:59.409> cause<00:00:59.559> any

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
insecurities it doesn't cause any

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.739 
insecurities it doesn't cause any
problems<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:01.149> they<00:01:01.269> have<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.420> test

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
problems and so they have to test

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.829 
problems and so they have to test
everything<00:01:02.280> strenuously<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.519> that<00:01:04.360> takes<00:01:04.690> a

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
everything strenuously and that takes a

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.270 
everything strenuously and that takes a
lot<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.110> time<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.619> know<00:01:05.740> it's<00:01:05.920> gonna<00:01:06.010> take

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
lot of time you know it's gonna take

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.789 
lot of time you know it's gonna take
them<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.490> lot<00:01:06.760> of<00:01:06.790> time<00:01:07.030> just<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.799> Microsoft's

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
them a lot of time just on Microsoft's

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.470 
them a lot of time just on Microsoft's
end<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.460> get<00:01:09.580> these<00:01:09.729> out<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.090> that's<00:01:10.270> not

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
end to get these out and that's not

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.760 
end to get these out and that's not
including<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:10.900> time<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.260> takes<00:01:11.410> them<00:01:11.650> to

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
including the time it takes them to

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.890 
including the time it takes them to
actually<00:01:11.920> code<00:01:12.400> these<00:01:12.640> patches<00:01:13.120> so<00:01:13.660> they're

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
actually code these patches so they're

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.840 
actually code these patches so they're
right<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.290> patches<00:01:14.740> they<00:01:15.220> pass<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.760> to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
right in the patches they pass it to

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.090 
right in the patches they pass it to
Microsoft<00:01:16.060> Microsoft<00:01:17.050> tests<00:01:17.650> these<00:01:17.830> patches

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
Microsoft Microsoft tests these patches

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.400 
Microsoft Microsoft tests these patches
and<00:01:18.490> then<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.090> patches<00:01:19.450> get<00:01:19.600> deployed<00:01:19.930> that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
and then the patches get deployed that

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.960 
and then the patches get deployed that
testing<00:01:20.920> process<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.520> main<00:01:21.700> thing<00:01:21.910> that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
testing process is the main thing that

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.310 
testing process is the main thing that
we're<00:01:22.180> worried<00:01:22.390> about<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.810> that's<00:01:23.020> why<00:01:23.260> you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
we're worried about and that's why you

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.840 
we're worried about and that's why you
guys<00:01:23.560> aren't<00:01:23.800> seeing<00:01:24.010> the<00:01:24.100> updates<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.730> we
