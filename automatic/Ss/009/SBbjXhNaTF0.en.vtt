of these before a little scrapped one

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.540 
of these before a little scrapped one
this<00:00:10.349> was<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> garbage<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.250> school

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
this was in the garbage of the school

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.279 
this was in the garbage of the school
that<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.759> cleaned<00:00:14.570> more<00:00:15.570> than<00:00:15.750> like<00:00:15.900> we've<00:00:16.109> been

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
that I cleaned more than like we've been

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.779 
that I cleaned more than like we've been
dropped<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.710> couple<00:00:17.010> hundred<00:00:17.130> times<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.699> it

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
dropped a couple hundred times and it

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.210 
dropped a couple hundred times and it
ain't<00:00:17.940> even<00:00:18.150> worth<00:00:18.270> selling<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.779> eBay<00:00:19.189> some<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
ain't even worth selling on eBay some a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.560 
ain't even worth selling on eBay some a
scrap<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:22.039> on<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> film<00:00:23.699> cartridge<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
scrap it on this the film cartridge I

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.400 
scrap it on this the film cartridge I
think<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.800> also<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.250> battery<00:00:26.430> oh<00:00:27.410> yeah

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
think this is also the battery oh yeah

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.670 
think this is also the battery oh yeah
that's<00:00:28.980> cool<00:00:30.080> bad<00:00:31.080> time<00:00:32.870> must<00:00:33.870> plan<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
that's cool bad time must plan was for a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.270 
that's cool bad time must plan was for a
while<00:00:36.530> that's<00:00:37.530> intense

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:50.720 

plastic<00:00:42.829> battery

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.330 

so<00:00:51.240> I'll<00:00:51.330> see<00:00:51.510> what's<00:00:51.660> inside<00:00:51.810> this

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.800 

some<00:00:57.730> cool<00:00:57.970> lunges<00:01:00.150> all<00:01:01.150> I'm<00:01:01.420> saying<00:01:01.720> is

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
some cool lunges all I'm saying is

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:10.200 
some cool lunges all I'm saying is
plastic<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:06.700> here<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:09.700> other<00:01:09.850> grade

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
plastic right here for other grade

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.610 
plastic right here for other grade
stainless<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.790> is<00:01:12.940> probably<00:01:13.150> 400<00:01:13.420> frames<00:01:13.750> Oh

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.360 

looks<00:01:17.620> like<00:01:17.740> 400<00:01:18.340> grade<00:01:18.490> stainless<00:01:20.370> I'll

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
looks like 400 grade stainless I'll

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.750 
looks like 400 grade stainless I'll
throw<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.730> in<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.880> bucket<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:27.130> I'm<00:01:27.340> seeing<00:01:27.640> in

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
throw it in the bucket all I'm seeing in

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.990 
throw it in the bucket all I'm seeing in
this<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.000> plastic<00:01:28.510> now<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.640> got<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.910> be

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
this is plastic now it's got to be

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.210 
this is plastic now it's got to be
something<00:01:37.210> nice<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.690> here

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220

that's<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.410> for<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:55.170> this<00:04:56.170> little<00:04:56.500> gizmo

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
that's it for that this little gizmo

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.350 
that's it for that this little gizmo
look<00:04:57.040> at<00:04:57.130> all<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.370> copper<00:04:57.790> in<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:58.090> little

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
look at all the copper in that little

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.800 

let's<00:05:04.790> see<00:05:04.970> if<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.150> can<00:05:05.240> get<00:05:05.360> this<00:05:05.480> apart

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
let's see if I can get this apart

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.510 
let's see if I can get this apart
somehow

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
nice you a lump another two copper I'm

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.020 
nice you a lump another two copper I'm
gonna<00:06:02.650> put<00:06:02.800> it<00:06:02.860> all<00:06:02.980> together<00:06:03.100> and<00:06:03.460> see<00:06:03.970> what

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
gonna put it all together and see what

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.060 
gonna put it all together and see what
we<00:06:04.150> got

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
we got

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.379 
we got
didn't<00:06:06.070> do<00:06:06.190> so<00:06:06.400> bad<00:06:06.639> I<00:06:06.669> got<00:06:06.910> a<00:06:06.940> little<00:06:07.180> bit<00:06:07.300> of

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
didn't do so bad I got a little bit of

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.840 
didn't do so bad I got a little bit of
number<00:06:07.570> two<00:06:07.780> a<00:06:07.810> coated<00:06:08.199> copper<00:06:08.460> we<00:06:09.460> got<00:06:09.610> some

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
number two a coated copper we got some

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.460 
number two a coated copper we got some
copper<00:06:10.510> bearing<00:06:10.720> I<00:06:11.729> got<00:06:12.729> some<00:06:13.290> number<00:06:14.290> two

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
copper bearing I got some number two

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.590 
copper bearing I got some number two
circuit<00:06:14.860> board<00:06:15.070> I<00:06:15.340> can't<00:06:15.970> believe<00:06:16.150> how<00:06:16.270> strong

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
circuit board I can't believe how strong

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.350 
circuit board I can't believe how strong
neck<00:06:17.220> that<00:06:18.220> capacitor<00:06:18.850> was<00:06:19.030> in<00:06:19.180> there<00:06:19.330> I

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
neck that capacitor was in there I

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.560 
neck that capacitor was in there I
almost<00:06:19.510> got<00:06:19.720> a<00:06:19.780> pretty<00:06:20.290> good<00:06:20.440> zap<00:06:20.680> out<00:06:20.919> of<00:06:21.040> that

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
almost got a pretty good zap out of that

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.689 
almost got a pretty good zap out of that
and<00:06:22.570> on<00:06:22.690> this<00:06:22.930> circuit<00:06:23.320> board<00:06:23.530> it's<00:06:24.310> green<00:06:24.550> on

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
and on this circuit board it's green on

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.240 
and on this circuit board it's green on
both<00:06:24.820> sides<00:06:25.210> and<00:06:26.080> it's<00:06:26.590> got<00:06:26.740> a<00:06:26.770> little<00:06:26.889> gold

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
both sides and it's got a little gold

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.770 
both sides and it's got a little gold
connectors<00:06:27.639> in<00:06:28.060> there<00:06:28.240> a<00:06:28.270> little<00:06:28.479> gold

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
connectors in there a little gold

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.469 
connectors in there a little gold
contacts<00:06:29.520> so<00:06:30.520> that's<00:06:30.669> number<00:06:30.820> one<00:06:30.940> circuit

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
contacts so that's number one circuit

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.550 
contacts so that's number one circuit
