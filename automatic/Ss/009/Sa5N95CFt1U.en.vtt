00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:23.640
 I loved your walk but I hope the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:25.230
 last one month and all this and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.910
 then you look at the first girl to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.840
 Sometimes it crosses forward, it can be good 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.490
 but this respect here I value you 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.500
 I do not know how all the others did 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.930
 giving out there 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.180
 that's why I love you and that's why 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.500
 I will create by looking for you you speak like that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.860
 only because I installed myself with 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.420
 mariana no but now that you touch the subject 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.730
 I would like not to have to see test and with 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.090
 Mariano back for another we will 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.510
 I'm sending because it's good for me to take you out 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.510
 so 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.420
 and you will take out 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.430
 It gives me the possibility to change it 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.670
 excuse me you can not be angry 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.670
 with me 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.920
 you have to think that I am a toy 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.250
 instant you know what you throw so clear 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.320
 and struck out I'm ready 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.780
 it's more I think you 're wrong 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.580
 used because you're used to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.950
 Winning is an error 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.690
 Well, I'm going to admit to being 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.670
 a little winner you get used to but 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.310
 what do you want me to do 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.210
 anyway I feel that still 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.210
 you feel something for me 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 something meaning is denoted that apart from me 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.770
 I have a gift because I realize 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.960
 when two minds and when not also 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.340
 I have a gift and I know you want me 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.930
 say where do you want to get leonardo 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 with everything it is so you know me and I 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.549
 you know very well and I'm sure I'm with my 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.830
 brother not about me leonardo who does and 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.509
 leonardo with whom he walks not to put h 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.659
 when I hired you with my sister no no 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.140
 he fears 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.950
 you did not join with the beyond 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.950
 Imagine 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.750
 you will listen at least from tomorrow 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.460
 no please 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.630
 as you might not see in my eyes 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.850
 what I have for you I do not see to see that 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.300
 you have in your eyes but to me 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.120
 one 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.640
 a whole world that I can build alone 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.830
 for you 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.290
 full of beautiful mountain landscapes 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:42.490
 Seas and gardens full of love 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.440
 sweetheart contention 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.010
 and that you do not dare to live with me this 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.010
 I feel 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.610
 It is beautiful in your proposal 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.740
 I do not know I feel there is something that 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.310
 it prevents accepting 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.310
 eat 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.710
 I do not know I do not know maybe if 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.300
 or maybe it's just that you have 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.620
 fear of being happy 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.620
 look forgive me but 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.930
 it seems to me that you are misdirecting your 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.930
 arrows 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.630
 It is very sad to see such feelings as 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.630
 cute not going anywhere 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.060
 I am expressing your love in someone who 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.020
 does not deserve it marÃ­a 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.020
 you 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.569
 as if you deserve it 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 Y
