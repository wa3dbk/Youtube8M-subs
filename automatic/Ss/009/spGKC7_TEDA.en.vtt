origami elephant pick out your sheet of

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.560 
origami elephant pick out your sheet of
paper<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.099> we're<00:00:11.639> going<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.849> make<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.150> diagonal

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
paper and we're going to make a diagonal

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.379 
paper and we're going to make a diagonal
fold<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.170> start<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.530> white<00:00:14.009> side<00:00:14.400> up<00:00:14.610> take

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
fold so start with a white side up take

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.000 
fold so start with a white side up take
the<00:00:15.509> bottom<00:00:15.809> corner<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.289> fold<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.770> all<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the bottom corner and fold it all the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.340 
the bottom corner and fold it all the
way<00:00:17.190> up<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> top<00:00:17.880> try<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:18.960> get<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.199> where

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
way up to the top try and get it where

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.609 
way up to the top try and get it where
the<00:00:19.529> they<00:00:19.830> touch<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.750> precisely<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.170> can

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the they touch as precisely as you can

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.460 
the they touch as precisely as you can
and<00:00:23.310> then<00:00:24.060> once<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.630> lock<00:00:24.900> down<00:00:25.170> go

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and then once you have that lock down go

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.279 
and then once you have that lock down go
ahead<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.740> slide<00:00:26.010> your<00:00:26.039> finger<00:00:26.250> down<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
ahead and slide your finger down and

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.509 
ahead and slide your finger down and
hold<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.470> place<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.160> nice<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.340> flat

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
hold it in place so it's nice and flat

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.179 
hold it in place so it's nice and flat
and<00:00:29.880> then<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.090> out<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> left<00:00:30.630> hand<00:00:30.840> side

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
and then go out to the left hand side

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
and then go out to the left hand side
then<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:32.669> hand<00:00:32.880> side<00:00:32.940> just

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
then out to the right hand side just

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.870 
then out to the right hand side just
like<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.200> we're<00:00:35.190> gonna<00:00:35.309> open<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.700> back<00:00:35.820> up

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
like that we're gonna open it back up

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
like that we're gonna open it back up
and<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> other<00:00:37.110> diagonal<00:00:37.739> fold<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and do the other diagonal fold so the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.610 
and do the other diagonal fold so the
bottom<00:00:38.430> corner<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.960> way<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> top

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
bottom corner all the way up to the top

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.709 
bottom corner all the way up to the top
like<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.270> next<00:00:45.270> we're<00:00:45.390> gonna<00:00:45.480> open

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
like that next we're gonna open

like that next we're gonna open
everything<00:00:46.079> back<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.320> again<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.730> we're<00:00:47.850> gonna

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
everything back up again and we're gonna

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.459 
everything back up again and we're gonna
take<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> corners<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> doesn't

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
take one of the corners it doesn't

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
take one of the corners it doesn't
actually<00:00:49.559> matter<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.340> we're<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
actually matter which one we're going to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
actually matter which one we're going to
fold<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.989> into<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.770> middle<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> touches

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
fold it into the middle so it touches

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
fold it into the middle so it touches
right<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.449> where<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.930> X<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
right in where that X is so right in the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.799 
right in where that X is so right in the
middle<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.940> corner<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.600> single

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
middle of that corner that's a single

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.119 
middle of that corner that's a single
blintz<00:00:58.289> fold<00:00:59.359> next<00:01:00.359> we're<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.750> two

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
blintz fold next we're going to do two

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.260 
blintz fold next we're going to do two
kite<00:01:02.129> folds<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> kite<00:01:02.789> folds<00:01:03.090> are<00:01:03.149> gonna

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
kite folds and the kite folds are gonna

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.000 
kite folds and the kite folds are gonna
come<00:01:03.510> they're<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> start<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.409> this

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
come they're going to start at this

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.700 
come they're going to start at this
point<00:01:05.420> right<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.900> they're<00:01:07.650> gonna

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
point right here and they're gonna

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.859 
point right here and they're gonna
connect<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> way<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> bottom

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
connect all the way down to the bottom

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.510 
connect all the way down to the bottom
point<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.500> I'll<00:01:10.560> show<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.100> fold<00:01:11.369> this

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
point so I'll show you when I fold this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.760 
point so I'll show you when I fold this
over

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
over

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.050 
over
see<00:01:13.770> how<00:01:13.920> I'm<00:01:14.040> getting<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> goes<00:01:14.820> right

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
see how I'm getting it or it goes right

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.660 
see how I'm getting it or it goes right
up<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.470> lining<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
up to there and then I'm lining it up to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
up to there and then I'm lining it up to
go<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> way<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> bottom<00:01:18.810> as

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
go all the way down to the bottom as

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.730 
go all the way down to the bottom as
well<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.740> fold<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.159> over<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:20.880> side

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
well so you fold that over on one side

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.770 
well so you fold that over on one side
I'll<00:01:22.740> show<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> how<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> makes<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:24.479> crease

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
I'll show you how that makes that crease

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.410 
I'll show you how that makes that crease
line<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.200> between<00:01:25.500> those<00:01:25.680> two<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.299> fold<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
line right between those two I fold that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
line right between those two I fold that
over<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> same<00:01:28.710> thing<00:01:28.950> on

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
over there and we do the same thing on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.780 
over there and we do the same thing on
this<00:01:29.340> side<00:01:29.579> where<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> fold<00:01:31.189> this<00:01:32.189> side<00:01:32.430> over

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
this side where I fold this side over

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.910 
this side where I fold this side over
it's<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.180> touch<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.630> top<00:01:33.869> point<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.409> then

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's gonna touch the top point and then

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
it's gonna touch the top point and then
it's<00:01:35.009> gonna<00:01:35.130> come<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.610> meet<00:01:35.990> right<00:01:36.990> at

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
it's gonna come down and meet right at

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
it's gonna come down and meet right at
the<00:01:37.500> bottom<00:01:38.420> like<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:40.579> next<00:01:41.579> we're<00:01:41.820> gonna

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the bottom like that next we're gonna

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
the bottom like that next we're gonna
make<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> ears<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> elephant<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.470> ahead

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
make the ears on the elephant go ahead

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.480 
make the ears on the elephant go ahead
and<00:01:43.829> fold<00:01:44.659> this<00:01:45.659> panel<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:49.189> out<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> the

and fold this panel out and out to the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.950 
and fold this panel out and out to the
side<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> gonna<00:01:51.180> go<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.780> this

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
side so it's gonna go right up to this

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.490 
side so it's gonna go right up to this
point<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.500> slide<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
point and slide out to there and the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.740 
point and slide out to there and the
same<00:01:55.710> thing<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> left

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
fold that one out as well so those are

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.819 
fold that one out as well so those are
gonna<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> ears<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.179> then<00:02:06.929> next<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.679> have

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
gonna be the ears and then next we have

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.080 
gonna be the ears and then next we have
a<00:02:07.859> little<00:02:08.039> bit<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.340> pointy<00:02:08.700> part<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:09.030> at

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
a little bit of a pointy part here at

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.259 
a little bit of a pointy part here at
the<00:02:09.179> top<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.539> gonna<00:02:09.629> fold<00:02:10.019> this<00:02:10.289> down

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
the top so I'm gonna fold this down

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.150 
the top so I'm gonna fold this down
about<00:02:12.269> that<00:02:12.510> far<00:02:12.569> not<00:02:13.470> too<00:02:13.620> much<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:13.920> sort

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
about that far not too much it just sort

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.059 
about that far not too much it just sort
of<00:02:14.190> rounds<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> corners<00:02:15.150> off<00:02:16.849> like<00:02:17.849> that

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
of rounds the corners off like that

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.610 
of rounds the corners off like that
finally<00:02:20.069> go<00:02:20.250> ahead<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.489> flip<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.760> over<00:02:21.620> you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
finally go ahead and flip it over you

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.190 
finally go ahead and flip it over you
can<00:02:22.650> see<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> little<00:02:23.129> bit<00:02:23.750> there<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.780> the

this<00:02:27.090> one<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.569> trunk<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.860> do

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
this one is the trunk what I like to do

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.449 
this one is the trunk what I like to do
is<00:02:29.250> fold<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:31.130> pleat<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.280> back

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
is fold it up and then pleat it back

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.339 
is fold it up and then pleat it back
down<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> little<00:02:32.970> bit<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.079> all

the<00:02:34.410> way<00:02:34.980> down<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.610> trunk<00:02:35.849> so<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.360> them

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the way down the trunk so you have them

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.890 
the way down the trunk so you have them
some<00:02:36.660> nice<00:02:36.810> ridges<00:02:37.849> on<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.299> elephant<00:02:39.690> trunk

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900

and then I've make a little fold right

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.710 
and then I've make a little fold right
at<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> bottom<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.150> trunk<00:02:48.390> doesn't

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
at the bottom so that the trunk doesn't

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.059 
at the bottom so that the trunk doesn't
have<00:02:48.810> such<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> point<00:02:49.349> on<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:51.239> can<00:02:51.390> see<00:02:51.599> here

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
have such a point on it you can see here

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.449

you've<00:02:53.069> got<00:02:53.280> some<00:02:53.310> nice<00:02:54.049> ridges<00:02:55.049> there<00:02:55.459> there

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you've got some nice ridges there there
