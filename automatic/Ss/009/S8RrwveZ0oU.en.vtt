00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.809
 If I were a chicken what would they be 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:17.970
 ask me if you are a chicken i would 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 actually have no big questions 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.520
 we already said everything that I did 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.779
 wanted to know about them because we did that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.560
 reverse experiment 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.539
 I would ask you something as a chicken 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.750
 answer more than chicken and I ask 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.739
 Ask him an interested person 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.450
 left always going so say I love it 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.800
 waste 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.870
 I do not know if chickens on etiquette 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.930
 put value or just I think 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.850
 , after doing nothing wrong because 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.200
 I do not know if the legal 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.809
 well, so I got out as always 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.460
 taken cats have to duzen , however 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.530
 which will be shaped then 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:02.180
 very casually that I have with each other 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:02.180
 already possible ask now do you make me 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 yes sympathy is a matter which 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.860
 I build up over a certain amount of time 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.229
 maybe now 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.220
 he should be rather reserved 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.270
 careful chicken 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.240
 There are also chicken 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.979
 different characteristics if 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.280
 I would be an iguana what would you do me 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280
 ask 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.540
 The iguana could give me a little something 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.369
 about his needs and his 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.820
 sensations and his perception of 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:38.400
 I can tell world stories as an iguana 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:42.030
 I'm in the habit of radiating radiation 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.210
 but makes up in the heart of my heart 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:52.290
 I am humble and long for one 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.970
 strong strict hand that which 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.990
 can not offer not not bad 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.159
 People have become an iguana 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.170
 are legally not quite 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.580
 loner 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.490
 That's why they reject the anger of everyone 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.870
 are probably the motive, the animals are once 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:17.060
 predecessor not by now a time 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.069
 little think about it so yeah more 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.260
 Not 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.350
 yes, but it must be an iguana, yes 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.940
 first is a correspondingly Steam 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.519
 find equivalent and this amount but 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.900
 if I out my me so my 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.110
 contemporaries look at that people 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.920
 which are very strong in power structures 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.590
 I also had something like that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.049
 My grandfather's family was the Wehrmacht 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.200
 my grandfather is also a power person 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.450
 my excellence and he has his 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.640
 Officers hunched that did one 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.380
 Insanity kg in a pink was an officer 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.269
 yes mine too and he also has one 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.410
 mad career calm though he 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:05.470
 from my and he was the grandfather Paul 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.470
 kosubek puzzle game nothing 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.510
 what we are after such a clip 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.890
 really do not want to be like that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.520
 comments that is really here 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.560
 Stammtisch 20 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.800
 no human needs that if you us 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.610
 bad is or stays and and 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.970
 costs the right conclusions but 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.710
 the internet probably with the eu receives if 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.750
 you might have liked that then 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.190
 again like conventions write 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.130
 we can also click on it immediately 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.500
 without comment next clip out 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.010
 thought that so now in the same 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.420
 player inserted or you can do something here 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.190
 look very different and someone here 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.840
 subscribe to 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:54.220
 and there is the door if if someone 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.220
 air needs
