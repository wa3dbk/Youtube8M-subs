 and today we will test and it is impossible 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.680
 we do not make a comparison between the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 more than traditional color and more 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220
 the power 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.540
 I made a video a while back 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.019
 showing result more than glue 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.500
 traditional and the result of it was thus 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.629
 that no yellow hair not later 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.519
 interfered in taking the air today my hair 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.769
 still had some orange and 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.570
 let that tone so if half 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.790
 Improve invented that I like a lot. 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.479
 Just what I'm seeing on the internet. 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.250
 besides that is that the more that puts power 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.549
 it gives that golden effect more 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.040
 Pearly knows it does not cost as much by ash 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.729
 So we'll test, I'll wash the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.799
 hair 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.450

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.989
 Now I'm going to take a look in the mirror and 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.840
 if there were no bars left without applying 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.700

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.600
 pasted power and what difference you 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.690
 Are you going to give my hair to a school or 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.489
 more than traditional color is good people 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.950
 kissed washed hair since I took the 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.900
 magic lap of my hair I left 10 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.340
 minutes as I had told you that 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.049
 I left ten minutes I left 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.600
 really the 10 minutes 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.260
 the middle people are really enjoying it 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.079
 really dick it does not give that effect 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.979
 gray than the traditional cut 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.350
 gives the effect of it is this blonde here who is 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.710
 the number well be the same side you 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.419
 can see that my hair april in tone 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.310
 he did not realize to me he was 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.979
 It's a great song. 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.070
 but when we apply such a product 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.500
 good how much 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.890
 hebe that you were beautiful but that 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.270
 you can better understand then if 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.420
 you like me 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.850
 I'm in love with the United States and I recommend people 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.830
 what a power lap 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.220
 I really liked it anyway, but also 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.280
 I liked the more it became traditional only 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.720
 the result of them is very different from 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.270
 one to another understood 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.040
 I like it too much, I do not know which one I would choose 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.510
 to speak the truth 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.100
 You can see those words that I 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.830
 I'll show you 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.110
 Look, I left my hair ten minutes. 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.380
 it did not turn purple and it did not sink I washed 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.630
 only with water, but that's it 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.580
 result it would make a bit of person 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.190
 for person from hair to hair then 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.680
 if you apply and pure as I feel 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.470
 that some part has become so different or 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.750
 I blew the blue one so you can pass only 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.210
 a little bit of shampoo a little bit 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.210
 shampoo and he's already back button 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.400
 I know why I did it just like in 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.980
 traditional school because sometimes I 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.830
 left a lot of time in his hair and he 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.660
 that tone a strange chumbava fear 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.820
 people leave a lot of rain 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.770
 Let's have a people like this. 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:54.480
