areas<00:00:58.590> our<00:00:58.800> chart<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> different<00:01:00.030> ones

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
areas our chart of the different ones

areas our chart of the different ones
some<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.309> multiple<00:01:02.789> piece<00:01:03.949> see<00:01:04.949> there<00:01:06.530> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
some are multiple piece see there and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.649 
some are multiple piece see there and
let's<00:01:08.070> take<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> look<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:10.130> at<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.490> sprue<00:01:11.820> it's

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
let's take a look here at the sprue it's

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.800 
let's take a look here at the sprue it's
in<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> lovely<00:01:13.290> my<00:01:13.890> own<00:01:14.130> hand<00:01:14.610> flush<00:01:15.299> color<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
in a lovely my own hand flush color I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.120 
in a lovely my own hand flush color I
already<00:01:18.810> cut<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.619> you'll<00:01:19.979> see

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
already cut one out there so you'll see

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.390 
already cut one out there so you'll see
that<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> minute<00:01:21.619> but<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.950> go<00:01:24.380> now

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
that one in a minute but there we go now

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
that one in a minute but there we go now
positioning<00:01:26.400> there's<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.570> huge<00:01:28.229> amount<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
positioning there's not a huge amount of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.980 
positioning there's not a huge amount of
different<00:01:29.220> positions<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.360> guys<00:01:30.630> are

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
different positions that these guys are

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.429 
different positions that these guys are
in<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.070> see<00:01:32.250> here's<00:01:32.869> four<00:01:33.869> duplicates

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
in you can see here's four duplicates

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.899 
in you can see here's four duplicates
three<00:01:34.770> duplicates<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.490> actually<00:01:35.729> for

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
three duplicates so actually for

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.810 
three duplicates so actually for
duplicates<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:37.020> two<00:01:37.200> three<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> lot<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
duplicates one two three so a lot of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.450 
duplicates one two three so a lot of
repeat<00:01:39.150> duplicates<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.140> would<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.280> more

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
repeat duplicates you would get more

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.679 
repeat duplicates you would get more
variety<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:43.820> battlefront<00:01:44.820> miniatures

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
variety with the battlefront miniatures

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.749 
variety with the battlefront miniatures
but<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:49.290> quality<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> plastic<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
but the quality here of the plastic is

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.429 
but the quality here of the plastic is
much<00:01:50.939> better<00:01:51.119> than<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
much better than you get with the the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.840 
much better than you get with the the
metal<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> trade-off<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> bit

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
metal so it's a trade-off you get a bit

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.359 
metal so it's a trade-off you get a bit
less<00:01:54.509> variety<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> lot<00:01:55.680> cheaper<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
less variety but it's a lot cheaper and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.600 
less variety but it's a lot cheaper and
a<00:01:57.079> bit<00:01:58.079> higher<00:01:58.259> quality<00:01:58.290> with<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> plastics

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
a bit higher quality with the plastics

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.969 
a bit higher quality with the plastics
here<00:02:00.049> one<00:02:01.049> thing<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> notice<00:02:01.770> right<00:02:01.920> away

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
here one thing that I notice right away

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.039 
here one thing that I notice right away
is<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.759> seam<00:02:03.030> lines<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:04.009> really<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.700> bad

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
is the seam lines are really really bad

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.710 
is the seam lines are really really bad
like<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.610> hopefully<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.910> count<00:02:09.149> picks<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.629> up

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
like and hopefully the count picks it up

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.910 
like and hopefully the count picks it up
there<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> seam

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
there we go if you can see the seam

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.250 
there we go if you can see the seam
lines<00:02:11.129> going<00:02:11.370> down<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.700> side<00:02:11.940> right<00:02:12.180> there

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
lines going down the side right there

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.170 
lines going down the side right there
that's<00:02:13.560> present<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.190> pretty<00:02:14.550> much<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.819> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
that's present on pretty much all the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.020 
that's present on pretty much all the
miniatures<00:02:16.190> there's<00:02:17.190> another<00:02:17.400> bad<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:18.000> right

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
miniatures there's another bad one right

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.369 
miniatures there's another bad one right
there<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:20.340> coming<00:02:20.640> out<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> hope<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.140> there

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
there that's coming out I hope so there

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.869 
there that's coming out I hope so there
will<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.530> some<00:02:22.830> cleanup<00:02:23.099> work<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.610> these

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
will be some cleanup work on these

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:30.740 
will be some cleanup work on these
things<00:02:25.400> now<00:02:27.500> excuse<00:02:28.500> me<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:30.360> miniatures

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
things now excuse me the miniatures

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.449 
things now excuse me the miniatures
themselves<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.620> lot<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.980> people<00:02:32.190> don't<00:02:32.340> like

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
themselves a lot of people don't like

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.410 
themselves a lot of people don't like
plastic<00:02:33.030> soldier<00:02:33.390> company<00:02:33.830> infantry<00:02:34.830> because

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
plastic soldier company infantry because

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.120 
plastic soldier company infantry because
I've<00:02:36.420> repeatedly<00:02:37.050> heard<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> same<00:02:37.590> comment

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
I've repeatedly heard the same comment

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.300 
I've repeatedly heard the same comment
that<00:02:38.310> they<00:02:38.430> look<00:02:38.610> too<00:02:38.849> spindly<00:02:40.069> now<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.099> think

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
that they look too spindly now I think

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.490 
that they look too spindly now I think
it's<00:02:41.580> an<00:02:41.700> acquired<00:02:41.970> taste<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.690> kind<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.110> like

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
it's an acquired taste I kind of like

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.460 
it's an acquired taste I kind of like
the<00:02:43.950> look<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.599> these<00:02:45.599> infantry<00:02:46.349> because

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the look of these infantry because

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.070 
the look of these infantry because
they're<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> bit<00:02:46.920> more<00:02:47.190> true<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.849> scale<00:02:48.090> than

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
they're a bit more true to scale than

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110 
they're a bit more true to scale than
the<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.920> plastics<00:02:50.370> excuse<00:02:50.849> me<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the the plastics excuse me the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.699 
the the plastics excuse me the
battlefront<00:02:51.660> miniatures<00:02:52.049> which<00:02:52.319> are<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> bit

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
battlefront miniatures which are a bit

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.640 
battlefront miniatures which are a bit
more<00:02:53.239> out<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.299> proportion<00:02:54.959> with<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.260> giant

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
more out of proportion with the giant

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.970 
more out of proportion with the giant
helmets<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:57.079> they're<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.110> bit<00:02:58.260> more<00:02:58.470> lumpy

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
helmets and they're a bit more lumpy

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.949 
helmets and they're a bit more lumpy
these<00:02:59.220> guys<00:02:59.430> are<00:02:59.610> much<00:02:59.730> more<00:03:00.030> much<00:03:00.540> thinner

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
these guys are much more much thinner

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.110 
these guys are much more much thinner
and<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.799> think<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.310> guns<00:03:02.579> are<00:03:02.849> much<00:03:02.970> more

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and I think like the guns are much more

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.850 
and I think like the guns are much more
accurate<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.720> scale<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.319> just<00:03:04.500> couldn't<00:03:04.739> do

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
accurate to scale you just couldn't do

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.250 
accurate to scale you just couldn't do
this<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.670> metal<00:03:06.360> without<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.720> bending<00:03:07.140> or

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
this in in metal without a bending or

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.880 
this in in metal without a bending or
breaking<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:09.510> again<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:10.110> an<00:03:10.530> acquired<00:03:10.769> taste

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
breaking so again it's an acquired taste

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.800 
breaking so again it's an acquired taste
I<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.489> these<00:03:11.730> they<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.209> kind<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.450> remind<00:03:12.750> me

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
I like these they just kind of remind me

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.979 
I like these they just kind of remind me
of<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.049> old<00:03:13.670> green<00:03:14.670> army<00:03:14.970> men<00:03:15.000> type<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.720> look

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
of the old green army men type of look

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.360 
of the old green army men type of look
especially<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.980> standard

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
especially the it's the standard

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.229 
especially the it's the standard
standing<00:03:17.880> pose<00:03:18.319> but<00:03:19.579> overall<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.819> quality<00:03:21.150> is

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
standing pose but overall the quality is

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.509 
standing pose but overall the quality is
good<00:03:21.420> there<00:03:21.660> are<00:03:21.780> some<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.380> few<00:03:22.799> figures<00:03:23.190> are<00:03:23.489> a

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
good there are some a few figures are a

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.780 
good there are some a few figures are a
little<00:03:23.910> bit<00:03:24.090> weird<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:25.590> guy<00:03:25.829> right<00:03:26.130> here<00:03:26.549> is

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
little bit weird this guy right here is

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.970 
little bit weird this guy right here is
looks<00:03:27.269> like<00:03:27.389> he's<00:03:27.569> pulling<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:28.049> grenade<00:03:28.650> out<00:03:28.829> or

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
looks like he's pulling a grenade out or

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.930 
looks like he's pulling a grenade out or
something<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.340> looks<00:03:29.639> like<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.819> got

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
something like that looks like you got

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.629 
something like that looks like you got
shot<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.450> gut<00:03:30.660> though<00:03:30.900> instead<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.639> this

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
shot in the gut though instead and this

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.009 
shot in the gut though instead and this
guy<00:03:32.910> on<00:03:34.459> holding<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.489> radio<00:03:35.850> here<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.810> a

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
guy on holding the radio here just in a

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.470 
guy on holding the radio here just in a
very<00:03:37.290> odd<00:03:37.620> pose<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.700> looks<00:03:38.819> like<00:03:38.940> he's<00:03:39.090> sort<00:03:39.389> of

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
very odd pose it looks like he's sort of

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.300 
very odd pose it looks like he's sort of
hugging<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.959> teddy<00:03:40.109> bear<00:03:40.290> or<00:03:40.440> something<00:03:40.950> that's

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
hugging a teddy bear or something that's

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.129 
hugging a teddy bear or something that's
what<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.519> first<00:03:41.819> thought<00:03:43.730> but<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.690> details

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
what I first thought but the the details

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.229 
what I first thought but the the details
on<00:03:46.380> them<00:03:46.530> are<00:03:46.739> pretty<00:03:47.100> good<00:03:47.519> they're<00:03:48.090> not

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
on them are pretty good they're not

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.120 
on them are pretty good they're not
super<00:03:48.900> high<00:03:49.019> quality<00:03:49.049> because<00:03:49.470> they<00:03:49.650> are<00:03:49.769> just

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
super high quality because they are just

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.300 
super high quality because they are just
15<00:03:50.519> mils<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.109> can't<00:03:52.410> see<00:03:52.769> pupils

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
15 mils so you know you can't see pupils

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.819 
15 mils so you know you can't see pupils
on<00:03:53.519> them<00:03:53.670> anything<00:03:53.850> like<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:55.260> lot

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
on them anything like that but the a lot

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.150 
on them anything like that but the a lot
of<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.980> helmets<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.549> some<00:03:56.880> netting<00:03:57.239> on<00:03:57.450> them

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
of the helmets have some netting on them

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.410 
of the helmets have some netting on them
if<00:03:59.160> I<00:03:59.280> could<00:03:59.459> find<00:03:59.670> one<00:03:59.849> like<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.000> one<00:04:00.239> there

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
if I could find one like that one there

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.990 
if I could find one like that one there
has<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.630> bit<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.870> netting<00:04:01.430> but<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.459> can't<00:04:02.760> get

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
has a bit of netting but I can't get

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.120 
has a bit of netting but I can't get
close<00:04:03.269> enough<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.630> actually<00:04:03.780> see<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.410> but

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
close enough to actually see it but

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.050 
close enough to actually see it but
trust<00:04:05.370> me<00:04:05.549> it<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:05.819> there<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.430> details<00:04:08.819> are

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
trust me it is there so the details are

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.550 
trust me it is there so the details are
fine<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:10.099> again<00:04:11.099> you<00:04:11.280> can't<00:04:11.489> beat<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.849> price

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
fine and again you can't beat the price

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.650 
fine and again you can't beat the price
now<00:04:13.560> let's<00:04:13.919> let's<00:04:14.760> line<00:04:15.090> up<00:04:15.299> some<00:04:15.510> different

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
now let's let's line up some different

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.589 
now let's let's line up some different
15<00:04:16.139> mils<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.700> compare<00:04:17.700> all<00:04:17.729> all<00:04:18.150> them

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
15 mils and compare all all them

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.659 
15 mils and compare all all them
together<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.500> pulled<00:04:19.859> one<00:04:19.919> from<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.340> sprue

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
together so I pulled one from the sprue

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.039 
together so I pulled one from the sprue
and<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:20.940> just<00:04:21.090> primed<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.539> real<00:04:21.690> quick<00:04:21.870> and

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
and I just primed it a real quick and

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.980 
and I just primed it a real quick and
gave<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.289> black<00:04:22.500> wash<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.669> detail<00:04:24.150> will

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
gave it a black wash so the detail will

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.460 
gave it a black wash so the detail will
stand<00:04:25.320> out<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.530> bit<00:04:25.650> better

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
stand out a bit better

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.170 
stand out a bit better
and<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:27.010> can<00:04:27.130> see<00:04:27.280> plenty<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.580> strapping<00:04:28.030> you

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
and you can see plenty of strapping you

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.840 
and you can see plenty of strapping you
can<00:04:28.300> see<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.510> belts<00:04:28.810> really<00:04:29.110> well

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
can see the belts really well

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.370 
can see the belts really well
unfortunately<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.180> pulled<00:04:31.450> one<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.990> sort<00:04:32.290> of

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
unfortunately I pulled one that sort of

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.980 
unfortunately I pulled one that sort of
has<00:04:32.770> its<00:04:32.800> face<00:04:33.370> covered<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.090> you<00:04:34.150> cannot<00:04:34.570> see

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
has its face covered so you cannot see

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.530 
has its face covered so you cannot see
the<00:04:35.170> face<00:04:35.640> so<00:04:36.640> we<00:04:36.730> can't<00:04:36.940> see<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.180> detail

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
the face so we can't see the detail

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.040 
the face so we can't see the detail
there<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.490> overall<00:04:39.490> it's<00:04:39.730> pretty<00:04:39.940> clean<00:04:40.210> of

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
there but overall it's pretty clean of

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.200 
there but overall it's pretty clean of
course<00:04:41.260> it's<00:04:41.410> a<00:04:41.470> lot<00:04:41.680> cleaner<00:04:42.010> than

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
course it's a lot cleaner than

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.330 
course it's a lot cleaner than
battlefronts<00:04:43.210> metal<00:04:43.750> figures<00:04:44.080> so<00:04:44.830> these

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
battlefronts metal figures so these

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.640 
battlefronts metal figures so these
would<00:04:45.520> take<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.570> base<00:04:46.780> coat<00:04:47.020> in<00:04:47.260> a<00:04:47.350> wash

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
would take just a base coat in a wash

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.210 
would take just a base coat in a wash
and<00:04:48.070> look<00:04:49.000> pretty<00:04:49.420> good<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:51.150> size<00:04:52.150> wise<00:04:53.220> let's

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
and look pretty good and size wise let's

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.090 
and look pretty good and size wise let's
line<00:04:54.730> this<00:04:55.000> up<00:04:55.240> here

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
right away that the plastic soldier

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.250

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
battlefronts figure is much closer to 15

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.320 
battlefronts figure is much closer to 15
of<00:05:33.550> those<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.840> also<00:05:35.800> Peter<00:05:36.640> pig<00:05:36.880> is<00:05:37.030> also

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
close to 15 as well but their figures

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.810 
close to 15 as well but their figures
tend<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.030> be<00:05:40.120> much<00:05:40.270> more<00:05:41.200> much<00:05:42.070> thinner<00:05:42.520> than
