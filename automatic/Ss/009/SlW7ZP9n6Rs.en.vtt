the<00:01:04.110> stomach<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.530> someone<00:01:04.799> who's<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.040> used

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the stomach for someone who's not used

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
the stomach for someone who's not used
to<00:01:05.400> having<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.760> ton<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.940> fiber<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.510> sensitive<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
to having a ton of fiber or sensitive to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.109 
to having a ton of fiber or sensitive to
fiber<00:01:07.440> also<00:01:08.159> you're<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.729> getting<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
fiber also you're going to be getting a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.609 
fiber also you're going to be getting a
lot<00:01:09.329> more<00:01:09.359> calories<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.289> something<00:01:10.469> to

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
lot more calories so it's something to

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
lot more calories so it's something to
keep<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.009> mind<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.000> movies<00:01:12.329> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
keep in mind some of this movies that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.880 
keep in mind some of this movies that
people<00:01:12.479> make<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.259> five<00:01:13.500> or<00:01:13.530> six<00:01:13.829> hundred

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
people make can be five or six hundred

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
people make can be five or six hundred
calories<00:01:14.579> so<00:01:14.759> if<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> case<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
calories so if that's the case then you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
calories so if that's the case then you
probably<00:01:16.049> shouldn't<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.590> eating<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:17.009> meal

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
probably shouldn't be eating a meal

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
probably shouldn't be eating a meal
along<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.299> you're<00:01:18.420> trying<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> kind

juicing<00:01:26.310> juicers<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.810> good<00:01:27.929> ones

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
juicing juicers the really good ones

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929 
juicing juicers the really good ones
that<00:01:28.259> extract<00:01:28.859> the<00:01:29.100> most<00:01:29.369> amount<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.700> juice

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that extract the most amount of juice

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.270 
that extract the most amount of juice
can<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.450> pricey<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.140> they're<00:01:31.350> worth<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
can be pricey but they're worth it you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.520 
can be pricey but they're worth it you
get<00:01:32.789> the<00:01:33.090> immediate<00:01:33.630> result<00:01:33.960> when<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> drink

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
get the immediate result when you drink

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.770 
get the immediate result when you drink
it<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.490> nutrients<00:01:35.939> are<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it that the nutrients are going to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.260 
it that the nutrients are going to
digest<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.320> lot<00:01:37.439> faster<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.820> problem<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.240> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
digest a lot faster the problem is that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
digest a lot faster the problem is that
you<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.259> bulk<00:01:40.439> fiber<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.189> end

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you don't have the bulk fiber so you end

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.060 
you don't have the bulk fiber so you end
up<00:01:41.579> still<00:01:41.939> needing<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.950> fruits<00:01:43.950> and

up still needing to have your fruits and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770 
up still needing to have your fruits and
veggies<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.579> grains<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.179> make<00:01:45.359> up<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
veggies and grains to make up for that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.200

about<00:01:49.499> 25<00:01:49.890> grams<00:01:50.219> of<00:01:50.429> fiber<00:01:50.609> when<00:01:51.119> you're

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
about 25 grams of fiber when you're

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.090 
about 25 grams of fiber when you're
juicing<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:51.929> to<00:01:52.079> still<00:01:52.289> consider<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
juicing you have to still consider that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.169 
juicing you have to still consider that
you're<00:01:53.249> still<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> need<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.030> your

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
you're still going to need to get your

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.959 
you're still going to need to get your
fiber<00:01:54.359> in<00:01:54.569> for<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> day<00:01:55.340> juicers<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.759> be

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
fiber in for the day juicers can be

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.880 
fiber in for the day juicers can be
pricey<00:01:57.179> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.749> some<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> best<00:01:58.380> ones<00:01:58.619> at

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
pricey I think some of the best ones at

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.940 
pricey I think some of the best ones at
the<00:01:58.920> bottom<00:01:59.069> range<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.640> about

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the bottom range are about

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.590 
the bottom range are about
dollars<00:02:00.399> but<00:02:00.520> they<00:02:00.610> can<00:02:00.729> go<00:02:00.850> up<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.180> hundreds

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
dollars but they can go up to hundreds

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.660 
dollars but they can go up to hundreds
of<00:02:01.659> dollars<00:02:02.049> I<00:02:02.409> would<00:02:03.189> say<00:02:03.310> if<00:02:03.369> you're<00:02:03.490> just

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
of dollars I would say if you're just

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.800 
of dollars I would say if you're just
starting<00:02:03.759> out<00:02:04.060> on<00:02:04.119> your<00:02:04.329> health<00:02:04.539> journey

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
starting out on your health journey

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.840 
starting out on your health journey
probably<00:02:05.649> don't<00:02:05.740> buy<00:02:05.920> either<00:02:06.100> one<00:02:06.399> just<00:02:06.430> go<00:02:06.759> to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
probably don't buy either one just go to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.820 
probably don't buy either one just go to
a<00:02:06.909> health<00:02:07.060> bar<00:02:07.329> and<00:02:07.630> try<00:02:08.140> both<00:02:08.379> types<00:02:08.679> of

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
a health bar and try both types of

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.469 
a health bar and try both types of
drinks<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.250> just<00:02:09.399> get<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.610> feel<00:02:09.819> for<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.269> see

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
drinks and just get a feel for and see

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.050 
drinks and just get a feel for and see
which<00:02:10.599> one<00:02:10.810> would<00:02:11.019> be<00:02:11.280> would<00:02:12.280> best<00:02:12.670> work<00:02:12.879> for

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
which one would be would best work for

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.880 
which one would be would best work for
your<00:02:13.150> lifestyle<00:02:13.599> I<00:02:13.870> don't<00:02:14.620> want<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.800> offend

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
your lifestyle I don't want to offend

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.170 
your lifestyle I don't want to offend
anyone<00:02:15.190> because<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.489> know<00:02:15.550> some<00:02:15.819> people<00:02:15.849> are

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
anyone because I know some people are

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.970 
anyone because I know some people are
really<00:02:16.239> attached<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.959> their<00:02:17.080> juicer<00:02:17.440> or<00:02:17.709> their

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
really attached to their juicer or their

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.970 
really attached to their juicer or their
smoothie<00:02:18.489> maker<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:19.000> think<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.569> best<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.800> both

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
smoothie maker I think the best of both

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.170 
smoothie maker I think the best of both
worlds<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.400> when<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.730> something<00:02:21.970> like<00:02:22.090> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
worlds is when you have something like a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.910 
worlds is when you have something like a
Vitamix<00:02:22.690> blenders<00:02:23.019> but<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.290> can<00:02:23.530> blend<00:02:23.739> that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
Vitamix blenders but you can blend that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.580 
Vitamix blenders but you can blend that
pulp<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.400> really<00:02:24.700> small<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.360> make<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> really

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
pulp up really small and make a really

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.670 
pulp up really small and make a really
nice<00:02:26.739> smooth<00:02:27.250> smoothie<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.319> but<00:02:29.319> of<00:02:29.440> course

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
nice smooth smoothie and but of course

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.039 
nice smooth smoothie and but of course
some<00:02:29.799> people<00:02:29.860> prefer<00:02:30.310> juice<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:31.810> think

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
some people prefer juice so just I think

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.990 
some people prefer juice so just I think
the<00:02:32.319> biggest<00:02:32.530> thing<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.830> keep<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.099> mind<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.549> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the biggest thing to keep in mind is the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.300 
the biggest thing to keep in mind is the
fiber<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.569> also<00:02:34.810> things<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.319> for<00:02:35.680> example<00:02:35.709> a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
fiber and also things like for example a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.130 
fiber and also things like for example a
cucumber<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:37.330> nutrients<00:02:37.750> would<00:02:37.870> be<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.019> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
cucumber the nutrients would be in the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.559 
cucumber the nutrients would be in the
peel<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.680> if<00:02:38.739> your<00:02:38.890> juice<00:02:39.099> thing<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:39.940> you

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
peel and if your juice thing then you

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.330 
peel and if your juice thing then you
are<00:02:40.989> just<00:02:41.019> extracting<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.680> water<00:02:42.040> from<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
are just extracting that water from the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.100 
are just extracting that water from the
cucumber<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.030> you're<00:02:43.180> missing<00:02:43.510> out<00:02:43.599> on<00:02:43.660> some

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
cucumber and you're missing out on some

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.110 
cucumber and you're missing out on some
of<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.440> nutrient<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.579> said<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.760> really

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
of the nutrient but you said I really

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.360 
of the nutrient but you said I really
been<00:02:46.209> wanting<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.660> try<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:46.959> by<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:48.069> company

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
is that they use pure organic

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.809 
is that they use pure organic
ingredients<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:53.319> make<00:02:53.530> juices<00:02:54.160> in<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.430> bottle

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
it from because I

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.710
