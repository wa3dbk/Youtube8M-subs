taking it off putting on a backwards hat

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.140 
taking it off putting on a backwards hat
to<00:02:16.200> prevent<00:02:16.500> from<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.800> sliding<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.280> that's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
to prevent from it sliding up that's
