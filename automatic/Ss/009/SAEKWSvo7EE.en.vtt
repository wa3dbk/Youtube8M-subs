to add drawings to this list that are
external<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> model<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.939> example

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
external to the model for example

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.499 
external to the model for example
structural<00:01:51.720> drawings<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.030> easiest<00:01:54.329> way<00:01:54.479> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
structural drawings the easiest way to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
structural drawings the easiest way to
do<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.229> create<00:01:55.680> new<00:01:56.490> empty

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
do this is to just create new empty

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
do this is to just create new empty
sheets<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.200> automatically<00:01:58.590> add
