00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.530
 I kept going whistling though 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.650

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.930

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.820
 the thief stole from untruth 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:02.009
 I'll start with the better half if 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.009
 show with the one you have 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.650
 obama 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.650
 in your drawing 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.780
 I want you 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:19.340
 hello half 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.340
 and to defend you will know that 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.910
 Saviola 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 They kept him from love if he hopes 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.180
 terror in the river thought 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.270
 nor do they go down in themselves 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.030
 It's the best feeling. 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:53.650
 I took the life but I was leaving. 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.650
 the guide in every prayer folder is you 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.980
 is that you 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.310
 The one who leaves the life, the soul is sent 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.940
 though 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:13.200
 i brought you part of the heart 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.650
 and fagot and I was going to leave 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.239
 bia 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.239
 How is my heart? 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.980
 is that you 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:36.810
 and to talk about the real actor 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.810
 I'll start with the best half. 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:05.590
 I liked it, I liked it 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:09.099
 how old 14 tozzo ball Mia is up 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.340
 I did not speak late, right? 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.829
 and I found your presentation in general 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.630
 very good did not like one bit of 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.150
 stanzas thought his pitch was 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.340
 somewhat unstable at the time of the stanza but 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.039
 at the time you needed to give that 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.860
 sharp you got so well sustained 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.289
 besides playing guitar very well if 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.660
 also to me is a point because it is very 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.479
 cool to see also playing a musician in 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.280
 I think it's very good I did not find it 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.320
 as good as the others 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.970
 presentations but you 're still 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.970
 very good rules the actor 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:52.110
 Like everybody knows, no, I'm not here to 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.899
 cup of warm milk and biscuit 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.149
 people tomorrow 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.929
 You started poorly on this song started. 

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:01.529
 bad 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:05.279
 you there in the first three verses 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:08.249
 You did not find the right setting there. 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:10.529
 until the first time you're gone 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.909
 kind of skidding making the semi 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.740
 times hitting 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.889
 From there you improved one 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.529
 bit but in compensation a lack 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.939
 heat in its interpretation the impression 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.369
 that I had that I was singing in the 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.680
 autopilot and cheering for this 

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:27.839
 music to arrive soon to the end 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.699
 So let's get on with it next time. 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:36.149
 in j act I think you have a profile 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.369
 of an artist and that they only have to 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.680
 be careful about some things in 

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:43.559
 presence of the stage is not to move but a 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.740
 look already says something understood and 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:49.309
 Dude, I really enjoy your voice, and you? 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:54.330
 Congratulations, you're a great artist. 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:56.009
 simone come think you a great chance no 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.959
 it will be for this presentation that you 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.509
 It was not so well that I will stop 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:04.759
 To admire you I admire you very much and see 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.759
 a great artist and saw to be sure
