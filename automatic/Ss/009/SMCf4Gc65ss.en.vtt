all<00:00:00.269> right<00:00:00.420> setting<00:00:00.750> up<00:00:00.900> your<00:00:01.140> spray<00:00:01.589> gun<00:00:01.639> you

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
all right setting up your spray gun you

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.830 
all right setting up your spray gun you
need<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.909> think<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.330> how<00:00:03.540> much<00:00:03.659> pressure

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
need to think about how much pressure

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.990 
need to think about how much pressure
you're<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.440> use<00:00:04.740> when<00:00:05.460> you're<00:00:05.609> working

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
you're going to use when you're working

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.930 
you're going to use when you're working
with<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> cup<00:00:06.569> gun<00:00:06.839> or<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.109> chop<00:00:07.470> gun<00:00:07.940> something

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
with a cup gun or a chop gun something

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.470 
with a cup gun or a chop gun something
like<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.360> one<00:00:09.570> right<00:00:09.719> here<00:00:11.240> you<00:00:12.240> want<00:00:12.420> to

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
like this one right here you want to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.870 
like this one right here you want to
keep<00:00:12.570> your<00:00:12.690> pressure<00:00:12.960> down<00:00:13.259> around<00:00:13.679> 2025<00:00:14.519> you

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
keep your pressure down around 2025 you

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.730 
keep your pressure down around 2025 you
can<00:00:15.059> adjust<00:00:15.450> your<00:00:15.540> pressure<00:00:15.809> up<00:00:16.199> or<00:00:16.379> down<00:00:16.560> from

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
can adjust your pressure up or down from

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.980 
can adjust your pressure up or down from
that<00:00:16.980> depending<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.090> viscosity<00:00:18.300> or<00:00:18.960> the

that depending on the viscosity or the
thickness<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.250> material<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.699> you're

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
thickness of the material that you're

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.330 
thickness of the material that you're
using<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:22.109> what<00:00:22.920> you're<00:00:23.070> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.220> be

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
using and what you're going to be

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
using and what you're going to be
spraying<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:24.000> don't<00:00:24.119> want<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.300> lot<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.600> fallout

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
spraying you don't want a lot of fallout

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.810 
spraying you don't want a lot of fallout
and<00:00:25.289> bounce<00:00:25.529> off<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.460> paint<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
and bounce off you want your paint to

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.000 
and bounce off you want your paint to
stick<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.990> need<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> set<00:00:28.590> your<00:00:28.740> pressure

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
stick so you need to set your pressure

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.429 
stick so you need to set your pressure
accordingly<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:30.240> one's<00:00:30.480> got<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> gauge<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.230> it

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
accordingly this one's got a gauge on it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.530 
accordingly this one's got a gauge on it
so<00:00:32.250> you'll<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.759> where<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
so you'll know where you're at and it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.580 
so you'll know where you're at and it
stays<00:00:33.750> constant

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
stays constant

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.380 
stays constant
it<00:00:34.950> comes<00:00:35.160> off<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> compressor<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.239> right

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it comes off the compressor that's right

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.830 
it comes off the compressor that's right
here<00:00:36.600> which<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.050> set<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.840> don't

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
here which is set so that you don't

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100 
here which is set so that you don't
overwork<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.649> compressor<00:00:41.390> this<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.629> set<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
overwork the compressor this is set it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
overwork the compressor this is set it
like<00:00:43.170> 120<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.730> pressure<00:00:44.969> coming<00:00:45.360> off<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.539> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
like 120 the pressure coming off of it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600 
like 120 the pressure coming off of it
there's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> knob<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> will<00:00:47.219> set<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there's a knob on here that will set it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
there's a knob on here that will set it
down<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.750> 35<00:00:49.110> 40<00:00:49.879> psi<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> can

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
down to like 35 40 psi and then you can

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.779 
down to like 35 40 psi and then you can
adjust<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.469> pressure<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.489> even

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
adjust your pressure on this one even

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
adjust your pressure on this one even
down<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> little<00:00:54.390> more<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.739> pressure

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
down a little more so all the pressure

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.729 
down a little more so all the pressure
is<00:00:56.070> constant<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.820> through<00:00:57.320> it<00:00:58.320> really

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
is constant going through it really

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
is constant going through it really
depends<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.730> viscosity<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> material

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
depends on the viscosity of the material

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.740 
depends on the viscosity of the material
we<00:01:01.170> use<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.370> second<00:01:02.879> rule<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.510> means

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
we use the one second rule that means

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.250 
we use the one second rule that means
1,001<00:01:04.619> 1,002<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.240> dip<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.540> stick<00:01:07.020> into

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

some<00:01:07.560> paint<00:01:07.830> after<00:01:08.310> reduction<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.930> starts

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
some paint after reduction and it starts

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.590 
some paint after reduction and it starts
to<00:01:10.320> drip<00:01:10.619> you'll<00:01:11.010> count<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.460> drips<00:01:11.760> 1,001

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
to drip you'll count the drips 1,001

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.370 
to drip you'll count the drips 1,001
1,002<00:01:13.290> 1,003<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.150> should<00:01:15.390> give<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.810> the

1,002 1,003 and that should give you the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.140 
1,002 1,003 and that should give you the
right<00:01:16.619> viscosity<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.610> need<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.060> the

so<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:56.669> adjust<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:57.180> pressure<00:03:57.449> on<00:03:57.720> an<00:03:57.870> airless

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
so to adjust the pressure on an airless

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.229 
so to adjust the pressure on an airless
you<00:03:58.680> have<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.919> start<00:03:59.220> by<00:03:59.400> looking<00:03:59.790> at<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
you have to start by looking at the

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.619 
you have to start by looking at the
reduction<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.959> material<00:04:02.510> adjustment<00:04:03.510> on

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
reduction of the material adjustment on

reduction of the material adjustment on
the<00:04:03.840> airless<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:05.459> type<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.790> fan<00:04:06.659> that<00:04:06.900> you're

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
the airless the type of fan that you're

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.360 
the airless the type of fan that you're
going<00:04:07.199> to<00:04:07.260> use<00:04:07.530> our<00:04:07.769> tip<00:04:07.979> and<00:04:10.129> really<00:04:11.129> on<00:04:11.340> a

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
going to use our tip and really on a

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.170 
going to use our tip and really on a
good<00:04:12.150> working<00:04:12.569> gun<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:13.079> can<00:04:13.349> control<00:04:14.180> amount

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
good working gun you can control amount

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.549
