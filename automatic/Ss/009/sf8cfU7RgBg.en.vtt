00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
Lara has been through a lot in the first

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
Lara has been through a lot in the first
game<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> focus<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.730> how<00:01:02.850> she

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
game there was a lot of focus on how she

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
game there was a lot of focus on how she
became<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.449> tomb<00:01:03.930> raider<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
became the tomb raider that we know and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.910 
became the tomb raider that we know and
love<00:01:05.030> he<00:01:06.030> talks<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.390> flashbacks<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.860> he

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
love he talks about flashbacks but he

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.440 
love he talks about flashbacks but he
talks<00:01:08.159> about<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.700> away<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.270> think

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
talks about them going away and I think

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
talks about them going away and I think
the<00:01:09.570> point<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.049> because<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:11.040> want<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the point of that is because we want to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.620 
the point of that is because we want to
move<00:01:11.430> past<00:01:11.700> what<00:01:11.970> happened<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> first

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
move past what happened in the first

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.330 
move past what happened in the first
game<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.080> move<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.439> further<00:01:13.770> development

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
game and move on to further development

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.039 
game and move on to further development
of<00:01:14.369> her<00:01:14.490> character<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> second<00:01:15.479> game<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
of her character in the second game you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.450 
of her character in the second game you
can<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.530> point<00:01:16.650> she<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.220> shot<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
can see at this point she just shot a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.830 
can see at this point she just shot a
guy<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> back<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> head<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.689> she's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
guy in the back of the head so she's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
guy in the back of the head so she's
obviously<00:01:19.140> moved<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.470> quite<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> bit<00:01:20.070> from<00:01:20.250> her

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
obviously moved on quite a bit from her

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.630 
obviously moved on quite a bit from her
her<00:01:21.000> terrified<00:01:21.720> self<00:01:22.650> defense<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> first

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
her terrified self defense in the first

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.240

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
game and we're going to see further

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
game and we're going to see further
development<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> possibly<00:01:28.470> see

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
development in this one and possibly see

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.590 
development in this one and possibly see
her<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.220> she<00:01:29.340> says<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.729> point<00:01:30.030> become<00:01:30.420> who

closer<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.720> tomb<00:01:33.869> raider<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.500> knew

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
bit more of what I think might happen in

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.450 
bit more of what I think might happen in
this<00:01:42.990> game<00:01:43.110> obviously<00:01:43.439> pointing<00:01:44.100> out<00:01:44.220> again

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
this game obviously pointing out again

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.999 
this game obviously pointing out again
that<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.329> an<00:01:45.509> in-game<00:01:45.930> footage<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.740> don't

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that this is an in-game footage so don't

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.249 
that this is an in-game footage so don't
take<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.490> such<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.600> first<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.049> this

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
take it as such now this first one this

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.960 
take it as such now this first one this

picture of a bear that was briefly
chasing<00:01:51.509> her<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> beginning<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
chasing her at the beginning of the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.389 
chasing her at the beginning of the
trailer<00:01:52.560> when<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> therapist<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.369> talking

to<00:01:53.790> her<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.079> flashback<00:01:55.530> from<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
to her this is not a flashback from the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.170 
to her this is not a flashback from the
first<00:01:55.950> game<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.430> which<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.090> were

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
first game in which I think there were

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.170 
first game in which I think there were
only<00:01:57.270> moves<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.520> does<00:01:59.640> suggest<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.000> will

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
only moves but it does suggest that will

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.969 
only moves but it does suggest that will
seal<00:02:00.390> our<00:02:00.540> encounter<00:02:01.110> more<00:02:01.320> animals<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
seal our encounter more animals and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.760 
seal our encounter more animals and
players<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> old<00:02:02.850> game<00:02:03.149> will<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:04.409> be

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
players of the old game will will be

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
players of the old game will will be
familiar<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.790> kind<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.329> feeling

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
familiar with that kind of feeling

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.969 
familiar with that kind of feeling
although<00:02:07.170> obviously<00:02:07.380> there<00:02:07.710> were<00:02:07.770> dinosaurs

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
although obviously there were dinosaurs

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.160 
although obviously there were dinosaurs
and<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.239> other<00:02:09.479> games<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.110> I'm

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and the like in the other games and I'm

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.760 
and the like in the other games and I'm
not<00:02:10.379> sure<00:02:10.410> we'll<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.039> here

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
not sure we'll see that here

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.740 
not sure we'll see that here
seems<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.130> be<00:02:12.160> despite<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.000> magic<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.480> little

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
seems to be despite the magic a little

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.260 
seems to be despite the magic a little
bit<00:02:13.840> more<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> focus<00:02:14.290> on<00:02:14.590> realism<00:02:15.210> now<00:02:16.210> the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
bit more of a focus on realism now the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.870 
bit more of a focus on realism now the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
hook I've picked because a i'm quite

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.920 
hook I've picked because a i'm quite
excited<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.890> see<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> climbing<00:02:24.490> hook<00:02:24.930> come

excited to see the climbing hook come

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.260 
excited to see the climbing hook come
back<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.350> like<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.220> axe<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.670> first<00:02:27.940> game<00:02:28.090> I

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
back I like the axe in the first game I

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.540 
back I like the axe in the first game I
quite<00:02:28.480> liked<00:02:28.720> doing<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.740> climbing<00:02:30.130> with<00:02:30.250> Lara

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
quite liked doing the climbing with Lara

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.940 
quite liked doing the climbing with Lara
but<00:02:30.970> also<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.990> likely<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.440> we'll<00:02:32.620> see<00:02:32.770> her

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
but also it's likely that we'll see her

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.070 
but also it's likely that we'll see her
in<00:02:33.010> several<00:02:33.460> near-death<00:02:34.030> situations<00:02:34.300> as<00:02:34.900> we

did<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.410> first<00:02:35.620> game<00:02:36.120> where<00:02:37.120> she<00:02:37.300> was<00:02:37.420> kind

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
did in the first game where she was kind

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.090 
did in the first game where she was kind
of<00:02:37.630> climbing<00:02:38.020> over<00:02:38.290> buildings<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.010> were

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
in the back of a head interesting things

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110 
in the back of a head interesting things
to<00:02:56.320> take<00:02:56.470> from<00:02:56.650> this<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:57.070> she's<00:02:57.610> got<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.910> bow

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
to take from this a she's got that bow

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.940 
to take from this a she's got that bow
and<00:02:58.270> arrow<00:02:58.450> which<00:02:58.780> was<00:02:59.170> my<00:02:59.350> favorite<00:02:59.710> weapon

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
and arrow which was my favorite weapon

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.380 
and arrow which was my favorite weapon
in<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.070> first<00:03:00.310> game<00:03:00.520> despite<00:03:00.940> all<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
in the first game despite all of the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.170 
in the first game despite all of the
guns<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.900> were<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.200> offer<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:03.580> think<00:03:03.730> has

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
guns that were on offer and I think has

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.940 
guns that were on offer and I think has
become<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.690> new<00:03:04.870> signature<00:03:05.260> weapon<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
become the new signature weapon for the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
game the first game but also be the fact

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.240

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
scared all that was my interpretation of

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.580 
scared all that was my interpretation of
it<00:03:19.450> when<00:03:19.600> he<00:03:19.720> was<00:03:19.840> kind<00:03:20.050> of<00:03:20.110> pointing<00:03:20.440> his<00:03:20.560> gun

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
it when he was kind of pointing his gun

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.170 
it when he was kind of pointing his gun
around<00:03:20.800> that<00:03:21.070> cave<00:03:21.280> despite<00:03:22.000> being

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
around that cave despite being

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.940 
around that cave despite being
surrounded<00:03:22.480> by<00:03:22.660> dead<00:03:22.990> bodies<00:03:23.320> although

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
whether he killed them or Lara killed

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.630 
whether he killed them or Lara killed
them<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.660> up<00:03:25.990> for<00:03:26.230> discussion<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.070> fact

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
the head suggests that she's she's

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.980 
the head suggests that she's she's
really<00:03:30.820> grown<00:03:31.000> as<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.209> character<00:03:31.570> they<00:03:31.810> whether

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
really grown as a character they whether

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.630 
really grown as a character they whether
it's<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.320> good<00:03:32.440> way<00:03:32.620> or<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:32.860> bad<00:03:32.980> way<00:03:33.160> we'll

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
it's in a good way or a bad way we'll

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.600 
it's in a good way or a bad way we'll
have<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.030> find<00:03:34.270> out<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.920> final<00:03:36.280> image<00:03:36.490> is

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
have to find out and this final image is

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.490 
have to find out and this final image is
interesting<00:03:37.209> because<00:03:37.390> as<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.840> said<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.200> seems

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
interesting because as I said it seems

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.350 
interesting because as I said it seems
like<00:03:38.740> this<00:03:38.950> game<00:03:39.220> will<00:03:39.550> really<00:03:39.910> show<00:03:40.090> Lara

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
like this game will really show Lara

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.780 
like this game will really show Lara
getting<00:03:41.080> closer<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.560> her<00:03:41.800> roots<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.580> first

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
getting closer to her roots the first

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.270 
getting closer to her roots the first
game<00:03:42.910> was<00:03:43.090> incredible<00:03:43.530> but<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.650> tombs<00:03:44.950> kind

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
game was incredible but the tombs kind

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.100 
game was incredible but the tombs kind
of<00:03:45.370> felt<00:03:45.580> like<00:03:45.640> side<00:03:46.090> activities<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.990> it's

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
of felt like side activities and it's

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.680 
of felt like side activities and it's
possible<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.650> we'll<00:03:47.800> see<00:03:47.980> more<00:03:48.160> actual<00:03:48.690> tomb

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
possible that we'll see more actual tomb

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.990 
possible that we'll see more actual tomb
raiding<00:03:49.959> in<00:03:50.320> this<00:03:50.860> game<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.370> that'll<00:03:51.670> be<00:03:51.790> more

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
raiding in this game and that'll be more

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.490 
raiding in this game and that'll be more
of<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.180> focus<00:03:52.360> of<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.840> now<00:03:52.990> that<00:03:53.140> we've<00:03:53.260> gotten

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
of a focus of it now that we've gotten

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.100 
of a focus of it now that we've gotten
through<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.760> initial<00:03:55.120> how<00:03:55.360> did<00:03:55.570> Lara

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
through the the initial how did Lara

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.530 
through the the initial how did Lara
Croft<00:03:56.380> become<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.070> Lara<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:57.640> we<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.510> we
