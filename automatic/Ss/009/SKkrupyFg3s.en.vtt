to be honest I you know comparing with

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.740 
to be honest I you know comparing with
an<00:03:09.720> iPhone<00:03:10.560> for<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.239> was<00:03:12.239> looking<00:03:12.480> at<00:03:12.630> it

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
an iPhone for that I was looking at it

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.160 
an iPhone for that I was looking at it
it<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:12.930> feels<00:03:13.349> so<00:03:13.500> much<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.270> an<00:03:15.270> iOS<00:03:15.810> device

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
it just feels so much like an iOS device

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.130 
it just feels so much like an iOS device
we're<00:03:17.160> just<00:03:17.310> kind<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.489> sad<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.660> way<00:03:18.690> but<00:03:19.430> yeah

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
we're just kind of sad in a way but yeah

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.830 
we're just kind of sad in a way but yeah
there<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.290> go

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
there you go

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
there you go
commenting<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:24.989> performance<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.739> is

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
commenting on the performance so this is

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.340 
commenting on the performance so this is
now<00:03:26.430> I'm<00:03:26.700> going<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.940> move<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.720> bar<00:03:27.989> I'm<00:03:28.260> going

now I'm going to move this bar I'm going

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.650 
now I'm going to move this bar I'm going
to<00:03:28.470> move<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.160> custom<00:03:30.090> firmware<00:03:30.300> which<00:03:30.569> is

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
to move to the custom firmware which is

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.390 
to move to the custom firmware which is
the<00:03:30.780> latest<00:03:31.110> version<00:03:31.319> that's<00:03:31.650> just<00:03:31.950> recently

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the latest version that's just recently

the latest version that's just recently
come<00:03:32.580> out<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.030> I'll<00:03:33.750> say<00:03:34.470> if<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.650> go<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:36.200> system

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
come out and I'll say if I go to system

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.830 
come out and I'll say if I go to system
we'll<00:03:37.739> go<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:39.209> phone

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
we'll go to that phone

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.610 
we'll go to that phone
as<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.890> can<00:03:41.010> see<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.110> latest

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
as you can see that is the latest

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.620 
as you can see that is the latest
version<00:03:44.069> which<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.489> version<00:03:46.489> 1.9<00:03:47.489> point<00:03:47.880> 2<00:03:48.390> 3

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
version which is version 1.9 point 2 3

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.280 
version which is version 1.9 point 2 3
and<00:03:48.959> I've<00:03:49.080> downloaded<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.400> from<00:03:50.989> gal<00:03:51.989> net

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
and I've downloaded it from gal net

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.270 
and I've downloaded it from gal net
which<00:03:52.830> is<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.130> think<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.630> it's<00:03:54.830> based<00:03:55.830> on<00:03:56.069> in

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
which is I think it's it's based on in

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:04.030 
which is I think it's it's based on in
Scotland<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:58.069> yeah<00:03:59.269> I<00:04:01.700> think

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
Scotland so yeah I think

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.910 
Scotland so yeah I think
obviously<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.569> performance<00:04:06.260> improvement

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
obviously the performance improvement

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.589 
obviously the performance improvement
it's<00:04:07.099> so<00:04:07.489> much<00:04:07.670> more<00:04:07.879> fluid<00:04:08.810> much<00:04:10.390> much<00:04:11.390> more

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
it's so much more fluid much much more

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.960 
it's so much more fluid much much more
responsive<00:04:12.200> better-looking<00:04:13.040> as<00:04:13.489> you<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.849> see

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
responsive better-looking as you can see

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.479 
responsive better-looking as you can see
I'm<00:04:14.540> not<00:04:14.720> sure<00:04:14.870> if<00:04:15.019> you<00:04:15.110> can<00:04:15.260> see<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.680> quality

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
I'm not sure if you can see the quality

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.819 
I'm not sure if you can see the quality
of<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.880> icons<00:04:17.269> from<00:04:17.840> there<00:04:18.079> it's<00:04:18.260> really

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
of the icons from there it's really

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.900 
of the icons from there it's really
sharp<00:04:21.220> definitely<00:04:22.220> one<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.490> sharpest

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
sharp definitely one of the sharpest

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.689 
sharp definitely one of the sharpest

opportunity to do this I'm going to show

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.409 
opportunity to do this I'm going to show
you<00:04:32.810> something<00:04:33.800> called<00:04:34.010> volume<00:04:34.789> plus<00:04:35.090> which<00:04:35.330> I

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
you something called volume plus which I

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.390 
you something called volume plus which I
didn't<00:04:35.660> mention<00:04:35.810> in<00:04:36.110> stock<00:04:36.410> but<00:04:38.169> it's<00:04:39.340> kind<00:04:40.340> of

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
didn't mention in stock but it's kind of

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.219 
didn't mention in stock but it's kind of
a<00:04:40.520> known<00:04:40.699> fact<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.389> Samsung<00:04:41.600> Galaxy<00:04:41.840> S

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
a known fact that the Samsung Galaxy S

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.920 
a known fact that the Samsung Galaxy S
still<00:04:42.470> has<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:43.150> fairly<00:04:44.150> weak<00:04:45.880> audio<00:04:46.930> capability

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
still has a fairly weak audio capability

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.409 
still has a fairly weak audio capability
and<00:04:48.169> what<00:04:48.979> this<00:04:49.160> does<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.699> is<00:04:49.729> essentially

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
and what this does it is essentially

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.010 
and what this does it is essentially
allows<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:51.080> enhance<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:52.360> audio<00:04:53.360> the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
allows you to enhance the audio the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.490 
allows you to enhance the audio the
maximum<00:04:54.560> volume<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:55.310> can<00:04:55.490> increase<00:04:55.850> that<00:04:56.500> and

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
maximum volume you can increase that and

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.330 
maximum volume you can increase that and
you<00:04:57.770> can<00:04:57.949> all<00:04:58.130> see<00:04:58.370> with<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:58.729> 3d<00:04:59.090> ups

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.930 

you've<00:05:03.340> got<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:05.250> virtual<00:05:06.250> room<00:05:06.370> effect<00:05:06.760> and

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
you've got the virtual room effect and

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.540 
you've got the virtual room effect and
you've<00:05:07.030> got<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:08.170> know<00:05:08.440> you<00:05:08.500> really<00:05:08.800> can<00:05:09.220> make

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
you've got you know you really can make

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.990 
you've got you know you really can make
a<00:05:10.290> significant<00:05:11.290> and<00:05:11.770> very<00:05:12.370> noticeable

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
a significant and very noticeable

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.330 
a significant and very noticeable
difference<00:05:13.390> to<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:13.780> audio<00:05:13.990> quality<00:05:14.140> as<00:05:14.590> well

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
difference to the audio quality as well

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.040 
difference to the audio quality as well
as<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:16.500> Veloster<00:05:17.500> volume<00:05:17.800> so<00:05:18.660> yep<00:05:19.660> so<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:19.870> can

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
as the Veloster volume so yep so you can

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.930 
as the Veloster volume so yep so you can
change<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.500> volume<00:05:20.590> level<00:05:23.580> wider<00:05:24.580> than<00:05:24.760> that

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
change the volume level wider than that

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.730 
change the volume level wider than that
I<00:05:25.180> would<00:05:25.570> probably<00:05:25.720> say<00:05:26.020> seven<00:05:26.530> and<00:05:26.650> eight

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
I would probably say seven and eight

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.290 
I would probably say seven and eight
would<00:05:27.040> be<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.430> optimum<00:05:27.850> because<00:05:28.090> otherwise

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
would be the optimum because otherwise

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.400 
would be the optimum because otherwise
doesn't<00:05:29.260> sound<00:05:29.470> good<00:05:30.510> but<00:05:31.510> anything<00:05:32.260> above

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
doesn't sound good but anything above

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.260 
doesn't sound good but anything above
three<00:05:33.280> is<00:05:34.210> higher<00:05:34.720> than<00:05:34.960> the<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.820> default

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
three is higher than the the default

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.940 
three is higher than the the default
maximum<00:05:37.870> so<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.050> think<00:05:38.140> the<00:05:38.290> default<00:05:38.470> there<00:05:38.830> was

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
maximum so I think the default there was

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.670 
maximum so I think the default there was
about<00:05:39.750> that<00:05:40.750> should<00:05:40.870> be<00:05:41.020> four<00:05:41.260> supposed<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:41.620> be

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
about that should be four supposed to be

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.460 
about that should be four supposed to be
zero<00:05:41.890> but<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:43.510> I<00:05:43.540> think<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.020> optimum<00:05:44.380> is

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
zero but the I think the optimum is

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.060 
zero but the I think the optimum is
about<00:05:44.650> six<00:05:45.010> or<00:05:45.160> seven<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.320> and<00:05:47.590> this

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
about six or seven so that is and this

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.480 
about six or seven so that is and this
is<00:05:48.130> called<00:05:51.360> just<00:05:52.360> fine<00:05:52.630> what<00:05:52.870> it's<00:05:52.990> cold

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
is called just fine what it's cold

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.670 
is called just fine what it's cold
volume<00:05:54.490> plus<00:05:54.730> that's<00:05:55.150> what<00:05:55.360> it's<00:05:55.480> called<00:05:55.680> okay

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
volume plus that's what it's called okay

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.430 
volume plus that's what it's called okay
anyway<00:05:57.100> so<00:05:57.160> I<00:05:57.340> hope<00:05:57.550> you<00:05:57.700> guys<00:05:57.850> enjoyed<00:05:58.600> this

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
anyway so I hope you guys enjoyed this

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.790 
anyway so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video<00:05:59.710> and<00:06:00.420> I'll<00:06:01.420> put<00:06:01.840> a<00:06:01.870> link<00:06:02.470> in<00:06:02.740> the

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
video and I'll put a link in the

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.500 
video and I'll put a link in the
description<00:06:02.950> where<00:06:03.670> you<00:06:03.730> can<00:06:03.940> download<00:06:04.090> the

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
description where you can download the

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.720 
description where you can download the
date<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:05.500> I<00:06:05.650> think<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:07.270> source<00:06:08.140> of<00:06:08.410> MIUI<00:06:08.730> is

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
date and I think the source of MIUI is

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.040 
date and I think the source of MIUI is
already<00:06:10.120> there<00:06:10.360> on<00:06:10.660> my<00:06:11.430> on<00:06:12.430> my<00:06:12.900> initial<00:06:13.900> video

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
already there on my on my initial video

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.310 
already there on my on my initial video
all<00:06:14.380> right<00:06:14.530> cheers<00:06:14.860> guys<00:06:14.980> think
