00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.249 
px3 has two assignable buttons
assignable<00:00:11.790> button<00:00:12.150> one<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.049> used<00:00:13.170> for

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
assignable button one can be used for

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.880 
assignable button one can be used for
modulation<00:00:14.089> portamento<00:00:15.139> or<00:00:16.139> when<00:00:16.410> using<00:00:16.800> the

here's<00:00:26.880> how<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.119> assign<00:00:27.480> modulation<00:00:28.550> we

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
here's how we assign modulation we

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
here's how we assign modulation we
simply<00:00:29.730> choose<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> seller<00:00:30.510> won't<00:00:31.109> apply

simply choose the seller won't apply

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680 
simply choose the seller won't apply
modulation<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.000> by<00:00:33.120> pressing<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
modulation to and by pressing and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.540

holding<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.110> assignable<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.890> button<00:00:35.219> we

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
holding the assignable one button we

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
holding the assignable one button we
hear<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> modulation<00:00:41.809> side<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.960> button<00:00:43.200> one

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
hear the modulation side of a button one

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:53.690 
hear the modulation side of a button one
is<00:00:43.559> released<00:00:43.920> modulation<00:00:44.640> stops
