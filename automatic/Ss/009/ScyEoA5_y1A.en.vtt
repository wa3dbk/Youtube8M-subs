00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 very good how are you today I bring you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.960
 a tutorial is about how I'm going to 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.360
 fix and make up aha first thing 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.570
 What I do is take a file in this case 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.340
 is a file with four edges that each 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.750
 one of them has a function but I 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.359
 in my case he only used what is 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.850
 the file to give a little bit of shape to 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.500
 the nail and good as advice that I give is 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.330
 always use the same ones that do not have 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.300
 in very thick granules because that makes 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.130
 to lift everything that is the nail and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
 apart then I will not control much what 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.510
 which is a way that you are going to give me 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.579
 then what I'm doing little to 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.579
 little filing from one place to another to not 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.559
 also lift the nail and nothing 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.980
 giving the form of this case my form 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.140
 of nail is a square shape because of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.059
 for me, one is like that but you know that 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.059
 you can give it the shape you want 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 now with a cuticle kit of a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.180
 tool that on the one hand makes 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 drag or push the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.829
 cuticle towards the end and on the other hand 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.320
 what it does is cut it what I do is go 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.300
 pushing little by little until the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.100
 Cuticle is as close to the nail as possible 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.780
 this is important to do so that the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.370
 nail looks the longest and the cleanest 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.540
 possible so little by little I go 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.540
 dragging back 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.500
 now with a specific product for 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.720
 remove the cuticles what I do is 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.820
 apply it on the nail where we have the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.220
 cuticle this will make it soften a 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.160
 little bit and it's easier to remove it but 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.990
 good if you do not have this product you can 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.060
 use it with nothing or even then 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.290
 also uses the oil to make it 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.860
 it slipped a little bit and so that 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.860
 soften 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.670
 and so this step would be to let act 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.670
 approximately about 60 seconds 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.080
 with the cuticle kit that we have 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.880
 previously used what I'm going 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.619
 doing is removing the as you see is a 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.260
 blade so you have to have 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.270
 relatively careful and not get much 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.550
 or not remove more from the account because what 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.310
 what are you going to do is do or give me 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.870
 even get to make you blood so 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.690
 you see little by little and removing the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.880
 cuticles that supervene now what I'm going to 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.180
 do is apply a base on the nail to 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.100
 that the enamel lasts for longer and 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.590
 so do not dye your nails on 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.390
 enamel that you put in color this is 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.300
 very important to do it as I say 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.489
 so there is no aggression in the enamel 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.550
 of your nail and apart this base has 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.209
 then functions how to protect it 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.209
 strengthen and shine 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.910
 good as you see I have already applied 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.910
 totally this base 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.610
 Now what it would be is to apply the color 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.250
 in the nail I have chosen a red burgundy 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.010
 and good, the important thing is to start from 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.360
 the end out on the one hand 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.549
 imagine that you start with the part 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.019
 right as you can see I'm going to touch up and 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.540
 then we continue with the part 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.040
 left or right of water what is 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.319
 important that you do it by piece 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.730
 law from one half to another half is 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.069
 important that you see it slow that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.019
 have time to make up the nail 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.120
 The faster you go the worse it will come out 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.920
 and it will also help you that the brush of 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.569
 the enamel is as long and fine 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.569
 possible to have more precision 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.400
 and I will repeat the steps as you see the 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.130
 beginning from the end to one side 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.290
 I repeat the same from the end the other 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.610
 side and it's also important that I 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.680
 you get especially if you have colors 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.430
 dark what is the beginning of the nail 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.430
 a little bit below 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.250
 to finish what I do is apply a 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.080
 product that makes me last longer 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.750
 enamel is to say that I do not know 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.790
 would peel part also makes 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.190
 the drying of the previous enamel that we have 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.990
 put it much faster so nothing 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.580
 it is applied just above the enamel that 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.040
 we have put do not have any kind of 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.650
 difficulty and what he will do as I say is 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.630
 that the enamel dries before possible 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.890
 something that happens to us all is that once 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.170
 that we have already made up the nail 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.240
 we started doing everything and in the end what 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.370
 we spoil so it's very important 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.110
 let it dry a little bit and with this 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.470
 product will help you to finish is 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.470
 before 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.040
 and nothing has already finished what is the 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.390
 nail makeup I hope you 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.520
 have liked that you have taken some 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.520
 trick and see you in the next video
