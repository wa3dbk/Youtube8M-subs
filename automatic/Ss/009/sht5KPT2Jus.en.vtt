00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
 the evolution of Brazilian gymnastics is undeniable 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:11.669
 22 years 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.399
 the Olympic medal did not come 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:17.890
 but the athlete already has in the curriculum important titles like worldwide 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.570
 and two diamonds and a silver in the pan of the river 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.250
 is the continuation of the success that Diego has made in gymnastics until now 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.029
 but throughout Brazil we have anonymous gymnasts true athletes artists 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.119
 that shine 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.119
 the riding stables across the country 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.290
 live now has 21 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.260
 one year, circus artists are approved of the mission of boyfriends. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.730
 helps in the pairing of the pair during presentations 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.640
 the people 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.320
 before he called the oral and written expression on his vow - along with it 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.260
 the project also predicts the entity already worked together and we leave after 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.960
 who waits for the sea with the name of a better future 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.230
 a story 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.310
 there was a whole love story to the name is once with the number selection with 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.310
 a story just like the professional gymnast 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.060
 concentration readability quick movements said cardoso but the goal of 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.409
 join 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.409
 to elicit applause and sighs from the audience 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.170
 it's competing to get the best grades 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.880
 impress the jurors 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.570
 I think if the same thing 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.020
 I was right 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.410
 I am going to vote the text of aldo rebelo will also be presented so what is 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.770
 that you 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.480
 It's the same thing he was paying he was followed by birigui passes from him in the 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.140
 Brazil 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.340
 Empty chairs since Saturday is a different head because people 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 make a presentation for public and there they make a presentation by 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.670
 a note to nutribem something is different 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.030
 so from there already start apparatus that is different from us to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.960
 our sole structure completely different from theirs so we 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.600
 ends up getting inferior due general structure lack that we have 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.450
 compared to them
