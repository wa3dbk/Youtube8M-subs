 new europe is its own kitchen 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.790
 culture and of course its own history and yet 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 here more and more young people are unhappy with those 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.099
 what the future is trying to determine without her 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.260
 participation risk group students for 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.420
 freedom is becoming more popular 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 many young people are not satisfied 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 happening in Europe they are for hard 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.840
 a variant of capitalism their ranks continue 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.519
 replenish and replenish and replenish 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.279
 this weekend here was 400 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.420
 students from 44 countries never thought 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.070
 what is possible 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.170
 very cool to watch as ours 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.280
 organization grows throughout europe 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.600
 that our ideas are shared by many 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 conferences are held by youth and for 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.700
 youth political parties group not 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.129
 finance and those who are here 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.800
 paid everything from your own pocket 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.829
 there is no ready solution to Europeâ€™s problems 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.109
 but they think it's time for new ones 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.660
 ideas really the situation is very 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.330
 dangerous politicians and bureaucrats rule 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.640
 almost five hundred million people 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.000
 In this they do not always know exactly which is better. 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.000
 for people 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 archos yes and why do they want more 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 freedom to do business and less 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.170
 intervention on the part of bureaucrats and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.509
 also to centralize the current government 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.490
 Brussels 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.710
 Europe â€™s biggest problem right now is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.720
 misuse of original goals 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.490
 there was a goal to keep the peace first 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 free market free movement 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.119
 in Europe 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.790
 and now they are forming a new nation 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.009
 build it as representatives of the new 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.649
 generations they want to contribute to 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.520
 Europe's future to get something on 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.680
 their eyes are deprived today I think that this 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.570
 a reflection of the fact that young people in europe 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.450
 now feel deprived of their 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.520
 rights among youth spain 50 percent 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.290
 how can you feel unemployed 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.340
 decide something if you don't even have 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.259
 works and the feeling of being forgotten 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.229
 pushing towards these young people to search 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:12.530
 ways to make a difference thousands of things 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.530
