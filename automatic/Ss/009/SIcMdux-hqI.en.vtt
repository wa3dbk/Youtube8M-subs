00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.980

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.380
 valeria of good morning princesses of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 Bluffs because she is simply very 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.760
 cute and supports to be worth everything 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.429
 needs and advises and is not like a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.649
 absent mother but there is also a 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:43.050
 moment that is a little bit involved in 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.969
 things like what force you want to treat me 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.519
 like to help valerio to make her see 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.530
 I saw things his way then there 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.870
 about like it but telling me it's a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.059
 very loving mother and very worried about 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.550
 her daughter then yes in number 4 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.319
 we have rugby wen's mom 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.449
 crisis in script just to me that 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.819
 woman I almost lost in the part always 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.220
 he was protecting him went over all 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.930
 get what I had to import 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.540
 do 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.700
 to protect and the very loving and the advice 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.520
 so I really liked his role in 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.860
 excess in number three we have more 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.080
 of virgin criteria beautiful creatures 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.850
 in this case it has broken beautiful cause 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.190
 because it 's true that it's where you see the most 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.900
 loves love towards there so for all 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.910
 things that happen in this book instead of the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.550
 suffering from loves balls 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.070
 worry about this that she is a 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.100
 perfect maternal figure in this case that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.350
 scream does not have a mom then then 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.960
 that I liked a lot numbers 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.610

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.229

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.350
 green that are really the gentlemen 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.810

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.450
 you do not want anyone because you really 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.310
 see that your son has I love is something 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.880
 really strong with parents but 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.800
 I feel it is something very ugly to know that you 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.840
 son is suffering or he can get to 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.270
 really suffer you can stay rooted 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.560
 in everything and the poem that even though I already 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.930
 they have cancer they have to keep going 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.090
 they have to make a normal life without 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.340
 to leave you in to pose for this was like 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.390
 I loved them and just the ones from 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.110
