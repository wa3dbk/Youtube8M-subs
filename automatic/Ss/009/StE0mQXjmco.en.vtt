00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:12.339 
couldn't go enough and then we couldn't

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.279 
couldn't go enough and then we couldn't
run<00:00:13.339> the<00:00:13.370> fourth<00:00:13.669> quarter<00:00:13.849> he<00:00:14.120> got<00:00:14.299> his<00:00:14.839> dunks

and<00:00:16.240> turbo<00:00:17.240> hit<00:00:17.420> some<00:00:17.570> big<00:00:17.690> shots<00:00:17.950> and<00:00:18.950> we<00:00:19.429> just

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
and turbo hit some big shots and we just

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.009 
and turbo hit some big shots and we just
kind<00:00:19.789> of<00:00:19.880> scored<00:00:20.150> enough<00:00:20.300> I<00:00:20.390> mean<00:00:20.570> we<00:00:20.660> got<00:00:20.810> some

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
kind of scored enough I mean we got some

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.570 
kind of scored enough I mean we got some
shots<00:00:21.260> but<00:00:21.529> we<00:00:21.650> just<00:00:21.800> couldn't<00:00:22.010> score<00:00:22.310> enough

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
shots but we just couldn't score enough

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.759 
shots but we just couldn't score enough
points<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:23.060> then<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:23.480> thought<00:00:24.170> defense<00:00:24.619> in<00:00:24.710> the

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
points and then I thought defense in the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.730 
points and then I thought defense in the
first<00:00:25.009> half<00:00:25.189> was<00:00:25.250> pretty<00:00:25.640> good<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.740> third

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
first half was pretty good and third

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.380 
first half was pretty good and third
quarters<00:00:28.220> just<00:00:28.460> a<00:00:28.609> little<00:00:28.820> bit<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.089> then<00:00:29.150> they

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
quarters just a little bit and then they

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.499 
quarters just a little bit and then they
just<00:00:29.570> sound<00:00:30.130> we<00:00:31.130> just<00:00:31.310> got<00:00:31.429> 10<00:00:31.669> fastest<00:00:32.180> what's

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
just sound we just got 10 fastest what's

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.960 
just sound we just got 10 fastest what's
Dwight<00:00:32.780> Howard<00:00:33.140> scoring<00:00:33.770> I<00:00:34.070> guess<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.790> way

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
Dwight Howard scoring I guess the way

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.520 
Dwight Howard scoring I guess the way
you<00:00:35.030> wanted<00:00:35.510> him<00:00:35.629> to<00:00:35.780> like<00:00:35.989> do<00:00:36.110> you<00:00:36.200> think<00:00:36.260> he

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
if he shoes jump shots on jump hooks or

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.430 
if he shoes jump shots on jump hooks or
something<00:00:42.469> like<00:00:42.559> that<00:00:42.620> but<00:00:43.239> me<00:00:44.239> dunks<00:00:44.870> you

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
five to one something like that and you

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.849 
five to one something like that and you
can't<00:00:51.020> give<00:00:51.230> him<00:00:51.320> done<00:00:51.530> especially

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
can't give him done especially

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.720 
can't give him done especially
transition<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.920> means<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.160> load<00:00:55.340> is<00:00:55.370> easy

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
transition and it means a load is easy

yes<00:03:20.549> but<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:20.849> I<00:03:20.940> thought<00:03:21.540> um<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.230> thought<00:03:22.739> jamir

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
yes but I I thought um I thought jamir

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.220 
yes but I I thought um I thought jamir
looked<00:03:23.340> pretty<00:03:23.579> good<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.659> thought<00:03:24.870> Boggs

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
looked pretty good and I thought Boggs

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.440 
looked pretty good and I thought Boggs
was<00:03:25.500> really<00:03:25.920> he'd<00:03:26.579> gutted<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.030> out<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
was really he'd gutted it out but I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.699 
was really he'd gutted it out but I
thought<00:03:27.599> he<00:03:27.690> was<00:03:27.780> really<00:03:28.079> struggling<00:03:28.410> he

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
thought he was really struggling he

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.930 
thought he was really struggling he
looked<00:03:29.010> very<00:03:29.299> very<00:03:30.500> uncomfortable<00:03:31.819> but<00:03:32.819> he

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
looked very very uncomfortable but he

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.539 
looked very very uncomfortable but he
hit<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> huge<00:03:33.450> three<00:03:33.810> for<00:03:34.109> us<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:35.069> thought

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
hit a huge three for us and I thought

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.580 
hit a huge three for us and I thought
played<00:03:35.819> pretty<00:03:36.030> good<00:03:36.120> defense<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.349> thought

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
played pretty good defense so I thought

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.199 
played pretty good defense so I thought
he<00:03:37.650> played<00:03:37.709> fine<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.549> thought<00:03:38.879> he<00:03:39.000> looked

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
he played fine but I thought he looked

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.289 
he played fine but I thought he looked
very<00:03:39.769> uncomfortable<00:03:40.769> up<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.010> see<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:42.150> know

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
very uncomfortable up to see you know

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.839 
very uncomfortable up to see you know
