00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.500 
we'll just press play to get to the big

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
game and so this is actually the first

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
game and so this is actually the first
level<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> game<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.559> gives<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.800> some

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
basically your goal is to get the Apple

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.250 
basically your goal is to get the Apple
before<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.000> thief<00:00:45.270> does<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.960> finished

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

before the thief does and it finished
the<00:00:46.350> level<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.280> don't<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
apples before the thief does you don't

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
apples before the thief does you don't
fail<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> level<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.520> kind<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.850> getting

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

your Birds the three apples are kind of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
your Birds the three apples are kind of
like<00:00:52.559> three<00:00:52.770> stars<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.760> also<00:00:53.879> finish

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
at all and so the controls are fairly

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830

simple<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.789> jump<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> longer

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
simple all you do is jump but the longer

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.950 
obstacles you have to make it over
through<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> levels<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.840> generally

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
through but the levels are generally

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
through but the levels are generally
pretty<00:01:22.380> easier<00:01:22.909> especially<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
pretty easier especially in the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.219 
pretty easier especially in the
beginning<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.049> bit

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
beginning but they do get a little bit

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.249 
beginning but they do get a little bit
more<00:01:25.380> complicated<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> levels<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:27.259> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
more complicated as the levels go on and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.569 
more complicated as the levels go on and
so<00:01:28.409> there's<00:01:28.560> also<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.860> tool<00:01:29.100> shed<00:01:29.310> where<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
so there's also a tool shed where you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.980 
so there's also a tool shed where you
can<00:01:29.729> buy<00:01:29.909> things<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.390> those<00:01:30.509> coins<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
can buy things for those coins that you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960 
can buy things for those coins that you
earn<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.979> buy<00:01:32.100> bananas<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.880> buy

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
earn so you can buy bananas you can buy

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.910 
earn so you can buy bananas you can buy
a<00:01:33.000> helmet<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:34.140> also<00:01:34.350> unlock<00:01:34.710> different

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
a helmet you can also unlock different

characters such as granny scruffy or the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
characters such as granny scruffy or the
grandpa<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.210> use<00:01:39.390> those<00:01:39.570> items<00:01:39.990> that

like<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.270> said<00:01:51.509> use<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.930> cane<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.500> slow<00:01:52.710> him

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
like I said use the cane to slow him

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.620 
like I said use the cane to slow him
down<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> don't<00:01:54.509> make<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
down as you can see if you don't make a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.780 
down as you can see if you don't make a
jump<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.619> gonna<00:01:55.740> end<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.310> level<00:01:56.640> for

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
jump it's not gonna end the level for

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
jump it's not gonna end the level for
you<00:01:56.880> per<00:01:57.060> se<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:58.020> store<00:01:58.259> circumstances

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
you per se in some store circumstances

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
you per se in some store circumstances
it<00:01:59.250> does<00:01:59.280> they're<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.240> slows<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it does they're just slows you down a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.510 
it does they're just slows you down a
little<00:02:00.930> bit<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.890> don't<00:02:02.070> make<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> jump

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
little bit but if you don't make a jump

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.800 
little bit but if you don't make a jump
like<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.149> right<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.329> you're<00:02:03.689> gonna

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
like this one right here you're gonna

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
like this one right here you're gonna
fall<00:02:04.079> down<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> that's<00:02:04.920> basically<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.880> can't

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
fall down and that's basically you can't

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.520 
fall down and that's basically you can't
get<00:02:06.210> out<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.079> level<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.469> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
get out of that so the level is going to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.990 
get out of that so the level is going to
end<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> take<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.640> back<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
end it's going to take you back to the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.499 
end it's going to take you back to the
beginning

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
beginning

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390 
beginning
some<00:02:10.140> levels<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.890> give<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
some levels actually do give you the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.070 
some levels actually do give you the
baseball's<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.480> need<00:02:12.690> them<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.870> get

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
baseball's because you need them to get

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.309 
baseball's because you need them to get
through

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
through

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.470 
through
certain<00:02:13.680> malls<00:02:14.159> if<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.670> throw<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.120> baseball

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360 
certain malls if you throw the baseball
out<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> wall<00:02:15.840> before<00:02:16.079> you<00:02:16.290> crash<00:02:16.499> into<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:16.950> you

out a wall before you crash into it you
won't<00:02:17.489> slow<00:02:17.790> down<00:02:17.819> at<00:02:18.150> all<00:02:18.269> you'll<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.629> go

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
won't slow down at all you'll just go

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.509 
won't slow down at all you'll just go
through<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> opening<00:02:19.499> that<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.650> make<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.370> so

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
through the opening that you make and so

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.520 
through the opening that you make and so
I<00:02:20.549> do<00:02:20.700> enjoy<00:02:20.939> this<00:02:21.269> game<00:02:21.540> that's<00:02:21.959> definitely<00:02:22.499> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
I do enjoy this game that's definitely a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.780 
I do enjoy this game that's definitely a
little<00:02:22.859> bit<00:02:22.980> different<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.430> game<00:02:23.579> that<00:02:23.730> I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
little bit different of game that I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.699 
little bit different of game that I
usually<00:02:24.030> play<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.079> only<00:02:25.230> reason<00:02:25.650> I

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
usually play the really only reason I

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.349 
usually play the really only reason I
picked<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.189> was<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:26.849> was<00:02:26.939> 25

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
picked this up was because it was 25

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.330 
picked this up was because it was 25
cents<00:02:27.780> when<00:02:28.139> Google<00:02:28.499> was<00:02:28.590> having<00:02:28.889> a<00:02:28.950> special

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
cents when Google was having a special

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.459 
cents when Google was having a special
and<00:02:29.430> having<00:02:29.670> certain<00:02:29.879> apps<00:02:30.120> for<00:02:30.299> 25<00:02:30.719> cents<00:02:31.109> but

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
and having certain apps for 25 cents but

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:32.629 
and having certain apps for 25 cents but
I<00:02:31.530> definitely<00:02:31.769> think<00:02:32.069> it's<00:02:32.159> well<00:02:32.310> worth<00:02:32.340> it

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
I definitely think it's well worth it

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.490 
I definitely think it's well worth it
it's<00:02:32.819> even<00:02:33.000> definitely<00:02:33.329> worth<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.510> 99<00:02:34.200> cents

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
it's even definitely worth the 99 cents

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.679 
it's even definitely worth the 99 cents
at<00:02:34.889> its<00:02:35.099> normal<00:02:35.370> price<00:02:35.670> there's<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.389> lot<00:02:36.599> of

at its normal price there's a lot of
game<00:02:36.810> play<00:02:36.989> here<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.560> pretty<00:02:37.859> addicting

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.530 
it's very simple it's really not that
hard<00:02:40.049> to<00:02:40.109> mess<00:02:40.319> up<00:02:40.530> I'm<00:02:40.889> sometimes<00:02:41.219> the<00:02:41.819> jumps

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
hard to mess up I'm sometimes the jumps

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.479 
hard to mess up I'm sometimes the jumps
can<00:02:42.689> be<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> little<00:02:43.349> bit<00:02:43.499> finicky<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:44.069> if

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
can be a little bit finicky because if

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.190 
can be a little bit finicky because if
you<00:02:44.879> don't<00:02:45.060> hit<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.239> jump<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.840> right<00:02:46.049> you're

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
you don't hit the jump just right you're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.479 
you don't hit the jump just right you're
not<00:02:46.319> gonna<00:02:46.500> make<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.889> and<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.430> to

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
not gonna make it and you have to

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.250 
not gonna make it and you have to
restart<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:48.090> level<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.689> that<00:02:48.719> does<00:02:49.019> get<00:02:49.230> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
restart the level so that does get a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.929 
restart the level so that does get a
little<00:02:49.439> bit<00:02:49.650> frustrating<00:02:50.219> but<00:02:50.579> other<00:02:50.730> than

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
little bit frustrating but other than

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.030 
little bit frustrating but other than
that<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.389> think<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:51.959> pretty<00:02:52.109> fun<00:02:52.409> worth<00:02:52.829> your

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that I think it's pretty fun worth your

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.189 
that I think it's pretty fun worth your
$0.99<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.239> guys<00:02:54.359> want<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> check<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.019> out

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:04.949 
ability to skip a level if you want to

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.170 
ability to skip a level if you want to
all<00:03:05.159> you<00:03:05.250> gonna<00:03:05.370> do<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.549> press<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.060> you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
all you gonna do is press it and you

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.459 
all you gonna do is press it and you
have<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.480> ability<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.810> skip<00:03:07.079> if<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.349> have

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
have the ability to skip if you have

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.140 
have the ability to skip if you have
enough<00:03:07.680> coins<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:08.849> wouldn't<00:03:09.060> suggest

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
enough coins and but I wouldn't suggest

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.939 
enough coins and but I wouldn't suggest
skipping<00:03:09.510> too<00:03:09.750> many<00:03:09.900> levels<00:03:10.109> because<00:03:10.319> it's

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:10.949 
skipping too many levels because it's

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.289 
skipping too many levels because it's
not<00:03:11.189> really<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.489> expensive<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.030> normally

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
not really that expensive the normally

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.689 
not really that expensive the normally
that<00:03:12.449> hard<00:03:12.689> but<00:03:13.439> that<00:03:13.680> basically<00:03:14.189> sums<00:03:14.549> up

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
that hard but that basically sums up

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.459 
that hard but that basically sums up
