you put a piece of that because it has

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.550 
you put a piece of that because it has
these<00:02:01.880> silicones<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.080> silicones

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
these silicones in it and the silicones

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.179 
these silicones in it and the silicones
hold<00:02:03.830> 30<00:02:04.369> times<00:02:04.790> its<00:02:05.119> own<00:02:05.360> weight<00:02:05.420> in<00:02:05.840> water

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
to water now we take our healthy tomato

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.360 
to water now we take our healthy tomato
plant<00:02:26.510> we<00:02:27.139> to<00:02:27.319> always<00:02:27.590> tap<00:02:27.829> them

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
plant we to always tap them

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.940 
plant we to always tap them
and<00:02:28.849> then<00:02:29.330> we<00:02:29.450> take<00:02:29.629> them<00:02:29.810> out<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.319> we<00:02:30.440> put<00:02:30.830> it

and then we take them out and we put it
in<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.280> ground<00:02:31.519> we<00:02:31.819> put<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.330> lower<00:02:32.690> than<00:02:33.050> it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
in the ground we put it in lower than it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.050 
in the ground we put it in lower than it
was<00:02:33.170> planted<00:02:33.739> because<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.370> farther<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.849> come

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
up on the trunk the more rooting you get

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.759 
up on the trunk the more rooting you get
now<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:37.970> push<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.540> soil<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:39.080> around<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.620> and

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
now you push the soil in around it and

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.809 
now you push the soil in around it and
pack<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.370> down<00:02:41.379> really<00:02:42.379> good<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:43.519> can't

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819
