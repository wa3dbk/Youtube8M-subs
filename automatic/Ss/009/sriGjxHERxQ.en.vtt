00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.700
 Nekrasov 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 Now I will show you such a thing on 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.590
 computer preferably on windows 7 not 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.309
 I know how in other systems but on windows 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.500
 7 works 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.590
 we need to open a command prompt for 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.650
 this transition start menu here we write in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.650
 searching 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:34.160
 so we cut in here we need to write 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 next shoot down 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.270
 I will write this in the description just in case 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.590
 hand can't you right because 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.840
 why does 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:54.559
 shoot down space jelly is like her 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:00.690
 is called flash like the letter s is space 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:02.670
 flash and seconds time tried in minutes 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.309
 I canâ€™t walk anything personally 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 I do not know how to cope with it but it is not 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.090
 so important for what we need it is us 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.780
 need for the computer to pass out 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.140
 when we need, that is, we say 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.189
 let's go for a walk or somewhere else 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.490
 pumped up game or here at night 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.430
 leave the game writes how much will 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.460
 pump up let's say half an hour we wanted 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.860
 the resulting parameter is passed out to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.490
 all at night did not work downloading the game he 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 to cut in 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.350
 that is, we wrote it in half an hour it's 1800 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.090
 seconds 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.800
 if you can't then you can calculate 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.920
 on calculator let's say calculator 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.170
