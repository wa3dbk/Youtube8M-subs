00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.920 
to do that I was like I said when I did
my<00:02:05.490> hair<00:02:05.759> yesterday<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> didn't<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
my hair yesterday and I didn't like the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.449 
my hair yesterday and I didn't like the
way<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.140> turned<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.649> able<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.069> put

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
way it turned out I was able to just put

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.390 
way it turned out I was able to just put
it<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.910> bun<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.950> definitely<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.099> good

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it up in a bun so definitely a good

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.150 
it up in a bun so definitely a good
protective<00:02:11.940> style<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.599> everything

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
protective style and everything

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.870 
protective style and everything
but<00:02:14.090> yeah<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.630> if<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:15.050> are<00:02:15.670> quite<00:02:16.670> at<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
but yeah so if you are quite at the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.000 
but yeah so if you are quite at the
length<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.570> want<00:02:17.780> yet<00:02:18.440> or<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.830> just

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
length that you want yet or you just

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.150 
length that you want yet or you just
want<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.310> little<00:02:19.430> bit<00:02:19.700> more<00:02:19.910> fullness

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
want a little bit more fullness

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.620 
want a little bit more fullness
definitely<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.340> clip<00:02:22.610> ins<00:02:22.790> are<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.120> great

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
definitely the clip ins are a great

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.690 
definitely the clip ins are a great
solution<00:02:25.120> they<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:26.450> all<00:02:27.250> types<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.430> lens

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
solution they have all types of lens

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.870 
solution they have all types of lens
like<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.180> said<00:02:29.240> earlier<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:30.860> got<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.340> 12-inch

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
like I said earlier I got the 12-inch

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.240 
like I said earlier I got the 12-inch
but<00:02:32.210> i<00:02:32.240> believe<00:02:32.390> they<00:02:33.350> go<00:02:33.560> all<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.010> way<00:02:34.070> up<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
but i believe they go all the way up to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.850 
but i believe they go all the way up to
24<00:02:35.030> inches<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.630> if<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.840> want<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.110> really<00:02:36.530> really

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
24 inches so if you want a really really

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.070 
24 inches so if you want a really really
long<00:02:37.160> or<00:02:37.700> if<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.420> want<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.780> little<00:02:38.870> bit

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
long or if you want it a little bit

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.140 
long or if you want it a little bit
shorter<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.800> think<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.220> shortest<00:02:40.760> they<00:02:40.940> have

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
shorter I think the shortest they have

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.290 
shorter I think the shortest they have
is<00:02:41.510> 8<00:02:42.110> inches<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:42.920> yeah<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:44.000> have<00:02:44.270> to

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
is 8 inches but yeah you just have to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.740 
is 8 inches but yeah you just have to
kind<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:44.990> play<00:02:45.290> around<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.910> kind

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
kind of like play around with it to kind
