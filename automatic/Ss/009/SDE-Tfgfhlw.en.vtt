low<00:02:56.600> voltage<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.530> running<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.430> it's<00:02:58.520> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
low voltage for running so it's the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.030 
low voltage for running so it's the
economical<00:02:59.210> it's<00:03:00.020> got<00:03:00.200> its<00:03:00.350> own<00:03:00.440> built-in

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
want to set the temperature exactly how

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.070 
want to set the temperature exactly how
you<00:03:10.010> want<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.340> which<00:03:10.550> is<00:03:10.670> really<00:03:10.880> nice<00:03:11.120> it's

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
also got a flow adjustment so if you

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.840 
also got a flow adjustment so if you
feed<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.720> lower<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.200> flow<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:16.520> feed

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
feed in you can lower the flow and feed

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.060 
feed in you can lower the flow and feed
give<00:03:17.570> them<00:03:17.690> sort<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:17.990> five<00:03:18.230> or<00:03:18.440> ten<00:03:18.650> minutes<00:03:18.950> to

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.520 
give them sort of five or ten minutes to
feed<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.610> then<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.120> can<00:03:20.270> put<00:03:20.480> feed<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.290> flow

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
feed and then you can put feed the flow

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.490 
feed and then you can put feed the flow
back<00:03:21.770> up<00:03:21.980> again<00:03:22.280> it's<00:03:23.210> also<00:03:23.390> got<00:03:23.780> an<00:03:23.960> indicator

here really doing well there's one well

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.529 
here really doing well there's one well
worth<00:05:54.039> investing<00:05:54.639> the<00:05:54.729> money<00:05:54.759> into<00:05:55.360> it

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
worth investing the money into it

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.439
