00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689

which will make an accent to be down at
the<00:01:13.740> fam<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.240> just<00:01:15.240> marked<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.650> that's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
the fam I just marked on there that's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.289 
the fam I just marked on there that's
rather<00:01:17.220> than<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.460> sent<00:01:17.729> me<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> mark<00:01:18.150> would

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
rather than that sent me to mark would

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.140 
rather than that sent me to mark would
be<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.950> would<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.159> sure<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.820> return<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
be so it would be sure to not return a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
be so it would be sure to not return a
bit<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.509> rpm<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> same<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.650> such

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
bit more rpm to get the same out of such

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280 
bit more rpm to get the same out of such
as<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> egg<00:01:23.189> monster<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.960> bit<00:01:25.140> more

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
as the egg monster so a little bit more

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.539 
as the egg monster so a little bit more
horsepower<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> play<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.670> very<00:01:27.570> similar

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
horsepower to play with or very similar

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.590 
horsepower to play with or very similar
does<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.729> winning<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> little<00:01:30.150> bit<00:01:30.270> higher

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.410 

I<00:01:33.100> got<00:01:34.100> over<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.310> slightly<00:01:34.549> better<00:01:34.759> pitch<00:01:35.119> on

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
I got over a slightly better pitch on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.910 
I got over a slightly better pitch on
the<00:01:35.509> shorter<00:01:35.780> blades<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.320> all<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:36.650> chopping

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
the shorter blades so all this chopping

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.160 
the shorter blades so all this chopping
out<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:37.369> did<00:01:37.490> hope<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.450> won't<00:01:38.570> be<00:01:38.720> necessary<00:01:39.110> in

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
out and did hope I won't be necessary in

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.899 
out and did hope I won't be necessary in
the<00:01:39.229> shoulder<00:01:39.560> blades<00:01:39.770> because<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.610> entire

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
the shoulder blades because the entire

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.359 
the shoulder blades because the entire
length<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.240> blade<00:01:41.690> will<00:01:42.080> be<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.220> right

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
length of the blade will be the right

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.070 
length of the blade will be the right
pitch<00:01:44.290> as<00:01:45.290> of<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.500> egg<00:01:45.590> monster<00:01:46.810> low<00:01:47.810> pitch

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080

generating interest at all and I was

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.480 
generating interest at all and I was
only<00:01:58.970> about<00:01:59.270> 30<00:01:59.509> kilo<00:01:59.720> gums<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.020> first<00:02:00.490> that's

seven<00:04:56.889> mil<00:04:57.689> does<00:04:58.689> it<00:04:58.810> make<00:04:58.930> sense<00:05:00.689> then<00:05:01.689> I

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
seven mil does it make sense then I

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.860 
seven mil does it make sense then I
thought<00:05:01.990> era<00:05:02.229> maybe<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:03.389> asked<00:05:04.389> him<00:05:04.479> to<00:05:04.659> milic

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
thought era maybe I asked him to milic

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.240 
thought era maybe I asked him to milic
to<00:05:05.050> whether<00:05:05.259> it<00:05:05.409> is<00:05:05.500> six<00:05:05.830> points<00:05:06.250> 80<00:05:06.669> /<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.330> to

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
to whether it is six points 80 / is to

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.070 
to whether it is six points 80 / is to
tap<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.310> thread<00:05:09.580> into<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:10.029> an<00:05:10.719> eight<00:05:10.900> mile

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
tap a thread into it an eight mile

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.339 
tap a thread into it an eight mile
thread<00:05:11.520> so<00:05:12.520> then<00:05:12.819> the<00:05:13.509> miata<00:05:13.839> journeys<00:05:14.199> at

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
thread so then the miata journeys at

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.320 
thread so then the miata journeys at
eight<00:05:14.529> mil<00:05:16.139> I've<00:05:17.139> could<00:05:17.379> then<00:05:17.999> tap<00:05:18.999> these<00:05:19.120> up

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
eight mil I've could then tap these up

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.290 
eight mil I've could then tap these up
to<00:05:19.360> eight<00:05:19.569> mil<00:05:20.879> another<00:05:21.879> to<00:05:22.029> choose<00:05:22.150> another

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
to eight mil another to choose another

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.059 
to eight mil another to choose another
bolt<00:05:22.599> and<00:05:22.900> going<00:05:23.110> straight<00:05:23.289> through<00:05:23.349> not<00:05:23.919> on

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
bolt and going straight through not on

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.459 
bolt and going straight through not on
the<00:05:24.159> end<00:05:24.339> I<00:05:24.610> could<00:05:24.759> just<00:05:24.879> bolt<00:05:25.659> straight<00:05:25.960> into

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
the end I could just bolt straight into

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:33.070 
the end I could just bolt straight into
that<00:05:26.909> which<00:05:27.909> will<00:05:28.029> be<00:05:28.089> nice<00:05:30.719> so

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
that which will be nice so

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.750 
that which will be nice so
maybe<00:05:34.080> I'm<00:05:34.380> system<00:05:34.830> this<00:05:34.950> is<00:05:35.130> because<00:05:35.550> it

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
maybe I'm system this is because it

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.670 
maybe I'm system this is because it
weighs<00:05:35.940> it<00:05:36.090> down<00:05:36.120> slightly<00:05:36.480> less<00:05:38.030> what<00:05:39.680> steel

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
weighs it down slightly less what steel

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.000 
weighs it down slightly less what steel
hub<00:05:41.360> since<00:05:42.360> on<00:05:42.450> aluminium<00:05:42.600> it's<00:05:43.050> probably<00:05:43.260> cut

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
hub since on aluminium it's probably cut
