00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the hardest part really is just trying

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.690 
the hardest part really is just trying
to<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.150> foot<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.590> pedal<00:01:26.070> but

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that's actually pretty easy one to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.160 
that's actually pretty easy one to
figure<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.619> how<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
figure out how to do that and then it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.539 
figure out how to do that and then it's
pretty<00:01:31.350> much<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.220> once<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> get

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
pretty much it you know once you get

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.910 
pretty much it you know once you get
really<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.240> could<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.500> stabs

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
really good you could like it stabs
