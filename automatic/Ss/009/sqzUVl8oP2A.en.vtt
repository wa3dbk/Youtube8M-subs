 e 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.140
 hi to all his cd buddy I hope that 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.430
 you 're doing that very well then 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.570
 can see that I called myself city 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.130
 pod the beginning of the video 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.360
 and why these deposits of baths because 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.840
 that it is the alliance of sidiailles of 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.669
 ipod 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.679
 I replaced my name which was 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.670
 sir baby of 25 who was not very 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.800
 well adapted we love you and I 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.330
 will call me now if ipods and 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.000
 you will recognize me under this name 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.019
 so the intros at the beginning it will not be 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.150
 immediately changed me naughty 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.460
 would soon change my name to the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.370
 replace with silicon 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.320
 so I said then I introduce you 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.730
 today an alternative to a stadium 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.379
 where to install what a lot of people 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.520
 use the main people who 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.320
 live with their device it's for a 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.079
 stage where it would be a pity 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.730
 missing an obligation like this 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.410
 which I presented an application 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.420
 alternative that's called v expensive and who 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.670
 is almost even better than a stadium 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.170
 where so this is the first positive point 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.059
 she is French and you have 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 no need to visit sites 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.750
 to download applications 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.759
 so I explain to you more clearly 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.740
 so here I am in the application v 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.310
 dear I'm on the home so there 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.959
 it's applications to the pif a little there 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.610
 does not hurt a chinese one in french 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.539
 as can be seen here to install it 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.060
 you just have to click on install 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.200
 automatically installs right you 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.390
 have collections his say several 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.530
 applications that will be grouped a little 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.099
 we do not know how because it's 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.940
 in Chinese 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:32.979
 so here we are rather interested in 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.209
 or category there you have the categories 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.709
 like on the app store and you can 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.869
 download directly based on 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.979
 software categories etc 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.899
 if you want to do a search you 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.179
 click on the little troop upstairs at 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.250
 right and you make your chair du 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.229
 application site I mean that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.289
 you want but for example I want some 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.060
 changes is an action app 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.310
 here I am going to look in the most 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.369
 popular because you have the choice 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.080
 between applications sponsor the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.869
 palms popular places and the latest 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.879
 so I stayed so popular and so 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:09.250
 I want to install for example eh ben 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.090
 here we will wait in the popular 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.080
 because I'm still in the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.209
 popular game there I am in the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.709
 last I'm going to install by 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.420
 example it forces more debate just 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.590
 click on install and the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 download will be done directly 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.020
 while i was showing this with angry 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.100
 birds 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.300
 on install then it does not work 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.460
 you see that the installation was 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.770
 made directly with angry birds star 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.210
 wars and wanted him to know how to score 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.770
 facilities now see in the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.330
 downloads right there they could 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.830
 see that I have several applications that 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.000
 are in the process the installation we 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.530
 can install two at the same time is 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.250
 there to sell lists of expectations with 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.630
 angry birds star wars so english bird 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.870
 I will dance the download it 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.340
 could see that here I am at 46% you 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.080
 have all the guys I have them 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.700
 downloads that are based 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.220
 of the percentage can see just in 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.860
 below the size of the application and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.720
 how many kilos beats it gets 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.160
 download per second the time before 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.090
 when you downloaded a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.230
 application and not even need to 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.550
 click on install it installs 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.740
 automatically he could see that 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.450
 I installed ninja fruit right there but 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.310
 if we go to see springboard 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.560
 can see I have the application 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.080
 ninja stride that's right there so I 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.780
 easily installed with gvt is expensive if 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.730
 I go into management you can do 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.140
 the application manager that 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.600
 you have the updates and the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.980
 installed apps right here you 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.480
 click delete if you want 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.670
 remove the application from a face or 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.470
 is updated if you want to 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.330
 day and in more you can configure 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.709
 a little this tweak so we're not going too 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.630
 to be interested in that because it's not that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.590
 which interest you the most now 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.760
 I told you how this works 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.310
 application we will see how 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.480
 install it so we go on cydia and 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.360
 we will install the thing called 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.840
 Appsync ap Simoleons allies on the source 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.220
 a saloon 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.230
 but as this source does not work anymore 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.170
 we will go to our source so we 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.490
 will go into manage when it's over 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.770
 to load wuala we will go into manage 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.810
 we will go after in sources for 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.540
 do edit added and you go 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.270
 added the source called http du 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.880
 slash point yasid y a milow weight 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.770
 do not pose this point as I drag myself 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.060
 link in the description worry 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.530
 not you go in the description you 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.320
 look at the link and you go back in 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.120
 six guys when it's done we'll go 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.480
 in research and we will search 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.950
 the thing called appsync so you 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.650
 have several possibilities for a ping 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.740
 you have for ios 4 is superior and 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.500
 ios 5 and higher if you are over 6.5 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.200
 take sync apps for ios 5 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.660
 5 more like could see right here so 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.920
 you install and as soon as 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.620
 installed you will go on 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.480
 safari on your browser which is 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.870
 installed you go get the following 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.460
 that they are called v points at tv.com 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.200
 slash in slash 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.820
 so I would put links also in the 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.610
 description you just click here on 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:56.020
 two modes installs the necessary 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.220
 click twice you say he 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.870
 wanted to install the application you 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.190
 install you have the application v expensive 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.650
 I just introduced 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.090
 directly on your springboard and 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.950
 you will be able to download the application 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.540
 a bit like installing better and better bone 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.950
 because if in French and in addition to 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.800
 no need to visit sites 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.570
 to download applications so 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.190
 tell me what you think of this 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.450
