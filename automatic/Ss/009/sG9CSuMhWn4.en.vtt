 let's see the fight on tiger 2 you bought this one 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.550
 typewriter specifically for historical battles 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.880
 it is a fight that we consider this is a 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 version 811 I bought it even 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.320
 have not yet set camouflage reading lit 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.730
 In short for the gold put it put 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.150
 love and all 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.950
 because camouflage I decided to wait for 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.840
 on the stock although then I immediately bought gold 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.360
 general is not the point 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 The royal tiger is my 1 tt 8 1 general 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.130
 my eight in this game 2 8 to full 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.460
 It was Jagdpanther 2 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:54.720
 I rocked parallel to the hawk is a shame 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.310
 In general, I roll back mist with a rollback around 1300 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.840
 average damage 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.690
 50 plus percent wins here we are about 400 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.820
 of battles I bought him in due time 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 to take the master again sold 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 here now bought again 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.840
 trained one hundred percent for him the crew 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.850
 for gold and started to rock a separate 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 characters to quietly 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.840
 This is one of the first fights and we are here. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.810
 brothers were sitting in timspike 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.460
 and the site is such a guys do not want to lei 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.750
 to cheat such a lion we go 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.300
 shorter tuner he went on borsch 1-3 2 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.600
 we go into battle but you see the delivery man 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.740
 eights which common eights that is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.100
 the sorrows of the enemies will immediately merge 2 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.610
 bochat but show just skill 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 really 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.890
 nagib on this tank and since there is no 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.080
 artillery I cliff on the map 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.990
 driving up to the center and now I will just 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.470
 until d annihilate boy you will see 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.340
 change ammunition 20 to 20 gold and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.410
 lugs then there is no purpose there especially 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.720
 bend up raising statistics on tiger 2 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.780
 I was not here that is just 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.140
 bought out I knew that there not long ago 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.140
 support 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.790
 he was slightly removed review a little 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.819
 truth added armor to commanding 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.209
 turret but in general that did ponerfili 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.040
 People's Deputy had previously 123,100 but give 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.800
 about him even more wadded any 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.440
 distance from the first if falls into 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.020
 onnogo punches at a right angle at 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.709
 even at an angle well I think with distances 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.110
 three hundred meters he, too, will break through quietly I 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.450
 on the test in historical battles went to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.980
 still calmly understands the pen 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.520
 royal tiger his tax with any 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.980
 distance depreciation hide just 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.260
 so I understood that tiger 2 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.850
 this is far from us halo but tanchik yet 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.680
 not weak of it to me this will be here 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.400
 back clearly demonstrated 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.220
 You will see a gold in the board of an ass 8 very much 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.800
 great set and if you constantly monitor 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.930
 where is your tower turned to 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.970
 Do not expose here the sides of the tower like me 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.730
 framed the beginning of the battle there st-1 somewhere with 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.800
 I put it on the base of course it's wild 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.170
 saddened but I can not do anything he 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.220
 this is what I'm trying to do here somehow 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.470
 lean out and throw comrade 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.570
 on the center meanwhile the site is also here on 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.140
 center in its trough trying something 0 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.870
 in this very cool there is a cake me 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.850
 trying to punish here and such successfully 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.130
 because on the tower on here like you 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.570
 see urgently printed something from me 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.170
 just head on to the tower 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.850
 punches and it is not surprising then 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.980
 I am here the tower is essentially the same as u 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.810
 E50 Well, only a little more will 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.930
 booking booking I will say no 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.090
 shine tank towers can be but 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.720
 single level and better than the seventh catching 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.020
 foot 7 caught in the forehead of the tower do not take yes and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.450
 here are the eight nines often pierce 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.990
 the only chance to tank it is simple and 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.490
 they don't fall or fall into a bevel 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.620
 tadada non-penetration will 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.160
 but generally even considering all these 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.670
 disadvantages see the mask sometimes damage 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.830
 hawala that is at hour rondell 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.600
 judging by the sound just fell into the mask 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.520
 guns ace gun mask damage yet 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.530
 holds 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.660
 you can tank something like on it with 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.720
 dozens of war given a good 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.490
 accuracy and acceptable rate of fire 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.040
 studios see my crew here finally 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:41.410
 no cost 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.360
 here in my ventilation and rammer 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.640
 then our rate of fire is even a little bit 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.800
 less than 9 seconds think it is great 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.040
 indicator true then when already services 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.020
 90 I'm in the historical boyarynya ride it 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.090
 put enlightened instead 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.690
 ventilation because there is enlightened to 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.030
 but here it is important to fit the end of the God 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.449
 there is a final stage and i start 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.159
 embroider to those who absolutely do not stand 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.819
 in place it is not at all kid 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:15.340
 stir crush that's actually what I 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:18.729
 now doing all sorts of watch stand 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.090
 rat him beautiful golda and 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.789

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.740
 just genius look at it remains 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.389
 vaffentur st-1 did not first want 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.159
 charge the bomb for later dramatically switched 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.590
 on the gold in the same place I understood that most likely 1 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:35.949
 will get st-1 which this early bout on 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.590

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.840
 bro many you see here and occupy 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.870
 position here at such an angle in aldane 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.389

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.949

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.599
 I did not even to light here is he there 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.300
 stood near the bush as soon as he 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:54.449
 I end up immediately charging a mine 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.060
