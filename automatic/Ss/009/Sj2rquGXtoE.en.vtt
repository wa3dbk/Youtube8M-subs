00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
really what kills me so I'm a size large

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.679 
really what kills me so I'm a size large
in<00:01:53.180> everything<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.189> even<00:01:56.689> other

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
in everything really and even other

here<00:02:31.720> without<00:02:32.720> being<00:02:33.260> restricted<00:02:33.620> by<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
here without being restricted by the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.059 
here without being restricted by the
jacket<00:02:34.430> if<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.700> sort<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.260> lift<00:02:36.260> my<00:02:36.440> arms<00:02:36.739> up<00:02:36.920> and

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
jacket if I sort of lift my arms up and

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.699 
jacket if I sort of lift my arms up and
over<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.580> can<00:02:38.300> fully<00:02:38.569> extend<00:02:39.140> them<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:39.530> then

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
over I can fully extend them but then

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.670 
over I can fully extend them but then
the<00:02:39.860> jacket<00:02:40.489> really<00:02:40.819> rides<00:02:41.150> up<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:42.050> it

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
the jacket really rides up and it

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.470 
the jacket really rides up and it
becomes<00:02:43.069> really<00:02:43.190> constricted<00:02:44.030> around<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
becomes really constricted around the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.320 
becomes really constricted around the
chest<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> think<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.700> could<00:02:46.760> potentially

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
chest so I think I could potentially

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.740 
chest so I think I could potentially
size<00:02:48.019> up<00:02:48.319> they<00:02:48.560> don't<00:02:49.190> use<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> standard<00:02:49.940> sizing

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
size up they don't use a standard sizing

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.430 
size up they don't use a standard sizing
I<00:02:50.930> think<00:02:51.260> their<00:02:51.440> sizing<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.069> 0<00:02:52.489> 1<00:02:52.790> 2<00:02:52.940> 3<00:02:52.970> 4<00:02:53.440> maybe

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
I think their sizing is 0 1 2 3 4 maybe

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.699 
I think their sizing is 0 1 2 3 4 maybe
you<00:02:54.709> up<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.010> 5<00:02:55.600> or<00:02:56.600> 6<00:02:56.840> set<00:02:57.080> off<00:02:57.170> don't<00:02:57.530> quite

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
you up to 5 or 6 set off don't quite

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.949 
you up to 5 or 6 set off don't quite
recall<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.340> wear<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.730> 3<00:02:59.120> which<00:02:59.360> would<00:02:59.569> equate

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
recall so I wear a 3 which would equate

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.270 
recall so I wear a 3 which would equate
to<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.200> large<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:02.450> size<00:03:02.660> up<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.989> an<00:03:03.110> XL<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:03.980> I

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
to a large I can size up to an XL but I

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.840 
to a large I can size up to an XL but I
really<00:03:05.000> think<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.980> would<00:03:07.160> be<00:03:07.280> overkill

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
really think that that would be overkill

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.120 
really think that that would be overkill
I<00:03:08.120> might<00:03:08.600> gain<00:03:08.810> some<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.350> chest<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:09.950> then

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
I might gain some of the chest but then

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.940 
I might gain some of the chest but then
it'd<00:03:10.310> be<00:03:10.340> way<00:03:10.819> too<00:03:10.880> long<00:03:11.150> in<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:12.380> sleeves<00:03:12.680> in

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
it'd be way too long in the sleeves in

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.970 
it'd be way too long in the sleeves in
other<00:03:13.100> areas<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:17.260> let's<00:03:18.260> go<00:03:18.440> over<00:03:18.590> some<00:03:18.799> more

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
other areas so let's go over some more

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.410 
other areas so let's go over some more
of<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.190> features<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.120> sort<00:03:20.359> of

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
talked about what I was hoping for from

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.310 
talked about what I was hoping for from

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
contact with your chin or anything so if

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.140 
contact with your chin or anything so if
it's<00:04:51.770> cold<00:04:51.980> out<00:04:52.130> in<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.340> middle<00:04:52.550> dippers<00:04:52.880> cold

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
it's cold out in the middle dippers cold

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.270 
it's cold out in the middle dippers cold
you're<00:04:53.420> not<00:04:53.540> gonna<00:04:53.710> get<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:54.890> on<00:04:55.130> your<00:04:55.370> chin

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
you're not gonna get that on your chin

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.740 
you're not gonna get that on your chin
it<00:04:58.280> does<00:04:58.520> have<00:04:59.260> adjustments<00:05:00.430> along<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.750> hem

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
it does have adjustments along the hem

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.860 
it does have adjustments along the hem
line<00:05:02.780> here<00:05:03.370> so<00:05:05.410> you<00:05:06.410> can<00:05:06.590> get<00:05:07.580> stop<00:05:07.850> wind<00:05:08.180> gust

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870

from<00:05:09.940> coming<00:05:10.940> up<00:05:11.060> into<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.420> jacket<00:05:11.840> and<00:05:12.020> it

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
from coming up into the jacket and it

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.370 
from coming up into the jacket and it
does<00:05:12.260> carry<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.650> lifetime<00:05:13.130> guarantee<00:05:14.350> so<00:05:15.350> I

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
does carry a lifetime guarantee so I

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.020 
does carry a lifetime guarantee so I
think<00:05:15.560> this<00:05:15.800> is<00:05:15.950> actually<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.550> Auto<00:05:16.820> to

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
think this is actually the Auto to

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.020 
think this is actually the Auto to
technically<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:18.560> don't<00:05:19.340> think<00:05:19.490> it's<00:05:19.640> normally

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
technically I don't think it's normally

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.180 
technically I don't think it's normally
advertised<00:05:20.450> that<00:05:20.630> way<00:05:20.810> but<00:05:21.110> as<00:05:21.590> far<00:05:21.800> as<00:05:21.950> the

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
advertised that way but as far as the

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.280 
advertised that way but as far as the
the<00:05:22.220> burger<00:05:22.700> progression<00:05:23.480> goes<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.960> think<00:05:24.140> this

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
the burger progression goes I think this

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.430 
the burger progression goes I think this
is<00:05:24.470> their<00:05:24.680> second<00:05:25.130> iteration<00:05:25.460> of<00:05:25.700> this<00:05:25.850> jacket

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
is their second iteration of this jacket

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.610 
is their second iteration of this jacket
I'd<00:05:27.440> really<00:05:27.770> like<00:05:27.920> to<00:05:28.070> see<00:05:28.220> a<00:05:28.250> third<00:05:28.490> iteration

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
I'd really like to see a third iteration

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.110 
I'd really like to see a third iteration
that's<00:05:30.820> more<00:05:31.820> articulated<00:05:32.540> and<00:05:33.760> allows<00:05:34.760> for<00:05:35.090> a

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
that's more articulated and allows for a

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.180 
that's more articulated and allows for a
better<00:05:35.210> range<00:05:35.510> of<00:05:35.630> motion<00:05:35.770> other<00:05:36.770> than<00:05:37.040> that

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
better range of motion other than that

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.510 
better range of motion other than that
this<00:05:37.340> is<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.520> really<00:05:37.850> great<00:05:37.970> jacket<00:05:39.490> possibly<00:05:40.490> a

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
this is a really great jacket possibly a

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.460 
this is a really great jacket possibly a
person<00:05:40.910> with<00:05:41.030> a<00:05:41.060> slimmer<00:05:41.540> build<00:05:41.870> than<00:05:42.050> myself

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
person with a slimmer build than myself

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.440

I'm 5 11 and a half around 200 pounds a

I'm 5 11 and a half around 200 pounds a
little<00:05:47.480> bit<00:05:47.780> less<00:05:47.960> maybe<00:05:48.920> a<00:05:49.070> slimmer<00:05:49.370> person

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
little bit less maybe a slimmer person

little bit less maybe a slimmer person
wearing<00:05:50.840> this<00:05:50.990> jacket<00:05:51.970> would<00:05:52.970> not<00:05:53.480> have<00:05:53.690> the

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
wearing this jacket would not have the

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.330 
wearing this jacket would not have the
same<00:05:54.400> restriction<00:05:55.400> that<00:05:55.520> I<00:05:55.550> have<00:05:56.020> so<00:05:57.250> here's<00:05:58.250> a

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
same restriction that I have so here's a

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.600 
same restriction that I have so here's a
look<00:05:58.790> at<00:05:58.910> the<00:05:59.000> back

so<00:06:07.759> I<00:06:08.759> just<00:06:08.939> wanted<00:06:09.180> to<00:06:09.330> take<00:06:09.569> a<00:06:09.629> quick<00:06:09.930> moment

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
so I just wanted to take a quick moment

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.689 
so I just wanted to take a quick moment
here<00:06:10.500> to<00:06:10.650> sort<00:06:10.800> of<00:06:10.889> explain<00:06:11.280> what<00:06:11.490> I<00:06:11.520> was

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
here to sort of explain what I was

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.230 
here to sort of explain what I was
