was like an increased presenting i think

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.480

it<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.660> like<00:00:18.720> 15<00:00:19.619> or<00:00:19.650> 20<00:00:20.189> or<00:00:20.220> something<00:00:20.460> i

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it was like 15 or 20 or something i

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.189 
it was like 15 or 20 or something i
can't<00:00:20.670> remember<00:00:20.789> exactly<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.080> like

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
can't remember exactly but it was like

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.980 
can't remember exactly but it was like
retarded<00:00:22.529> lehigh<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.060> overpowered<00:00:24.869> i

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
retarded lehigh and it was overpowered i

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.720
