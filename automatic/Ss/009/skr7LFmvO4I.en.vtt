00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
are we need to reconsider whether the

are we need to reconsider whether the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
airplanes more generally are safe for

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.979 
airplanes more generally are safe for
overweight<00:00:49.710> passengers<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> think

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
overweight passengers what do you think

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.900 
overweight passengers what do you think
do<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.469> should<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.739> reassessing<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
do I think we should be reassessing this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.639 
do I think we should be reassessing this
yeah

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
yeah

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.350 
yeah
couldn't<00:00:55.649> hurt<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.860> guess<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.670> yeah<00:00:57.210> why

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
couldn't hurt I guess really yeah why

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
couldn't hurt I guess really yeah why
not<00:00:57.510> okay<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> let's<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
not okay so let's do it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.670 
not okay so let's do it
alright<00:00:59.850> story's<00:01:00.300> done<00:01:00.480> no<00:01:01.199> there's<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.559> lot

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
alright story's done no there's a lot

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.049 
alright story's done no there's a lot
more<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> say<00:01:02.070> about<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.430> when<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.850> actually

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
more to say about this when we actually

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.990 
more to say about this when we actually
look<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:04.010> changes<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> regulations<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
look at changes to the regulations in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.350 
look at changes to the regulations in
back<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.600> 2005<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.530> FAA<00:01:07.920> changed<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> average

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
back in 2005 the FAA changed the average

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.910 
back in 2005 the FAA changed the average
passenger<00:01:09.659> weights<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.530> used<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
passenger weights that are used to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.700 
passenger weights that are used to
calculate<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.689> weight<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.290> weight<00:01:13.530> in

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
calculate the weight the the weight in

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.859 
calculate the weight the the weight in
the<00:01:13.740> airplane<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.790> men's<00:01:15.060> weight<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.600> raised

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the airplane the men's weight was raised

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.800 
the airplane the men's weight was raised
by<00:01:16.170> 25<00:01:16.680> pounds<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> 200<00:01:17.970> pounds<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> average

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
by 25 pounds to 200 pounds on average

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
by 25 pounds to 200 pounds on average
and<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> women's<00:01:19.409> weight<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.770> raised<00:01:19.979> by<00:01:20.159> 34

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
and the women's weight was raised by 34

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
and the women's weight was raised by 34
pounds<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.270> 179<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> summer

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
pounds to 179 that's the summer

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
pounds to 179 that's the summer
calculation<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.119> even<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> winter

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
calculation it's even more in the winter

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
calculation it's even more in the winter
when<00:01:25.200> travelers<00:01:25.650> typically<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.220> heavier

clothes possibly jackets with them as

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
clothes possibly jackets with them as

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
well so that has been changed the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.640 
well so that has been changed the
problem<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:33.020> number<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.200> Engineers

advance fat acceptance are saying that

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.729 
advance fat acceptance are saying that

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
listen this is just yet another way to

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.740 
listen this is just yet another way to
criticize<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:45.790> condemn<00:02:45.970> people<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.660> are

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
criticize and condemn people that are

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.690 
criticize and condemn people that are
overweight<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.860> reality<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.580> if

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
overweight and the reality is that if

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.640 
overweight and the reality is that if
airlines<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.390> address<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:50.019> everybody

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
airlines just address this everybody

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.650 
airlines just address this everybody
would<00:02:50.830> benefit<00:02:51.250> possibly<00:02:51.820> by<00:02:51.940> creating<00:02:52.480> a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
would benefit possibly by creating a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.140 
would benefit possibly by creating a
couple<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.290> aisles<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.769> have<00:02:54.190> slightly<00:02:55.000> more

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
couple of aisles that have slightly more

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.780 
couple of aisles that have slightly more
expensive<00:02:55.239> seats<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.590> are<00:02:56.739> wider<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.340> my

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
expensive seats that are wider and my

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.220 
expensive seats that are wider and my
thought<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:58.510> it's<00:02:58.810> called<00:02:59.019> business

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
thought is it's it's called business

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.110 
thought is it's it's called business
class<00:02:59.650> or<00:02:59.830> first<00:02:59.980> class<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.700> that's<00:03:00.819> exactly

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
class or first class and that's exactly

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.910 
class or first class and that's exactly
what<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.810> group<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.140> advocating<00:03:02.680> saying

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
what the the group is advocating saying

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.440 
what the the group is advocating saying
these<00:03:03.040> would<00:03:03.220> be<00:03:03.310> price<00:03:03.519> similar<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.090> business

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
these would be price similar to business

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.600 
these would be price similar to business
class<00:03:04.720> seats<00:03:04.989> but<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.739> already<00:03:06.010> exists<00:03:06.519> in

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
class seats but that already exists in

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.370 
class seats but that already exists in
my<00:03:06.730> point<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.030> view<00:03:07.090> yeah<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:07.810> mean<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.050> can't

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
my point of view yeah I mean I can't

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.170 
my point of view yeah I mean I can't
think<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.890> anything<00:03:09.280> else<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
think of anything else that the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.940 
think of anything else that the
airline's<00:03:10.660> themselves<00:03:10.870> would<00:03:11.290> be<00:03:11.410> able<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.650> do

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
airline's themselves would be able to do

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.559 
airline's themselves would be able to do
to<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:14.350> compensate<00:03:14.980> for<00:03:15.280> overweight<00:03:16.060> people<00:03:16.450> I

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
to to compensate for overweight people I

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.210 
to to compensate for overweight people I
mean<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.019> they're<00:03:17.260> certainly<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.829> going<00:03:18.160> to

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
mean and they're certainly not going to

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.910 
mean and they're certainly not going to
start<00:03:18.430> ordering<00:03:18.640> new<00:03:19.090> planes<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:20.079> what

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
start ordering new planes that have what

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.229 
start ordering new planes that have what
would<00:03:21.040> be<00:03:21.130> new<00:03:21.250> plans<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:21.670> would<00:03:21.760> be<00:03:21.820> seats

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
would be new plans that would be seats

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.360 
would be new plans that would be seats
new<00:03:22.660> seats<00:03:22.959> or<00:03:23.230> new<00:03:23.410> planes<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.010> reality

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
new seats or new planes and the reality

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.160 
new seats or new planes and the reality
is<00:03:24.430> if<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.579> want<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.880> get<00:03:25.000> six<00:03:25.269> if<00:03:25.480> honest<00:03:25.930> if

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
is if you want to get six if honest if

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.280 
is if you want to get six if honest if
on<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.890> narrow-body<00:03:27.310> airplane<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.810> want<00:03:29.079> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
on a a narrow-body airplane you want to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.530 
on a a narrow-body airplane you want to
get<00:03:29.500> six<00:03:30.010> seats<00:03:30.280> across<00:03:30.730> with<00:03:31.090> an<00:03:31.239> aisle<00:03:31.420> in

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
get six seats across with an aisle in

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.220 
get six seats across with an aisle in
the<00:03:31.690> middle<00:03:32.400> simple<00:03:33.400> math<00:03:33.610> dictates<00:03:34.420> how<00:03:34.959> wide

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the middle simple math dictates how wide

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.560 
the middle simple math dictates how wide
the<00:03:35.470> seat<00:03:35.709> can<00:03:35.980> be<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.459> therefore<00:03:37.360> if<00:03:37.480> you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
the seat can be and therefore if you
