00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.710 
see that we're getting about you know
there's<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.459> little<00:03:51.700> bit<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:51.910> janky<00:03:52.239> pneus<00:03:52.480> but

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
there's a little bit of janky pneus but

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.199 
there's a little bit of janky pneus but
I've<00:03:53.470> been<00:03:53.650> watching<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.160> pretty<00:03:54.430> closely<00:03:54.670> for

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
I've been watching it pretty closely for

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.240 
I've been watching it pretty closely for
the<00:03:55.269> last<00:03:55.450> few<00:03:55.600> days<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.140> it's<00:03:56.620> about<00:03:56.769> 20

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
the last few days and it's about 20

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.090 
the last few days and it's about 20
frames<00:03:57.400> per<00:03:57.670> second<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:59.110> crowded<00:03:59.380> room<00:03:59.680> so

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
frames per second in a crowded room so

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.340 
frames per second in a crowded room so
it<00:04:00.850> kind<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:01.420> depends<00:04:01.720> on<00:04:01.840> your<00:04:01.989> network<00:04:02.320> and

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
it kind of depends on your network and

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.530 
it kind of depends on your network and
what<00:04:02.680> you're<00:04:02.830> showing<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:03.880> that's<00:04:04.090> what<00:04:04.420> I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
what you're showing and that's what I

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.670 
what you're showing and that's what I
want<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.780> make<00:04:04.870> sure<00:04:04.900> we<00:04:05.140> get<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.290> that's<00:04:05.590> a

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
want to make sure we get that that's a

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.110 
want to make sure we get that that's a
key<00:04:05.830> point<00:04:05.860> it's<00:04:06.280> really<00:04:06.400> dependent<00:04:06.730> on<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
key point it's really dependent on the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.270 
key point it's really dependent on the
network<00:04:07.360> not<00:04:07.900> on<00:04:08.110> any<00:04:08.410> Bluetooth<00:04:08.830> or<00:04:09.010> anything

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
network not on any Bluetooth or anything

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.949 
network not on any Bluetooth or anything
between<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:09.850> that<00:04:10.090> it's<00:04:10.269> Wi-Fi<00:04:10.420> that's

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
between this and that it's Wi-Fi that's

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.110 
between this and that it's Wi-Fi that's
right<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.350> is<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.500> Wi-Fi<00:04:11.920> device

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
right it is a Wi-Fi device

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.210 
right it is a Wi-Fi device
and<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:14.140> know<00:04:14.230> each<00:04:14.409> each<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.010> devices

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
and you know each each of the devices

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.159 
and you know each each of the devices
has<00:04:15.580> to<00:04:15.730> be<00:04:15.849> set<00:04:16.120> up<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.449> same<00:04:16.600> network<00:04:16.959> if

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
has to be set up on the same network if

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.439 
has to be set up on the same network if
you're<00:04:17.620> using<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:18.010> Mac<00:04:18.519> or<00:04:18.579> Windows<00:04:18.790> computer

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
you're using a Mac or Windows computer

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.140 
you're using a Mac or Windows computer
as<00:04:19.600> your<00:04:19.810> second<00:04:20.199> display<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:21.220> can<00:04:21.400> do<00:04:22.030> we<00:04:22.120> can

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
as your second display you can do we can

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.460 
as your second display you can do we can
do<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:22.449> through<00:04:22.600> ethernet<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.139> then<00:04:23.320> that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
do it through ethernet and then that

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.830 
do it through ethernet and then that
eliminates<00:04:23.949> latency<00:04:24.400> altogether<00:04:24.820> but<00:04:25.510> most

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
eliminates latency altogether but most

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.210 
eliminates latency altogether but most
people<00:04:26.139> are<00:04:26.229> doing<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.620> this<00:04:26.740> way<00:04:26.800> with<00:04:27.100> an

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
people are doing it this way with an

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.420 
people are doing it this way with an
ipad<00:04:27.520> via<00:04:28.030> Wi-Fi<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.740> ten<00:04:29.860> dollars<00:04:30.160> i<00:04:30.280> can

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
ipad via Wi-Fi so for ten dollars i can

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.250 
ipad via Wi-Fi so for ten dollars i can
basically<00:04:30.610> turn<00:04:31.000> any<00:04:31.180> pretty<00:04:31.660> much<00:04:31.810> any<00:04:31.990> old

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
basically turn any pretty much any old
