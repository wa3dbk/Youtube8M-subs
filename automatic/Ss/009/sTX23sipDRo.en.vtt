00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 very good we are all in a new 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.319
 video of guild wars 2 and here as you see 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.970
 let's explain a little the farm in this 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.710
 what is here at the waypoint of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.410
 regret is a little lower than 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.059
 lion's bow you will find it right away and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 what we have to do, we do the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.650
 teleport there we go to the heart 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.300
 that we have just the sword to the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.990
 back to the pajanosas to the back of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.849
 where we left and if we do not have the heart 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.890
 completed we completed it so that this 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.560
 person give us the mission or the mission 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.870
 or the merchant once we are here 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 we have to buy the cloth gloves 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.149
 to pick up crabs I have to say 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.239
 that this is based on the change of karma 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.309
 for objects that we will then put into 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.170
 forge and subsequently recycle 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.120
 to obtain a material which we 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 will provide a certain amount of gold 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 as you can see here if you have the same 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.160
 problem that I just have this 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.280
 handy character 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.780
 and it is not of the profession because you do this 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.600
 the trick you have to give one more pin but 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.950
 well the idea is simple guys if 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.910
 you have karma, do not you use it 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.500
 for example karma I'm not going to 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.960
 use for nothing then I prefer 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.810
 spend it for this and let's try 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 fill what is being the inventory 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.880
 so take good space to have 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.729
 all the possible object you can also go 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.500
 to the poche channel 7h from him or leave in the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.240
 description box because we try 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.490
 do this video together but for 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.070
 lack of time and others do not coincide 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.100
 so we have one each the open 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.100
 100 thousand karma points 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.820
 I'm going to open until we reach 200 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.910
 hello sorry I think 100 recyclables 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.430
 ok what I have to say is simple 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.700
 I'm not going to record all the trips that 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.810
 I've done but basically I've recorded what 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.369
 what is good is the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.680
 operation of so you can see how 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.330
 how is this going 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.220
 What do we have to do? 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.590
 can be recycled at the moment and once 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.050
 let's have the inventory filled what 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.360
 let's do is go to lion's bow 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.820
 to see the second part so let's say 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.470
 of this pair meo in quotes is worth a 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.930
 Once we are in a lion's bow I am going to 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.310
 teach a little trick to have kit 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.860
 of recycling does not have to go buying 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.200
 of 25 25 and it's something that maybe many 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.910
 You know, I did not know, so I told you 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.740
 I share with you we have to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.750
 buying the three kits is worth the 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.520
 select recycling 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.460
 the blue the green and the yellow is worth and 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.180
 with those 33 x recyclables vouchers of 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.420
 day laborers elected and teacher and a stone 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.650
 of the forge forge stone of the forge 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.200
 mysticism 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.420
 if you have if you do not have then 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.580
 will have to form some area so that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.670
 get a stone and give us a 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.349
 mystical recycling tool that are 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.170
 250 uses worth does not come out quite profitable 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.230
 to do this we do not have to be 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.160
 pending to buy or not to buy 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.810
 once we have everything ready 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.640
 we have already started to place in the forge 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.680
 mystical four-by- four objects 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.430
 and with it we will have then as 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.230
 we are looking here pres gloves 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.330
 juggler devastating many 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.760
 many green blues and you will say but it is 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.340
 What do we want this for? 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.260
 blue objects mostly and as 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.450
 a lot of green we will see later 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.549
 I have to tell you that if you want you have 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.730
 curiosity to know how much gold comes out 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.140
 exactly opening 100,000 of karmas 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.630
 doing this function of 100,000 of 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.980
 garma go to the poche channel if you have 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.250
 curiosity to know what is achieved with 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.030
 with 100 recycled objects you have here 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.549
 the solution 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.590
 the gold that I have to say because I do not know 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.080
 difference between one and the other but 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.720
 well this is a way to earn that gold 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.610
 if you get bored you do not know how to get gold 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.910
 Well, you have this way of doing it, it's very 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.160
 tedious is not fun at all 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.180
 sense that we have to do many 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.340
 clicks is usually boring and well I do not know 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.530
 there are people who end up getting tired 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.750
 this but good is not to be 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.910
 doing 24 hours a day but if you have 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.610
 a little karma you need a few 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.960
 gold for any object, because this is 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.800
 the easiest way as we see 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.340
 they give us 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.340
 and 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.620
 rest of linen is worth of red and the rest 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.540
 of linen is an object of the most 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.610
 value they have right now within the 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.710
 materials of tier 3 materials 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.949
 I think this one has three or four I do not know 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.590
 now that we're also going 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:34.070
 to serve to catch as essences of 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.919
 good luck well here we see the price 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.710
 what comes to be the remains of 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.990
 flax with only one 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.550
 a trip is worth a runco here we have the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.150
 already as the last phase of what I've 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.970
 you see you had 250 recycles 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.710
 now I have 135 got more than 100 what 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.539
 what I wanted to get out was a stack of 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.850
 linen rest which we are going to get 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.710
 well let's exchange do not put it 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.010
 by direct sale put it for a price 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.560
 yours in an average between what is 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.979
 buy directly and the price that is 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.260
 is selling and because the tax every 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.330
 time it's higher 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.750
 We sell the linen and we go to 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.780
 take it like here we see 12 25 less 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.030
 122 let's put 11 gold clean with a 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.820
 extractor linen rest that what 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.230
 can carry only good with the rest 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.240
 cotton also back we're going something 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.210
 money we do not sell immediately the 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.530
 cotton yes because it has no interest and 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.670
 well here they were giving away a 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.800
 black lion's key are giving away 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.850
 things these days so I picked it up and 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.770
 I said well I'm going to open I'm going to 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.110
 take advantage of the video of the farms and os 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.060
 I teach what I got with one and also 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.610
 of the black lion buffet an enhancer 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.490
 a knowledge taking and finally a 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.160
 ground object I think it's four of 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.690
 materials which we can sell and 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.090
 get a little money like we're going to see here 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.130
 Well nothing more people if you liked the 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.290
 video then play it 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.090
 leave if you are interested in any other part or 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.670
 if you know a report or if 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.640
 you want me to upload it and for the people 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.900
 I still enjoy it and nothing we see 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.900
 in the next video see you later
