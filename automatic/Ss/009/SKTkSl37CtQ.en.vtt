00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
questions we now some numerous occasions

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.360 
questions we now some numerous occasions
why<00:03:46.989> British<00:03:47.319> athlete<00:03:47.680> seem<00:03:47.919> to<00:03:48.069> suffer<00:03:48.280> from

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
why British athlete seem to suffer from

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.059 
why British athlete seem to suffer from
injury<00:03:48.879> a<00:03:49.030> lot<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.470> could<00:03:50.620> be<00:03:50.739> numerous

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
injury a lot and it could be numerous

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.920 
injury a lot and it could be numerous
reasons<00:03:51.400> from<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.299> know<00:03:52.419> a<00:03:52.449> lot<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.780> time

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
reasons from that you know a lot of time

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.420 
reasons from that you know a lot of time
we<00:03:53.109> got<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.260> look<00:03:53.500> at<00:03:53.650> their<00:03:53.799> background<00:03:54.250> work

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
we got a look at their background work

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.250 
we got a look at their background work
or<00:03:54.669> conditioning<00:03:55.239> they've<00:03:55.449> done<00:03:55.690> what

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
or conditioning they've done what

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.199 
or conditioning they've done what
general<00:03:56.889> conditioning<00:03:57.519> they've<00:03:57.699> done<00:03:57.970> to

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
general conditioning they've done to

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.759 
general conditioning they've done to
enable<00:03:58.840> them<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:58.989> them<00:03:59.230> raise<00:03:59.739> their

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
enable them to them raise their

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.220 
enable them to them raise their
performance<00:04:00.519> up<00:04:00.669> another<00:04:01.000> level<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.569> I<00:04:02.019> think

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
performance up another level and I think

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.990 
performance up another level and I think
a<00:04:02.349> lot<00:04:02.379> of<00:04:02.590> time<00:04:02.889> we've<00:04:03.069> missed<00:04:03.340> out<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.549> lot<00:04:03.910> of

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
a lot of time we've missed out a lot of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.369 
a lot of time we've missed out a lot of
the<00:04:04.150> basics<00:04:04.660> which<00:04:04.870> would<00:04:04.989> be<00:04:05.109> things<00:04:05.290> like

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
the basics which would be things like

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.650 
the basics which would be things like
Star<00:04:05.829> Jones<00:04:06.069> circuit<00:04:06.849> training<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.540> know

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
Star Jones circuit training you know

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.960 
Star Jones circuit training you know
push-ups<00:04:07.930> into<00:04:08.290> all<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.919> basic<00:04:09.519> stuff<00:04:09.760> that

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
push-ups into all that basic stuff that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.819 
push-ups into all that basic stuff that
shiver<00:04:10.180> happen<00:04:10.510> when<00:04:10.660> they<00:04:10.750> were<00:04:10.870> 14<00:04:11.109> and<00:04:11.379> 15

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
shiver happen when they were 14 and 15

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.729 
shiver happen when they were 14 and 15
perhaps<00:04:12.790> was<00:04:13.120> missed<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.810> hence<00:04:14.379> that's<00:04:14.590> the

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
perhaps was missed and hence that's the

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.050 
perhaps was missed and hence that's the
reason<00:04:15.099> why<00:04:15.599> sometimes<00:04:16.599> we<00:04:17.049> can<00:04:17.169> see<00:04:17.289> our<00:04:18.060> team

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
reason why sometimes we can see our team

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.509 
reason why sometimes we can see our team
with<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:19.449> quite<00:04:19.780> injury<00:04:20.169> prone<00:04:20.440> Plus<00:04:21.070> also<00:04:21.250> I

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
with is quite injury prone Plus also I

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.010 
with is quite injury prone Plus also I
believe<00:04:21.640> they<00:04:22.060> don't<00:04:22.150> compete<00:04:22.510> enough<00:04:22.780> at<00:04:22.930> the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
believe they don't compete enough at the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.440 
believe they don't compete enough at the
highest<00:04:23.200> level<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.370> when<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.700> do<00:04:24.940> come<00:04:25.180> to

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
highest level and so when you do come to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.060 
highest level and so when you do come to
major<00:04:26.349> event

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
major event

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.070 
major event
major<00:04:27.220> competitions<00:04:27.850> when<00:04:28.420> all<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.810> sudden

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
major competitions when all of a sudden

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.050 
major competitions when all of a sudden
you've<00:04:29.200> stepped<00:04:29.530> up<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.860> level<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.550> the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
you've stepped up a level and the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.970 
you've stepped up a level and the
intensity<00:04:31.570> gets<00:04:31.840> more<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.410> chances<00:04:32.890> of

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
intensity gets more and the chances of

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.740 
intensity gets more and the chances of
you<00:04:33.130> getting<00:04:33.250> injured<00:04:33.910> because<00:04:34.300> your<00:04:34.510> body's

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
you getting injured because your body's

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.160 
you getting injured because your body's
not<00:04:34.870> used<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.440> greatly<00:04:36.040> increases<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:37.720> think

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
not used to it greatly increases I think

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.570 
not used to it greatly increases I think
those<00:04:38.350> can<00:04:38.530> be<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.800> couple<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.160> elements<00:04:39.310> that

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
those can be a couple of elements that

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.310 
those can be a couple of elements that
we<00:04:39.760> need<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:39.940> possibly<00:04:40.600> address<00:04:40.990> if<00:04:41.170> we're

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
we need to possibly address if we're

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.930 
we need to possibly address if we're
going<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.530> see<00:04:41.680> success<00:04:42.070> right<00:04:42.550> way<00:04:42.730> through

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
going to see success right way through

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.060 
going to see success right way through
to<00:04:43.060> 2012<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.810> lot<00:04:44.200> of<00:04:44.350> time<00:04:44.530> people<00:04:44.800> may<00:04:45.040> think

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
to 2012 a lot of time people may think

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.710 
to 2012 a lot of time people may think
our<00:04:45.400> athletes<00:04:45.730> are<00:04:45.880> just<00:04:46.210> solely<00:04:46.420> motivated

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
our athletes are just solely motivated

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.750 
our athletes are just solely motivated
by<00:04:47.200> money<00:04:47.470> nowadays<00:04:47.800> well<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.430> don't<00:04:48.550> think

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
by money nowadays well I don't think

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.030 
by money nowadays well I don't think
that's<00:04:49.000> really<00:04:49.420> true<00:04:49.450> most<00:04:50.290> athletes<00:04:50.710> now

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
that's really true most athletes now

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.430 
that's really true most athletes now
still<00:04:51.670> would<00:04:52.240> say<00:04:52.480> they<00:04:52.660> want<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.020> win<00:04:53.290> an

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440

else you know there is a blight on money
it's<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.560> not<00:05:11.740> there<00:05:12.010> as<00:05:12.940> much<00:05:13.180> as<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.450> used

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
it's just not there as much as it used

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.840 
it's just not there as much as it used
to<00:05:13.750> be<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.110> they<00:05:14.260> have<00:05:14.350> a<00:05:14.410> realistic<00:05:14.830> idea<00:05:15.280> of

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850

reasons<00:06:12.400> that<00:06:12.940> could<00:06:13.270> be<00:06:13.450> because<00:06:13.660> of

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
reasons that could be because of

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.980 
reasons that could be because of
motivation<00:06:14.940> preparation<00:06:15.940> is<00:06:16.060> wrong<00:06:16.330> but<00:06:16.870> we

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
motivation preparation is wrong but we

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.420 
motivation preparation is wrong but we

things will look completely different

brinton<00:06:24.880> is<00:06:25.030> just<00:06:25.240> really<00:06:25.540> accelerated<00:06:26.200> and

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
brinton is just really accelerated and

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.010 
brinton is just really accelerated and
we<00:06:26.860> just<00:06:27.160> be<00:06:27.280> left<00:06:27.460> behind<00:06:27.730> when<00:06:28.480> it<00:06:28.600> comes<00:06:28.810> to

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
we just be left behind when it comes to

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.740 
we just be left behind when it comes to
sport<00:06:29.710> in<00:06:29.830> Olympic<00:06:29.950> Games<00:06:30.460> I<00:06:30.730> still<00:06:31.390> think<00:06:31.630> of

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
sport in Olympic Games I still think of

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.140 
sport in Olympic Games I still think of
more<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.200> purest<00:06:32.830> side<00:06:33.070> of<00:06:33.280> things<00:06:33.400> so<00:06:33.610> even

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
more the purest side of things so even

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.420 
more the purest side of things so even
though<00:06:34.270> at<00:06:34.630> twenty<00:06:34.960> twelve<00:06:35.230> people<00:06:35.770> be<00:06:36.070> crying

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
though at twenty twelve people be crying

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.990 
though at twenty twelve people be crying
out<00:06:36.610> for<00:06:36.820> some<00:06:36.970> British<00:06:37.300> sports<00:06:37.570> like<00:06:37.840> snooker

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
out for some British sports like snooker

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.290 
out for some British sports like snooker
rugby<00:06:39.570> etc<00:06:40.170> been<00:06:40.380> involved<00:06:40.650> in<00:06:40.950> it<00:06:41.160> and<00:06:41.340> well<00:06:42.030> I

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
rugby etc been involved in it and well I

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.510 
rugby etc been involved in it and well I
kind<00:06:42.660> of<00:06:42.810> think<00:06:43.020> that<00:06:43.290> it's<00:06:43.770> not<00:06:44.010> part<00:06:44.280> of<00:06:44.460> the

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
kind of think that it's not part of the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.490 
kind of think that it's not part of the
Olympic<00:06:44.940> movement<00:06:44.970> nothing<00:06:45.840> personally

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
Olympic movement nothing personally

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.890 
Olympic movement nothing personally
against<00:06:46.920> those<00:06:47.070> sports<00:06:47.520> but<00:06:48.150> I<00:06:48.180> do<00:06:48.360> look<00:06:48.720> at

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
against those sports but I do look at

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.750 
against those sports but I do look at
more<00:06:49.110> the<00:06:49.230> purest<00:06:49.680> side<00:06:49.860> of<00:06:50.040> it<00:06:50.160> and<00:06:50.250> I<00:06:50.370> do<00:06:50.430> look

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
more the purest side of it and I do look

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.430 
more the purest side of it and I do look
at<00:06:50.910> other<00:06:51.120> sports<00:06:51.570> that<00:06:51.750> are<00:06:51.900> that<00:06:52.380> are

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
at other sports that are that are

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.940 
at other sports that are that are
involved<00:06:53.160> and<00:06:53.820> to<00:06:53.850> be<00:06:54.270> any<00:06:55.050> dominant<00:06:55.620> the

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
involved and to be any dominant the

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.410 
involved and to be any dominant the
Olympic<00:06:56.280> Games<00:06:56.310> I<00:06:56.700> think<00:06:56.910> they<00:06:57.000> should<00:06:57.210> stay

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
Olympic Games I think they should stay

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.060 
Olympic Games I think they should stay
there<00:06:57.630> when<00:06:58.320> it<00:06:58.410> comes<00:06:58.530> to<00:06:58.620> the<00:06:58.680> Olympic<00:06:59.040> Games

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
there when it comes to the Olympic Games

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.700 
there when it comes to the Olympic Games
it<00:06:59.640> seems<00:07:00.030> like<00:07:00.180> this<00:07:00.630> is<00:07:00.690> the<00:07:00.870> only<00:07:01.050> time<00:07:01.500> when

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710
