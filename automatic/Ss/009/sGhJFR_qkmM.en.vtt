00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.499
 with the Dutch barradas even more 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.790
 false 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.790
 as simple as that 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
 the former convent that 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.779
 I'm preparing a why 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 - proportion by walking I know that if I am preparing myself for 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.819
 yes, preparing 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.819
 his tutorial about 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 how to take curves the management of the look in the curve 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.810
 when it came to me 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.620
 nor lula lugo 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.830
 63 minute 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.230
 that's how the reaction of the citizens came to him 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 in the curves particularly 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.580
 ways of driving with pass or yes because 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.210
 it was a phenomenon they want to believe asphalt 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.630
 I can seem like he talked a lot of stupid things 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.910
 and if I speak to you 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.660
 but a lot of these expensive 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.810
 we make 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.200
 fairly prepared 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.340
 except on the side for those that are blocks 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.010
 personal 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.010
 goes to others but in the case of those exceeded the prepared engines 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.530
 if the thing nostra is preparing for is the tutorial to about 20 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.680
 how it looks slowed down 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.020
 manufacturing 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.910
 in that limit not because oddly in 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.910
 among all the readings I was 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 first of all reading are being selected to repair their fear 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
 has found something curious and is that 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 the great majority of authors agree that 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.510
 there is no 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.940
 That demonstrates 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.940
 more 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.630
 if there is nothing that shows more 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 what could be the temperament 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.639
 orcí and temperament 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.059
 the mood at the time of driving 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.089
 their customs 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.449
 the motorcyclist the users of motorcycles and bikes and driving temperament 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.199
 his style 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.609
 -exacto your style if it is a style 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.059
 the mythical cruiser a more sporty style 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.209
 it was followed by tourism 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.979
 whatever, regardless of the moderation class 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.549
 reyna hrl more this 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.889
 it was his way of telling 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.269
 cline seemed curious because 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.179
 since grief can get all of that out 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.269
 but it's true because it's something you get used to at least in my case 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.209
 we have a huge challenge of mobile phones 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.359
 the highway 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.879
 speed limit and know the road that skirts 100 kilometers 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.329
 per hour on the roads 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.329
 thus they are defined as healthy 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.859
 but he also realizes that he 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.339
 it's true my 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.339
 the type of driving has always been a type of driving 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.319
 tourism 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.359
 tourism islands adventure 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.399
 from height or something like that 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.979
 why 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.939
 generally paved roads 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.939
 I do not usually touch the rear brake much 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.229
 and this I do in order to 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.619
 first because they brake you have much more cash than the back 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:44.719
 it was like that and second because the rear wheels of the motorcycle with masks 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.719
 the front 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:53.259
 yes because the front of the rear of the motorcycle are all front 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:54.239
 before 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.239
 if we believe that the front is more gaso flat front rim 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.439
 chávez will arrive with both castañeda nba so many at par 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.439
 but like the back tire the one that already all the work of the attraction 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.799
 hamas and will block is the rear brake even raptors by the earthquake would happen 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.799
 much more than something rear which would indicate a longer term 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.169
 from January 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.909
 long term 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.870
 but as it was assigned it fell into account 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.789
 but if you dare not only touch the rear brake a lot 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.389
 to September when I go with the passenger the chosen to mergers I'm going to show you 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.680
 your subsidiary 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.479
 I found it curious 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.020
 for the theme of ee 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.159
 of custom when both are customary 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.099
 because it is my custom to no longer touch the rear brake without scarcely 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.099
 when you really needed it when today with passengers 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.900
 and for example when he entered he had not scammed 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.949
 one is invented 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.639
 ground usually adopt the motocross attack posture that scatter the 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.300
 stirrups fold hands forward with the population outside a little 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.000
 of leaning aggressive forward to the shark's recent stance 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 We were traveling shark posture or office 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.360
 yes when not my motocross costumes by the way motocross pacts in time 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.599
 from 12 years old until 16 17 something like that more or less 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.060
 but I understand I do not know if your proposal in that sense 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.490
 consequently 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.490
 a few minutes later 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.839
 Yes whatever 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.399
 Ohl realized when it took a meek step to adopt that position of 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:33.210
 shark 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.220
 they did one more than anything with the brake 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.910
 he also sees rear butt and applied very little forward that only g 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.380
 I did not learn motocross because many Huelva people in the center front train is 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.380
 the land that contributes 70% of the property of the land 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.419
 but in the next season 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.270
 yes but how are they the only men g 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.270
 a motorcycle rider and that at least I could tell you 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.530
 now more declared frank a lot in the forward Ghanaian and related 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.869
 I do not usually 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:14.369
 wait until the last moment to ferrer strongly but 

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:17.369
 I prefer to go down in gear to be braked motor 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.180
 yordi bonnet 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.089
 then it is a driving 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:25.099
 the tourism 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.099
 very close they were put by relaxed 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.999
 we said even when composting 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:35.419
 but with motorcyclists use a little more successful and superior 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.999
 to the association for expecting much more to slow down and dance with both brakes 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.580
 fast employer 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.089
 and it is something impossible 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.279
 then I thought when things in habit 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.149
 with consumer funds as well as
