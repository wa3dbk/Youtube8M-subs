the fish all the way in for over 100

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.080 
the fish all the way in for over 100
yards<00:03:04.630> or<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.140> landed<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.740> in<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:05.950> hole<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.610> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
yards or I landed it in a hole in the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.810 
yards or I landed it in a hole in the
margins<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:08.680> there<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:08.980> front<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.340> me<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:09.790> I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
margins just there in front of me so I

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.580 
margins just there in front of me so I
never<00:03:10.030> say<00:03:10.330> never<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.410> most

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
never say never that is the most

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.900 
never say never that is the most
important<00:03:12.130> thing<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.450> really<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:15.280> third<00:03:15.520> one

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
important thing and really the third one

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.790 
important thing and really the third one
I<00:03:18.150> mean<00:03:19.150> there<00:03:19.300> is<00:03:19.420> no<00:03:19.600> third<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.140> there

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
I mean there is no third one there

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.620 
I mean there is no third one there
that's<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> only<00:03:21.430> tool<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:21.790> need<00:03:21.820> you<00:03:22.480> don't

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
that's the only tool you need you don't

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.000 
that's the only tool you need you don't
need<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:23.020> overcomplicate<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
need to overcomplicate it

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.670 
need to overcomplicate it
so<00:03:24.460> basically<00:03:24.880> fish<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.050> waters<00:03:26.380> where<00:03:26.560> the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
so basically fish the waters where the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.450 
so basically fish the waters where the
fish<00:03:26.860> are

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
fish are

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.900 
fish are
Never<00:03:28.090> Say<00:03:28.210> Never<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:29.730> just<00:03:30.730> don't

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
Never Say Never and just don't

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.660 
Never Say Never and just don't
overcomplicate<00:03:31.270> it
