00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.639
 so vampire, so please you have destroyed my brothers and now 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.879
 It's my turn (you) to remember, 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.740
 (I am) no easy prey I do not want to kill you, but I will, 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.050
 If I have to, give me the heart back, then we quit 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.610
 that's all you're here for, that lousy parasite 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.610
 to avenge and demand his stinking heart 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.500
 (you are a right-creating enemy, are not you) 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.280
 I am obviously 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.980
 no, vampire we will finish this, but you will 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.900
 Do not leave this room and now let's put an end to it, I'll 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.809
 mercifully make it as short as Janos did 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.439
 no, this monster has avoided us for too long, 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.200
 it would have been a shame to kill him so fast 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 it is ironic, the great Janos Audron was not at all 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.760
 Challenge, thanks to your help 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.660
 Did you hear his miserable cries when I give him his black heart 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.880
 torn from the ribs 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.560
 I swear to you 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.800
 that's the end of the circle of my story I closed 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.160
 Feeling her twin, the spiritual blade left me 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.280
 and tenderly wound herself around her former self 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.200
 her grip loosened, and as she left me, her absence discouraged me more, 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.560
 when their presence ever did, a foreboding of emptiness and loss 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.910
 came over me and on the border of my consciousness, spread 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.910
 a terrible realization, after all the other opponents were sucked out, 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.520
 The swords turned against me and I realized why I felt nothing 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.040
 when Janos offered me the sword the Reaver (= robber) was never as soul-consuming 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.280
 Weapon forged, the soul-devouring unit that in 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:39.330
 the blade was, was and always was, myself, 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.830
 so the blade broke as Cain tried to kill me 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.610
 the Reaver (= robber) could not devour his own soul 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.130
 this paradox, the blade destroyed my terrible fate was so it 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.460
 this hell cycle, to play for all eternity 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.460
 I could not bear that. Desperation overwhelmed me 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.260
 you 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.960
 Do you enjoy this sight, Cain 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.680
 do not fight it, Raziel beat you 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.440
 Did you have me this fate intended 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.960
 trust me 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.700
 I felt myself weakening and weakening, 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.560
 Unable to hold on longer the Reaver (= robber) simply had too much power 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.699
 and then, 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.600
 a growing sense of dizziness and the familiar shift, 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.530
 the paradoxical moment when my double soul is inside and outside 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.220
 of the Reaver (= robber) 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.259
 on this moment, the glimmer of a time-distortion, 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:16.569
 Cain had hoped all the time that was the edge of the coin, 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:23.569
 the brief flicker of a probability to which Cain had put everything 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.160
 now you are free to claim your true destiny, Raziel 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.280
 behind Kain's eyes I could see new memories bloom and die 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.409
 as history tried to rearrange itself around this blockade 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.460
 and I saw the dawning horror on his face, 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.740
 that maybe we had too much history 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:07.080
 that trying to change my destiny may be a fatal paradox 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.800
 had introduced 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.100
 my god, the hylden 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:25.280
 Raziel, Janos has to stay dead 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.900
 but Kain's warning was lost as I plunged into the realm of spirits, 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:40.819
 too weak to keep my physical shape and there was always the Reaver (= robber) waiting 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:44.439
 on me the spiritual blade, my own soul, 

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:49.839
 Tied to me forever I realized that I was my terrible 

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:55.359
 Destiny would never escape, I just postponed it 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.420
 History abhors a paradox
