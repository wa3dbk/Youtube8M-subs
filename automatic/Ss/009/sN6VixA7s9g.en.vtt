00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.680
 Y 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.170
 Y 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.680
 i 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.680
 ah 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.640
 ah 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.640
 all right 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.950
 Today I 'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:47.480
 little balls on newspaper 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:52.420
 I'm going to grab my sheet of newsprint 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.110
 as I have it in strips and I'm going to cut 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.650
 more or less 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.650
 sights 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.649
 and this thickness 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.560
 and then I'm going to start 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.880
 I have my america tail I'm going to start 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 with the fingers 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.320
 to roll the paper 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.299
 putting together a little ball 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.780
 I do not know if they can see 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.400
 always with strength today putting together the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.800
 small ball 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.800
 and always queuing up 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.960
 I say arming 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.960
 and so I'm twisting 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.480
 and shaping it with my fingers 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.480
 so that it is well rounded 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.880
 I keep putting vinyl because 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.330
 I want my balls to be good 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.330
 hard 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.140
 these balls are used to make 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.950
 any type of work 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.950
 Crafts 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.450
 to make costume jewelery 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.770
 I make hanging mats of a whole 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.140
 little with that 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.140
 They are very nice very hard 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.860
 go to command only with your hands 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.860
 with the fingers 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.940
 I do not know if they can see how it's going 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.390
 but we continue 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.130
 the way they have 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.610
 can make it the size that you 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.610
 want 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.220
 we put tail 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.209
 twisting 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.620
 in the same way we are going 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.930
 going until we reach the end of our 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.010
 sheet and so we continue 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.469
 if we want a bigger ball 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.709
 let's put another piece of paper 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:33.750
 when we get to this point we are going to 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.750
 paste another piece of paper 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.850
 I'm going to do a bit more so that 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.850
 see how 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.360
 everything depends on the size that you 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.830
 need little balls if they want 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:02.670
 smaller balls cut the paper already 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:07.520
 there if they want bigger balls 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.520
 continue to incorporate paper 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:15.480
 and so with our fingers always with 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.480
 vinyl tail we are molding 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.770
 I'm going to leave is the little ball on the side 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.770
 I do not know if they can see it 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.669
 I'm going to put a little aside 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.449
 backwards 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.449
 other bigger balls 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.949
 how are you are I incorporate several 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:48.370
 newspaper strips to make it 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:51.689
 I have also made bigger 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.629
 others of another size more 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:57.509
 it's like the Phrygian before it depends 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:01.499
 the size for the work that you 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:04.169
 need they are hard hard infringed 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:06.989
 so you can paint them you can 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.139
 they decorate with seeds You can 

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:12.419
 produce with glitter for 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.770
 hanging the mat or for any 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.440
 other types of crafts 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:22.030
 I use it in different types of 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:25.509
 crafts are very nice now they 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.569
 I'm going to show you here I have a tool 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.509
 that we call it less does not have 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:35.650
 a tip as supposed a needle but 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:38.800
 This is very hard. I'm doing this with 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.949
 I pinch my balls to be able 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.560
 pass the thread or whatever when 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:49.150
 I have to work to make pendants 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.669
 or bracelets or for any other kind of 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.590
 work that has to pass a thread or 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.880
 a tape or whatever 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.890
 this work 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.620
 they will come very well to all 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.880
 girls who make costume jewelery since they are left 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.040
 very nice 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.790
 and they can be painted and decorated with 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.460
 that you want 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.090
 for my friend Maria Ines who does a lot 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.090
 imitation jewelry 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.009
 for ball balls marÃ­a inÃ©s 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.119
 for you to do 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.119
 beautiful costume jewelery 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:33.980
 and so with force because they are very hard 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:39.190
 let's drill to be able to later 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:43.480
 pass the thread or the inks or what 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.480
 we want to put you 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.210
 and there I will show you 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.410
 and you already have the hole where you 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.510
 can happen if they want to make it a 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:59.610
 little larger or more chiquitos 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.550
