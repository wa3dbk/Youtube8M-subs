00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.680
 after this a qualification then 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:20.510
 you want to stay in yours 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.510
 talent or want to emigrate 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.860
 but I don't let you say how they are 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.570
 things is precisely this is my home 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.750
 it's true 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.520
 no no no venice the thing is almost serious 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.120
 life this is your home 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.530
 but there are some people and some 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.430
 tell us that your home is dirty 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.809
 made it unclean dirty and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.659
 polluted 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.430
 this means that if you stay in 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:59.059
 this land most likely flame 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.059
 the networks 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.210
 the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.630
 miccoli and the united states 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.490
 They are few 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.870
 that i go on sun system 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.610
 to the columella institute this but 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.500
 lately we took the habit of 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.300
 turn to schools let's say it's a 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.530
 physique very well fitted as per 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.229
 part of the schools we find ourselves a lot 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.550
 good because to speak dialect to speak 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.680
 in short, talented better than us 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.450
 let's face it and it's also a time 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.210
 important in history we are 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.950
 convincing the kids to stay here in the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.540
 salento to become landlords a 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.670
 re-evaluate everything over the years 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.380
 previous was destroyed like the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.020
 our history our art ours 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.030
 agronomy and from there that must start again 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.800
 everything and today we are in a school that has 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.470
 precisely that mission 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.420
 in the agri-business sector 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.340
 to convince these guys to form gods 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.650
 groups of companies that give breath 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.390
 in his laurel to no longer be 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.730
 slaves of the emigration of the factory 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.709
 that pay you a pittance 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.720
 be entrepreneurs of themselves at home 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.950
 own resources 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.830
 we must do this must stop 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.690
 let's say this fatalistic attitude 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.690
 we have to go to work in the north 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.120
 all here we have to use it for us 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.670
 themselves and also for those who will come to visit 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.920
 this beautiful land since it is the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.380
 tourism is making a good contribution 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.799
 the other degree must serve 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.850
 to clean to make steep pil e 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.850
 this on the ground 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.160
 this land must then because those 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.770
 politicians and those who 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.990
 check they won't do it to the fullest 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.860
 they will give all this is the mafia not 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.860
 will have to happen 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.650
 you're done a little lower than this 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.400
 earth before everyone today we talk about a 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.950
 return 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.540
 no no i am an olive tree one 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.700
 we pay pity in this land not 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.640
 we are the embassies we vote the earth 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.950
 and all must turn into the earth 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.180
 we don't have to be tourists 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.080
 to be the hosts 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.080
 the House 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.070
 an unusual institute assembly this 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.460
 morning at the institute lends columella 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.110
 guests on the sun system you are before 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.480
 all we care that the assembly of 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.640
 sure i'll do you because the assemblies in 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.540
 that guy stays at his home note 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.640
 sad the assembly a point of life and of 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.890
 self-management of children's education 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.450
 between them therefore it is important that 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.940
 have news is that they work 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.090
 we have already done others 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.130
 assemblies somewhat animated in such a way 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.170
 involve them because it's really bad 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.600
 see the reserve school of the day 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.940
 of the assembly and here and today we have 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.370
 given the opportunity, a system appears 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.290
 which for me are a little bit like 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.840
 that is, we are a fruit 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.320
 of the territory one hundred percent 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.570
 from agriculture to processing 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.060
 of the offer to the tourist 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.040
 we present Salento not to whom 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.170
 comes from outside and they have been in 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.130
 able to present it to the next world 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.270
 appointments 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.850
 we are preparing the new disc 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.860
 prepared in advance almost ready as 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.449
 period we have may 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.370
 let's just say that 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.699
 in other words, tomorrow after the hands 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.020
 week a new single will be released that 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.470
 is not part of our project 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.050
 of the disc but it is a collaboration 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.880
 with salento new guys dj producers 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.860
 salentini that 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.430
 in short they stood out in the field 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.510
 Italian musical underground we have 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.260
 He made a really combo breaks and 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.260
 title imprint 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.019
 for me
