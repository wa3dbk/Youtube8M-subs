00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
whole day in tune and jungle I quickly

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.140 
whole day in tune and jungle I quickly
came<00:00:08.230> to<00:00:08.289> the<00:00:08.530> conclusion<00:00:08.619> that<00:00:09.099> I<00:00:09.339> hated<00:00:09.730> it<00:00:09.999> I

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
came to the conclusion that I hated it I

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.699 
came to the conclusion that I hated it I
wrote<00:00:10.690> up<00:00:10.839> a<00:00:10.900> video<00:00:11.110> script<00:00:11.499> that<00:00:11.650> was

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
wrote up a video script that was

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.529 
wrote up a video script that was
basically<00:00:11.949> nothing<00:00:12.610> more<00:00:12.820> than<00:00:12.969> seething

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:13.539 
basically nothing more than seething

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.720 
basically nothing more than seething
anger<00:00:13.719> and<00:00:14.079> venom<00:00:14.379> and<00:00:14.559> even<00:00:15.219> went<00:00:15.369> so<00:00:15.519> far<00:00:15.549> as

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
anger and venom and even went so far as

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.030 
anger and venom and even went so far as
to<00:00:15.820> record<00:00:16.270> it<00:00:16.450> but<00:00:17.080> then<00:00:17.200> I<00:00:17.290> decided<00:00:17.590> to<00:00:17.800> scrap

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
to record it but then I decided to scrap

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.860 
to record it but then I decided to scrap
that<00:00:18.100> work<00:00:18.460> entirely<00:00:18.820> I<00:00:19.210> thought<00:00:19.720> it<00:00:19.810> would

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 
that work entirely I thought it would

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.510 
that work entirely I thought it would
better<00:00:20.050> serve<00:00:20.320> my<00:00:20.560> channel<00:00:20.950> if<00:00:21.040> I<00:00:21.100> took<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.310> more

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
better serve my channel if I took a more

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.340 
better serve my channel if I took a more
constructive<00:00:21.820> approach<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:23.110> on<00:00:23.260> the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
constructive approach to on the

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.650 
constructive approach to on the
new<00:00:23.470> content<00:00:23.980> I<00:00:24.130> want<00:00:24.700> to<00:00:24.790> dissect<00:00:24.970> it<00:00:25.360> piece

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
new content I want to dissect it piece

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.720 
new content I want to dissect it piece
by<00:00:25.690> piece<00:00:25.870> and<00:00:26.350> discuss<00:00:26.800> why<00:00:27.100> I<00:00:27.130> think<00:00:27.610> its

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730

of<00:00:53.649> our<00:00:53.800> new<00:00:53.949> map<00:00:54.190> I'm<00:00:54.670> going<00:00:54.909> to<00:00:55.059> approach

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
of our new map I'm going to approach

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.090 
of our new map I'm going to approach
this<00:00:55.569> by<00:00:55.780> making<00:00:55.929> a<00:00:56.199> series<00:00:56.649> of<00:00:56.679> short<00:00:57.039> videos

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
this by making a series of short videos

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.489 
this by making a series of short videos
where<00:00:57.609> I<00:00:57.639> can<00:00:57.789> focus<00:00:57.999> on<00:00:58.269> one<00:00:58.539> topic<00:00:58.809> per<00:00:59.199> video

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
where I can focus on one topic per video

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:01.680 
where I can focus on one topic per video
and<00:00:59.920> there's<00:01:00.609> no<00:01:00.879> rush<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.239> complete<00:01:01.359> this
