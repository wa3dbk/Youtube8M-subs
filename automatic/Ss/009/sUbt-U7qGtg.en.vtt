video we're going to be talking about a
simple<00:00:06.509> fix<00:00:06.870> for<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> problem<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.799> many<00:00:08.010> Mac

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
simple fix for a problem that many Mac

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.450 
simple fix for a problem that many Mac
owners<00:00:08.940> have<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.500> when<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.960> USB

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
owners have and that is when a USB

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.189 
owners have and that is when a USB
external<00:00:14.460> hard<00:00:14.700> drive<00:00:15.030> or<00:00:15.420> maybe<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.929> flash

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
external hard drive or maybe a flash

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.260 
external hard drive or maybe a flash
drive<00:00:16.440> doesn't<00:00:16.890> work<00:00:17.220> properly<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:18.060> their

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
drive doesn't work properly with their

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.240 
drive doesn't work properly with their
Mac<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:19.199> let<00:00:19.289> me<00:00:19.380> give<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.590> an<00:00:19.710> example<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
Mac so let me give you an example of

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.609 
Mac so let me give you an example of
that<00:00:20.430> we'll<00:00:21.420> go<00:00:21.600> ahead<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.869> open<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
that we'll go ahead and open up this

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.189 
that we'll go ahead and open up this
external<00:00:23.130> hard<00:00:23.310> drive<00:00:23.550> here<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.019> see

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
external hard drive here and you can see

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.279 
external hard drive here and you can see
it<00:00:25.320> doesn't<00:00:25.529> look<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:26.340> normal<00:00:26.670> finder<00:00:27.449> if<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
it doesn't look like normal finder if I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.040 
it doesn't look like normal finder if I
had<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> folder<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.550> could<00:00:29.970> copy<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
had a folder in this I could copy it and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.459 
had a folder in this I could copy it and
I<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:32.040> put<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.820> back<00:00:32.969> down<00:00:33.270> into<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.809> Mac<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> can

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
I can put it back down into my Mac I can

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.830 
I can put it back down into my Mac I can
drag<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.430> let's<00:00:36.270> say<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> want<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> put

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
drag it but then let's say I want to put

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.950 
drag it but then let's say I want to put
this<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:38.430> won't<00:00:38.850> work<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.070> let's

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
this on it it won't work at all so let's

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.279 
this on it it won't work at all so let's
let's<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.200> why<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.219> occurs<00:00:44.910> let's<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.750> into

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
let's see why that occurs let's go into

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.090 
let's see why that occurs let's go into
get<00:00:46.649> info<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.969> over<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.840> have

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
get info and right over here we have

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.880 
get info and right over here we have
Windows<00:00:50.100> NT<00:00:50.449> file<00:00:51.449> system<00:00:52.020> under<00:00:52.260> format<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
Windows NT file system under format and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.720 
Windows NT file system under format and
that<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.789> main<00:00:53.969> problem<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.449> many<00:00:55.730> hard

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that is the main problem for many hard

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
that is the main problem for many hard
drives<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.390> come<00:00:57.690> originally<00:00:58.379> formatted<00:00:58.949> in

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
drives they come originally formatted in

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.240 
drives they come originally formatted in
NTFS<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> won't<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:01.379> work<00:01:01.530> properly

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
NTFS so it won't really work properly

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.509 
NTFS so it won't really work properly
and<00:01:02.930> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> go<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.379> here<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.619> sharing<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and if you go down here to sharing and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.179 
and if you go down here to sharing and
permissions<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.659> only<00:01:07.080> read<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:07.979> why

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
permissions you can only read that's why

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.820 
permissions you can only read that's why
you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.640> grab<00:01:09.240> files<00:01:09.540> off<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.140> hard<00:01:10.530> drive

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can grab files off of the hard drive

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.510 
you can grab files off of the hard drive
but<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.340> put<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.049> again<00:01:13.520> so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
but not put them back on it again so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.719 
but not put them back on it again so
let's<00:01:14.700> go<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.350> fix<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.590> problem<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:17.490> into

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
let's go to fix this problem go into

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.240 
let's go to fix this problem go into
applications<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.350> into<00:01:19.500> utilities

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
applications and now go into utilities

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
applications and now go into utilities
and<00:01:20.520> go<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> Disk<00:01:21.509> Utility<00:01:24.140> ok<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.290> once<00:01:25.470> Disk

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and go to Disk Utility ok now once Disk

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.120 
and go to Disk Utility ok now once Disk
Utility<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.369> loaded<00:01:26.759> hit<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.990> hard<00:01:28.799> drive

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
Utility is loaded hit the hard drive

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.020 
Utility is loaded hit the hard drive
that<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.329> problem<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.280> go<00:01:32.280> over<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> erase

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that is the problem and go over to erase

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
that is the problem and go over to erase
and<00:01:34.070> now<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.460> format<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.240> where<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.110> going

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
and now the format is where it's going

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.980 
and now the format is where it's going
to<00:01:38.340> matter

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
to matter

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.219 
to matter
so<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.619> Macs<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
so if you have Macs and you just want it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.609 
so if you have Macs and you just want it
to<00:01:43.320> work<00:01:43.439> for<00:01:43.500> Mac<00:01:43.860> click<00:01:44.340> Mac<00:01:44.790> OS<00:01:45.299> extended

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
to work for Mac click Mac OS extended

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.050 
to work for Mac click Mac OS extended
but<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> want<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> work<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.490> both<00:01:47.700> Mac

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
but if you want it to work with both Mac

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.289 
but if you want it to work with both Mac
and<00:01:48.140> PC<00:01:49.520> do<00:01:50.520> ms-dos<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.530> another<00:01:52.770> file

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
and PC do ms-dos it's another file

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.889 
and PC do ms-dos it's another file
system<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> works

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
system but it works

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.440 
system but it works
it's<00:01:55.649> cross-platform<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.149> work<00:01:57.270> with

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's cross-platform so it can work with

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.830 
it's cross-platform so it can work with
both<00:01:57.630> Mac<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.460> PC<00:01:59.460> just<00:02:00.149> give<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> name<00:02:00.570> I'll

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
both Mac and PC just give it a name I'll

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.899 
both Mac and PC just give it a name I'll
call<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.969> disc<00:02:02.969> 1<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.740> click<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.979> race<00:02:05.250> now

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
call it disc 1 and click you race now

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.219 
call it disc 1 and click you race now
the<00:02:05.969> big<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.270> about<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.200> will

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the big thing about this is it will

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.010 
the big thing about this is it will
reformat<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.580> hard<00:02:08.610> drive<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
reformat the hard drive so all of the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.559 
reformat the hard drive so all of the
data<00:02:10.200> that's<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.610> hard<00:02:11.849> drive<00:02:12.090> will<00:02:12.360> be

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
