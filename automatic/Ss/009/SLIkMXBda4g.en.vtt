 Let's go to the animal fair. 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090
 on the screens in the order of the daily 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.820
 in fact her mother is acting here as a duty my work already 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.850
 started when I was a child that there are animals collected from the street 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.010
 and when to give the dora animals then 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.920
 I think our music had brought him that he could not be seen pet shops 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.870
 what was 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.700
 ohio's main action is to make people aware of the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.130
 responsible for the importance of castration of the animals for what 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.130
 do not have this amount of animals abandoned in the streets 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:18.689
 we see with animals eyes of the vaccine, vermifugado epoch puts itself to 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:19.509
 Donation 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.210
 the puppies that you can see here are several fronts 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.100
 So 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.590
 The importance and awareness of each piece goes to every bead bichinha she has 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.500
 that to sign a term of adhesion of her will be responsible for that animal 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.329
 here has a life of 10 to 15 years 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.329
 so it's important she knows it's in this period 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.540
 she will have to take care of food is based on the breed is medically expressed 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.159

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.659
 then we try to make you aware of what animal you can not eat right? 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.489
