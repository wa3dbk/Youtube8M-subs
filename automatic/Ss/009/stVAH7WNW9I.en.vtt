where<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.650> think<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.280> let<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.730> soak<00:03:47.030> down

where I think it really let it soak down

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.699 
where I think it really let it soak down
it<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.650> qualitative<00:03:49.550> of<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.330> prince<00:03:51.050> so

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
it is the qualitative of the prince so

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.979 
it is the qualitative of the prince so
