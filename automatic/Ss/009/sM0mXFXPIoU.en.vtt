play<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.980> ascending<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.850> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
play it ascending it's just a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389 
play it ascending it's just a
straight-ahead<00:00:33.710> scale<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:35.010> some<00:00:35.190> notes

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
straight-ahead scale with some notes

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.560 
straight-ahead scale with some notes
missed<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:40.640> okay<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> shame<00:00:42.300> once

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
okay so I'll show you the patterns we've

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.790 
okay so I'll show you the patterns we've
got<00:00:49.360> six<00:00:49.630> notes<00:00:49.900> on<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.170> botany<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.680> a

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
got six notes on the botany and a

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.650 
got six notes on the botany and a
strings<00:00:53.940> okay<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.270> that's<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.690> first<00:00:55.720> shape

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
strings okay so that's the first shape

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.549 
strings okay so that's the first shape
and<00:00:58.660> we<00:00:58.750> literally<00:00:59.080> move<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.710> up<00:00:59.860> an<00:01:00.010> octave

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and we literally move that up an octave

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.430 
and we literally move that up an octave
and<00:01:02.559> do<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.830> same<00:01:03.040> thing<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:05.080> actually

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
and do the same thing for actually

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.910 
and do the same thing for actually
missing<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.830> seventh<00:01:06.340> outer<00:01:06.550> scale<00:01:06.970> so

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.490

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
okay then we skip up to the 15th fret of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.500 
okay then we skip up to the 15th fret of
the<00:01:12.530> B<00:01:12.710> string<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.159> we<00:01:13.250> played<00:01:16.390> okay<00:01:17.390> we<00:01:17.479> just

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
the B string and we played okay we just

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:25.510 
the B string and we played okay we just
got<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.810> passing<00:01:18.260> no<00:01:18.409> here<00:01:23.380> okay<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.250> picking

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520

economy picking so I'm going down okay
what<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:47.899> usually<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.560> do<00:01:48.710> with<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.130> is

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
what I usually like to do with that is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.570 
what I usually like to do with that is
to<00:01:49.460> build<00:01:49.640> up<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.060> speed<00:01:50.330> with<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.690> and<00:01:50.840> also

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
to build up the speed with it and also

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.660 
to build up the speed with it and also
stop<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:53.470> by<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.530> end<00:01:54.740> make<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.220> sound<00:01:55.399> quite

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
stop and by the end make it sound quite

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.090 
stop and by the end make it sound quite
aggressive<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:56.690> you<00:01:57.320> know<00:01:57.380> dynamically

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
aggressive so you know dynamically

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.919 
aggressive so you know dynamically
there's<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.340> nice<00:01:58.520> wide<00:01:58.850> range<00:01:59.149> there<00:01:59.509> it's<00:01:59.780> got

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
there's a nice wide range there it's got

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.350 
there's a nice wide range there it's got
that<00:02:00.050> kind<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:00.289> snappy<00:02:00.860> sound<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:02.090> which<00:02:02.240> I

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
that kind of snappy sound to it which I

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.920 
that kind of snappy sound to it which I
really<00:02:02.630> love<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.229> just<00:02:03.410> do<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.619> slowly<00:02:03.860> again

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.570 

okay<00:02:10.930> then<00:02:11.500> we're<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.860> descend<00:02:12.250> with<00:02:12.550> a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
okay then we're going to descend with a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.500 
okay then we're going to descend with a
series<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.000> staccato<00:02:13.540> notes<00:02:14.610> from<00:02:15.610> an<00:02:16.000> E<00:02:16.360> minor

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
series of staccato notes from an E minor

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.770 
series of staccato notes from an E minor
arpeggio<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> start<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
arpeggio so this is the start of the the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.870 
arpeggio so this is the start of the the
is<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.740> last<00:02:20.920> note<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.430> scale<00:02:21.670> that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
is it the last note in that scale that

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.770 
is it the last note in that scale that
start<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.390> next<00:02:22.630> sequence<00:02:27.240> third<00:02:28.240> slightly

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
start the next sequence third slightly

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.850 
start the next sequence third slightly
Sharma's<00:02:29.580> so

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:43.120 

we'll<00:02:35.370> lock<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.880> part<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:36.630> far

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130

okay<00:02:44.130> kill<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.520> next<00:02:44.880> part<00:02:45.090> we'll<00:02:45.270> get<00:02:45.390> this

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
okay kill it next part we'll get this

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.320 
okay kill it next part we'll get this

to play a little flurry with the
diminished<00:03:39.379> seventh<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:39.980> at<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.159> top

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
diminished seventh as you at the top

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:47.260 
diminished seventh as you at the top
okay

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.729 

so<00:03:48.270> simply<00:03:49.050> enough<00:03:49.230> then<00:03:49.440> we're<00:03:49.560> going<00:03:49.680> to

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
so simply enough then we're going to

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.309 
so simply enough then we're going to
shift<00:03:49.890> up<00:03:50.129> here<00:03:50.819> to<00:03:51.120> roll<00:03:51.599> back<00:03:51.720> into<00:03:51.900> E<00:03:51.989> minor

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
shift up here to roll back into E minor

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.520 
shift up here to roll back into E minor
and<00:03:52.950> on<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.910> tab<00:03:54.150> off<00:03:54.330> notated<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.080> is<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.200> grace

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
and on the tab off notated it is a grace

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.240 
and on the tab off notated it is a grace
three<00:03:55.890> grace<00:03:56.220> note<00:03:57.650> it's<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.769> lot<00:03:58.890> easier<00:03:59.040> to

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
three grace note it's a lot easier to

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.290 
three grace note it's a lot easier to
know<00:03:59.459> tell<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.879> way

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
know tell you that way

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.250 
know tell you that way
so<00:04:01.050> we<00:04:01.200> slam<00:04:01.530> those<00:04:01.860> in<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.930> we're<00:04:04.050> going<00:04:04.170> to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
so we slam those in and we're going to

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.500 
so we slam those in and we're going to
tap<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.590> fret<00:04:04.830> 24<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.730> dummy

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.190 

okay<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.569> then<00:04:10.019> we<00:04:10.110> get<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.590> pattern

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
okay so then we get it to this pattern

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.710 
okay so then we get it to this pattern
just<00:04:13.200> just<00:04:13.700> so<00:04:14.700> don't<00:04:14.940> forget<00:04:15.209> make<00:04:15.390> sure<00:04:15.569> you

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
just just so don't forget make sure you

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.289 
just just so don't forget make sure you
play<00:04:15.900> these<00:04:16.109> left-hand<00:04:16.889> hammers<00:04:17.220> only<00:04:19.100> okay

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
play these left-hand hammers only okay

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:28.180 
play these left-hand hammers only okay
so<00:04:22.520> that's<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.669> first<00:04:23.700> pattern<00:04:25.850> so<00:04:26.850> that's<00:04:27.090> 24

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
so that's the first pattern so that's 24

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.000 
so that's the first pattern so that's 24
1915<00:04:29.190> half<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:30.600> will<00:04:30.750> have<00:04:30.870> no<00:04:31.020> 14<00:04:31.590> 17<00:04:32.310> 24

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
1915 half but that will have no 14 17 24

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.050 
1915 half but that will have no 14 17 24
okay<00:04:35.010> so<00:04:35.070> it's

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
okay so it's

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.800 
okay so it's
I'm<00:04:38.060> going<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.330> continue<00:04:38.840> 12<00:04:39.320> 15<00:04:39.950> 20<00:04:40.250> 4<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:42.190> 10

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
I'm going to continue 12 15 20 4 of 10

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:54.520 
I'm going to continue 12 15 20 4 of 10
14:24<00:04:46.330> then<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:47.450> goes<00:04:47.650> 912<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:51.220> 812<00:04:52.480> and<00:04:53.530> then

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
14:24 then it goes 912 of 812 and then

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.260 
14:24 then it goes 912 of 812 and then
finally<00:04:55.270> 7<00:04:56.710> 1224<00:04:57.710> pull<00:04:58.520> off<00:04:58.670> well<00:04:59.030> then<00:04:59.120> we're

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
finally 7 1224 pull off well then we're

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.620 
finally 7 1224 pull off well then we're
gonna<00:04:59.360> hammer<00:04:59.570> from<00:04:59.780> nowhere<00:05:00.230> 7<00:05:00.830> 8

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
gonna hammer from nowhere 7 8

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.310 
gonna hammer from nowhere 7 8
and<00:05:04.260> then<00:05:04.380> pull<00:05:04.620> off<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:05.540> 789<00:05:06.800> then<00:05:07.800> pull<00:05:08.100> up<00:05:08.130> to

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
and then pull off to 789 then pull up to
