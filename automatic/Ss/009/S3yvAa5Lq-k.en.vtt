00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
clock so clicking a gear and let that

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.670 
clock so clicking a gear and let that
thing<00:02:10.110> fall<00:02:10.580> now<00:02:11.580> when<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.760> hits<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.000> bottom

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
thing fall now when it hits the bottom

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.740 
thing fall now when it hits the bottom
you<00:02:13.680> want<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.980> look<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.280> this

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.420 

just<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.960> little<00:02:18.590> bit<00:02:18.710> of<00:02:18.800> milder<00:02:19.070> school<00:02:19.280> I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
just a little bit of milder school I

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.430 
just a little bit of milder school I
mean<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.640> pool<00:02:19.910> might<00:02:20.090> turn<00:02:20.300> maybe<00:02:20.570> two<00:02:21.410> or

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
mean this pool might turn maybe two or

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.900 
mean this pool might turn maybe two or
three<00:02:21.530> times<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.070> bringing<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.550> little<00:02:22.670> bit

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
three times just bringing a little bit

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.260 
three times just bringing a little bit
of<00:02:23.180> line<00:02:23.480> above<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> school<00:02:24.970> if<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.030> actually

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
of line above the school if you actually

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.620 
of line above the school if you actually
drop<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.890> get<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.070> down<00:02:28.220> there<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:29.360> looks

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
drop it and get it down there it looks

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.850 
drop it and get it down there it looks
like<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:32.020> it's<00:02:33.020> pretty<00:02:33.350> much<00:02:33.500> almost<00:02:33.710> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
like this it's pretty much almost a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.220 
like this it's pretty much almost a
backlash<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.520> have<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.760> set<00:02:35.170> way<00:02:36.170> too

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
backlash and you have it set way too

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.970 
backlash and you have it set way too
light<00:02:36.530> for<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.340> wait<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:37.610> fishing<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.260> mean

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
light for the wait you fishing so I mean

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.940 
light for the wait you fishing so I mean
this<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.250> base<00:02:40.490> but<00:02:41.210> that<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:42.500> have<00:02:42.620> focused

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
this is a base but that you have focused

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.710 
this is a base but that you have focused
on<00:02:43.040> school<00:02:43.310> attention<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:43.970> just<00:02:44.330> anti

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
on school attention not just anti

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.570 
on school attention not just anti
backlash<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.410> putting<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.770> from<00:02:45.950> one<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.370> ten

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
backlash and putting it from one to ten

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.890 
backlash and putting it from one to ten
and<00:02:46.610> thinking<00:02:47.150> that's<00:02:47.240> going<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.540> solve<00:02:47.690> it

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
and thinking that's going to solve it

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.710 
and thinking that's going to solve it
get<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.740> weight<00:02:48.980> down<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.520> get<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.570> when

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
get that weight down and get it so when

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.540 
get that weight down and get it so when
it<00:02:50.840> hits<00:02:51.020> after<00:02:51.350> free<00:02:51.890> schooling<00:02:52.220> from<00:02:52.340> like<00:02:52.520> a

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
it hits after free schooling from like a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.670 
it hits after free schooling from like a
two<00:02:52.730> o'clock<00:02:52.820> position<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:54.110> overalls<00:02:54.560> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
two o'clock position just overalls a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.740 
two o'clock position just overalls a
little<00:02:54.860> bit<00:02:55.330> that's<00:02:56.330> where<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.570> it

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
little bit that's where you have it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.770 
little bit that's where you have it
properly<00:02:57.140> set<00:02:57.350> up<00:02:57.430> now<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:59.209> get<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.450> why<00:02:59.570> i<00:02:59.600> put

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
properly set up now we get to why i put

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.350 
properly set up now we get to why i put
at<00:02:59.930> seven<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.500> put<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.220> 7<00:03:01.520> because<00:03:01.640> that's<00:03:02.060> that's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
at seven I put a 7 because that's that's

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.270 
at seven I put a 7 because that's that's
a<00:03:02.450> good<00:03:02.570> place<00:03:02.750> start<00:03:03.050> at<00:03:03.830> least<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.190> I've

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
a good place start at least that I've

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.890 
a good place start at least that I've
always<00:03:04.400> put<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.700> there<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:05.120> helps<00:03:05.330> me<00:03:05.360> Cass<00:03:05.630> I

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
always put it there it helps me Cass I

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.980 
always put it there it helps me Cass I
can<00:03:05.990> cast<00:03:06.140> in<00:03:06.320> almost<00:03:06.470> any<00:03:06.680> situation<00:03:07.360> but<00:03:08.360> if

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
can cast in almost any situation but if

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.270 
can cast in almost any situation but if
maybe<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.410> wind<00:03:09.560> picks<00:03:09.770> up<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:09.950> I'm<00:03:10.100> casting

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
maybe the wind picks up and I'm casting

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.460 
maybe the wind picks up and I'm casting
into<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.090> click<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.930> up<00:03:11.990> to<00:03:12.110> eight<00:03:12.200> or<00:03:12.320> nine

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
into it and click it up to eight or nine

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.250 
into it and click it up to eight or nine
and<00:03:13.280> be<00:03:13.430> able<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.640> cast<00:03:13.820> pretty<00:03:14.150> much<00:03:14.270> backlash

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
and be able to cast pretty much backlash

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.130 
and be able to cast pretty much backlash
free<00:03:15.650> I'm<00:03:16.459> casting<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.150> wind<00:03:17.330> I<00:03:17.660> can

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
free I'm casting with the wind I can

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.560 
free I'm casting with the wind I can
turn<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.290> down<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.709> six<00:03:19.250> or<00:03:19.400> five<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:20.300> with

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
turn it down the six or five and with

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.240 
turn it down the six or five and with
the<00:03:20.630> same<00:03:20.750> spool<00:03:21.050> tension<00:03:21.230> on<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> same<00:03:21.769> way<00:03:21.950> I

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
the same spool tension on the same way I

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.699 
the same spool tension on the same way I
can<00:03:22.850> cast<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.150> even<00:03:23.330> further<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.810> not<00:03:24.560> have

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
can cast it even further and not have

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.640 
can cast it even further and not have
backlashes<00:03:25.420> so<00:03:26.420> trust<00:03:26.630> me<00:03:26.720> this<00:03:27.230> is<00:03:27.380> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
backlashes so trust me this is the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.229 
backlashes so trust me this is the
proper<00:03:28.160> way<00:03:28.280> like<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:28.580> said<00:03:28.730> I've<00:03:28.820> helped<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.120> lot

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
proper way like I said I've helped a lot

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.340 
proper way like I said I've helped a lot
of<00:03:29.300> people<00:03:29.390> set<00:03:29.750> up<00:03:29.959> so<00:03:30.200> we<00:03:30.230> have<00:03:30.410> boy<00:03:30.590> set<00:03:30.920> up

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
of people set up so we have boy set up

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.080 
of people set up so we have boy set up
don't<00:03:33.350> just<00:03:33.500> think<00:03:33.830> about<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.310> configural<00:03:34.880> or

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
don't just think about the configural or

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.259 
don't just think about the configural or
the<00:03:35.180> magnetic<00:03:35.769> spool<00:03:36.769> tension<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:38.060> have<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
the magnetic spool tension you have to

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.580 
the magnetic spool tension you have to
make<00:03:38.360> sure<00:03:38.600> that<00:03:38.870> like<00:03:39.050> I<00:03:39.110> said<00:03:39.290> when<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.470> have

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
make sure that like I said when you have

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.500 
make sure that like I said when you have
it<00:03:39.709> there<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.040> drops<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:41.510> looks<00:03:41.690> like<00:03:41.840> this

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.600 

and<00:03:45.900> not<00:03:46.349> this<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:50.390> hope<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.540> helps<00:03:52.610> until

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
and not this I hope this helps until

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.849 
and not this I hope this helps until
next<00:03:53.700> time
