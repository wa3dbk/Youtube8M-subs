video<00:00:00.329> is<00:00:00.599> about<00:00:00.840> some<00:00:01.140> of<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.290> different

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
video is about some of the different

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.830 
video is about some of the different
camshafts<00:00:02.280> that<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.580> made<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:03.149> various

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
camshafts that I made for various

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.930 
camshafts that I made for various
different<00:00:04.230> engines<00:00:04.560> here<00:00:05.460> we're<00:00:05.580> looking<00:00:05.850> at

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
different engines here we're looking at

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.000 
different engines here we're looking at
a<00:00:05.970> stock<00:00:06.420> lawnmower<00:00:07.200> camshaft<00:00:09.620> it<00:00:10.620> would<00:00:10.800> have

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
a stock lawnmower camshaft it would have

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.480 
a stock lawnmower camshaft it would have
approximately<00:00:11.910> I'm<00:00:12.690> guessing<00:00:13.230> 240<00:00:14.160> degrees

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
approximately I'm guessing 240 degrees

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.450 
approximately I'm guessing 240 degrees
of<00:00:14.700> duration<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.990> lift<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> valve<00:00:20.420> this<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
of duration to lift the valve this the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:30.750 
of duration to lift the valve this the
intake<00:00:23.460> lobe<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.320> exhaust<00:00:25.320> lobe

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.210 

this<00:00:31.760> one's<00:00:32.059> somewhat<00:00:32.480> different<00:00:33.040> this<00:00:34.040> is

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
this one's somewhat different this is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.750 
this one's somewhat different this is
one<00:00:34.399> from<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:36.040> supercharged<00:00:37.040> engine<00:00:37.489> that<00:00:37.640> I

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
one from a supercharged engine that I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.299 
one from a supercharged engine that I
use<00:00:38.030> this<00:00:38.570> is<00:00:38.629> actually<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.440> supercharger

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
use this is actually the supercharger

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.439 
use this is actually the supercharger
and<00:00:41.020> in<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:42.230> there's<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.190> valve<00:00:43.520> open<00:00:44.120> at<00:00:44.390> all

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
and in it there's a valve open at all

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.880 
and in it there's a valve open at all
times<00:00:45.489> so<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:46.970> have<00:00:47.120> your<00:00:47.269> intake<00:00:47.720> lobes<00:00:48.530> here

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
times so you have your intake lobes here

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.829 
times so you have your intake lobes here
and<00:00:49.040> here<00:00:49.400> and<00:00:49.720> then<00:00:52.540> exhaust<00:00:53.540> lobes<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:56.720> when

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
and here and then exhaust lobes so when

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.960 
and here and then exhaust lobes so when
you<00:00:56.930> look<00:00:57.079> at<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.350> from<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.620> end<00:00:57.800> you<00:00:58.610> see<00:00:58.820> that

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
you look at it from the end you see that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.550 
you look at it from the end you see that
there's<00:00:59.239> always<00:00:59.720> a<00:01:00.460> valve<00:01:01.460> open<00:01:03.040> because

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
there's always a valve open because

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.260 
there's always a valve open because
supercharger<00:01:06.560> sucks<00:01:06.830> air<00:01:07.070> in<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:07.909> opens<00:01:08.210> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
supercharger sucks air in then opens the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.020 
supercharger sucks air in then opens the
exhaust<00:01:08.630> valve<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.170> compresses<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.920> out<00:01:10.070> and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
exhaust valve and compresses it out and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.120 
exhaust valve and compresses it out and
then<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:11.450> repeats<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.200> next<00:01:12.470> cycle<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:12.920> same

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
then it repeats the next cycle the same

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.210 
then it repeats the next cycle the same
thing<00:01:13.369> over<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.000> over<00:01:14.920> basically<00:01:15.920> an<00:01:16.100> air

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
thing over and over basically an air

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.260 
thing over and over basically an air
pump

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.249 

now<00:01:22.810> here<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.530> strange<00:01:23.979> one<00:01:24.220> it's<00:01:25.180> out<00:01:26.049> of

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
now here is a strange one it's out of

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.690 
now here is a strange one it's out of
the<00:01:26.409> mono<00:01:26.680> soup

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
the mono soup

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.280 
the mono soup
it<00:01:28.570> has<00:01:28.840> about<00:01:29.700> 370<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.820> 380<00:01:31.570> degrees<00:01:31.869> of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
it has about 370 to 380 degrees of

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
it has about 370 to 380 degrees of
duration<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:34.030> why<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.299> lobes<00:01:35.140> are<00:01:35.409> so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
duration that's why the lobes are so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.469 
duration that's why the lobes are so
large<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:38.439> far<00:01:38.740> as<00:01:38.890> circular<00:01:39.580> size<00:01:39.880> they<00:01:40.180> start

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
large as far as circular size they start

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.370 
large as far as circular size they start
over<00:01:41.080> here<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.500> go<00:01:41.619> all<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.920> way<00:01:41.950> around<00:01:43.380> here

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
over here and go all the way around here

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.219 
over here and go all the way around here
and<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:47.200> this<00:01:47.950> engine<00:01:48.189> both<00:01:48.610> valves<00:01:48.970> are

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and on this engine both valves are

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:59.539 
and on this engine both valves are
exhaust<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.659> both<00:01:52.869> lobes<00:01:53.170> are<00:01:53.470> timed<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.130> same

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.039 

let<00:02:00.549> me<00:02:00.610> get<00:02:00.789> into<00:02:01.000> some<00:02:01.179> other<00:02:01.330> strange<00:02:01.690> ones

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
let me get into some other strange ones

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.550 
let me get into some other strange ones
this<00:02:02.649> one<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.720> Uniflow

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
this one is out of the Uniflow

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.240 
this one is out of the Uniflow
two-stroke<00:02:06.929> so<00:02:07.929> it<00:02:08.080> has<00:02:08.229> lobes<00:02:08.590> each<00:02:08.950> side

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
two-stroke so it has lobes each side

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.539 
two-stroke so it has lobes each side
that<00:02:09.280> are<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.060> same<00:02:10.330> shape<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.840> again<00:02:11.549> just

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
that are the same shape and again just

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.800 
that are the same shape and again just
like<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.819> mono<00:02:13.620> both<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.860> these<00:02:15.630> both<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
like the mono both of these both the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.770 
like the mono both of these both the
valves<00:02:17.170> are<00:02:17.380> exhaust<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.850> they're<00:02:19.120> they're

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
valves are exhaust so they're they're

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.460 
valves are exhaust so they're they're
timed<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.380> same<00:02:20.650> now<00:02:21.310> if<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.580> notice<00:02:22.470> there

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
timed the same now if you notice there

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.979 
timed the same now if you notice there
isn't<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.860> whole<00:02:24.040> lot<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.280> lift<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.840> it

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
isn't a whole lot of lift on this and it

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.259 
isn't a whole lot of lift on this and it
has<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.350> do<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.769> timing<00:02:27.220> with<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.060> being

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
has to do with the timing with it being

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.900 
has to do with the timing with it being
a<00:02:28.359> two-stroke<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.459> wasn't<00:02:30.459> getting<00:02:30.700> enough

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
a two-stroke I wasn't getting enough

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.940 
a two-stroke I wasn't getting enough
lift<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.600> engine<00:02:31.900> didn't<00:02:32.079> wanna<00:02:32.230> run<00:02:32.709> very

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
lift to the engine didn't wanna run very

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.849 
lift to the engine didn't wanna run very
well<00:02:33.220> couldn't<00:02:33.700> get<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.820> exhaust<00:02:34.209> out<00:02:34.859> so

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
well couldn't get the exhaust out so

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:41.970 
well couldn't get the exhaust out so
instead<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.549> this<00:02:36.820> cam<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:40.500> went<00:02:41.500> with<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> full

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
instead of this cam I went with a full

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.580 
instead of this cam I went with a full
speed<00:02:42.280> camshaft<00:02:42.989> i'll<00:02:43.989> show<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.350> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
speed camshaft i'll show you the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.560 
speed camshaft i'll show you the
difference<00:02:44.739> in<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.250> timing<00:02:45.730> gear<00:02:45.760> sizes<00:02:48.570> this

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
difference in the timing gear sizes this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.770 
difference in the timing gear sizes this
one<00:02:49.630> here<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.079> regular<00:02:50.350> timing<00:02:51.250> gear<00:02:51.780> and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
one here is a regular timing gear and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.479 
one here is a regular timing gear and
this<00:02:53.079> one's<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.709> same<00:02:53.890> size<00:02:54.130> as<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
this one's the same size as the

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.690 
this one's the same size as the
crankshaft<00:02:54.819> here<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.620> threw<00:02:57.579> an

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
crankshaft here so that it threw an

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.940 
crankshaft here so that it threw an
idler<00:02:57.970> gear<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.959> runs<00:02:59.850> that<00:03:00.850> crankshaft<00:03:01.359> speed

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
idler gear it runs that crankshaft speed

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.250 
idler gear it runs that crankshaft speed
so<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.130> lets<00:03:03.340> me<00:03:03.489> use<00:03:03.730> basically<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.799> stock

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
so that lets me use basically a stock

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.979 
so that lets me use basically a stock
stock<00:03:08.260> low<00:03:08.680> profile<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.480> get<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> lot<00:03:10.959> more

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
stock low profile so you get a lot more

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.930 
stock low profile so you get a lot more
lift<00:03:11.470> out<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.370> valve

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.550 

now<00:03:16.940> very<00:03:17.180> good<00:03:17.360> welding<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:17.900> these<00:03:18.110> valves

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
now very good welding on these valves

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.250 
now very good welding on these valves
but<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:23.030> anyways<00:03:23.500> that's<00:03:24.500> my<00:03:24.770> selection<00:03:25.400> of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
but so anyways that's my selection of

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.740 
but so anyways that's my selection of
oddball<00:03:27.260> camshafts<00:03:27.920> as<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:29.300> can<00:03:29.420> see<00:03:29.600> they

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
oddball camshafts as you can see they

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.800 
oddball camshafts as you can see they
vary<00:03:29.990> quite<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.290> bit<00:03:30.380> from<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.950> really<00:03:31.370> large

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
vary quite a bit from the really large

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.410 
vary quite a bit from the really large
lobes<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.260> mono<00:03:33.650> soup<00:03:33.950> ape<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:36.230> the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
lobes on the mono soup ape to the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.760 
lobes on the mono soup ape to the
somewhat<00:03:38.420> smaller<00:03:38.720> lobes<00:03:39.110> on<00:03:39.530> the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
somewhat smaller lobes on the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.520 
somewhat smaller lobes on the
supercharger
