00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.240
This time I explain a writing method using pen of Duo 13

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.200
There is a special function of Pen wake in Duo 13.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:35.500
This function can run specific program when detect to pull out a pen from pen holder during sleep mode condition.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.400
Now, Duo is in sleep mode condition. I pull out a pen in this condition.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.680
As soon as a pen pulls out from pen holder, you can confirm a monitor is turned on.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.130
When I take off the lock screen, you can see a writing program that is run immediately.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.540
The sensing method to pull out pen like this is by using a sensor that detects magnetic properties.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.860
There is a sensor that detects magnetic properties in the back.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.970
The back side of pen embedded the magnet.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.810
The USB port is iron. I use this USB port and try to make sure that pen back side is magnet.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.160
Approaching like this, the USB port stick on the pen, so you can see that coming up.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.520
We can confirm the pen back side is magnet by this method.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.540
Turned on by magnets, so caution is required.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:37.310
When notebook is in sleep mode, accidentally if there is/are the magnet at a pen holder, the duo turns on unwanted things can happen.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.350
If you don't want this function, you can disable at VAIO control center.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.630
Well, next we will see a funtion of this pen stand.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.840
This pen stand can stand a pen like this.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:04.220
If you want to run writing program in this pen stand condition, you can put the pen to this area and take off lock screen and run writing program.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.140
The program that is run when sense to pull out the pen from pen holder can change other programs.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.890
I will try to set up the internet explorer.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.970
You can use internet immediately by Pen wake function when in sleep mode.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.340
There for, you can use that you want program from this set up.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.260
I will try to use Note Anytime for VAIO writing program that bascially installed.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.930
You can choose pen thickness, color and so on by pushing a pen shape image.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.425
After control pen thickness and color, push a complete button.

00:02:45.435 --> 00:02:47.795
Let's take notes.

00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:57.305
There are two buttons on the pen, but I will take note without using the buttons.

00:02:57.315 --> 00:03:00.515
I wrote WangEi's VAIO Duo 13.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:04.915
This time I'll take note pusing long button on back side.

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:08.745
This button can use eraser.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:12.705
I'll push the screen pusing a back side button.

00:03:12.715 --> 00:03:17.365
So you can see drawn gray pen.

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:23.865
If I take off the pen, you can see to erase the drawn gray area.

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:28.975
I'll erase what's left over.

00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:32.895
And next, I'll try to use front side button.

00:03:32.905 --> 00:03:37.145
This button can appoint selected area.

00:03:37.155 --> 00:03:42.801
You can select area pusing the front button like this.

00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:46.811
You can see that is expressed the selected area.

00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:53.091
It can move and control size up and down.

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:57.381
It can control size right and left.

00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:02.541
It can control size diagonally.

00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:09.781
It's able to rotation.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:18.101
And next, Click this, you can see extended menu.

00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:28.371
And next, I'll try to select area by other function pusing the screen long time without two buttons of pen.

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:35.676
If I push the screen long time, a circle appear and disppear.

00:04:35.686 --> 00:04:41.696
We can appoint selected area on this condition.

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:49.000
You can see the selected area and this case you can see that the popup menu is showed immediately.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.892
You can erase all if you push a remove button.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.055
This class is as far as here.

00:04:56.065 --> 00:05:01.655
I'll show other functions to a second video of Using a Duo pen.
