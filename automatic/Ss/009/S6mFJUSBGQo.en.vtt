00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.880
 ah 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.350
 ah 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.369
 i 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.910
 looking back between lies 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.850
 wounds that left a mark and that did not 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.250
 They tapaban with broken smiles few bandaids 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.290
 how many and missed goals like when 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.570
 you break the silence and scream and crack 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.550
 within my being that is not enclosed I am 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.260
 of those who wait for things 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.390
 hundreds of 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.040
 memories that do not disappear when it happens 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.590
 time and go tell me how many times 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.200
 they will want and I looking south as when 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.270
 I lose the north with my luck or the 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.460
 You want to see a chicken to cry 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.680
 I just ask you to let me out before you drown 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.260
 of six days that you think about escaping to 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.150
 another part fly from here leave whole 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.040
 how do you want me to want what I have if 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.230
 I do not have what I want as you want me 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.540
 you smile and I still miss the days I know 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.120
 He was a child and he lived happily and without fear 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.970
 I can in the past through my eyes 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.190
 I can see all those who are far away 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 recovered from the different past of the theme 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.110
 and I leave it like seeing myself alone in a room 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.479
 full of mirrors shortcuts that took me 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.550
 astray and luck is destiny 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.979
 that escapes from my hands mine 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.480
 they are worth so much you do not buy with money they are 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.700
 as brothers but yes no 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.620
 as less as succeed 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.320
 when nothing comes out always good 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.420
 who is worth and who is not worth lose me not me 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.490
 listen if you do not understand what hurts 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.860
 do not listen to me, I'm just 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.350
 unbearable I am one of those rare days that 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.480
 love the rainy days or those fools 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.820
 that do not look for a girlfriend of those who 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.770
 think that life is very wise and that you 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.550
 He fucked to show him he was not doing what he 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.540
 I owed what I owed 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.540
 in the 14th
