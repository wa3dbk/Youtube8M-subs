hi<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.779> question<00:00:07.500> from<00:00:07.680> ceará<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
hi this is a question from ceará and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.530 
hi this is a question from ceará and
dragon<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.590> relates<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> water

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
dragon and it relates to water

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.620 
dragon and it relates to water
particularly<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:13.200> tap<00:00:13.500> water<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.570> they<00:00:15.570> were

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
particularly to tap water and they were

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.890 
particularly to tap water and they were
wondering<00:00:16.310> what<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> think<00:00:17.820> about<00:00:17.940> tap<00:00:18.420> water

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
wondering what I think about tap water

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.029 
wondering what I think about tap water
versus<00:00:19.500> bottled<00:00:20.010> water<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.990> also<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.920> know

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
versus bottled water and also you know

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.230 
versus bottled water and also you know
knowing<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.380> your<00:00:25.380> water<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.980> stay<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.939> go

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
knowing that your water can stay or go

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.700 
knowing that your water can stay or go
through<00:00:27.570> pipes<00:00:28.109> dirty<00:00:28.859> pipes<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:30.599> stay<00:00:31.470> there

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
through pipes dirty pipes and stay there

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.260 
through pipes dirty pipes and stay there
for<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> long<00:00:32.189> time<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.899> also<00:00:35.059> with<00:00:36.059> the

for a long time and also with the
knowing<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> water<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:38.129> stay<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.489> plastic

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
knowing that water can stay in plastic

are sold and there these are certainly

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.639 
are sold and there these are certainly
concerning<00:00:47.270> effects<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.620> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
concerning effects because we know that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.200 
concerning effects because we know that

cancer<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.960> producing<00:00:55.530> chemicals<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
cancer are producing chemicals into the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.450 
cancer are producing chemicals into the
water<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.949> don't<00:00:58.980> say<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.649> big

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
water so they don't say you know a big

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.640 
water so they don't say you know a big
issue<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.379> with<00:01:04.379> regard<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.640> chemicals

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
issue now with regard to these chemicals

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.270 
issue now with regard to these chemicals
raising<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.280> body's<00:01:08.990> hormones<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.470> estrogens

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
raising the body's hormones of estrogens

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.660 
raising the body's hormones of estrogens
particularly<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:13.020> lead<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.040> certain

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
particularly which can lead to certain

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.810 
particularly which can lead to certain
types<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.299> cancer<00:01:15.869> growth<00:01:16.740> some<00:01:17.220> they<00:01:17.549> act

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
types of cancer growth some they act

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.200 
types of cancer growth some they act
like<00:01:17.970> growth<00:01:18.570> hormones<00:01:19.310> they<00:01:20.310> lead<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
like growth hormones they lead to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.980 
like growth hormones they lead to
excessive<00:01:21.960> growth<00:01:22.470> patterns<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.430> cells<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
excessive growth patterns in cells so

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.880 
excessive growth patterns in cells so
I'm<00:01:25.170> certainly<00:01:26.100> on

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
I'm certainly on

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.750 
I'm certainly on
in<00:01:26.950> favor<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.670> any<00:01:28.300> bottled<00:01:28.900> water<00:01:29.200> unless<00:01:29.800> it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
in favor of any bottled water unless it

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.730 
in favor of any bottled water unless it
is<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.060> plastic<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.830> doesn't<00:01:33.610> here<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.810> get<00:01:35.440> you

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
is a plastic that doesn't here I get you

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.810 
is a plastic that doesn't here I get you
know<00:01:35.830> you<00:01:36.640> know<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.810> know<00:01:37.870> that<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.350> fear

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
know you know you know that it's fear

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.750 
know you know you know that it's fear
parts<00:01:39.820> or<00:01:40.030> chemicals<00:01:41.220> into<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:45.160> water

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
parts or chemicals into the the water

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.170 
parts or chemicals into the the water
so<00:01:46.110> once<00:01:47.110> again<00:01:47.290> I'm<00:01:47.740> very<00:01:48.130> very<00:01:48.550> cautious

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
so once again I'm very very cautious

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.860 
so once again I'm very very cautious
about<00:01:49.300> any<00:01:49.900> bottles<00:01:50.610> yet<00:01:51.610> drinking<00:01:52.479> bottled

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
about any bottles yet drinking bottled

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.710 
about any bottles yet drinking bottled
water<00:01:53.310> means<00:01:54.310> also<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.240> you're<00:01:55.510> drinking

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
water means also that you're drinking

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.230 
water means also that you're drinking
tap<00:01:56.260> water<00:01:56.320> because<00:01:57.250> that's<00:01:57.400> basically<00:01:57.970> what

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
tap water because that's basically what

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.469 
tap water because that's basically what
it<00:01:58.360> is<00:01:58.510> these<00:01:59.200> companies<00:01:59.530> that<00:02:00.100> just<00:02:00.479> take

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
it is these companies that just take

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.260 
it is these companies that just take
regular<00:02:01.750> tap<00:02:02.320> water<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:03.160> then<00:02:03.820> they<00:02:04.000> use<00:02:04.240> a

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
regular tap water and then they use a

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.669 
regular tap water and then they use a
system<00:02:05.220> mostly<00:02:06.220> reverse<00:02:06.790> osmosis<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.810> they

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
system mostly reverse osmosis and they

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.120 
system mostly reverse osmosis and they
bottle<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:09.820> then<00:02:10.239> sell<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:11.130> more

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
bottle it and then sell it for more

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.930 
bottle it and then sell it for more
money<00:02:12.190> than<00:02:12.730> actually<00:02:13.180> gas<00:02:13.620> gasoline<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.550> if

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
money than actually gas gasoline so if

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.690 
money than actually gas gasoline so if
it's<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.360> big<00:02:16.540> money-making<00:02:16.989> scheme<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.250> it's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
it's a big money-making scheme and it's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.400 
it's a big money-making scheme and it's
a<00:02:18.880> scam<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:21.520> personally<00:02:22.150> don't<00:02:22.720> promote<00:02:23.020> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
a scam it I personally don't promote it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.630 
a scam it I personally don't promote it
so<00:02:23.590> what<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.340> do<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> filtration

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
so what I do is I have a filtration

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.160 
so what I do is I have a filtration
system<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.980> filters<00:02:29.980> my<00:02:30.310> tap<00:02:30.640> water<00:02:31.170> and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
system that filters my tap water and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.590 
system that filters my tap water and
this<00:02:32.380> way<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.950> know<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.580> can<00:02:34.030> remove<00:02:34.360> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
this way I know I can remove the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.580 
this way I know I can remove the
contaminants<00:02:35.880> from<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.060> water<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:38.049> it<00:02:38.560> is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
contaminants from that water and it is

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.190 
contaminants from that water and it is
flowing<00:02:39.040> water<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.850> flowing<00:02:40.810> water<00:02:40.989> is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
flowing water and flowing water is

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.280 
flowing water and flowing water is
always<00:02:41.620> better<00:02:41.920> than<00:02:42.070> stagnant<00:02:42.910> water

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
always better than stagnant water

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.220 
always better than stagnant water
stagnant<00:02:44.290> water<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.680> pretty<00:02:45.280> much<00:02:45.519> dead<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:47.170> if

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
stagnant water is pretty much dead so if

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.340 
stagnant water is pretty much dead so if
it<00:02:47.380> sits<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.920> bottle<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> long<00:02:48.940> time

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
it sits in a bottle for a long time

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.110 
it sits in a bottle for a long time
there's<00:02:50.350> really<00:02:50.680> no<00:02:51.010> life<00:02:51.310> force<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.970> it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
there's really no life force in it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.140 
there's really no life force in it
whereas<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.200> water<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.640> use<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:55.120> your

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150
