00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.920
 ai 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.190
 And then I'll do the demonstration 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.600
 here is one more 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.150
 together here would be the one here is the a1 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.150
 next to teleportation that I edited 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.120
 here for a friend who had asked me there 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.260
 on a different teleportation set 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.670
 so I edited quote here's there 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.100
 posting you there then you do 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.220
 The installation is cute, we added 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.699
 file in the clÃ©o if you add that 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.739
 in the club, it's going to work out 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.430
 so you first select an area 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:11.220
 on the map where you want to put it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:21.770
 an area far away here mary on the map 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:21.770
 then mark and press the control key z 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:30.770
 press here z control 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.040
 I go he has an effect is that I 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.780
 I also put two eyes that 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.780
 they would appear to be tightening here 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:51.510
 this is the effect that appears that I edited 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:53.430
 It's also cool and the audio there is a 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.480
 audio that will serve for all 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.060
 characters there that you should ask 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.340
 a nice one I had already posted from kamui 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.520
 It was only from kamui now this is already here 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.940
 You can use it for several characters. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.940
 against the more is 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.800
 That's cool, too. 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.800
 send away 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.830
 average 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:29.970
 this is it even if they want a loss 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:35.730
 It's cool to download and do the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:41.810
 teleportation, bacaninha was beauty 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.810
 So, guys, I went. 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.360
