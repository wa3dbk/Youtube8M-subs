pepping right this level we might not

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.139 
pepping right this level we might not
make<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.469> level<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.190> heat<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.879> gonna

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
make in this level the heat is gonna

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.910 
make in this level the heat is gonna
slowly<00:00:48.450> take<00:00:48.690> help<00:00:49.350> away<00:00:49.710> from<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.690> degree

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920
