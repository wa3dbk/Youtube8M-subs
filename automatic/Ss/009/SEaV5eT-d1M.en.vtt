hi<00:00:03.520> Bryan<00:00:03.940> with<00:00:04.120> high<00:00:04.240> desert<00:00:04.510> adventure

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
hi Bryan with high desert adventure

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.620 
hi Bryan with high desert adventure
sorry<00:00:05.529> I'm<00:00:05.620> a<00:00:05.649> little<00:00:05.950> sick<00:00:06.299> I've<00:00:07.299> got<00:00:07.480> to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
sorry I'm a little sick I've got to

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.670 
sorry I'm a little sick I've got to
install<00:00:08.230> a<00:00:08.500> thermal<00:00:09.100> expansion<00:00:09.670> tank<00:00:09.880> onto<00:00:10.210> my

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
install a thermal expansion tank onto my

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.890 
install a thermal expansion tank onto my
thermal<00:00:11.680> expansion<00:00:12.190> chamber<00:00:12.490> onto<00:00:12.790> my<00:00:13.030> hot

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
thermal expansion chamber onto my hot

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.959 
thermal expansion chamber onto my hot
water<00:00:14.170> heater<00:00:14.440> and<00:00:14.679> so<00:00:15.519> I'm<00:00:15.639> going<00:00:15.790> to<00:00:15.849> go

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
water heater and so I'm going to go

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.310 
water heater and so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:16.029> and<00:00:16.330> test<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:18.689> water<00:00:19.689> pressure<00:00:20.020> coming

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
ahead and test the water pressure coming

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.859 
ahead and test the water pressure coming
into<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.680> house<00:00:20.860> and<00:00:21.550> have<00:00:21.820> a<00:00:21.849> watts<00:00:22.180> gauge

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
into the house and have a watts gauge

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.740 
into the house and have a watts gauge
and<00:00:23.290> next<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.340> changing<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.790> light<00:00:24.970> bulb<00:00:25.210> tested

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
and next to changing a light bulb tested

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.120 
and next to changing a light bulb tested
water<00:00:25.960> pressure<00:00:26.290> is<00:00:26.410> probably<00:00:26.680> one<00:00:27.009> of<00:00:27.040> the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
water pressure is probably one of the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.819 
water pressure is probably one of the
easiest<00:00:27.869> who<00:00:28.869> maintenance<00:00:29.320> steps<00:00:29.500> you<00:00:29.680> can

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
easiest who maintenance steps you can

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.620 
easiest who maintenance steps you can
actually<00:00:30.009> do<00:00:30.340> so<00:00:31.029> we'll<00:00:31.210> go<00:00:31.329> ahead<00:00:31.390> and<00:00:31.480> get

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
actually do so we'll go ahead and get

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.450 
actually do so we'll go ahead and get
started<00:00:31.750> good<00:00:33.450> since<00:00:34.450> I<00:00:34.570> have<00:00:34.960> easy<00:00:35.320> access<00:00:35.620> to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
started good since I have easy access to

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.369 
started good since I have easy access to
an<00:00:36.519> outside<00:00:36.850> faucet<00:00:37.449> I'm<00:00:37.870> just<00:00:38.050> gonna<00:00:38.199> go

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
an outside faucet I'm just gonna go

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:47.790 
an outside faucet I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:00:38.469> and<00:00:41.789> screw<00:00:42.789> this<00:00:42.820> on<00:00:43.329> I<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:47.469> I<00:00:47.559> said

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
ahead and screw this on I think I said

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.860 
ahead and screw this on I think I said
yeah<00:00:48.660> super<00:00:49.660> simple<00:00:50.109> all<00:00:50.320> right<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.510> I'm<00:00:52.749> gonna

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
yeah super simple all right so I'm gonna

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:24.450 
yeah super simple all right so I'm gonna
go<00:00:53.079> ahead<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:53.969> set<00:00:54.969> to<00:00:55.390> zero

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.620 

so<00:01:25.460> it's<00:01:25.610> approaching<00:01:26.409> 80<00:01:27.409> psi<00:01:29.229> looks<00:01:30.229> like

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.859 

if

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:50.510 

great<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.679> 80<00:01:38.329> pretty<00:01:39.329> high

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.200 

and<00:01:51.520> that's<00:01:52.090> how<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.270> test<00:01:52.570> it<00:01:54.090> thanks<00:01:55.090> for

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
and that's how you test it thanks for

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.700 
and that's how you test it thanks for
watching<00:01:55.510> I'm<00:01:55.660> gonna<00:01:55.900> have<00:01:56.050> another<00:01:56.320> video<00:01:56.650> on

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
watching I'm gonna have another video on

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.860 
watching I'm gonna have another video on
actually<00:01:57.220> installing<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.870> thermal

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
actually installing the thermal

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.510 
actually installing the thermal
expansion<00:01:58.960> chamber<00:01:59.800> if<00:01:59.890> you<00:01:59.980> like<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.280> video
