 the special 250 well gentlemen questions and 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.870
 answers there have not been many 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.429
 questions have been like 8 out there but 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.570
 good so those that have arranged those that 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.039
 selected from some actions 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.349
 selected as I put the 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.330
 comments and we're going to start this 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.240
 boiling in the background a video of duels 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.679
 I'm going to leave it there and good if we 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.750
 interesting the special because you see the video 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.990
 towns and that's good and first 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.539
 question is d 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.099
 David Perez that says why you started 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 with your videos and what do you want 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.200
 censorship I started with my videos because I 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.950
 I watched videos and other things and I had 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.530
 entertaining 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.420
 and I thought and they'll have fun recording 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.900
 those who do not know how many and there were things that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.970
 I also, I, too, want 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.620
 help with my videos and think that you can 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 to be helping someone who is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 you can like my videos and that 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.290
 Entertain watching it, I do not know how I like it 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.180
 and why do you want censorship because what 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.170
 I basically want to like money because 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.430
 one goes to 90 but no money for me 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.080
 that I do not want anything to do 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.110
 seventh because with the shit you do not 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.020
 continue to see from hunan you are one another 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.659
 question of a 95 how and when 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.710
 you met metin2 because I knew him ago 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.080
 four years is worth how you can play my 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.450
 brother and I took it I liked it and I started 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.140
 play to see what you like most 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.310
 from this game, I do not know what 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.930
 when you have a time when you can 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.700
 meet people with whom you can 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.310
 carry very well with the one you already have 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.930
 Trust and good but you have a good time 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.940
 consider that this game 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.040
 on the last 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.690
 good on the one hand yes or on the other 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.250
 because you look at the servers as 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.920
 they were before and how they are now and they give 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.740
 sorry but good even though the people I do not 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.020
 I am I do not know what it will end soon 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.630
 or not but good for as long as we go 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.360
 to enjoy it so to speak and also 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.940
 question and you think the game has 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.800
 something that makes it sometimes very addictive 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.960
 so good has the game is based on the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.030
 progression of a character and what he does 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.710
 is that at a low level you want to see more 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.960
 level more level to go put others of 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.110
 mature new and good that that to me 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.670
 it happened that from experience 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.190
 well here comes another question the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.190
 third that is please please tube 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.200
 red is worth what question why you sura 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.240
 it's called garnett's worth because I 'm 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.790
 game men craft and in a way that I 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.040
 I set no end called meat 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.200
 it would not be like putting him and I said handsome 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.910
 is you what I'm going I put it on I put the h 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.030
 out there so that it would not be the same but 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.480
 good the law or it is not equal 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.340
 to see so you raise it to 70 for pvp or 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.880
 you have me already I have said it before for the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.770
 seventh and good here also asks you 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.270
 I expected to win the workshop contest 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.100
 Do you think that if I had not won it? 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.780
 they had gone up the suv well I always 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.910
 said that the subscribers are in my 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.470
 channel because they like videos and if 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.170
 like sooner or later they have 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.660
 come some video if social them 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.530
 like it and subscribe then what 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.670
 I think 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.980
 but, well, maybe I have 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.790
 helped to give you to know well a 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 little to see another one who asks is called 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.130
 daniel reyna puts me when you take 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.489
 playing in med and I'm playing 44 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.489
 years you put many in the game you do not get the 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.800
 truth is that not a few say how 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.420
 you got to have so many things so much 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.819
 It has me or a lot to sell a lot 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.220
 change a lot we are going a lot to do the 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.730
 trade and little by little because in account 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.010
 I have it like two years to see how fuck 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.180
 his 50 view to the envelope so fast 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.010
 good with the ring that you give to 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.150
 principle that I'll already say how you get 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.069
 with ropes in the region loves damaged 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.069
 and with patience it's easy to upload 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.500
 50 like one hour less out there 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.780
 well here another question from a know that 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.250
 be more rolo in axis that puts that 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.079
 servers have you played since you raise the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.900
 You arrived because it covers in twilight the 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.510
 first time I reach level 35 I 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.489
 they bathed the working account from anima 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.780
 agreement the hub in austria to which it arrives 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.370
 the 61 played in paradise I played in 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.329
 almost all the servers but they have not 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.519
 come very far the accounts and good 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.250
 now I played I'm playing here in 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.760
 this in the Orion he also had a 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.549
 shura there is a shura a mental warrior 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.500
 a mental warrior in Chinese is worth seeing 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.690
 other than questions called jorge 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.430
 trujillo how did you do for project to 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.080
 advance the stuck without getting bored of it 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.460
 The truth is that he has never 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.169
 happened because the most boring thing that 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.800
 It may be the one I see and I see him 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.199
 in quotes I like it and it bores me 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.560
 I like it, I do not care about having another 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.260
 question is from tito or videla has you 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.940
 it helped a lot to have characters of equal 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.220
 level 94 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.310
 it's good to know according to where you are 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.860
 I see nothing because I have thought of myself 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.870
 it's always ok but for example now for 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.880
 the map does not yes that has helped me in the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.310
 question of getting the armors and 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.280
 sell them when they were when they were sold 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.130
 well and I also do not know to go and get 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.680
 things have you gone with him also to do 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.610
 things but whatever on the subject of him 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.120
 I see nothing to see another one that is called alone 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.500
 winch 24 to see how much time how much 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.550
 has been playing for some time and how 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.950
 to the plates of other kingdoms 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.180
 how much time four years to know how many 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.060
 you the plastas of other kingdoms 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.710
 It is always good that is not laughing at 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.140
 them but laughing at what you do already 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.830
 they tell you to go down I do not know what 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.570
 I do not know how much it is because I put him yes hahaha 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.180
 look very well what you say to me the 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.840
 peel with as long as you know what with 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.840
 the ones that I play 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.880
 what I carry what does not spare me gives me 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.770
 whatever you think and if they come and you 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.449
 they hit and they kill you for nothing because you laugh 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.340
 of them because so come to kill you and 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.660
 well always so the thing is not to bite 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.409
 because it is a game after all it is a 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.099
 game and you're done 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:06:00.789
 and the other question is of failure I'm going 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.409
 metin2 mt2 and says it's new then 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.419
 good to me as a child the school 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.039
 they had called cabinet rather I have 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.509
 a handful of names and in the end I 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.550
 they call roban I liked it and so good like that 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.910
 it was staying and staying and 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.610
 well well I put it on the channel 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.270
 and another question because you started playing 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.670
 in netting 2 then I started playing vale 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.140
 Well with my sister and then also me 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.510
 I had left it a little apart but 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.520
 later in the town in my town then 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.800
 they started playing those of my people and 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.380
 to see how it was that time to arrive 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.020
 at level 30 it was already done 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.060
 the 30 and the other always like the 8 I do not know 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.010
 that I have an iron or an iron more 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.830
 played like crazy but how have you 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.690
 got to be things like that and good now 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.880
 think that a 30 go up a fart by 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.920
