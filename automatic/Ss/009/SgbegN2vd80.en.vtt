00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
on them you never know they might go

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.179 
on them you never know they might go
flying<00:01:20.540> right<00:01:20.780> off<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.080> stand<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:21.890> make<00:01:22.070> sure

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
flying right off the stand so make sure

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.429 
flying right off the stand so make sure
this<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.490> nice<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:22.850> tight<00:01:23.060> one<00:01:23.960> word<00:01:24.200> here

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
this is nice and tight one word here

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.010 
this is nice and tight one word here
though<00:01:24.560> too<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:25.369> may<00:01:25.490> not<00:01:25.610> want<00:01:25.760> to<00:01:26.020> over

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
though too is you may not want to over

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.460 
though too is you may not want to over
tighten<00:01:27.790> this<00:01:28.790> little<00:01:29.090> screw<00:01:29.840> here<00:01:29.869> because

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
tighten this little screw here because

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.280 
tighten this little screw here because
it'll<00:01:31.100> actually<00:01:31.689> inhibit<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.780> cymbal<00:01:33.140> from

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
it'll actually inhibit the cymbal from

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.890 
it'll actually inhibit the cymbal from
moving<00:01:33.560> freely<00:01:34.100> when<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.030> strike<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:35.780> you

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
moving freely when you strike it so you

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.410 
moving freely when you strike it so you
want<00:01:36.049> just<00:01:36.200> enough<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.500> keep<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.799> in<00:01:36.890> place

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
want just enough to keep it in place

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.149 
want just enough to keep it in place
okay<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.479> we've<00:01:39.049> talked<00:01:39.350> today<00:01:39.470> about<00:01:39.740> how<00:01:40.130> to

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
okay so we've talked today about how to

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
they're not going to go flying all over
