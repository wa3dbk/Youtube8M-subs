00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
of this you put the end of line which is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.010 
of this you put the end of line which is
less<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.940> less<00:00:45.120> stronger<00:00:45.690> than<00:00:45.870> the

for the bottom for your end of line so

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.680 
for the bottom for your end of line so
you<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:56.160> loop<00:00:56.460> they<00:00:57.210> sell<00:00:57.480> these

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you do a little loop they sell these

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.330 
you do a little loop they sell these
already<00:00:58.109> made<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> packaged<00:00:59.430> or<00:01:00.140> other

already made up and packaged or other

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.380 
already made up and packaged or other
technical<00:01:02.340> block<00:01:02.670> i'll<00:01:02.850> show<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.120> how<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
technical block i'll show you how to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.440 
technical block i'll show you how to
make<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.870> yourself<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
make them yourself so what you do is you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.120 
make them yourself so what you do is you
take<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.630> loop<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.409> put<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.799> end<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
take your loop and you put at the end of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.030 
take your loop and you put at the end of
the<00:01:08.250> swivel<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.070> easy<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:12.920> put<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the swivel it's very easy to do put the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.020 
the swivel it's very easy to do put the
hook<00:01:14.220> through<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.810> loop<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> way<00:01:17.970> you

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
hook through the loop so that way you

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.170 
hook through the loop so that way you
have

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.090 

it<00:01:22.180> looks<00:01:22.450> at<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.780> end<00:01:24.030> hey<00:01:25.030> what<00:01:25.210> up<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.920> this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
it looks at the end hey what up so this

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.819 
it looks at the end hey what up so this
is<00:01:27.219> a<00:01:27.250> sliding<00:01:27.759> wait<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.200> even<00:01:29.500> if<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:29.680> have<00:01:29.770> a

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
is a sliding wait so even if you have a

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.830 
is a sliding wait so even if you have a
big<00:01:30.070> white<00:01:30.280> dispersion<00:01:30.850> won't<00:01:31.060> feel<00:01:31.329> the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
big white dispersion won't feel the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.359 
big white dispersion won't feel the
weight<00:01:32.020> when<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.350> bites<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:32.979> that<00:01:33.159> way<00:01:33.280> you

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
weight when it bites so that way you

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.460 
weight when it bites so that way you
have<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.520> chance<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.970> see<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.270> debate<00:01:35.079> because

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
have a chance to see the debate because

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.710 
have a chance to see the debate because
on<00:01:35.619> your<00:01:35.799> rod<00:01:36.009> it's<00:01:36.880> just<00:01:37.119> going<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.299> move<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.539> a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
on your rod it's just going to move to a

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.289 
on your rod it's just going to move to a
little<00:01:37.960> bit<00:01:38.079> like<00:01:38.259> this<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.729> you<00:01:39.880> put<00:01:40.090> some

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
little bit like this if you put some

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.149 
little bit like this if you put some
bells<00:01:40.569> or<00:01:40.840> something<00:01:40.869> you<00:01:41.409> you'll<00:01:41.710> never<00:01:41.920> hear

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
bells or something you you'll never hear

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.419 
bells or something you you'll never hear
the<00:01:42.310> bites<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.350> this<00:01:44.799> is<00:01:44.829> laying<00:01:45.250> at<00:01:45.399> the

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
the bites so this is laying at the

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.160 
the bites so this is laying at the
bottom<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.270> put<00:01:46.420> your<00:01:46.569> normal<00:01:46.929> bait

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
bottom and you just put your normal bait

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.219 
bottom and you just put your normal bait
like<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.560> warrants<00:01:48.100> or<00:01:48.250> whatever<00:01:48.520> else<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:50.020> if

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
you have a like springtime you should

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.969 
you have a like springtime you should
have<00:01:51.789> a<00:01:51.850> little<00:01:52.119> grass<00:01:52.750> go<00:01:53.079> growing<00:01:53.409> like<00:01:53.770> this

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
have a little grass go growing like this

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
you won't see this and the bottom the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.800 
you won't see this and the bottom the
surge<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.159> won't<00:01:57.340> find<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.759> so<00:01:57.909> what<00:01:58.539> you<00:01:58.659> do

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810
