coming<00:00:04.020> off<00:00:04.080> winter<00:00:04.319> Stoke<00:00:04.529> Road<00:00:04.740> here<00:00:04.980> that's

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
coming off winter Stoke Road here that's

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.610 
coming off winter Stoke Road here that's
the<00:00:05.490> main<00:00:06.000> way<00:00:06.150> into<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> new<00:00:06.690> stadium<00:00:07.170> I

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
the main way into the new stadium I

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.200 
the main way into the new stadium I
think<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.309> only<00:00:08.400> when<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.730> see<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> steel

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
think it's only when you see the steel

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.060 
think it's only when you see the steel
go<00:00:09.420> up<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.809> begin<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.200> see<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.500> whole<00:00:10.650> scale

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
go up you begin to see the whole scale

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.280 
go up you begin to see the whole scale
of<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> stadium<00:00:11.940> how<00:00:12.480> it's<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> develop

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
of the stadium how it's going to develop

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.020 
of the stadium how it's going to develop
and<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:14.070> its<00:00:14.190> relationship<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and and what its relationship is to the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.180 
and and what its relationship is to the
old<00:00:15.179> stadium<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.289> think<00:00:16.500> many<00:00:16.710> fans<00:00:17.010> will

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
old stadium and I think many fans will

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
old stadium and I think many fans will
be<00:00:17.369> surprised<00:00:17.789> at<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:17.970> quickly<00:00:18.539> these<00:00:19.260> steel

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
be surprised at how quickly these steel

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.439 
be surprised at how quickly these steel
works<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:20.039> going<00:00:20.070> up<00:00:20.400> nine<00:00:20.640> weeks<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.180> steel

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
works are going up nine weeks this steel

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.420 
works are going up nine weeks this steel
work<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.960> actually<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.470> take<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:23.310> this

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
work is actually going to take for this

we're hopeful that's going to work

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.059 
we're hopeful that's going to work
effectively<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.859> then<00:02:16.040> next<00:02:16.370> year<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.790> ninety

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
effectively and then next year in ninety

2015-16<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.670> West<00:02:19.879> Stand<00:02:20.439> nearly<00:02:21.439> eleven

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
2015-16 the West Stand nearly eleven

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.160 
2015-16 the West Stand nearly eleven
thousand<00:02:22.040> people<00:02:22.280> in<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.519> stand<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:23.359> very<00:02:23.900> big

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
thousand people in that stand a very big

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.559 
thousand people in that stand a very big
structure<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.519> again<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:25.849> think<00:02:25.969> when<00:02:26.299> people

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
structure and again I think when people

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.179 
structure and again I think when people
start<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:26.989> some<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.680> come<00:02:27.890> out<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
start to see some that come out of the

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.319 
start to see some that come out of the
ground<00:02:28.370> they'll<00:02:28.609> really<00:02:28.849> get<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.060> feel<00:02:29.299> for

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
ground they'll really get a feel for

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.490 
ground they'll really get a feel for
what<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:29.780> state<00:02:30.019> is<00:02:30.049> going<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.319> look<00:02:30.469> like

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
what the state is going to look like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.099 
what the state is going to look like
yeah<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.549> it's<00:02:31.939> a<00:02:32.030> very<00:02:32.209> fast<00:02:32.450> project<00:02:32.959> this

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
yeah it's it's a very fast project this

which is a big milestone for us well
it's<00:02:48.079> fascinating<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.709> watch<00:02:48.950> we've<00:02:49.220> just

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
it's fascinating to watch we've just

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.920 
it's fascinating to watch we've just
stood<00:02:49.579> watching<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:50.060> precast<00:02:50.480> concrete

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
stood watching the precast concrete

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.649 
stood watching the precast concrete
stairs<00:02:51.530> going<00:02:51.859> in<00:02:52.189> a<00:02:52.370> section<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.239> them<00:02:53.480> how

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
stairs going in a section of them how

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.960 
stairs going in a section of them how
difficult<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.799> one<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:55.159> these<00:02:55.310> projects<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.849> do

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
difficult is one of these projects to do

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.659 
difficult is one of these projects to do
on<00:02:56.090> an<00:02:56.209> existing<00:02:56.599> site<00:02:57.019> it's<00:02:57.889> it<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.430> very

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
on an existing site it's it is very

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.030 
on an existing site it's it is very
complicated<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.510> the<00:03:00.040> construction

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
complicated the the construction

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.759 
complicated the the construction
projects<00:03:01.579> are<00:03:01.959> generally<00:03:02.959> complex<00:03:03.409> in<00:03:03.620> their

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
projects are generally complex in their

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.069 
projects are generally complex in their
nature<00:03:04.099> especially<00:03:04.370> stadiums<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.510> to

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
nature especially stadiums so to

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.479 
nature especially stadiums so to
actually<00:03:06.579> build<00:03:07.810> effectively<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.840> new<00:03:09.049> stadium

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
actually build effectively a new stadium

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.490 
actually build effectively a new stadium
or<00:03:10.489> on<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.329> site<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.659> an<00:03:11.750> existing<00:03:12.230> one<00:03:12.319> and

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
or on the site of an existing one and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.890 
or on the site of an existing one and
keep<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.799> all<00:03:12.950> running<00:03:13.189> at<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.489> same<00:03:13.669> time<00:03:14.000> is

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
keep it all running at the same time is

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.140 
keep it all running at the same time is
is<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.349> fairly<00:03:15.709> major<00:03:15.950> challenge<00:03:16.459> and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
is a fairly major challenge and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.059 
is a fairly major challenge and
obviously<00:03:18.049> we've<00:03:18.199> seen<00:03:18.349> a<00:03:18.409> big<00:03:18.590> change<00:03:18.620> over

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
obviously we've seen a big change over

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.619 
obviously we've seen a big change over
the<00:03:19.159> last<00:03:19.310> week<00:03:19.639> indeed<00:03:20.000> since<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.419> still

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
the last week indeed since the still

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.689 
the last week indeed since the still
work<00:03:20.780> arrived<00:03:21.139> last<00:03:21.349> week<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:21.919> what<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.430> fans

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
work arrived last week but what can fans

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.939 
work arrived last week but what can fans
expect<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.359> see<00:03:23.540> over<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.109> coming<00:03:24.319> weeks<00:03:24.739> and

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
expect to see over the coming weeks and

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.439 
expect to see over the coming weeks and
months<00:03:25.040> just<00:03:25.370> talk<00:03:25.669> us<00:03:25.699> through<00:03:25.849> how<00:03:26.120> quickly

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
months just talk us through how quickly

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.839 
months just talk us through how quickly
everything<00:03:26.870> will<00:03:27.109> go<00:03:27.260> up<00:03:27.440> okay<00:03:28.159> so<00:03:28.220> at<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
everything will go up okay so at the

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.550 
everything will go up okay so at the
moment<00:03:29.000> what<00:03:29.299> we're<00:03:29.479> looking<00:03:29.750> at<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.109> the<00:03:30.349> the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
moment what we're looking at is the the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.219 
moment what we're looking at is the the
structural<00:03:31.069> fees<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.639> the<00:03:31.790> project<00:03:32.239> that's

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229 
structural fees of the project that's

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:34.960 
structural fees of the project that's
the<00:03:33.409> the<00:03:33.590> structural<00:03:34.040> steel<00:03:34.220> going<00:03:34.549> in<00:03:34.760> as

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
the the structural steel going in as

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.399 
the the structural steel going in as
you've<00:03:35.120> just<00:03:35.150> said<00:03:35.479> that<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.870> stairs<00:03:36.139> are

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
you've just said that the stairs are

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.619 
you've just said that the stairs are
going<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.129> then<00:03:37.669> the<00:03:37.790> next<00:03:38.180> phase<00:03:38.299> in

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
going in and then the next phase in

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.599 
going in and then the next phase in
probably<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.019> next<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.409> two<00:03:39.799> weeks<00:03:40.010> or<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:40.430> we

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
probably the next to two weeks or so we

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.300 
probably the next to two weeks or so we
will<00:03:40.909> start<00:03:41.239> seeing<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:42.290> actual<00:03:42.470> terracing

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
will start seeing the actual terracing

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.339 
will start seeing the actual terracing
going<00:03:43.879> on<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.269> front<00:03:44.449> where<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.959> funds

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
going on to the front where the funds

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.839 
going on to the front where the funds
will<00:03:45.560> actually<00:03:45.799> be<00:03:45.919> sitting<00:03:46.099> in<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.430> future

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
will actually be sitting in the future

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.420 
will actually be sitting in the future
that's<00:03:47.780> that<00:03:48.109> fees<00:03:48.349> really<00:03:48.680> take<00:03:48.949> us<00:03:49.099> through

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
that's that fees really take us through

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.189 
that's that fees really take us through
to<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.669> end<00:03:49.790> of<00:03:50.030> January<00:03:50.540> so<00:03:50.569> then<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.049> main

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
to the end of January so then the main

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.539 
to the end of January so then the main
structures<00:03:51.650> will<00:03:51.769> be<00:03:51.799> up<00:03:51.979> by<00:03:52.009> the<00:03:52.220> end<00:03:52.430> of

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
structures will be up by the end of

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.899 
structures will be up by the end of
January<00:03:53.060> with<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.449> with<00:03:53.689> the<00:03:53.810> new<00:03:53.989> roof

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
January with the with the new roof

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.039 
January with the with the new roof
structure<00:03:55.909> going<00:03:56.090> on<00:03:56.299> around<00:03:56.599> up<00:03:56.840> at<00:03:56.959> that

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
structure going on around up at that

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.610 
structure going on around up at that
point<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.150> stage<00:03:59.479> a<00:03:59.780> lot<00:04:00.229> of<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.439> work

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
point and that stage a lot of the work

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.289 
point and that stage a lot of the work
that<00:04:00.769> we'll<00:04:00.889> be<00:04:01.009> doing<00:04:01.159> won't<00:04:01.879> be<00:04:02.000> visible

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
that we'll be doing won't be visible

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.490 
that we'll be doing won't be visible
anymore<00:04:02.540> because<00:04:02.840> it'll<00:04:03.109> all<00:04:03.169> be<00:04:03.379> the

anymore because it'll all be the
internal<00:04:04.069> fit-out<00:04:04.280> work<00:04:04.729> which<00:04:05.000> will<00:04:05.209> be

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
internal fit-out work which will be

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.179 
internal fit-out work which will be
going<00:04:05.449> ahead<00:04:05.659> and<00:04:06.169> that'll<00:04:06.470> take<00:04:06.620> us<00:04:06.799> up<00:04:06.979> till
