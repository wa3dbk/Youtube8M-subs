00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
here is my solar panel my solar panel
goes<00:00:50.390> down<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.600> side<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.230> dashboard

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
goes down the side of my dashboard

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.990 
goes down the side of my dashboard
underneath<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.420> dashboard<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.629> goes<00:00:57.870> just

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
underneath my dashboard and it goes just

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.280 
underneath my dashboard and it goes just
over<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:01.020> cigarette<00:01:01.890> lighters<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:03.290> this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
over here to cigarette lighters but this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.800 
over here to cigarette lighters but this
is<00:01:04.500> my<00:01:04.739> second<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> second<00:01:06.450> place<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
is my second that's the second place it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.770 
is my second that's the second place it
goes<00:01:06.990> where<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.890> goes<00:01:08.130> before<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.600> see

I<00:01:16.710> installed<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.540> after<00:01:18.540> cuz<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.780> already

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
I installed this after cuz I already

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
I installed this after cuz I already
have<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> cigarette<00:01:19.710> lighter<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.520> but

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
I disconnected that one and I installed

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520 
I disconnected that one and I installed
the<00:01:23.610> four<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:24.960> we'll<00:01:25.110> actually<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the four right here we'll actually the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.710 
the four right here we'll actually the
other<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.799> went<00:01:25.950> bad<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> started<00:01:27.509> four

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
other one went bad but I started four

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.929 
other one went bad but I started four
right<00:01:27.930> here<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.829> way<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.369> always<00:01:29.759> have

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
right here so that way I always have

power<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.350> solar<00:01:31.590> panel<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.460> our

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
power this is my solar panel so our

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.170 
power this is my solar panel so our
solar<00:01:32.850> panel<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> directly<00:01:34.049> connected

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
solar panel is directly connected

solar panel is directly connected
underneath<00:01:36.180> my<00:01:36.900> dashboard<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:39.509> gonna

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
underneath my dashboard to and I'm gonna

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.859 
underneath my dashboard to and I'm gonna
take<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> around<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:44.610> goes<00:01:44.820> first<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.689> goes

take you around it goes first it goes
from<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> solar<00:01:46.470> panel<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.479> this<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:49.710> is

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
from the solar panel to this this is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.800 
from the solar panel to this this is
called<00:01:50.270> my<00:01:51.270> charge<00:01:51.570> controller

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
called my charge controller

basically<00:02:03.820> what<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.659> does<00:02:04.840> it's<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.200> trickle

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
basically what it does it's a trickle

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.309 
basically what it does it's a trickle
charges<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.180> solar<00:02:07.450> panel<00:02:07.869> comes<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.229> the

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
charges so the solar panel comes to the

controller your battery will blow up or
it<00:02:15.250> will<00:02:15.400> start<00:02:15.610> smoking<00:02:16.120> it'll<00:02:16.330> burn<00:02:16.540> out<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
it will start smoking it'll burn out you

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.500 
it will start smoking it'll burn out you
have<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.800> put<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.340> because<00:02:18.849> there's<00:02:19.239> no

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
have to put this on because there's no

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.259 
have to put this on because there's no
controlling<00:02:20.260> how<00:02:20.500> much<00:02:20.709> power<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
controlling how much power that the

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.530 
controlling how much power that the
solar<00:02:22.540> panel<00:02:23.080> converts<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.130> brings<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:25.150> to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
solar panel converts and brings in to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.400 
solar panel converts and brings in to
the<00:02:26.200> battery<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.489> this<00:02:27.850> is<00:02:28.090> it's<00:02:28.840> essential

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the battery so this is it's essential

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
the battery so this is it's essential
that<00:02:29.440> it's<00:02:29.739> between<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.430> battery<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
that it's between the battery and the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.350 
that it's between the battery and the
solar<00:02:31.959> panel<00:02:32.470> now<00:02:33.010> my<00:02:33.310> charge<00:02:33.610> controller<00:02:34.060> is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
solar panel now my charge controller is

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.309 
solar panel now my charge controller is
wired<00:02:34.780> into<00:02:35.470> my<00:02:35.500> battery<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.250> grounded<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
wired into my battery and grounded so it

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.229 
wired into my battery and grounded so it
trickle<00:02:38.830> charges<00:02:39.310> every<00:02:39.610> time<00:02:39.760> my<00:02:39.910> battery

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
trickle charges every time my battery

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.509 
trickle charges every time my battery
goes<00:02:40.540> down<00:02:40.840> if<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.410> left<00:02:41.620> my<00:02:41.709> lights<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.310> or

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
goes down if I left my lights on or

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.789 
goes down if I left my lights on or
something<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.230> or<00:02:44.230> anything<00:02:44.500> like

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
something like that or anything like

everything if you out in the daytime

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.740 
everything if you out in the daytime
you're<00:03:11.530> constantly<00:03:12.250> getting<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.480> light

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
you're constantly getting that the light

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.920 
you're constantly getting that the light
from<00:03:14.500> your<00:03:14.920> solar<00:03:15.160> panel<00:03:15.670> which<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.630> goes

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
from your solar panel which it goes

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.599 
from your solar panel which it goes
directly<00:03:17.170> into<00:03:17.739> your<00:03:17.769> charge<00:03:18.100> controller<00:03:18.519> and

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
directly into your charge controller and

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.370 
directly into your charge controller and
constantly<00:03:19.269> charging<00:03:19.480> your<00:03:19.780> batteries<00:03:20.200> so

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
constantly charging your batteries so

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.110 
constantly charging your batteries so
whereas<00:03:20.859> other<00:03:21.100> people<00:03:21.190> would<00:03:21.639> have<00:03:21.819> to<00:03:21.850> have

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
whereas other people would have to have

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.080 
whereas other people would have to have
some<00:03:22.389> kind<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:23.400> power<00:03:24.400> boost<00:03:24.790> or<00:03:25.000> something

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
some kind of power boost or something

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.580 
some kind of power boost or something
like<00:03:25.420> that<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.750> won't<00:03:25.900> ever<00:03:26.019> have<00:03:26.139> to<00:03:26.319> do<00:03:26.440> that

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
like that you won't ever have to do that

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.319 
like that you won't ever have to do that
because<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.100> have<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> boosting<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> Sun

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
because you have the boosting of the Sun

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.509 
because you have the boosting of the Sun
and<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.410> difference<00:03:29.829> is<00:03:29.980> for<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.310> lot<00:03:30.489> of

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
and the difference is for a lot of

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.259 
and the difference is for a lot of
people<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.359> in<00:03:31.600> their<00:03:32.019> situation<00:03:33.269> like

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
people is that in their situation like

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.000 
people is that in their situation like
if<00:03:34.420> you're<00:03:34.630> in<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.780> cold<00:03:35.019> area<00:03:35.319> or<00:03:35.709> something

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
if you're in a cold area or something

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.970 
if you're in a cold area or something
like<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.190> sure<00:03:37.060> your<00:03:37.359> battery<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.900> miss<00:03:38.739> if

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
like that sure your battery can miss if

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.640 
like that sure your battery can miss if
it's<00:03:39.190> being<00:03:39.340> cold<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:40.180> might<00:03:40.450> might<00:03:41.109> freeze<00:03:41.440> up

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
it's being cold it might might freeze up

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.140 
it's being cold it might might freeze up
on<00:03:41.859> you<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.220> might<00:03:42.400> not<00:03:42.549> get<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.880> juice

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
on you and you might not get that juice

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.240 
on you and you might not get that juice
but<00:03:43.569> if<00:03:43.720> it's<00:03:43.930> out<00:03:44.049> in<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.260> Sun<00:03:44.530> all<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.100> time

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
but if it's out in the Sun all the time

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.620 
but if it's out in the Sun all the time
and<00:03:45.639> is<00:03:45.700> getting<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.060> juice<00:03:46.359> and<00:03:46.480> their

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
power all the time coming to it it's

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.390 
power all the time coming to it it's
very<00:03:48.900> difficult<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.139> freeze<00:03:50.380> up<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.799> you<00:03:50.950> at

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
very difficult to freeze up on you at

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
any rate it comes from my battery then

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.120 
any rate it comes from my battery then
it<00:03:54.549> goes<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.730> my<00:03:55.630> cigarette<00:03:56.079> lighters<00:03:56.500> which<00:03:56.980> I

some important thing to have your solar
panel<00:04:13.370> it's<00:04:14.300> really<00:04:14.750> pretty<00:04:14.990> easy<00:04:15.140> I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
panel it's really pretty easy I

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.620 
panel it's really pretty easy I
basically<00:04:16.220> put<00:04:16.580> some<00:04:16.880> stickers<00:04:17.209> on<00:04:17.510> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
basically put some stickers on the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.080 
basically put some stickers on the
bottom<00:04:18.020> of<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:19.130> little<00:04:19.459> squares<00:04:19.790> of

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
bottom of it the little squares of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.530 
bottom of it the little squares of
velcro<00:04:20.810> stickers<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:22.280> this<00:04:23.030> can<00:04:23.240> be<00:04:23.390> removed

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
velcro stickers so this can be removed

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.640 
velcro stickers so this can be removed
at<00:04:23.960> any<00:04:23.990> time<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:25.580> can<00:04:25.730> see<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.500> see<00:04:27.500> my

at any time you can see that see my
velcro<00:04:27.950> stickers<00:04:28.670> so<00:04:29.270> they<00:04:29.480> can<00:04:29.690> be<00:04:29.840> removed

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
velcro stickers so they can be removed

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.200 
velcro stickers so they can be removed
solar<00:04:31.040> panel<00:04:31.340> could<00:04:31.430> be<00:04:31.520> taken<00:04:31.820> out<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.030> the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
solar panel could be taken out of the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.690 
solar panel could be taken out of the
window<00:04:32.510> at<00:04:32.600> any<00:04:32.690> time<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:33.680> it's<00:04:33.950> very<00:04:34.040> it's

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
window at any time but it's very it's

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.640 
window at any time but it's very it's
very<00:04:34.880> durable<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.660> can<00:04:35.840> take<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.500> take

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
very durable and it can take it and take

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.140 
very durable and it can take it and take
the<00:04:36.830> Sun<00:04:37.070> it's<00:04:37.250> made<00:04:37.400> out<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.640> plastic<00:04:38.120> and

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
the Sun it's made out of plastic and

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.420 
the Sun it's made out of plastic and
really<00:04:38.990> strong<00:04:39.200> plastic<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:39.830> can<00:04:39.950> take<00:04:40.160> a

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
really strong plastic that can take a

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.570 
really strong plastic that can take a
lot<00:04:40.730> of<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.970> sunlight<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.780> I'm<00:04:42.050> I'm<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.740> uh<00:04:42.770> on

lot of the sunlight and I'm I'm in uh on

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.240 
lot of the sunlight and I'm I'm in uh on
the<00:04:43.730> west<00:04:43.940> coast<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:44.510> it<00:04:44.870> is<00:04:45.470> getting<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.920> ton<00:04:46.220> of

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
the west coast so it is getting a ton of

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.760 
the west coast so it is getting a ton of
Sun<00:04:46.670> and<00:04:47.030> I'm<00:04:47.210> basically<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.110> could<00:04:48.290> run<00:04:48.740> my

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
Sun and I'm basically I could run my

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.130 
Sun and I'm basically I could run my
whole<00:04:49.130> system<00:04:49.430> all<00:04:50.240> day<00:04:50.540> as<00:04:50.600> long<00:04:50.840> as<00:04:50.990> I'm<00:04:51.110> in
