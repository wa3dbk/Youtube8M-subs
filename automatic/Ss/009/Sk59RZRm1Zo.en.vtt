00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.550
 Next personal speech a friend of ours 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.700
 spirit in the channel 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.160
 His name is Luiz Fernando 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:20.550
 She asked how do I go up and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.740
 lower the suspension of what made it fw 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.080
 06 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:30.330
 So I'm going to record this video here. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.600
 showing how you can download and then 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.600
 up car's suspension has're two to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 people work with two procedures there 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:46.110
 to make this change the car 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.340
 first the car can not have a base 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.050
 on a straight flat surface is so here 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.699
 I have a glass 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.399
 Here I have a glass so we have 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.899
 that put the car on the glass to regulate 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.180
 the height and height of the car to hit 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.700
 the sides on both sides can hold everything 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.200
 right 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.530
 a regular first show for you 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:20.820
 here's na on the bumper 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.420
 how much more are we down here? 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.810
 this piece that comes down the ones I walk 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.500
 will be further pressured by making 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.790
 that the damper is more 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.270
 it stretches so it gets harder and 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.360
 more stretched, this is one thing 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.310
 one of the things that helps make the car 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.689
 ride up 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.409
 Just so, I'm not just not 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.610
 a thing both in front and behind 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:59.280
 here's the time for rifle ak Ã³ 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.759
 well in that hole has a screw June 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.350
 inside there is 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.890
 this screw here if you push it 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.740
 he will come in more and more he will 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.340
 get out here down here 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.470
 I can not even pick it up and show it to you. 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.050
 here look here 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.950
 he is right here what he does he goes 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.770
 coming down here leaving here going down 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.320
 that will make up the suspension and will 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.030
 do not just pull up the proof is 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.840
 here he is here 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.170
 it will go up if you drop it it goes 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.030
 up year it goes up and apprehension 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.090
 It goes down but it 's how it goes. 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.650
 lowering it goes down alone not 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.290
 She will start to lower you more. 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.710
 intending the spring here because the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.240
 damper spring intending this 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.930
 part of the bumper here more for 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.700
 down will leave more then stretched with 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:11.070
 that his suspension will rise or 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:15.390
 let down well meaning here 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:18.060
 besides keeping the car harder, right? 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.190
 car bumper tougher than these 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.710
 here original balls they are soft I 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.690
 I think the screens would be mobile. 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.570
 a little harder 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.310
 if you have to work more here 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.700
 How are you in mine? Almost everyone. 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.240
 selected back here which in this case 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.920
 Here's what I have to do to 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.360
 turn more attention to the arm came 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.180
 further down 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.390
 I have to loosen that screw 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.700
 From here to make the arm, it's not for 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.640
 make this move up here 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.480
 I have to tighten the screw and the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.140
 front is no different is Luis in the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.460
 front it also has alternatives I 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.610
 I think we were in front of it does not rain 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:09.540
 I can not remember is in front he does not 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.940
 has a right screw my dog did 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.940
 down here in the 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.040
 front he does not have that screw leaves 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.310
 Until I confirm this so you do not talk. 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.550
 bullshit is in front he does not have the spindle 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.970
 from the front so what do you do? 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.230
 already ahead and almost basically 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.320
 It's only on the bumper you're rising, it's you. 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.730
 Up this part here are you showing 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.920
 up here 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.880
 it will automatically lower the 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.760
 suspension 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.020
 the front bumper it is smaller this 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.580
 piece here 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.880
 this piece here it is smaller with the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.980
 back then loosing here 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.350
 automatically it will go down if 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.440
 keeping almost everything tight it goes 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.220
 climb mine in my case here 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.400
 he's there're still only soft so he 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.260
 is almost at the maximum of the tightening here 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.120
 everything is almost maximum only in the 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.600
 front and almost mark on the back 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.880
 With that I'm keeping my car 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:17.100
 It's still a bit high up there. 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:20.100
 oh see he still picks up the ground and 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.840
 give some ugly scrapes to the floor 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.040
 although it has no way as much 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.980
 back like here in front of some 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:36.570
 things here by the pebble netÃ£o so in the 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:40.919
 front is only the rear shock 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.780
 you already control by the screw and 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.120
 bumper 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.229
