00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.680 
tell what that species composition of
the<00:01:31.030> harvest<00:01:31.480> is<00:01:31.660> so<00:01:32.760> that's<00:01:33.760> one<00:01:34.060> purpose<00:01:34.510> of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
the harvest is so that's one purpose of

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.530 
the harvest is so that's one purpose of
the<00:01:34.840> survey<00:01:35.290> but<00:01:35.920> then<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.640> age<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.330> sex

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
the survey but then the age and sex

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.210 
the survey but then the age and sex
information<00:01:38.050> is<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:39.660> value-added<00:01:41.220> age

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
information is a value-added age

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.280 
information is a value-added age
information<00:01:43.150> what<00:01:43.330> we're<00:01:43.510> able<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.900> tell<00:01:44.110> from

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
information what we're able to tell from

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.930 
information what we're able to tell from
these<00:01:44.470> parts<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.070> whether<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.490> bird<00:01:45.670> was<00:01:45.910> a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
these parts is whether the bird was a

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.210 
these parts is whether the bird was a
young<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.450> year<00:01:46.480> bird<00:01:46.990> or<00:01:47.260> an<00:01:47.590> adult<00:01:47.890> bird

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
young of the year bird or an adult bird

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.300 
young of the year bird or an adult bird
so<00:01:49.000> that<00:01:49.540> gives<00:01:49.930> us<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.350> pretty<00:01:50.530> good<00:01:50.680> index

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
so that gives us a pretty good index

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.150 
so that gives us a pretty good index
every<00:01:51.730> year<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.240> what<00:01:52.780> productivity<00:01:53.680> was<00:01:53.890> on

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
every year of what productivity was on
