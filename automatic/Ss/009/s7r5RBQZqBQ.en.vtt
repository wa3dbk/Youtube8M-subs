00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
 Blood and carnage. Mention of drugs. Intense violence. Bad language. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.760
 Another way to customize your gameplay 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.790
 in Modern Warfare 3 it's by your skills on every weapon 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.190
 We gave each weapon an experience bar 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.230
 Now, your weapon and your game we both have a level 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.810
 By increasing your level of play, you unlock all attachments or your camouflage 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.680
 it also unlocks one thing we added that we call experience on every weapon. 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.160
 This allows you to play better with the weapon you have chosen 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.950
 to advance with this weapon and the weapon itself becomes better. 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.030
 Weapon Qualifiers are improvements in your weapon, geared towards certain game styles 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 So for example I can unlock the recoil reduction 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.490
 and now my weapon will be more stable with less hindsight 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.670
 and this stability in shooting may make me a better player. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.310
 There are several skills by weapon like reducing recoil, 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.010
 reduce the swing of the weapon and some that are unique to each class. 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.180
 For example, the "Assault" class allows you to hold your breath, like the "Sniper" class. 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.650
 The SMG class has the ability to make melÃ©es faster. 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.820
 The LMG class has the ability to run faster. 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.520
 If you want to swing less, you can win it. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.340
 If you want more attachments, you can win it, you want less recoil, win it! 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.670
 The skills per weapon are great; you may have a favorite weapon 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.630
 but this weapon may not be the perfect weapon for every card or game mode. 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.640
 With the qualifiers weapon, I can customize this weapon a little more 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 and actually integrate it into different game styles and use it in different maps and game modes. 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.350
 We have brand new weapons in all categories: 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.760
 You have an SMG called PP90M, one of my favorites 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.520
 you have the FAR or "Fat Assault Rifle", brand new 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.460
 you have the "Bouncing Betty" grenade, a new type of fragmentation grenade 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.460
 there is the XM25, the new launcher. 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.100
 One of the last things we have is the EMP grenade. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.440
 So, it's similar to the flash grenade or the concussion grenade 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 but it works by disabling all the electronics around. 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.880
 Another new equipment we had and that I think people will really love is the trophy system. 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.520
 The trophy system is a fantastic portable anti-grenades device 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.090
 anti-RPG that you can use to defend a point. 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.090
 With all the new ways of playing, the level and the set of skills weapons equipment 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.230
 we really gave players all the tools to play the way they want to Call of Duty 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.200
 This game is full of new weapons for all players. It's super exciting. 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.290
