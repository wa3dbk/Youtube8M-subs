00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone here the george s good 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.529
 I bring a new video a very very video 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.019
 interesting and it's about how to get into 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.539
 the control tower and see everything all 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.179
 inside is pretty cool you'll see 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.830
 and good first thing we need to do 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 is to take this ramp to enter with a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.339
 bike we need a motorcycle and we have 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.800
 that kill someone to start a 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.929
 individual duel to death is worth for what 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.759
 so that when entering the base then 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.850
 do not leave us stars and do not screw us 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.920
 you both know cops not good 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.630
 when the game is already death 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 individual you take the motorcycle but you do not 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.470
 pass like me to look at the bus that I 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.810
 enter look at the motorcycle walking alone to 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.720
 down I pass it there to fast camera the 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.100
 motorcycle down there and I say what the fuck and 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.040
 well I climbed up and I say 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.160
 good uncle good I left aside 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.990
 you know that death has already begun 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.490
 individual the duel to death 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.610
 individual, well, we enter through the 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.070
 ramp here and as you already know that the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.420
 clichÃ© is to enter the tower because we 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.430
 we go to the tower and here I was 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.800
 little bit because I do not say where I'm from 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.210
 well we have to go to the tower and it's 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.820
 a vile and quite simple is not necessary 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.570
 no need the mobile phone and it does not 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.100
 nothing is missing simply that a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.580
 motorcycle a motorcycle is the only thing that is needed 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.900
 worth and dexterity with the bike for 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.550
 put them down this street because I am 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.010
 very awkward but good as you are seeing 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.479
 there in the background and the tower are going to flip 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.910
 when you see her inside because she is 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.330
 Pretty cool and quite curious because 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.160
 in the story mode, I do not think 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.960
 we got to see inside in no 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.930
 moment so it's very funny that it's 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.160
 everything so detailed everything so I do not know anymore 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.810
 you will see well then we are here and 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.980
 we see the green door what we have to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.100
 do is 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.350
 and what I have done or accelerate 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 against that gap there you will see it I leave 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.400
 of the motorbike and see where I appear or be 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.380
 we have already appeared below the tower 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.250
 as you see there the exit door here 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.690
 a detector against a metal detector 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.040
 here the guard said he was touching 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.300
 pushing eggs I tell myself what does the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.250
 newspaper I'm not going to kill him what I'm going to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.800
 get out cops now here is a mansalva 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.050
 and but good as you are seeing here in 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.280
 the surveillance cameras I say now to see 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.930
 if you can not be here here you can not 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.270
 enter here fire extinguishers or is everything 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.250
 detailed here the metal vector a 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.710
 bit false because I'm supposed to be 50 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.410
 weapons and I do not detect anything 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.850
 but it's good so look good 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.060
 I was investigating here and here I 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.190
 I found a class that will be where I do not know 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.590
 where the soldiers learn here 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.480
 Had the map come out Spain 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.120
 obviously you have the Spanish map 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 world if I do not go fabric then good I 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.810
 I still followed my way the truth 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.130
 quite interesting everything to remove the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.320
 stairs to climb to the top of the 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.120
 tower where the controllers are 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.620
 aerial is supposed and good here is 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.780
 rather curious fact that the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.490
 elevator will open since but good not 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.050
 It serves for nothing opens it closes because 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.550
 it does not take you anywhere and the guard 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.860
 be here watching me tell me dt kim al 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.620
 fuck your mule and the heaviest 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.670
 the good thing here climbing ladder for the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.010
 I do the trick and want to 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.850
 stairway I tell you that the three minutes do not 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.600
 nobody takes it from you 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.980
 or this is a little frustrating 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.650
 had this ladder because they are 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.970
 seven plants and it fucks a lot so what 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.520
 pass fast cameras and I can not be done 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.250
 this with long trip but good as 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.030
 you see is all detailed 4 floor plant 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.250
 ts I do not know it seems that everything was decided 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.930
 that was going to come out in the online gta 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.880
 I do not know maybe they put some 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.050
 update that we will have to use 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.420
 part of the map but well we have already 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.580
 uploaded and as you see here we have 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.460
 the final staircase and here we enter and we 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.460
 we found the camera is good 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.560
 camera the room is with windows 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.780
 that are not the top one at all and 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.670
 as you see here we see everything we can see 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.890
 everything that is outside can not be killed 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.530
 to nobody from here here the this that 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.260
 it seems not a document I do not know here 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.610
 very all very curious very interesting and 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.610
 the truth that everything is very detailed 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.700
 all the chairs the tables all everything or 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.650
 be amazing but then I realized 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.820
 that I had used the elevator 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.260
 I would have taken here directly not 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.210
 I would have had to be eight hours 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.740
 going up stairs because I do not know how to try it 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.940
 you because I 've already tried it and 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.940
 I had to climb all the good stairs 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.260
 here I found myself already the last room is worth 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.460
 they were of state the world here loads me 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.020
 these two because I say do not go to 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.730
 spend the same as before the race ended 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.410
 individual death and already four 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.180
 pull stars so good you 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.590
 I recommend doing it fast but good 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.810
 here here is where the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.420
 very interesting air traffic controllers 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.560
 all this the truth I liked a lot 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.840
 this 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.870
 it's not a good it's glitch and a trick to 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.139
 enter the military tower and the truth 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.570
 which is very very interesting so 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.100
 well I bring it pretty trick 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.050
 interesting I hope he does and that you 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.730
 has served that has liked a like 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.760
