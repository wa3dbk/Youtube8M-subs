00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:11.690
 Well when it was decided to appear 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:14.650
 As for the place of the festival here of the woman's line of the Japanese version Asakura of the rider that I play that seems to be east 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.650
 With that feeling I was able to go to the scene 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.039
 Well I was glad to be cast 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.010

 I combined the picture of Japan 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:44.230
 Is reminiscent of Power Rangers theater in and the fact that that Well new remake 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.480
 Contents so as to very that 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:52.300
 Demonstrate that the attraction becomes better by fusing more than looking for the difference 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.620
 Is my personal attraction 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.590

 It is a bad example 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.700
 No but really that mix even though I'm Well that obvious, such as to extend overseas drama 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.720
 But I thing called Rider you are familiar from childhood child is reflected in the eye 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.100
