 sent mailings nothing or functional portelo 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.820
 asked I frame what difference there is 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.070
 between your course and other courses that you can 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.410
 find on the street and good input 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.540
 there are many 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.010
 in my memories on the street the fear 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.890
 makes it directly our 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.550
 facilities or through us what 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.320
 second the difference of the courses that 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.400
 you can find out there in others 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.560
 places 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.840
 and nothing else will teach you how to do 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.789
 channel tacos 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.100
 here I'll teach you how to make the tacos 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.549
 of basket but apart in two models 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.109
 more I'll teach you how to do business 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.229
 this is more valuable than learning to do 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:26.689
 basket tacos and I'll explain why 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.810
 Many people believe that knowing a recipe 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.350
 will be successful in your business is a 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.659
 very big mistake today business 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.299
 especially the food business if you 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.819
 you are going to compete against companies that 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.310
 they have very good marketing very good 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.039
 organization very good management very good 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.689
 presentation you will not be able to compete yet 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.689
 have the best recipe 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.670
 how many times have you entered a 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.890
 taqueria where you see that there is a lot 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.830
 people 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.420
 tickets you order an order of tacos are the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.120
 you eat and you realize that the tacos 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.450
 they knew badly the tacos you did not like wow 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.450
 this to cost bad then explain me 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.610
 how is it that they had so many people because 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.260
 that's why you came true many times 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.270
 they are stretches because we see many people 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.880
 and as there are many people we are 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.190
 convinced that it is very surely is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.580
 very good product we try it and we 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.140
 we realize that the product is very 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.989
 true good then it means that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.810
 the success of this one wanted in particular not 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.470
 depends on your recipe depends on other 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.440
 things but not your recipe the second 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.470
 account our centered a place that 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.930
 It is empty but what to eat delicious 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.690
 has happened in after somewhere where you go 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.209
 to enter you eat and eat very rich I had 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.190
 very good seasoning and very good flavor one 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.290
 Very rich food at a good price 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.569
 affordable price a good service a 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.269
 good deal the business is empty 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.280
 it's already happened because there they have the best 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.900
 recipe but they do not have sales of anything 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.349
 it's good because in two or three months they're going to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.319
 close 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.030
 I do not want that I'm going to teach you to 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.280
 make basket cues at 23 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.260
 months would be crazy it would not serve 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.180
 nothing what we in a personal group 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.620
 we are working ourselves better by 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.569
 business support our intention 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.579

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.439
 number of people in the past 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.769
 news recent years today 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.299

 they live quietly talking about 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.020

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.050
 certainties and they will be created in this 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.150

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.800
 something guaranteed for you tell you in 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.210
 this moment that a whole correct 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.130
 they're going to run some day that you're going to 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.650
 accumulate obstacles accumulated someday a 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.970
 some day what will happen next that 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.160
 after I do not know where it says 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.410
 uncertainty that you already have your business 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.030
 working for you that you have an income 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.610

 this is one of the is one of the topics 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.270
 that I like to talk with people 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.009
 especially from your base an example in the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.600
 case of people who are in Mexico do not 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.400
 It matters in what state but in Mexico 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.990
 American regions I'll ask you 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.330
 something how many oxxo stores do you know 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.680
 how many oxxo stores do you know in this 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.120
 moment 5 10 15 20 320 oxxo stores 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.389
 how many times the owner of the oxxo store 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.880
 has reached states that you know 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.130
 never exposed in australia and be 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.870
 making money every day because if 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.070
 he can be in australia and win 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.099
 money every day you can not do it 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.990
 you just because you do not know how 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.430
 do it and that's precisely one of the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.009
 points about the values ​​that we 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.780
