 Hey guys! I am Davide (10BRA). 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.080
 Today I will teach you the Ronaldinho Flick Up. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.020
 Ronaldinho showed this trick when he was in charge of the Brazilian national team 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 and Barcelona has played. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.700
 Let's take a look at the trick together. Follow me! :) 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.840
 The first step is very simple. Just roll the ball to the side of your body. 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.380
 Make sure the ball does not turn away from your body when rolling. 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.860
 Ok guys, I hope so far everything clear. 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 After you have rolled the ball forward, the ball stops with the outer crotch of the other foot. (Lean) 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 Ok guys. Let us now come to the last and most difficult step of the trick. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.480
 If you are on the ball with the outside roll, pull it back and lift the ball 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.940
 by going under the ball and then continue normal juggling.
