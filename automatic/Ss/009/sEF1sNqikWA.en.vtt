00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 a pretty smile necessarily not 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.480
 it requires having perfect teeth without 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.099
 However it is important that you take care of them 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.170
 to be able to smile without any 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.480
 worry wash your teeth so 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 less three times a day is something very 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.379
 simple but that is definitely the factor 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.210
 most important to the appearance 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.520
 hygiene of our teeth use 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.420
 baking soda this will allow 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.450
 your teeth stay white 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.369
 apples carrots and celery have 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.260
 an exfoliating effect that helps remove 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.310
 the stains of the teeth so 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.310
 consider those in your diet 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.880
 On the other hand dark drinks 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 They tend to dye our clients for 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.680
 avoid this baby with a sorbet 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.000
 having white teeth is a very 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.489
 important to have security for 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.440
 smile you can opt for a process of 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.750
 bleached at home or visiting your 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.820
 dentist either works 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.629
 it just depends on how much money 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.629
 you can invest 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 this process at home that I got is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 practical first you have to dry your 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.160
 teeth then you have to apply 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.150
 vitamin gives your gums so that it does not 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.150
 mistreat by whitening 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.040
 then you just have to apply the gel 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.370
 bleach on your teeth with the help 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.370
 of a brush 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.600
 finally you have to place a light 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.280
 for 20 minutes on your teeth or 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.010
 simply place it between your lips 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.970
 which looks very funny and ready 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.100
 brush your teeth and they will be whiter 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.350
 We can not ignore the lakes 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.200
 I mix a little olive oil with 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.250
 granulated sugar uses this mixture as 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.250
 exfoliating for the lips 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.979
 when they are soft, wet them with a 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.979
 little Vaseline 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.030
 and help yourself with cold colored lipsticks 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.979
 to neutralize any yellow tone 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.660
 of the teeth if you do not know how to do it 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.150
 check the link that I left in the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.340
 description of this video finally yes 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.860
 you have to take some pictures relax 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.630
 and loosen your lips close your eyes and 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.190
 when you open them, you will be ready to 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.260
 smile calmly 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.910
 never forget that there is nothing else 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.910
 beautiful than a unique smile
