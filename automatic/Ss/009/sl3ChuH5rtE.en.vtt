00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.519
 two 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.409
 good as well you know the summer we had it in floors the north pole of lion 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.829
 and I'm going to take advantage of the fact that we have a wood-fired oven to prepare a stuffed chicken 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.720
 the first thing I do is always for the oven if what I do is peter brooms 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.329
 to have a lot of flame during this visit casyc 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.660
 that if I get more than 100 streets 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.040
 while we are going to smear the chicken well 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.109
 with butter 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.539
 and one of the things that I learned lately is to tell it not only because 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.140
 outside but also inside that is to say under the skin 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.030
 and the truth is that it is much more crispy 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 Moscow 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.400
 min 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 in this sense 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.220
 and I'm going to fill it with some raindrops 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.640
 the cloves of garlic and peel 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.930
 and an apple 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 finish 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.250
 we had a fire 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 all this mexicalenses accompanying 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.550
 His world 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.070
 we are going to solve 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
 the consumption 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.059
 and like any other no percent up to 11 hours 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.549
 this as if the homework probably 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.939
 then use ips the grid and under the tray 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.340
 It is important that you and the air under the chicken because if it is done in a 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.249
 report 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.929
 if this were conventional, it would be about ten minutes 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.509
 soweto patronos 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.589
 150 degrees pebble for a couple of hours or more 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.729
 winds you can read a book write a thesis the two detainees 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.559
 Moscow - 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.489
 but it's very important that every 20 minutes half an hour rocky hill in the 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.719
 chicken with 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.719
 when the soldiers 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.449
 in this way it will be much tastier and more crunchy 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.479
 and not beating because you have to be on guard but the result with 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.959
 Facebook 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.179
 do not 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.559
 and there it is 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.239
 and here presented 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.339
 with the filling 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:51.759
 I hope you like a hug until then 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.949
