 there is no remedy to cure 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.690
 leishmaniasis in dogs use medication to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.220
 human animals put at risk the health 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.690
 of the population, the Ministry of Health

 internet ongs and associations post photos 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.210
 dogs who, according to them, managed to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.730
 cure with human remedy allopurinol a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 used to treat uric acid and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.090
 kidney stones 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.399
 the health ministry bans 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.590
 treatment of dogs with leishmaniasis with 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.190
 medicines used in humans and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 requires that sick animals be 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.690
 sacrificed a controversial policy of 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.570
 confronting the disease which reveals that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.449
 there is no consensus on the subject is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.100
 obedience is a decision 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.399
 really that would leave the lady very 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.229
 sad I would let you leave it is difficult 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.020
 try to treat him to the end 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.510
 I would in no way sacrifice for 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.290
 a determination 70 attraction 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.750
 maybe he suffered a lot I would take oo 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.250
 the sacrifice to not see him suffer 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.950
 now if I had other alternatives 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.650
 should look for leishmaniasis is a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 a serious illness that strikes dogs and can 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.340
 pass to humans 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.329
 when untreated can lead to death 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.759
 up to 90% of cases it is caused by a 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.579
 mosquito known as 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.670
 there is a vaccine that is a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.380
 important protection tool that is 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.970
 the owner finds in the clinics 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.009
 particular 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.950
 there are also repellents in the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.649
 mosquito straw use human remedy in 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 dogs how this disease fits like 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.460
 Crime in Brazil 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.250
 the penalty varies from one month to one 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.740
 prison plus fine the vet 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.969
 you may also lose the record in the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.549
 regional Council of Medicine 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.890
 our recommendation is that 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.280
 they report with an attorney 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.319
 confidence 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.539
 how to proceed also with the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.060
 owner so that he has the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.180
 tools that guarantees the right 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.030
 treated for months. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.180
 jonara suffered from the thought of having to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.760
 sacrifice abbas and six-year-old madonna 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.880
 the dog contracted leishmaniasis and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.800
 recommendation of several veterinarians was 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.720
 the same is the only thing they only know 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.020
 talk let's kill 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.900
 Let's take life and never give you a chance. 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.640
 light at the end of the tunnel only one 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.519
 particular said that there was a 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.560
 possibility of cure he asked if the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.690
 nose was willing to take the risk of 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.890
 treatment because there is no efficacy 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.170
 proved the day-laborer accepted was the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.090
 The only one who told me has no need 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.120
 sacrifice that has healing has 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.440
 treatment for three years the madonna bitch 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 took a medicine 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.780
 leonardo and other dog owners do not 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.050
 have an idea of how much this treatment 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.170
 may be harmful to the population at 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.870
 Sometimes you see the animal apparently 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.120
 beautiful and it is a vector is a 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.540
 potential reservoir of the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.670
 leishmaniasis is a potential risk 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.870
 for its owner who has rain 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.799
 your loved one 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.620
 the highly potential animal in China and 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.870
 a risk to animals that are only god 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.850
 the fernanda veterinarian who is the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.950
 project coordinator of the association 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.950
 humanitarian protection and welfare 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.859
 Animal says euthanasia is not 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.320
 best solution for disease control 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.019
 this does not work if the country wants 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.049
 address the issue of leishmaniasis right 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.810
 then other measures would be much more 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.250
 not efficient for what we are 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.470
 May Brazil spend its resources 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.260
 financial institutions to invest in other 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.290
 as the control of the vector itself that the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.530
 mosquito straw we even understand who 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.260
 has an animal with all the affection and tem 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.420
 to lose but to benefit himself 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.700
 so it's a job that is done 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.329
 only the benefit to humans but 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.750
 benefit of animals living together free 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.750
 of disease
