00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 something else for a bigger project 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.390
 to give more time in production 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.490
 I've made the decision one 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 give small insight how I 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.389
 mass of the method used 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.190
 I do not want to be right away 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.320
 claim that the approach of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 I have it on my own 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.490
 developed and who exactly the same 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.630
 I do not automatically do that 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.230
 taken away a case 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.060
 So stay cool then good 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.910
 Let's start with the preparations 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.579
 First of all, he needs a lot 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 can patience during the process 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.090
 It certainly happens that she already 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.090
 after a few, a barn 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.430
 found or only after 1500 euro 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 you do not know it you should 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.360
 already set a lot like 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.550
 much you want to bring in the day 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.110
 I restrict myself, for example, per day 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.239
 at about 100 euro 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.559
 but it is up to each one how 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.140
 a lot you want to test 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.390
 It's pretty important to source 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 they have distracted you by the way 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.449
 Pretty much everyone shines their hand 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.449
 does not focus 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.420
 I'm not talking about the spasmodic shiny 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.150
 looking for distraction as it can eg 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.490
 videos are music or tv 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.439
 As I said, it is up to you again 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 For example, look at either French or one 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.420
 youtube video and now we come to the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.340
 Preparations in the game after we get together 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.049
 realize that they are not in us 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.420
 Mobile looking or cramping 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.070
 should despair for the mass of 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.040
 First and foremost we need method 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.350
 internet on our 3ds as an example 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.210
 a successful masuda method 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.140
 By the way, I play the excel 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.750
 take 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.610
 we need internet to get into the gts too 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.140
 arrive or possible passers-by or 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 friends from abroad after one 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.670
 to ask foreign pokémon 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.740
 on the spot offers either one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 foreign tito that pretty much 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.180
 compatible with any pokémon or 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.320
 the pokémon that you have a genie 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.630
 would like to use 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.579
 a little tip there not all 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.829
 is aware of a German and 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.079
 Foreign blood gets a lot 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.479
 faster than a German view and a 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.130
 foreign threatened is important too 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.670
 that they are twice plus each male 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.009
 and are female and now things are coming 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.069
 the one at the breeding 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.810
 can get to heavy debris for 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.239
 the normal pokémon players are these 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.310
 steps not necessary who is a 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.590
 strong pokémon wants to have too 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.560
 always keep an eye on which ingredients 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.510
 might be helpful with the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.430
 makes items or the father to knot 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.480
 You can also get maximum tv value 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.340
 be bred 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.190
 there are more detailed in google 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.930
 need instructions as next point 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.700
 we a pokémon which the attack 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.470
 mastered flying and ability 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.790
 flames possesses body around us 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.480
 to halve entry 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.190
 to recommend is a venture or 4 who 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.049
 his eggs are still ticking fast 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.209
 I want to reprimand the brut I recommend 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.040
 power is also here google your friends 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.859
 Tellelf if you do not know how to do it 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.200
 I personally use this power 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.450
 this force is not because she thinks the process 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.310
 for a short time and right and permanent 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.780
 that we have to change the breed now 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.549
 force again 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.190
 The effect only lasts for a few minutes 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.620
 In addition, you also need 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.810
 enough points to activate bread power 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.760
 These feel up only after the time 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.370
 and now come with distance 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.150
 most important item we breed on 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.199
 every case requires the bike 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.540
 you need an empty one for that, too 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.560
 box to collect your made and 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.079
 to sort 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.290
 let's count on what we do now 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:34.040
 All you need for the mass method 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.470
 patience distraction two rooms the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.750
 Optionally also seeks attaches beings or 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.000
 maximum values ​​to the budweiser color 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.489
 with the help of various teams a pokémon 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.849
 fly along and flames body and as well 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.379
 Optionally the bread power of a bicycle and 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.769
 at least one empty box 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.810
 as far as everything goes well then it can now 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.169
 continue with the procedures 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.269
 Step 1 You give your two problems 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.909
 at the pension from one thing to each 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.949
 case a foreign pokémon has to be 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.199
 at this point would also have the father 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.940
 knot or making far and forever 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.310
 give stone to the breeding pokémon 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.169
 it is irrelevant which point you are looking for 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.449
 knot the fatum or what does it matter? 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.199
 However, whoever continues to give the thing 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.030
 wants to inherit 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.130
 there must pay attention that the pokémon 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.560
 that was to bequeath 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.990
 owns the eternal stone carries 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.760
 Step 2 is swinging on your bike 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.639
 and so long until your team on 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.530
 fully mature is so five pieces that 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.440
 only pokémon to your team four 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.900
 years or there it will be tick if you 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.910
 You have five eggs in the empty box 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.620
 from here you can also with the help of 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.480
 highlight green buttons and four 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.400
 pokémon new at the same time in the box 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.560
 push there button appears by the way 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.660
 only if you have the option pokemon 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.050
 take the place of pokémon 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.330
 Stick step 4 repeatedly 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.280
 so far a box full or more 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.650
 but here is again to note that 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.210
 We do not have too many orders otherwise it can 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.860
 it may well be that after the 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.410
 third 1 seems the scripture and you 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.600
 still just under testing is pretty 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.820
 Annoying affair as the eggs 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.610
 I can not even release her now 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.979
 a box so 30 eggs to stow and 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.490
 to have five more eggs in the team with it 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.100
 you have a total of 35 eggs step 5 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.200
 if you have 35 eggs you open up 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.780
 the way to illuminati the city ​​center 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.789
 top driver direction prism tom process 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.100
 and start to turn several rounds 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.169
 and to test the first five eggs 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.539
 as another tip is recommended 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.789
 copper sleeve so 1 1 to 5 cents piece 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.710
 which you put in the sliding pad 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.990
 so you do not hold down any key 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.150
 must and your character automatically 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.070
 moving in a circle also notices that they 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.520
 you are no one in the middle of it 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.470
 jostled step sex are all five 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.510
 you hatched on this ride 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.000
 exit towards where two people on 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.100
 outer edge rides that 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.810
 pokémon center into it and trade yours 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.760
 hatched pokémon with the help of 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.680
 options pokémon move against the 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.780
 pokémon out and drive back to 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.590
 Stadtring where the prism tower is 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.539
 is located and repeats the city of 56 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.940
 Step 7 when all eggs are formed 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.550
 and none of the 35 eggs hatched a 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.520
 genie means means with the help of 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.130
 lr dust and select by now you have 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.169
 automatically no 35 polished pokémon 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.889
 notices and could again with step 2 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.870
 begin 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.700
 but it is important that you are the first 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.979
 pokal have saved before you 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.770
 refuses because it is always about 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:32.990
 the same pokémon act if you now 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.600
 with patience, these steps repeated there 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.280
 will eventually be lucky too 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.370
 have a genie pokémon welcome too 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.050
 allow for a less motivation here 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.710
 a small part of my level 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.500
 which after 246a in my livestream 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.850
 hatched 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.690
 it's like giving and taking 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.690
 I say I like that 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.200
 yes well in the login 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.840
 that immediately in the arena fight in any case 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:12.270
 a cherry andré compelling as can such a 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:18.670
 match play 950 land farmers here last 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:20.530
 I have to slow once is real 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.210
 Me with me and I had two three times 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.420
 Master tried two times I am 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.420
 full 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:57.280
 what once only samarra I have to 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:59.260
 press enter after 246 I hope so 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.090
 could help you a little bit and would 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.380
 me over a thumb high and a part 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:06.480
 of the video 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.480
 until next time euro
