00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 the price of natural gas sold in brazil 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.650
 should increase from 15% to 25% above 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.929
 inflation in the next two years to 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.690
 Petrobras justifies the need for 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.420
 readjustment due to the increase in 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.189
 concern for industries 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.900
 which use natural gas and for 1 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 million drivers 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.449
 they use gnv as fuel meet 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.390
 the government's own propaganda for the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.270
 need to pollute less and spend 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 even less 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.309
 in a year the fleet of cars moved to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.190
 Brazilian natural gas grew 20% 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.530
 increased from 1 million and 250 thousand 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 and a half million vehicles what more 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 encouraged conversions in workshops 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.120
 was the average price of fuel up to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.070
 40% cheaper than gasoline 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.550
 the government's decision to discourage 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.070
 new adaptations worries those who have already 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.809
 investment the lack of respect for the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.210
 people once again did not have a problem 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.489
 alcohol in the mouth of the stage is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.619
 problem with comgás nothing series belief 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.140
 which identifies the type of energy is 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.659
 reliable today for example gasoline 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.700
 depends on international 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.909
 investment of petrobras and etc. and such 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 the gas that has emerged as an alternative return 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.729
 in this circumstance then it is complicated 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 for us right? 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.890
 conversion is installed a cylinder that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.470
 stores natural gas in the trunk of the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.049
 car a paula of supply and a 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.470
 pressure reducer are connected to the motor 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.180
 to the car panel is coupled a sensor 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.920
 warning that the fuel 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 It's coming to an end. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.659
 the use of natural gas does not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.390
 alcohol or gasoline supply 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.340
 for the president of petrobras the use of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.500
 natural gas as fuel is 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.930
 inadequate the power of a car 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.750
 fueled by natural gas fell on average 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.420
 15% and the cost to install the cylinder 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.170
 varies from 3 thousand to 4 thousand and five hundred 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.990
 real 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.049
 but this adaptation can only be done in 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.270
 workshops certified by inmetro 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.879
 according to the manager of this workshop in 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.520
 before the crisis in the sector were 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.010
 made eight conversions per month 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.440
 now the movement has declined anyway 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.050
 he believes that because it is more economical 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.060
 natural gas will overcome this crisis 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.410
 Although the gas here in Brazil does not have 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.720
 nothing to do with this political crisis 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.060
 because it is 100% national 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.940
 evidently that this news has impacted 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.400
 negatively in demand but not in 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.200
 from the next days when the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.690
 consumer sees that it has no relation 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.250
 none with the crisis of Bolivia with 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.720
 Our supply in Brasilia this 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.030
 situation will change we expect that 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.760
 Yes, but this industry expert 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.040
 does not see a favorable scenario and 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.230
 condemns the use of natural gas 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.190
 in the Brazilian case it has no 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.710
 meaning you an energetic paradise is 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.520
 tropical neki with clean energies 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.220
 renewable energy that can be 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.740
 while there is sun you have energies 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.250
 of vegetable origin as is the case with 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.420
 of alcohol and is the case of the oils 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.220
 vegetables ne 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.760
 countries that do not have the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.510
 will have to be subordinated to 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.900
 these difficulties is polluting of 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.030
 lack of gas that the world is going to run 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.320
 huh 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.690
 is in our studio in são paulo 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.220
 journalist mário de almeida commentator 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.260
 from the newspaper of the gazette 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.190
 romario or you have practically 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.250
 anticipated that it was formally announced 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.650
 that the rise in the price of gas 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.170
 taking into account the question of 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.010
 subsidy that was that half truth 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.190
 or nobody knows if nobody knows 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.180
 now everything comes back knowing indignant with 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.900
 reason 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.540
 there is the energy issue in Brazil when 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.670
 it comes to liquid fuels is 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.680
 synonym of petrobras the reportage 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.510
 previous showed the power of the company 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.900
 new discoveries 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.680
 In addition petrobras has the pipes 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.400
 ships 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.000
 the refineries tanks and petrobras 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.160
 he had been coming for a couple of years now 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.130
 grumbling against the table 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.300
 of the natural gas that has been 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.880
 imposed on the head by the government 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.530
 central 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:34.220
 this is one of those typical situations 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.900
 Difficulty of Brazilians Brazil 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.290
 independent party citing 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.110
 opposition or the situation to plan 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.560
 because gas from bolivia began to arrive 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.740
 In Brazil in 1999 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.700
 discovered that as soon as it was too much gas 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.310
 on occasion for little use and petrobras 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:01.380
 had signed a contract to pay a 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:05.570
 guaranteed price whether or not that gas 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.780
 then the central government there in Brasilia 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:13.640
 told Petrobras to facilitate the use of 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.970
 vehicular natural gas by installing 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.190
 especially in Rio de Janeiro and 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.310
 working on a price list that 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.960
 represented a discount already the price of 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.480
 natural gas at that time 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.410
 since natural gas has tripled from 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.870
 price and the table was being corrected 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.860
 slowly and Petrobras responding 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.110
 with it and now won the stop 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.310
 Casão none for now we grumble 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:48.080
 talk about this great discovery that was 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:51.000
 announced a new field of tupi and 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.200
 point of the minister dilma rousseff ter 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.220
 said that this discovery is new 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.400
 oil reserve will change the profile 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.400
 energy of Brazil, there is an exaggeration in 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.510
 Minister has reason ps is a reservation 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.120
 which alone means taking a point 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.830
 between the minimum and maximum 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:21.110
 of 10 years of consumption in Brazil 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:23.700
 alone in Brazil has a misery in the sea 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.980
 Saints if you suspected that now you're fine. 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.890
 finding 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:32.250
 will find many other reserves 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:35.490
 Petrobras today announced a reserve 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:39.600
 22 billion barrels of reserves have 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:42.330
 more oil than the shell or 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.470
 than the action or axé wu 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:50.430
 that is, it has more oil than the sisters 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.730
 great sisters of the oil oligopoly 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.940
 that rules the planet 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:07:01.470
 In this situation, Brazil will spend more 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:05.310
 gasoline plus oil goes now to petrobras 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:08.550
 with oil at $ 100 out there and 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.130
 sometimes being able to raise the 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.830
 you can probably climb up the 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.950
 Brazil should export Brazil should 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.030
 save this oil for another 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.070
 occasion 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.090
 this is a decision that requires 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:27.210
 planning and above all people who 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:30.210
 of the subject without half truths 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.670
 is an extraordinary situation your 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.250
 reserves are worth today's price 1 trillion 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:38.310
 and a half dollars 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.470
 It is a money that represents almost the pib 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.080
 from Brazil in a single year 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:47.160
 is one of those moments that our country 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.840
 70 years ago I hoped the reason is a 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.520
 great celebration 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.520
 Thank you, good night
