00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.590
 well what can I say a match with something like 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:17.400
 previous missed because of the standard and 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:22.680
 knew how to rival on such standards and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 on a terrible mistake to give 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.460
 transfer bottom 300 to the opponent's leg 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.269
 well what will you do the kingdom is not enough and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.870
 I will say that in general 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.809
 probably to score goals 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.300
 we still say inexperienced 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.250
 football players ahead and i have so much 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.710
 masters view and because the prerequisites 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.559
 there is see again 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.550
 rod again backache of this filing all 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.160
 like there are blows but not enough 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.230
 accented hit 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.090
 here I can not recipe anything one that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.420
 if the team wants to play positional 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.239
 attack naturally naturally very difficult 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.519
 put such a game because there is 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.310
 benefits of owning a sword 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.060
 the ball is delivered in the penalty but further yes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.320
 there are still problems so we hope 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.710
 that all the same we will shift this component 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.280
 these honest of us are easier to play of course 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.820
 but more so let's say not so high 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.170
 on another half after the team 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.440
 and how high level of aging or 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.500
 no no counterattack will beat 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.500
 here in the midst of more teamwork 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.900
 but more here are the commands you speak with 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.080
 the future and the dance floor to drink the game 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.080
 still 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.740
 you know let's just not be on this one 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.950
 talk at the press conference 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.330
 After urinating my now all plans 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.330
 land and that is, I hope everything will be 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.180
 what will happen next 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:15.350
 so everything is bad but of course the team 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:22.300
 does not win all the same 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:24.950
 agreed not to comment 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.660
 know now what you say and don't care 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.990
 everything will turn against 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.050
 because let's say 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.420
 there is an arrangement here yes I'm going 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.930
 now home and just can not 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.920
 to say that I will send away Minsk there 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.970
 Dynamo yes but there Moscow guarantee 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.560
 the dynamo cannot in any case 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.280
 say what will happen tomorrow is still unknown 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.130
 so here so let's just 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.310
 i hear i work here and comment 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.310
