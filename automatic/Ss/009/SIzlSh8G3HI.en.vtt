00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
doorway over there you come into this

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.289 
doorway over there you come into this
building<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> ton<00:01:12.240> of

building there are actually a ton of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179 
building there are actually a ton of
boxes<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.350> Japanese<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.159> a

boxes in here that are Japanese for a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
boxes in here that are Japanese for a
glitch<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.330> obvious<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
glitch so it is pretty obvious that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there and this is a really nice jump

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.350 
there and this is a really nice jump
shot<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.860> broken-down<00:01:32.250> bus<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
shot from this broken-down bus and you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.520 
shot from this broken-down bus and you
can<00:01:33.479> probably<00:01:33.720> fire<00:01:33.990> off<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> nice<00:01:34.380> little
