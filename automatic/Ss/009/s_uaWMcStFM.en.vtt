that's a very big concession on the
Chinese<00:02:48.269> part<00:02:48.599> so<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.079> think<00:02:49.200> both<00:02:49.470> sides

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
Chinese part so I think both sides

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.039 
Chinese part so I think both sides
really<00:02:50.370> realize<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.819> importance<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
really realize the importance of the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.319 
really realize the importance of the
relationship<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.859> as<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.040> tell<00:02:53.640> my<00:02:53.700> students

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
relationship and as I tell my students

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.750 
relationship and as I tell my students
who<00:02:55.260> ask<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.769> China<00:02:56.099> going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.430> eat<00:02:56.579> our<00:02:56.730> lunch

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
who ask is China going to eat our lunch

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.289 
who ask is China going to eat our lunch
and<00:02:57.629> if<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.230> when<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.799> say<00:02:59.129> well<00:02:59.340> you<00:03:00.150> know<00:03:00.299> I

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
and if so when I say well you know I

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.119 
and if so when I say well you know I
think<00:03:03.299> it's<00:03:03.690> probably<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.140> good<00:03:04.379> idea<00:03:04.440> to

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
think it's probably a good idea to

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.009 
think it's probably a good idea to
invite<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.640> Chinese<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.269> lunch<00:03:06.599> table

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
invite the Chinese to the lunch table

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.890 
invite the Chinese to the lunch table
and<00:03:07.260> maybe<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.250> offer<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:09.239> know<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.420> share

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
and maybe to offer you know to share

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.259 
and maybe to offer you know to share
with<00:03:10.170> them<00:03:10.409> a<00:03:10.440> few<00:03:10.980> potato<00:03:11.310> chips<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.909> Oreo

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
with them a few potato chips and Oreo

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.599 
with them a few potato chips and Oreo
cookies<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.530> think<00:03:13.980> your<00:03:14.160> peanut<00:03:14.430> butter

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
cookies but I think your peanut butter

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.610 
cookies but I think your peanut butter
and<00:03:14.790> jelly<00:03:14.970> sandwiches<00:03:15.510> are<00:03:15.690> safe<00:03:15.930> for<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.440> long

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
and jelly sandwiches are safe for a long

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.220 
and jelly sandwiches are safe for a long
time<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:17.040> come
