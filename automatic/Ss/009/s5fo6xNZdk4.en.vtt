reference<00:02:09.180> again<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.780> yes<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:10.619> we

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
reference again and yes this is what we

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.350 
reference again and yes this is what we
saw<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.040> Milwaukee<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> Chicago<00:02:11.670> now<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
saw in Milwaukee and Chicago now the

Griffins night it's just the absolute
domination<00:02:14.900> front<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.960> chance<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:19.280> scandal

only<00:02:33.040> city<00:02:33.310> but

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
only city but

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.250 
only city but
we<00:02:36.090> all<00:02:36.209> knew<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:36.780> important<00:02:37.110> game

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
we all knew is a really important game

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
we all knew is a really important game
obviously<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.769> look<00:02:37.890> at<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.010> standings

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
obviously if you look at the standings

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.330 
obviously if you look at the standings
and<00:02:38.610> their<00:02:38.909> two<00:02:39.030> points<00:02:39.269> out<00:02:39.359> of<00:02:39.480> us<00:02:39.629> but<00:02:39.959> a

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
and their two points out of us but a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.160 
and their two points out of us but a
metha<00:02:41.420> I'm<00:02:42.420> pretty<00:02:42.629> sure<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:42.900> thought<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.079> was

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
metha I'm pretty sure we thought I was

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.809 
metha I'm pretty sure we thought I was
gonna<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.349> a<00:02:43.379> lot<00:02:43.500> closer<00:02:44.040> than<00:02:44.219> that<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
gonna be a lot closer than that and

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.550 
gonna be a lot closer than that and
right<00:02:44.939> sure<00:02:45.420> they<00:02:45.569> did<00:02:45.629> too<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.109> it's<00:02:46.319> just

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
right sure they did too but it's just

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.039 
right sure they did too but it's just
one<00:02:46.859> of<00:02:46.890> those<00:02:46.950> games<00:02:47.280> were<00:02:47.519> no<00:02:48.239> they<00:02:48.450> didn't

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
one of those games were no they didn't

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.110 
one of those games were no they didn't
have<00:02:49.140> their<00:02:49.290> best<00:02:49.439> game<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:49.859> uh<00:02:49.969> I'm<00:02:50.969> sure

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
have their best game but uh I'm sure

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.250 
have their best game but uh I'm sure
they'll<00:02:51.269> come<00:02:51.420> out<00:02:51.510> flying<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.930> our<00:02:52.049> scenes

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
they'll come out flying in our scenes

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.770 
they'll come out flying in our scenes
you<00:02:52.829> try<00:02:53.220> anything<00:02:53.489> different<00:02:53.970> than<00:02:54.060> some

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
you try anything different than some

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.240 
you try anything different than some
other<00:02:55.049> teams<00:02:55.260> didn't<00:02:55.500> know<00:02:55.560> where<00:02:55.799> or<00:02:55.980> did<00:02:56.099> you

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
other teams didn't know where or did you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.580 
other teams didn't know where or did you
have<00:02:56.400> success<00:02:56.819> against<00:02:57.090> them<00:02:57.470> well<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.500> think

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
have success against them well I think

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.020 
have success against them well I think
we<00:02:58.829> got<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> lot<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.159> pucks<00:02:59.310> on<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.670> obviously

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
we got a lot of pucks on that obviously

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.589 
we got a lot of pucks on that obviously
made<00:03:00.329> hard<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.689> both<00:03:01.290> are<00:03:01.470> bullies<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:02.099> uh

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
made hard on both are bullies but uh

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.550 
made hard on both are bullies but uh
we've<00:03:03.599> been<00:03:03.629> scouring<00:03:03.989> at<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> great<00:03:04.379> rate

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
we've been scouring at a great rate

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.770 
we've been scouring at a great rate
lately<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.489> know<00:03:05.579> enough<00:03:06.480> we'll<00:03:06.629> build

lately and you know enough we'll build
continue<00:03:07.230> yet<00:03:07.349> always<00:03:07.530> throughout<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.220> uh

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
continue yet always throughout but uh

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.860

you<00:03:08.760> know<00:03:08.790> if<00:03:08.939> we<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.389> gonna<00:03:09.569> be<00:03:09.720> tough<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
you know if we do it's gonna be tough to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.379 
you know if we do it's gonna be tough to
beat<00:03:10.019> these<00:03:10.950> wins<00:03:11.220> more<00:03:11.489> satisfying<00:03:12.090> because

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
beat these wins more satisfying because

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.819 
beat these wins more satisfying because
you<00:03:12.659> guys<00:03:12.750> struggled<00:03:13.200> early<00:03:13.439> on<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.650> put

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
you guys struggled early on to put

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.250 
you guys struggled early on to put
together<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.250> full<00:03:14.430> 60<00:03:14.900> yeah<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.959> could<00:03:16.139> be<00:03:16.230> I

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
together a full 60 yeah it could be I

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.110 
together a full 60 yeah it could be I
mean<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:17.010> very<00:03:17.189> satisfying<00:03:17.609> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
mean I think it's very satisfying the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.759 
mean I think it's very satisfying the
fact<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.419> we'd<00:03:18.659> be<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> top<00:03:19.019> team<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.530> you

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
fact that we'd be the top team and you

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.250 
fact that we'd be the top team and you
know<00:03:19.829> we're<00:03:19.980> chasing<00:03:20.310> them<00:03:20.900> okay<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> way<00:03:22.139> we

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
know we're chasing them okay the way we

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.429 
know we're chasing them okay the way we
did<00:03:22.379> it<00:03:22.530> was<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:22.919> big<00:03:23.099> big<00:03:23.340> win<00:03:24.150> big<00:03:24.419> big<00:03:24.989> lead<00:03:25.260> so

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
did it was a big big win big big lead so

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.809 
did it was a big big win big big lead so
I<00:03:25.470> think<00:03:25.590> that's<00:03:25.859> very<00:03:26.040> satisfying<00:03:26.370> on<00:03:26.730> its

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
I think that's very satisfying on its

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.819 
I think that's very satisfying on its
own<00:03:26.939> oh<00:03:27.919> well<00:03:28.919> first<00:03:29.609> one<00:03:29.939> was<00:03:30.239> oh<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:31.349> can't

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
own oh well first one was oh I can't

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.550 
own oh well first one was oh I can't
even<00:03:31.950> remember<00:03:32.129> third<00:03:33.120> one<00:03:33.299> was<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.629> was<00:03:34.530> a

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
even remember third one was that was a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.030 
even remember third one was that was a
good<00:03:34.769> play<00:03:34.919> from<00:03:35.040> single<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:36.000> shoot<00:03:36.599> it<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.260> I

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
good play from single a shoot it and I I

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.460 
good play from single a shoot it and I I
kind<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.669> wanted<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.269> shoot<00:03:39.299> there<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.989> hit

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
kind of wanted to shoot there and I hit

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.520 
kind of wanted to shoot there and I hit
the<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.680> spot<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.720> second<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:42.870> was<00:03:43.079> a

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
the right spot and second one was a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.539 
the right spot and second one was a
great<00:03:43.859> pass<00:03:44.099> from<00:03:44.340> ports<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.949> I<00:03:46.949> got<00:03:47.370> lucky

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
great pass from ports and I got lucky

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.610 
great pass from ports and I got lucky
there<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:47.849> think<00:03:48.419> they're<00:03:48.750> eat<00:03:49.019> their<00:03:49.260> demon

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
there I think they're eat their demon

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.920 
there I think they're eat their demon
and<00:03:49.799> winning<00:03:50.359> from<00:03:51.359> there

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
and winning from there

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.690 
and winning from there
first<00:03:52.930> one<00:03:53.819> man<00:03:54.819> I<00:03:54.879> can't<00:03:55.209> remember<00:03:55.390> first<00:03:56.700> you

growing<00:05:21.190> change<00:05:21.520> I<00:05:21.820> think<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.300> growth<00:05:22.539> of

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570

growing change I think the growth of
players<00:05:23.020> so<00:05:23.349> I<00:05:23.380> think<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:24.310> know<00:05:24.370> team<00:05:25.120> who

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270

I'd say for the most part melee scored
from<00:05:29.409> the<00:05:29.470> beginning<00:05:29.800> of<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:29.949> year<00:05:30.190> but<00:05:30.789> the

I<00:05:57.689> think<00:05:57.900> as<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.050> group<00:05:58.590> I<00:05:59.129> think<00:05:59.520> first<00:05:59.849> of<00:05:59.939> all

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
I think as a group I think first of all

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.209 
I think as a group I think first of all
I<00:06:00.150> think<00:06:00.330> our<00:06:00.419> décor<00:06:00.810> is<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:00.960> very<00:06:01.409> good<00:06:01.469> décor<00:06:01.979> I

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219

I think our décor is a very good décor I
think<00:06:02.460> secondly<00:06:02.909> we've<00:06:03.840> competed<00:06:04.229> very<00:06:04.590> hard

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
think secondly we've competed very hard

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.679 
think secondly we've competed very hard
defensively<00:06:05.219> and<00:06:05.580> not<00:06:05.789> given<00:06:06.120> up<00:06:06.210> lots<00:06:06.509> of

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:06.689 
defensively and not given up lots of

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.629 
defensively and not given up lots of
chances<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.289> then<00:06:07.560> and<00:06:07.800> then<00:06:08.009> finally<00:06:08.280> I'd

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
chances and then and then finally I'd

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.179 
chances and then and then finally I'd
say<00:06:08.849> our<00:06:08.969> goaltenders<00:06:09.830> obviously<00:06:10.830> lately

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:11.189 
say our goaltenders obviously lately

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.809 
say our goaltenders obviously lately
it's<00:06:11.310> been<00:06:11.460> peter<00:06:11.759> has<00:06:12.479> made<00:06:13.050> this<00:06:14.009> big<00:06:14.520> save

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
it's been peter has made this big save

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.209 
it's been peter has made this big save
at<00:06:14.969> the<00:06:15.000> big<00:06:15.210> moment<00:06:15.599> and<00:06:15.750> not<00:06:16.560> let<00:06:16.830> any<00:06:17.009> leak

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
at the big moment and not let any leak

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:18.980 
at the big moment and not let any leak
ones<00:06:17.460> in<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.699> give<00:06:17.849> weak<00:06:18.389> ones<00:06:18.629> in<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.840> get

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
ones in to give weak ones in to get

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.619 
ones in to give weak ones in to get
momentum<00:06:19.199> up<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:19.889> I<00:06:20.129> think<00:06:20.340> that<00:06:21.060> allows<00:06:21.389> you

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:21.629 
momentum up and I think that allows you

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.740 
momentum up and I think that allows you
then<00:06:21.990> to<00:06:22.069> keep<00:06:23.069> the<00:06:23.400> game<00:06:23.759> one<00:06:24.120> nothing<00:06:24.330> for<00:06:24.689> a

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
then to keep the game one nothing for a

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.360 
then to keep the game one nothing for a
long<00:06:24.900> time<00:06:25.110> 11<00:06:25.319> in<00:06:25.740> this<00:06:25.830> case<00:06:26.069> then<00:06:26.279> a

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
long time 11 in this case then a

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.249 
long time 11 in this case then a
promoter<00:06:26.879> Nelson<00:06:27.240> you<00:06:27.360> can<00:06:27.509> start<00:06:27.840> to<00:06:27.900> score

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
promoter Nelson you can start to score

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:37.250 
promoter Nelson you can start to score
it's<00:06:28.379> in<00:06:28.800> create<00:06:29.129> a<00:06:29.159> separation

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260
