something's just hit him in the face and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
something's just hit him in the face and
then<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:55.140> maybe<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.890> didn't<00:00:56.219> good<00:00:56.399> job<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
then one maybe this didn't good job and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.910 
then one maybe this didn't good job and
the<00:00:57.360> even<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.690> he<00:00:57.780> covers<00:00:58.109> his<00:00:58.289> head<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the even if he covers his head now and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.000 
the even if he covers his head now and
covers<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.090> keep<00:01:00.660> doing<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
covers up I keep doing this it's a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.039 
covers up I keep doing this it's a
downward<00:01:02.280> spiral<00:01:02.609> itself<00:01:03.329> dealt<00:01:03.750> with

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
downward spiral itself dealt with

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.320 
downward spiral itself dealt with
because<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:05.189> hit<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.700> another<00:01:05.909> hit<00:01:06.180> before

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
because one hit then another hit before

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.179 
because one hit then another hit before
he<00:01:06.540> has<00:01:06.810> time<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.260> understand<00:01:08.010> what's

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
he has time to understand what's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.300 
he has time to understand what's
happening<00:01:10.220> as<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.430> come<00:01:12.060> forward<00:01:13.189> you're<00:01:14.189> not

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
happening as you come forward you're not

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.289 
happening as you come forward you're not
slapping<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:15.799> it's<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.979> punching<00:01:17.520> except

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
slapping down it's like punching except

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
slapping down it's like punching except
you're<00:01:18.450> using<00:01:18.600> draw<00:01:18.990> your<00:01:19.320> palms<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.009> they

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you're using draw your palms so they

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.200 
you're using draw your palms so they
thrust<00:01:20.460> forward<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> bit<00:01:23.729> long<00:01:23.970> but

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
thrust forward but it's a bit long but

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.569 
thrust forward but it's a bit long but
if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.780> hook<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:25.979> each<00:01:26.280> strike<00:01:27.030> okay

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.750 

take<00:01:32.579> or<00:01:33.240> when<00:01:33.570> dissipation<00:01:34.290> Parenthood

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.850 

and<00:01:40.760> then<00:01:40.880> we'll<00:01:41.000> stop<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:41.450> okay<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.680> what

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
and then we'll stop it okay and what

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.510 
and then we'll stop it okay and what
this<00:01:42.980> is<00:01:43.190> simulating<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:43.970> essentially<00:01:44.540> the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
this is simulating is essentially the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.890 
this is simulating is essentially the
that<00:01:46.520> flinch<00:01:46.880> response<00:01:47.330> i'm<00:01:47.510> talking<00:01:47.840> about

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
that flinch response i'm talking about

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.660 
that flinch response i'm talking about
inbox<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.800> they<00:01:48.890> call<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.190> when<00:01:49.310> he's<00:01:49.460> on<00:01:49.580> the

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
inbox and they call it when he's on the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.450 
inbox and they call it when he's on the
back<00:01:49.850> foot<00:01:50.150> so<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:51.530> what<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.190> would<00:01:52.280> look<00:01:52.400> like

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
back foot so in what it would look like

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.750 
back foot so in what it would look like
of<00:01:52.850> its<00:01:53.030> early<00:01:53.360> but<00:01:53.540> I<00:01:54.140> hit<00:01:54.320> current<00:01:54.740> he<00:01:55.580> goes

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
of its early but I hit current he goes

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.820 
of its early but I hit current he goes
down<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.600> he<00:01:56.810> starts<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.140> back<00:01:57.320> off<00:01:57.560> because<00:01:57.710> I

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
down and he starts to back off because I

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.380 
down and he starts to back off because I
saying<00:01:58.130> what<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.340> fuck's<00:01:58.550> happening<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.300> I

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
saying what the fuck's happening and I

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.860 
saying what the fuck's happening and I
changed<00:01:59.780> it<00:01:59.870> when<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.110> following<00:02:00.470> up<00:02:00.790> but<00:02:01.870> I'm

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
changed it when I following up but I'm

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.600 
changed it when I following up but I'm
done<00:02:03.260> so<00:02:03.920> that's<00:02:04.070> what<00:02:04.220> we're<00:02:04.370> simulating

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
done so that's what we're simulating

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.300 
done so that's what we're simulating
with<00:02:05.120> that
