interesting headphone amplifier marty
was<00:00:22.240> it<00:00:22.509> all<00:00:22.599> about<00:00:22.630> well<00:00:23.410> basically<00:00:23.800> what<00:00:24.039> it

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
was it all about well basically what it

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.249 
was it all about well basically what it
is<00:00:24.189> it's<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.759> it's<00:00:25.390> an<00:00:25.599> intern<00:00:25.840> sir<00:00:26.020> to<00:00:26.169> the

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
is it's a it's an intern sir to the

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.460 
is it's a it's an intern sir to the
question<00:00:26.649> I<00:00:26.770> wish<00:00:27.009> I<00:00:27.310> could<00:00:28.000> you<00:00:28.810> know<00:00:28.840> mix<00:00:29.259> my

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
question I wish I could you know mix my

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.960 
question I wish I could you know mix my
record<00:00:29.800> on<00:00:29.919> headphones<00:00:30.340> but<00:00:30.550> of<00:00:30.699> course<00:00:30.910> you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
record on headphones but of course you

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.240 
record on headphones but of course you
can't<00:00:31.269> because<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.750> imaging<00:00:32.199> is<00:00:32.320> extreme

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
can't because the imaging is extreme

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.220 
can't because the imaging is extreme
left<00:00:33.519> and<00:00:33.699> right<00:00:33.879> there's<00:00:34.390> no<00:00:34.629> way<00:00:34.870> to<00:00:34.930> get

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
left and right there's no way to get

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.470 
left and right there's no way to get
your<00:00:35.379> imaging<00:00:35.829> to<00:00:35.949> match<00:00:36.129> your<00:00:36.400> speakers<00:00:36.820> so

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
your imaging to match your speakers so

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.649 
your imaging to match your speakers so
with<00:00:37.690> this<00:00:37.720> and<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:38.739> is<00:00:38.860> an<00:00:39.010> all<00:00:39.190> analog<00:00:39.760> box<00:00:40.089> we

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:40.659 
with this and it is an all analog box we

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.350 
with this and it is an all analog box we
are<00:00:40.809> able<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.379> actually<00:00:41.620> control<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.370> angle

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
are able to actually control the angle

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.000 
are able to actually control the angle
of<00:00:43.480> the<00:00:43.540> speaker<00:00:44.019> so<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.290> listen<00:00:44.589> to<00:00:44.860> your

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
of the speaker so you listen to your

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.280 
of the speaker so you listen to your
monitors<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:45.790> as<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:46.870> listen<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.199> your

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
monitors and as you listen to your

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.840 
monitors and as you listen to your
mother's<00:00:47.649> you<00:00:47.800> think<00:00:48.100> you<00:00:48.250> can<00:00:48.460> keep

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
mother's you think you can keep

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.299 
mother's you think you can keep
comparing<00:00:49.360> it<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:49.750> monitor<00:00:50.290> and<00:00:50.409> you<00:00:50.949> move

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
comparing it to the monitor and you move

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.429 
comparing it to the monitor and you move
the<00:00:51.670> imaging<00:00:52.089> of<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.269> speakers<00:00:52.720> until<00:00:53.320> it

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:53.439 
the imaging of the speakers until it

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.890 
the imaging of the speakers until it
matches<00:00:53.710> your<00:00:54.129> speakers<00:00:54.760> in<00:00:54.909> the<00:00:54.939> room<00:00:55.210> where

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
matches your speakers in the room where

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.390 
matches your speakers in the room where
they're<00:00:56.140> sitting<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:56.589> can<00:00:56.769> actually<00:00:56.920> feel<00:00:57.129> it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
they're sitting you can actually feel it

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.969 
they're sitting you can actually feel it
move<00:00:57.729> but<00:00:58.239> its<00:00:58.390> analog<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.260> then<00:00:59.559> after<00:00:59.890> you

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
move but its analog and then after you

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.070 
move but its analog and then after you
do<00:01:00.220> that<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.760> come<00:01:01.330> in<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:01.629> say<00:01:01.839> well<00:01:01.989> the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
do that you come in and say well the

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.439 
do that you come in and say well the
cross<00:01:02.320> speed<00:01:02.650> demo<00:01:02.949> change<00:01:03.400> clothes<00:01:04.089> feed

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
cross speed demo change clothes feed

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.260 
cross speed demo change clothes feed
being<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.860> if<00:01:06.009> I<00:01:06.159> make<00:01:06.400> something<00:01:06.820> left<00:01:07.060> of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
being that if I make something left of

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.469 
being that if I make something left of
center<00:01:07.689> and<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:09.159> should<00:01:09.580> have<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.970> residual

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
center and I should have the residual

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.440 
center and I should have the residual
amount<00:01:10.930> left<00:01:11.890> on<00:01:12.100> my<00:01:12.220> right<00:01:12.460> channel<00:01:12.939> but<00:01:13.420> I

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
amount left on my right channel but I

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.300 
amount left on my right channel but I
want<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:13.750> make<00:01:13.900> sure<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.409> does<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.950> exact

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
want to make sure that it does the exact

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.429 
want to make sure that it does the exact
same<00:01:15.340> thing<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:15.909> my<00:01:16.090> speakers<00:01:16.689> do<00:01:16.930> we

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
same thing that my speakers do we

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.920 
same thing that my speakers do we
actually<00:01:17.650> have<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:18.009> cross<00:01:18.340> feed<00:01:18.700> control<00:01:19.180> so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
actually have a cross feed control so

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.450 
actually have a cross feed control so
you<00:01:19.960> can<00:01:20.110> listen<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.530> your<00:01:20.650> monitors<00:01:21.100> when<00:01:21.340> you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
you can listen to your monitors when you

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.310 
you can listen to your monitors when you
do<00:01:21.580> like<00:01:21.760> something<00:01:22.090> left<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.420> center<00:01:22.750> that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
do like something left the center that

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.980 
do like something left the center that
compared<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.920> what<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.220> right<00:01:24.400> is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
compared to what the right is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.899 
compared to what the right is
information<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.380> match<00:01:27.070> that<00:01:27.430> exactly

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
information is and match that exactly

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.820 
information is and match that exactly
with<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.180> cross<00:01:28.390> for<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.690> control<00:01:29.080> but<00:01:29.680> that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
with the cross for you control but that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.860 
with the cross for you control but that
when<00:01:29.980> you<00:01:30.100> do<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.550> you've<00:01:31.090> disturbed<00:01:31.570> your

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
when you do that you've disturbed your

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.070 
when you do that you've disturbed your
Center<00:01:32.260> image<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.310> by<00:01:33.490> having<00:01:34.330> our<00:01:34.630> Center

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
Center image so by having our Center

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.200 
Center image so by having our Center
image<00:01:35.409> control<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.370> flipping<00:01:36.760> your<00:01:36.850> Center

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
image control you flipping your Center

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.880 
image control you flipping your Center
image<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:37.930> because<00:01:38.560> you're<00:01:38.680> going<00:01:38.830> to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
image and you because you're going to

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.590 
image and you because you're going to
lose<00:01:39.100> some<00:01:39.550> of<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.820> some<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.210> level<00:01:40.570> of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
lose some of the some of the level of

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.330 
lose some of the some of the level of
the<00:01:40.720> summer<00:01:40.960> image<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.890> listen<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.250> your

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the summer image you listen to your

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.460 
the summer image you listen to your
speakers<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:43.240> set<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.690> center<00:01:43.960> image<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.440> a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
speakers you set the center image to a

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.280 
speakers you set the center image to a
message<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.130> speakers<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:46.150> compare<00:01:46.659> and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
message of speakers and you compare and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.070 
message of speakers and you compare and
once<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.590> compare<00:01:48.010> you<00:01:48.520> are<00:01:48.790> imaging<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.810> your

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
once you compare you are imaging in your

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.250 
once you compare you are imaging in your
cans<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.909> later<00:01:52.150> speakers<00:01:52.720> are<00:01:52.840> imaging

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
cans what the later speakers are imaging

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.430 
cans what the later speakers are imaging
so<00:01:53.979> in<00:01:54.130> fact<00:01:54.370> then<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:54.970> can<00:01:55.180> actually<00:01:55.600> mix

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
so in fact then you can actually mix

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.130 
so in fact then you can actually mix
indore<00:01:57.280> what<00:01:58.180> this<00:01:58.420> essentially<00:01:58.900> is<00:01:59.020> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
indore what this essentially is a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.130
