00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.850 
hand I was about to have a cut and the
lady<00:04:38.940> was<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.390> busy<00:04:40.350> over<00:04:40.530> somewhere<00:04:40.800> else

lady was like busy over somewhere else

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.890 
lady was like busy over somewhere else
so<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.130> decided<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.730> look<00:04:41.910> at<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.180> remnants<00:04:42.720> and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
so I decided to look at the remnants and

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.710 
so I decided to look at the remnants and
I<00:04:43.350> came<00:04:43.560> across<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.860> remnant<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.400> was<00:04:44.790> two

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
I came across a remnant that was two

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.310 
I came across a remnant that was two
yards<00:04:46.050> 11<00:04:46.260> inches<00:04:46.680> so<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.850> got<00:04:48.690> this<00:04:48.870> instead<00:04:49.260> of

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
yards 11 inches so I got this instead of

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.400 
yards 11 inches so I got this instead of
having<00:04:49.620> some<00:04:49.980> yardage<00:04:50.310> cut<00:04:50.670> because<00:04:51.410> remnants

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
having some yardage cut because remnants

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.490 
having some yardage cut because remnants
you<00:04:52.650> saved<00:04:52.920> twenty<00:04:53.400> five<00:04:53.640> percent<00:04:54.350> so<00:04:55.350> I<00:04:55.680> got

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
you saved twenty five percent so I got

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.720 
you saved twenty five percent so I got
two<00:04:58.500> yards<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:58.950> 11<00:04:59.010> inches<00:04:59.370> for<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.540> dollar<00:05:00.840> 68

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
two yards and 11 inches for a dollar 68

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.210 
two yards and 11 inches for a dollar 68
which<00:05:02.730> was<00:05:03.150> still<00:05:03.690> even<00:05:04.590> though<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.710> has<00:05:04.800> 11

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
which was still even though it has 11

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.190 
which was still even though it has 11
extra<00:05:05.520> inches<00:05:05.880> cheaper<00:05:06.480> than<00:05:06.690> what<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:07.020> two

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
extra inches cheaper than what the two

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.020 
extra inches cheaper than what the two
yards<00:05:07.650> cut<00:05:07.890> off<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.130> bolt<00:05:08.370> would<00:05:08.640> have<00:05:08.790> been

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
yards cut off the bolt would have been

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.300 
yards cut off the bolt would have been
had<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.390> just<00:05:09.750> had<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.560> cut<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.010> bought<00:05:11.160> it

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
had I just had it cut and bought it

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.180 
had I just had it cut and bought it
straight<00:05:11.940> off<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.060> bolt<00:05:12.380> so<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.980> was<00:05:14.160> really

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
straight off the bolt so that was really

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.250 
straight off the bolt so that was really
lucky<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:15.000> found<00:05:15.090> that<00:05:15.510> exactly<00:05:16.020> what<00:05:16.230> I

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
up needing it for the projects that i

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.700 
up needing it for the projects that i
have<00:05:36.030> planned<00:05:36.390> I'm<00:05:36.750> sure<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.350> will<00:05:37.410> find

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
have planned I'm sure I will find

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.280 
have planned I'm sure I will find
another<00:05:37.950> reason<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:38.610> use<00:05:38.760> it<00:05:38.910> in<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.120> future

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
another reason to use it in the future

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.980 
another reason to use it in the future
so<00:05:40.290> it's<00:05:40.710> definitely<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.220> good<00:05:41.820> thing<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.870> have
