the internet that removing the head was

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.939 
the internet that removing the head was
impossible<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.199> Hasbro<00:00:19.680> didn't

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
impossible to do and that Hasbro didn't

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.099 
impossible to do and that Hasbro didn't
recommend<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.520> due<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> high<00:00:21.630> risk<00:00:21.900> of

breaking something but I was able to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.290 
breaking something but I was able to
find<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> way<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> safely<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.460> fairly

turning<00:00:48.450> mechanism<00:00:48.920> there's<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
turning mechanism there's one on the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.119 
turning mechanism there's one on the
side<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:51.469> there's<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> top

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
side right here there's one on the top

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.900 
side right here there's one on the top
here<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.829> there's<00:00:55.829> another<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.670> top

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
here and there's another one on top

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
here and there's another one on top
right<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.500> screws

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
right over there so now that the screws

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.189 
right over there so now that the screws
are<00:01:01.890> off<00:01:02.160> already<00:01:02.670> take<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> head<00:01:03.210> off<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
are off already take the head off the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
are off already take the head off the
head<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.530> basically<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:05.100> giant<00:01:05.129> snapping

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
head is basically one giant snapping

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.920 
head is basically one giant snapping
clip<00:01:06.409> there's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.560> latch<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.400> here

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
clip there's a latch and back here

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.730 
clip there's a latch and back here
there's<00:01:09.930> also<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.409> front<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:12.840> blocked

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
there's also one in front it's blocked

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
there's also one in front it's blocked
by<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> plastic<00:01:14.610> shield<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.840> think<00:01:16.049> that's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
by a plastic shield and I think that's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
by a plastic shield and I think that's
what<00:01:16.350> gives<00:01:16.560> people<00:01:16.740> most<00:01:17.100> problems<00:01:17.610> then

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
what gives people most problems then

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.170 
what gives people most problems then
they<00:01:18.330> can't<00:01:18.540> pull<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> head<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.880> what<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> did

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
they can't pull the head up what I did

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.620 
they can't pull the head up what I did
was<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.659> drilled<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.200> 1/4<00:01:22.740> inch<00:01:22.770> hole<00:01:23.600> near<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
was I drilled a 1/4 inch hole near the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.440 
was I drilled a 1/4 inch hole near the
bottom<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.350> close<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> middle<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> can

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
bottom and close to the middle so I can

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
bottom and close to the middle so I can
stick<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.020> screw<00:01:28.229> driver<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.650> access<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
stick in a screw driver to access the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
stick in a screw driver to access the
the<00:01:29.790> latch<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> now<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> want<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.920> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the latch so now what you want to do is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
the latch so now what you want to do is
you<00:01:32.579> want<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> stick<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> screwdriver<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.990> on

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you want to stick a screwdriver in on

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.260 
you want to stick a screwdriver in on
both<00:01:34.500> sides<00:01:34.829> at<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> same<00:01:35.820> time<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.650> push<00:01:37.650> in

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
both sides at the same time and push in

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
both sides at the same time and push in
and<00:01:39.950> then<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.100> pry<00:01:41.369> upwards

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.030
