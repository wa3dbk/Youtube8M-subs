00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
it but then you have to have someone to
pick<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.010> that's<00:00:44.219> how<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> process

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
pick it up so that's how the process

pick it up so that's how the process
works

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
works

00:00:45.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
works
that's<00:01:15.290> because<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.680> equal<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> normally

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that's because this is equal to normally

00:01:18.119 --> 00:02:33.370 
that's because this is equal to normally
ship<00:01:18.299> left<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.259> this

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.229 

so<00:02:34.380> as<00:02:34.880> 100<00:02:35.880> body<00:02:36.120> missiles<00:02:36.600> come<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.500> join<00:02:37.739> the

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239
