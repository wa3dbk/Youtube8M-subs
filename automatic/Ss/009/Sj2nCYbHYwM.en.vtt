training<00:00:22.350> game<00:00:22.949> right<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.789> don't<00:00:24.390> know

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
training game right here I don't know

training game right here I don't know
what<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.220> because<00:00:26.300> basically<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.840> point

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
what this is because basically the point

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.669 
what this is because basically the point
of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> game<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.510> strap<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.779> bombs<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.529> your

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
of the game is to strap on bombs to your

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.319 
of the game is to strap on bombs to your
allies<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.279> send<00:00:32.579> them<00:00:32.669> over<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.210> other

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
allies and send them over to the other

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.380 
allies and send them over to the other
side<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.739> red<00:00:35.489> vs.<00:00:35.820> blue<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.360> I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
side so this is a red vs. blue for I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.850 
side so this is a red vs. blue for I
guess<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> Middle<00:00:36.960> East<00:00:37.140> or<00:00:37.320> something<00:00:37.770> I

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
guess the Middle East or something I

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.340

up and the guys in the middle here the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
up and the guys in the middle here the
way<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.890> works<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> there's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> Hill

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
way it works is there's a there's a Hill

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
way it works is there's a there's a Hill
Zone<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.740> only<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.040> damage

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
Zone on it so you can only do damage

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
Zone on it so you can only do damage
from<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.960> means<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
from there so that means you have to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.690 
from there so that means you have to
stick<00:01:31.590> someone<00:01:31.890> they<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> deliver<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
stick someone they have to deliver the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.039 
stick someone they have to deliver the
bomb<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.180> while<00:01:33.360> you're<00:01:33.479> still<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
bomb and then while you're still in the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.480 
bomb and then while you're still in the
hill<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.460> who

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
hill you kind of you're the one who

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.969 
hill you kind of you're the one who
detonates<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> pretty<00:01:37.590> sick<00:01:37.829> and
