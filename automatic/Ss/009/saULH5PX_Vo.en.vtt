in<00:00:39.809> 2009<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.730> because<00:00:41.730> i<00:00:41.820> always<00:00:42.030> play<00:00:42.300> melee

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510

bored<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> game<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.820> don't<00:00:45.329> feel<00:00:45.450> like

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

doing<00:00:45.719> anything<00:00:45.899> even<00:00:46.829> though<00:00:46.920> there's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
doing anything even though there's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.889

plenty<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.399> stuff<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.090> me<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> mean<00:00:48.809> I'm

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
plenty of stuff for me to do I mean I'm

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.959 
plenty of stuff for me to do I mean I'm
not<00:00:49.020> progressed<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.649> don't<00:00:49.829> raid<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> barely

even<00:00:51.120> touched<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.840> expansion<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> seems

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
even touched this expansion and it seems

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.819 
even touched this expansion and it seems
to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> case<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:55.350> majority<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
to be the case of the majority of the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.069 
to be the case of the majority of the
times<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.940> seemed<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.870> burn

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
times like that I I seemed like it burn

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.229 
times like that I I seemed like it burn
out<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:58.890> even<00:00:59.100> brought<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.120> sort

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
out or not even brought out I just sort

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.540 
out or not even brought out I just sort
of<00:01:00.300> lose<00:01:00.480> interest<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> expansion<00:01:01.460> at<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of lose interest in the expansion at the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.979 
of lose interest in the expansion at the
beginning<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.090> barely<00:01:03.359> play<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.840> like

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
beginning and barely play it for like

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.210 
beginning and barely play it for like
months<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:06.510> wondering<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.439> could
