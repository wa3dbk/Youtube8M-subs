youtuber<00:01:54.450> only<00:01:55.140> gripe<00:01:55.380> about<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
youtuber only gripe about this is the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
youtuber only gripe about this is the
fact<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.700> only<00:01:56.850> ships<00:01:57.149> within<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.540> u.s.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
fact that it only ships within the u.s.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.660 
fact that it only ships within the u.s.
so<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.619> international<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.430> anything

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so it's not international or anything

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.670 
so it's not international or anything
which<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.210> sucks<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.350> highly

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
which really sucks but I highly

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.679 
which really sucks but I highly
recommend<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.549> guys<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.600> your
