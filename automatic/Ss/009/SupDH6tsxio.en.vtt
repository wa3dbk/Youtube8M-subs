it's<00:00:31.980> an<00:00:32.160> on-location<00:00:32.669> shoot<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.570> mean<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
it's an on-location shoot I mean the

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.560 
it's an on-location shoot I mean the
shoot<00:00:34.620> might<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.160> happened<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.820> location

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
shoot might have happened on location

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.569 
shoot might have happened on location
but<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> photos<00:00:37.469> look<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:38.070> were<00:00:38.129> taken

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
but the photos look like they were taken

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.729 
but the photos look like they were taken
in<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.879> regular<00:00:39.270> photo<00:00:39.539> studio<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
in a regular photo studio now on a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.370 
in a regular photo studio now on a
neutral<00:00:41.250> background<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:42.150> think<00:00:42.630> it's<00:00:43.200> very

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
neutral background I think it's very

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.920 
neutral background I think it's very
powerful<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.550> turn<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.030> location<00:00:45.600> into

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
powerful if you can turn a location into

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.930 
powerful if you can turn a location into
something<00:00:46.290> like<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.620> regular<00:00:47.130> photo<00:00:47.460> studio

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
something like a regular photo studio

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
something like a regular photo studio
with<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.150> neutral<00:00:48.660> background<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.440> instance

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
with a neutral background for instance

give<00:02:16.349> me<00:02:16.530> enough<00:02:16.799> space<00:02:17.159> and<00:02:17.550> then<00:02:18.390> if<00:02:18.750> I've

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
give me enough space and then if I've

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.479 
give me enough space and then if I've
got<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> paper<00:02:19.500> background<00:02:19.680> which<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.190> wider

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
got a paper background which is wider

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.480 
got a paper background which is wider
than<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> space<00:02:21.209> which<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.599> there

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
than the space which is there

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.760 
than the space which is there
I<00:02:22.520> cannot<00:02:23.060> shoot<00:02:23.330> with<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.930> fabric<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.470> very

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
I cannot shoot with it fabric is very

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.650 
I cannot shoot with it fabric is very
flexible<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.880> doesn't

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
flexible it doesn't

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.300 
flexible it doesn't
yeah<00:02:26.900> directly<00:02:27.380> break<00:02:27.650> when<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:27.950> handle<00:02:28.280> it

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
yeah directly break when I handle it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.740 
yeah directly break when I handle it
wrong<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.790> doesn't<00:02:28.970> break<00:02:29.270> when<00:02:29.300> there's

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
wrong it doesn't break when there's

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.340 
wrong it doesn't break when there's
something<00:02:30.320> uneven<00:02:30.950> on<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.160> ground<00:02:31.430> yeah<00:02:31.970> it's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
something uneven on the ground yeah it's

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.190 
something uneven on the ground yeah it's
very<00:02:33.350> forgiving<00:02:34.150> let's<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> look<00:02:35.570> at<00:02:35.870> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
very forgiving let's have a look at the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.260 
very forgiving let's have a look at the
setup<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.770> today's<00:02:37.100> photo<00:02:37.490> shoot<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:38.030> was

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
setup of today's photo shoot this was

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.630 
setup of today's photo shoot this was
actually<00:02:38.450> one<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.960> cases<00:02:39.410> where<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:40.220> came

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
actually one of the cases where I came

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.300 
actually one of the cases where I came
with<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> free<00:02:41.300> meter<00:02:41.620> background<00:02:42.620> but<00:02:42.890> we<00:02:43.100> had

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
with a free meter background but we had

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.190 
with a free meter background but we had
to<00:02:43.580> bring<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.910> down<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.270> two<00:02:44.540> meters<00:02:44.960> and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
to bring it down to two meters and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.750 
to bring it down to two meters and
thirty<00:02:45.470> two<00:02:45.710> hundred<00:02:45.740> thirty<00:02:46.130> centimeters

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
thirty two hundred thirty centimeters

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.140 
thirty two hundred thirty centimeters
because<00:02:46.910> we<00:02:47.630> just<00:02:47.900> didn't<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.320> enough<00:02:48.650> space

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
because we just didn't have enough space

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.330 
because we just didn't have enough space
now<00:02:50.180> nevertheless<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:51.290> could<00:02:51.530> set<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.920> up<00:02:52.040> we

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
now nevertheless we could set it up we

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.970 
now nevertheless we could set it up we
could<00:02:52.610> place<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.210> model<00:02:53.600> in<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.810> middle<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.200> we

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
could place a model in the middle and we

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.520 
could place a model in the middle and we
were<00:02:55.280> firing<00:02:55.670> some<00:02:56.600> speed<00:02:56.930> lights<00:02:57.140> or<00:02:57.350> two

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
were firing some speed lights or two

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.320 
were firing some speed lights or two
speedlights<00:02:57.800> into<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.430> background<00:02:58.850> both<00:02:59.090> on

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
speedlights into the background both on

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.880 
speedlights into the background both on
half<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.810> their<00:03:00.020> power<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.710> lot<00:03:00.860> of

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
half of their power so it's a lot of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.550 
half of their power so it's a lot of
power<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.550> one<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.480> them<00:03:02.630> was<00:03:02.810> on<00:03:03.020> a<00:03:03.050> 1<00:03:03.290> meter

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
power and one of them was on a 1 meter

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.560 
power and one of them was on a 1 meter
80<00:03:03.710> light<00:03:03.980> stand<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.640> it's<00:03:04.790> shooting<00:03:05.090> from<00:03:05.330> low

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
80 light stand so it's shooting from low

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.690 
80 light stand so it's shooting from low
on<00:03:05.930> top<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.620> other<00:03:06.740> one<00:03:06.980> shooting<00:03:07.340> up

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
on top and the other one shooting up

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.830 
on top and the other one shooting up
from<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.210> ground

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
from the ground

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.250 
from the ground
the<00:03:09.530> model<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.100> lit<00:03:10.430> from<00:03:10.670> two<00:03:11.510> sides<00:03:11.840> with

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the model is lit from two sides with

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.950 
the model is lit from two sides with
shoot<00:03:12.920> through<00:03:13.250> umbrellas<00:03:13.850> speed<00:03:14.540> lights<00:03:14.720> are

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
shoot through umbrellas speed lights are

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.370 
shoot through umbrellas speed lights are
on<00:03:14.990> 1/4<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:16.070> their<00:03:16.250> power<00:03:16.520> so<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.930> less<00:03:18.110> power

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
on 1/4 of their power so it's less power

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.770 
on 1/4 of their power so it's less power
than<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> background<00:03:19.070> lights<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.630> light

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.410 
is very flat and very even yeah it's
it's<00:03:23.690> ideal<00:03:24.110> for<00:03:24.170> beauty<00:03:24.740> shoot<00:03:25.010> or<00:03:25.220> for<00:03:25.970> you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
have something like a I Do's and when we

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.890 
have something like a I Do's and when we
turned<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.840> full<00:03:30.290> body<00:03:30.970> shoots<00:03:31.970> then<00:03:32.480> we<00:03:32.720> also

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
turned to full body shoots then we also

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.640 
turned to full body shoots then we also
usually<00:03:33.260> use<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.830> fill<00:03:34.100> light<00:03:34.340> which<00:03:35.440> was<00:03:36.440> the

usually use a fill light which was the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.620 
usually use a fill light which was the
speed<00:03:36.890> light<00:03:37.040> somewhere<00:03:37.490> on<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.000> ground<00:03:38.270> with

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
speed light somewhere on the ground with

the shoot for umbrella over it or

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.020 
the shoot for umbrella over it or
sometimes<00:03:41.150> we<00:03:41.570> just<00:03:41.600> used<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.230> reflector<00:03:43.030> the

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
sometimes we just used a reflector the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.240 
sometimes we just used a reflector the
camera<00:03:44.390> was<00:03:45.140> on<00:03:45.350> f/8<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.550> on<00:03:47.090> iso<00:03:47.350> 160<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:49.010> have

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
camera was on f/8 and on iso 160 to have

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.060 
camera was on f/8 and on iso 160 to have
fire<00:03:49.550> as<00:03:49.880> little<00:03:50.300> noise<00:03:50.480> as<00:03:50.540> possible<00:03:51.070> because

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
fire as little noise as possible because

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.710 
fire as little noise as possible because
when<00:03:52.430> you're<00:03:52.550> shooting<00:03:52.730> hair<00:03:53.210> and<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.510> want

want hair and not noise that's on one to
hundreds<00:03:59.090> of<00:03:59.210> a<00:03:59.360> second<00:03:59.690> too<00:04:00.110> soon<00:04:00.290> nicely

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
hundreds of a second too soon nicely

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.510 
hundreds of a second too soon nicely
with<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.160> speed<00:04:01.400> lights<00:04:01.640> that's<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:03.080> setting

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
with the speed lights that's the setting

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.850 
with the speed lights that's the setting
when<00:04:04.520> you<00:04:04.550> now<00:04:04.850> go<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.600> get<00:04:06.200> something<00:04:06.680> like

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
when you now go and get something like

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.340 
when you now go and get something like
this<00:04:07.070> fabric<00:04:07.580> background<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.810> can<00:04:09.080> get

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
this fabric background you can get
