00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 journalist and I hope you go 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.210
 well 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.470
 today I'm coming back for a little 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.740
 video of a really a very short 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.710
 video tell you about my participation in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.630
 clip echoes of rachel allison i have not 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.099
 I do not usually do this kind of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.099
 collaboration 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.079
 but the message he wanted to make 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.570
 go through split me 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.380
 really touched by what it is 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.020
 it's the clip talking about black women 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.790
 black women natural but 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.190
 naturalness of which all their totality 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.650
 stasio society is used to us 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 impose his diktats that it is at 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.860
 hair level we saw in some 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.310
 magazines the afro hair that were 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.300
 compared to underarms or other 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.909
 sobriquet hyper nice we saw at the level 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 make-up the letters of the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.520
 really transformations of I see 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.619
 women who through the count ory 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.409
 really make transformations that does not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.359
 not bother in itself but I find that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.609
 pity that a woman can not 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.439
 go out as she is for me the 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.960
 make-up this sense is sublime and it's 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.509
 no it's not supposed to turn that must 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.649
 to be something light 2.2 actually 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.590
 in the war when we have the big ones 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.759
 events here but I find damage 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.819
 that when we go out as is with his 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.329
 greenhouses as it is it is what is it 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.799
 whether bacon be judged we are going 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.219
 because in fact we are good we are in 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.219
 the jugement 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.300
 I was talking about hair compared to 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.710
 afro hair magazine that's sailing from 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.990
 wear as you want if you want it 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.360
 wear afro on your door and curled 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.880
 if we want to reach attached end we 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.790
 look and you have to think in addition to 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.270
 generations after I have a daughter gd niel 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.459
 I want her to have more freedom 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.600
 I want her to have the freedom to wear 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:19.030
 the hair as they want it and 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.130
 is really redeeming the list not getting 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.010
 grab that in his clip and I'm 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.290
 really very proud to participate 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.330
 so for me the message is to love 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.620
 you such as you are 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.200
 after if there are things to improve 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.870
 you do not like your body the holiday of 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.000
 sport you want to lose weight down and a 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.670
 better food but take yourself 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.620
 in hand but do not be fooled 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.090
 your image by anyone I want 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.040
 I wear them as I want if I am 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.590
 gave its propellers but I'm not the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.410
 high schools to please anyone 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.269
 either in relation to clips 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.330
 actually since March 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.410
 I had stopped everything that was 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.959
 heat I made myself a little 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.760
 March challenge I wanted to do 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.920
 until some months for a year 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.970
 of my adventure and capillaries at 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.790
 natural 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.459
 but for the clip I made exception 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.320
 so I sacrificed my hair for the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.840
 clip and I do not regret it because 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.620
 because here I am for you 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.630
 will put pictures of the final result that 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.540
 not give here it really gives where was 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.640
 so for the shot in the end I find it 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.160
 really big but it was too bushy 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.030
 my dad, it's going to finish in good 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.440
 tied hair 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:35.520
 so see you tonight 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.800
