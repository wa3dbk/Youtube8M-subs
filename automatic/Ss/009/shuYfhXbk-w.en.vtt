00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 only two weeks after release 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.109
 ios 8 beta 4 is on today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.090
 Monday was again as far as beta 5 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.860
 just released by apple 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.960
 and as always we look at this 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.769
 video of course the change and 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:23.039
 new 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:26.099
 have fun the update has an approximate 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.380
 size of 270 mb and you notice clearly 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.869
 that it is always direction finaler 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.149
 everything is faster than it gets 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 everything gets more fluid it jerks less 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.380
 and the wax are becoming less 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.329
 So apple really works on all corners 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.760
 There are no big changes 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610
 more but only many many small ones 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.649
 which I show you now, of course 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.020
 Let's start in the settings app 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.399
 here and there the iCloud has some new ones 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.649
 icon get donated 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.170
 we see the first one already here 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.670
 if we click on it then comes 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.300
 here is a new icon of the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.680
 have family release and below 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 We also have a cloud drive here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.510
 backup and keychain all have one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.909
 Here are some new blue icons 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.100
 white I like the whole thing 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.470
 and is just a little bit again 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 design update after the establishment of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.570
 beta 5 will ask you if you want the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.570
 sms synchronization between several 18 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.200
 or is in yosemite devices activate 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.460
 would like to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.780
 here comes a sign in here 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.520
 In this case, my ipad wanted to 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 example of this access to my sms 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.869
 that means if i have an sms on 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.909
 the iphone then comes the synonymous 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.439
 on the ipad and i can do it too 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.060
 then answer from there 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.590
 you can do it here now once 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.420
 enable or disable 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.009
 this does not seem to be the case later 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.229
 to go more than in the settings 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.990
 app there is no option for it yet 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.790
 with beta 4 he came the new menu item 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.229
 display and brightness where we are 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.549
 Among other things, the display brightness here 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.799
 can adjust 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.840
 Funnily, there was beta 4 at that time 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.460
 just under wallpaper the same 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.140
 attitudes that became here now 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.899
 fixed and the attitude was here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.969
 removed apples health map is getting 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.100
 further expanded this time there was 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.069
 Information on lung and respiratory tract 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 in addition and in addition the emergency was pass 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.560
 extended this can namely now the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.900
 information also in the lockscreen 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.849
 show that just in case of emergency too 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.280
 other people on this important data 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.110
 or important information such as 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.420
 allergies or any diseases 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.430
 There are also in the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.650
 privacy settings now the point 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 so that later seems so too 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.790
 Access other apps on the helper app 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.560
 we can stay in the again 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.540
 Settings app there was that 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.860
 menu for mobile net so the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.660
 attitudes we make there 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.640
 can optically a bit overworked 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.950
 But there are no new functions here 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.989
 the construction and the description became 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.580
 a bit adapted the spotlight 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.590
 search is now damn fast 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.239
 call the animation is running so 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.100
 apparently a bit faster from here 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.470
 you really notice that right 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.120
 clearly and also here was the whole 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.310
 a bit adjusted sees a 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.220
 a little bit like in the yosemite 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.630
 In addition, there is a new one 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.640
 animation if we are the whole again 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.110
 leave there so we have only here 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.180
 such a little blur 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.900
 effect until we get our apps 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.670
 meet again 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.590
 many of you go the quicktime 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.239
 keyboard on the nerves that it is here 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.069
 At the top of this bar you in the reason 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.590
 Words you may write 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.540
 I want to display and you could 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.950
 switch off already now we have 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.720
 but such a new switch 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.489
 we'll get that down here 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.500
 Smileys can easily call 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.090
 and the bar is there or not 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.709
 not even series was again 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.620
 expanded and now has the possibility 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.090
 the itunes store the ibook store and 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.090
 Browse podcast 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:47.150
 So we can say, for example, buy the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:49.190
 second season of homeland and siri 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.019
 look for it then opens the app and 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.299
 if there is the whole, then you come 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.470
 directly into the survey that is on 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.670
 every case pretty handy 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.620
 works as I said with 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.470
 You can also do different things for example 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.810
 say action movies in the itunes store 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.040
 or something and that should be you 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.720
 then also be displayed 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.430
 Last but not least, there is something in it 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.530
 changed the photo stream settings 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.540
 if you have the photo stream here 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.040
 activated, there are now the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.350
 both options iphone memory 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.100
 optimize and load and original 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.019
 to keep 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.669
 choose your iphone optimize memory 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.200
 then the downloaded pictures 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.880
 a little bit smaller 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.560
 bit compressed so just not so 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.300
 much space to consume 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.340
 and if you are loading and original 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.230
 keep selecting then the remain 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.330
 Pictures just original just like her 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.060
 but consume for it but of course 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.350
 some more space 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.820
 should still further innovations ans 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.100
 I will come to you in the light 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.960
 link video description and if 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.370
 you found something here 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.900
 not yet felt in it and not in the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.400
 description is then you can me 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.240
 that also like times in the comments 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.669
 write 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.040
 otherwise it was now with the ios 8 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.930
 beta 5 innovations I really hope that 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.190
 you liked the video and if so 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.020
 that's how I feel about it 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.979
 a thumbs up or one 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.750
 Comment
