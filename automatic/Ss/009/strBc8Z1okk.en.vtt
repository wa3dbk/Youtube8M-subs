the basis do a lot of different tricks
and<00:00:22.980> fingerboarding<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.640> your<00:00:23.939> 60<00:00:24.270> flips

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
and fingerboarding like your 60 flips

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.839 
and fingerboarding like your 60 flips
back<00:00:25.140> side<00:00:25.439> flips<00:00:25.770> front<00:00:26.099> side<00:00:26.340> flips<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
back side flips front side flips and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.299 
back side flips front side flips and
nollie<00:00:27.239> flips<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.710> kick<00:00:28.890> flips<00:00:29.130> out

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
nollie flips you can do kick flips out

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.549 
nollie flips you can do kick flips out
grinds<00:00:29.700> into<00:00:30.000> grinds<00:00:30.360> and<00:00:31.169> even<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.469> the

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
grinds into grinds and even like the

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.920 
grinds into grinds and even like the
legends<00:00:31.950> so<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:32.969> see<00:00:33.030> they're<00:00:33.660> really

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
even to the probe every let's escape

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.250 
even to the probe every let's escape
flips<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.179> they're<00:00:39.480> also<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.750> lot<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> fun<00:00:40.050> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
flips and they're also a lot of fun to

a<00:01:33.840> kickflip<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> board<00:01:35.640> over<00:01:35.880> rotating

a kickflip is the board over rotating
basically<00:01:38.010> what<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.190> means<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:39.210> when<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
basically what that means is when you

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.570 
basically what that means is when you
flip<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> board<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.560> rotates<00:01:40.979> three<00:01:41.220> times

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
flip the board it rotates three times

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.280 
flip the board it rotates three times
there's<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> couple<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.690> easy<00:01:42.780> ways<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.170> can

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290

fix<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.549> first<00:01:44.790> way<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.450> flicking<00:01:45.720> as

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
fix it the first way is not flicking as

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.050 
fix it the first way is not flicking as
hard<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:47.040> you're<00:01:47.159> flicking<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.820> front

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
hard when you're flicking your front

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.130 
hard when you're flicking your front
