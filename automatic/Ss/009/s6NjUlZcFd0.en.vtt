00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
just gonna show you how I set them up

what<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.100> do<00:01:13.360> 30-second<00:01:14.360> cables<00:01:14.780> through<00:01:14.960> there

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
what I do 30-second cables through there

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.620 
what I do 30-second cables through there
you<00:01:16.130> pound<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:16.490> nut<00:01:16.729> on<00:01:16.909> there<00:01:22.630> coming

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
you pound the nut on there coming

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.800 
you pound the nut on there coming
through<00:01:23.810> that<00:01:23.840> whole<00:01:24.380> swivel<00:01:25.070> from<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.460> top

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
through that whole swivel from the top

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.609 
through that whole swivel from the top
on<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.869> other<00:01:27.110> end

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
on the other end

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.340 
on the other end
take<00:01:28.579> my<00:01:28.850> furrow<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:30.189> right<00:01:31.189> where<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.369> put<00:01:31.640> the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
take my furrow and right where I put the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.310 
take my furrow and right where I put the
piece<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.560> extra<00:01:34.450> cable<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.930> comes<00:01:36.170> out

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
piece of extra cable in it comes out

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.010 
piece of extra cable in it comes out
this<00:01:36.469> loop<00:01:36.740> down<00:01:37.009> here<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.549> crimp<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.689> side

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
this loop down here I crimp that side

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.160 
this loop down here I crimp that side
only<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.950> reason<00:01:40.100> for<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:40.509> is<00:01:41.509> on<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.049> other

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
only the reason for that is on the other

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.370 
only the reason for that is on the other
side<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:43.039> not<00:01:43.310> crimped<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.810> can<00:01:44.990> push<00:01:45.200> that

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
side it's not crimped you can push that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.560 
side it's not crimped you can push that
cable<00:01:46.090> in<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.539> out<00:01:47.719> of<00:01:47.899> there<00:01:48.460> yet<00:01:49.490> yet<00:01:50.390> that

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
cable in and out of there yet yet that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.209 
cable in and out of there yet yet that
Kim's<00:01:50.840> not<00:01:51.020> gonna<00:01:51.229> pull<00:01:51.469> that<00:01:51.590> cable<00:01:51.799> off<00:01:51.979> cuz

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
Kim's not gonna pull that cable off cuz

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.899 
Kim's not gonna pull that cable off cuz
that's<00:01:52.430> not<00:01:52.490> scrimp<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.950> that's<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.700> time

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
that's not scrimp so that's the time

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.209 
that's not scrimp so that's the time
before<00:01:56.149> I<00:01:56.390> know<00:01:57.350> I'm<00:01:57.439> gonna<00:01:57.530> go<00:01:57.710> make<00:01:57.859> a<00:01:57.920> set<00:01:58.189> I

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
before I know I'm gonna go make a set I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.819 
before I know I'm gonna go make a set I
set<00:01:58.520> my<00:01:58.609> trap<00:01:58.850> already<00:01:59.350> another<00:02:00.350> way<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.649> be

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
set my trap already another way to be

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.650 
set my trap already another way to be
fast

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.360 

so<00:02:04.660> what<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.960> want<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.170> do<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.620> got<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.070> tree

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
so what you want to do I got the tree

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.490 
so what you want to do I got the tree
here

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
here

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.010 
here
I'm<00:02:08.500> gonna<00:02:08.619> take<00:02:09.310> my<00:02:09.869> loop<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:13.390> open<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.900> up

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
I'm gonna take my loop and open it up

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.940 
I'm gonna take my loop and open it up
just<00:02:14.800> so<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.160> trap<00:02:15.460> can<00:02:15.670> fit<00:02:15.880> through<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.270> she

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
just so that trap can fit through it she

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.280 
just so that trap can fit through it she
that's<00:02:17.950> about<00:02:18.220> good<00:02:18.460> right<00:02:18.700> there<00:02:19.290> like

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
that's about good right there like

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:38.330 
that's about good right there like
you're<00:02:20.440> gonna<00:02:20.560> do<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:22.000> come<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.390> your<00:02:22.480> tree

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.890 

furl<00:02:39.340> keep<00:02:39.850> pulling<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.150> down<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.600> loop

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
furl keep pulling it down so that loop

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.340 
furl keep pulling it down so that loop
gets<00:02:41.110> small<00:02:43.200> stick<00:02:44.200> your<00:02:44.350> trap<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:46.239> know<00:02:47.200> a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
gets small stick your trap in I know a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.070 
gets small stick your trap in I know a
lot<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.590> guys<00:02:47.800> they<00:02:48.600> stick<00:02:49.600> their<00:02:49.780> trap

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
lot of guys they stick their trap

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.080 
lot of guys they stick their trap
straight<00:02:50.560> hopping<00:02:51.340> down<00:02:51.520> I<00:02:53.489> just<00:02:54.489> like<00:02:54.880> to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
straight hopping down I just like to

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.199 
straight hopping down I just like to
stick<00:02:55.690> my<00:02:55.739> dog<00:02:56.739> proof<00:02:57.040> straight<00:02:57.640> in<00:02:57.820> not<00:02:58.090> an

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
stick my dog proof straight in not an

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.240 
stick my dog proof straight in not an
angle<00:02:59.070> the<00:03:00.070> reason<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.920> it's

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
angle the reason for that I think it's

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.160 
angle the reason for that I think it's
easier<00:03:03.670> for<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.880> coon<00:03:04.120> reach<00:03:04.420> down<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.930> there

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
easier for a coon reach down in there

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.440 
easier for a coon reach down in there
like<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.190> coming<00:03:07.150> up<00:03:07.300> over<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.600> top<00:03:07.900> and

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
like that and coming up over the top and

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.580 
like that and coming up over the top and
pulling<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.540> easier<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.140> pull<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.410> trigger

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
pulling that easier to pull the trigger
