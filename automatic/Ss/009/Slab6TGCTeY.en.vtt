00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:09.290
 I need to judge the situation when I 'm at your feet . 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:13.820
 It's not just the house you see today. 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:17.869
 It is to assess the quality eomae tipin I'm a little different out 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.050
 Now I have prepared some very interesting endings in my ear. 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:26.210
 TV Let's think about you guys 4 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:31.970
 Astronomical Observatory Culture 4 If the shape of the house is correct, 4 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.990
 At first glance, this is now the home dwaetjiman does this opening of the osteotomy night 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.610
 I'll see. 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:42.660
 1 House 2 House 3 House 4 House 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 house that will water 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:46.530
 So you can think about it. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.150
 So who's going to weigh enough to create a look you end game 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.460
 The blank space should be reduced to 1 1 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:01.620
 8th house and now surely what a dummy 6th house has a house in Bando 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:08.869
 What words accompanied by any country for repair but a space to write the last party myosu 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:11.160
 So just get through you will need to keep always knew example, four public finds 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.990
 You must know 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:19.710
 I'll do it at the end. 1 house blank. Very stranded. 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 I did like that we will try to really watch party functions 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.700
 The procedure for doing this, first people who will not go out so it could beef 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.039
 do not have 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.090
 Only then do not grab me Plus I'm dropping this 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.350
 At this time, the band will be those who do not thing so out of town 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.690
 If you think you are mistaken 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.890
 I grew bigger when I did not do anything with this. 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.600
 Is it the same? 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.800
 It should be able to simply kkatda when all the lights so I can be get through 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.300
 When the oil 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:55.020
 Red Army after Biggie was not much on the outside of the home What is a drink that 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:00.569
 Not gone yet another example not finish the comparison 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:05.490
 Ah, so that a space reading something hairy mewojyeo sseulttaen in the way 0 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:09.959
 Engineering College 10 contents 4 mistakenly Yu Yu Young 4 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.410
 You are in jinjeokyi milling 4 so that it every 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.069
 I was never caught will have to be careful the space 10000000000000 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.019
 The second hit was a very public so in this form 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:26.700
 The've seen him so plainly enters 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:31.019
 So I do not look at it so I just tell Knife Set poison this more in 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:36.420
 When you enter it, I put it off any more itjyo 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:39.360
 It's about 7 o'clock. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.480
 It is considered to be a variety of things. 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.840
 But it is a mistake. 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.319
 Scary numbers do not do this. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.450
 I gave you a burglary. 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.260

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:03.690
 It's better not to know this now. 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.680
 If you get a lot of things like this, the key is bd. Back is 1 tb 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.580
 I heard something. 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.760
 It's only 4 certification, so you should not just end up here . 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.950
 You should go to bed and go black. 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.950
 I do not want to give you 102 when you write here like this. 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.340
 Lift favorite thing turns into an example 4 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.330
 If you feed me like this, 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.989
 I can feed you again . 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.769
 When it should be , I will not make a connection. 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:39.120
 Let's cheer up the pig after dark 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.920
 So now I'm not coming home, but will also be the home I look 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.349
 Then I come here. 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.129

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.989
 Click 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:56.950
 This is a mistake. 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:04.840
 I got the number down. 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:07.329
 It can not do this, no party should do this first scene 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.010
 Hunt Abandonment 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:13.090
 Following will give live five houses, but these forces shape you can go to the party charged 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.940

 Then, too, if I ran after 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:31.030
 How many cases it is now pretty much run out boyeodo pile of awesome space inversion 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.620
 Oh spicy ground will have to think like a good drink 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.120
 You can not blame your partner for this . 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.440
 I was going to have to. 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.099
