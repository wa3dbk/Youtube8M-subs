hi this is sharing in this tutorial I'm

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.530 
hi this is sharing in this tutorial I'm
going<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.879> show<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.149> how<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.510> draw<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.490> easy

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
going to show you how to draw a easy

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.960 
going to show you how to draw a easy
rosebud<00:00:06.569> so<00:00:07.230> start<00:00:07.680> by<00:00:07.799> drawing<00:00:08.250> an<00:00:08.519> oval

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
rosebud so start by drawing an oval

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.310 
rosebud so start by drawing an oval
shape<00:00:09.410> next<00:00:10.410> followed<00:00:10.920> by<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.550> vase<00:00:12.330> looks<00:00:13.170> like

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
shape next followed by a vase looks like

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.359 
shape next followed by a vase looks like
it's<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.590> vase<00:00:13.799> tipping<00:00:14.250> over<00:00:16.190> then<00:00:17.190> you're

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it's a vase tipping over then you're

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.410 
it's a vase tipping over then you're
going<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.730> draw<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.539> stem<00:00:19.160> which<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.189> too<00:00:20.699> long

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
going to draw the stem which is too long

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.170 
going to draw the stem which is too long
sweeping<00:00:22.050> lines<00:00:23.090> parallel<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.420> each<00:00:24.660> other

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
sweeping lines parallel to each other

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.790 
sweeping lines parallel to each other
followed<00:00:27.180> by<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:27.960> oval<00:00:28.289> shape<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
followed by a little oval shape on the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.240 
followed by a little oval shape on the
end<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.160> show<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.670> cylindrical<00:00:30.539> form<00:00:31.219> draw<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
end to show the cylindrical form draw a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.930 
end to show the cylindrical form draw a
diagonal<00:00:32.640> line<00:00:33.000> across<00:00:33.170> your<00:00:34.340> rosebud<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
diagonal line across your rosebud and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.290 
diagonal line across your rosebud and
then<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> little<00:00:37.230> swirl<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.489> inside<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
then a little swirl on the inside to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.799 
then a little swirl on the inside to
show<00:00:39.480> where<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.260> petals<00:00:40.620> are

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
show where all the little petals are

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.900 
show where all the little petals are
next<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.320> rose<00:00:43.800> hips<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.320> sepals<00:00:46.910> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
next the rose hips and the sepals the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.209 
next the rose hips and the sepals the
sepals<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:49.170> hold<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> flower

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
sepals are what hold all the flower

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.880 
sepals are what hold all the flower
petals<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.910> before<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> bud<00:00:52.050> starts<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> bloom

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
petals in before the bud starts to bloom

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.569 
petals in before the bud starts to bloom
and<00:00:54.050> then<00:00:55.050> you're<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> draw<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> leaf

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and then you're going to draw the leaf

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.110 
and then you're going to draw the leaf
and<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.559> long<00:00:58.920> line<00:00:59.640> therefore

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and it's just one long line therefore

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.720 
and it's just one long line therefore
the<00:01:00.420> stem<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.590> oval<00:01:02.250> shape<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.520> two

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the stem and then oval shape with two

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.070 
the stem and then oval shape with two
pointy<00:01:03.239> ends<00:01:03.629> around<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.840> you've

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
pointy ends around it so now that you've

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.780 
pointy ends around it so now that you've
done<00:01:07.260> drawing<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.100> rose<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.520> time<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
done drawing your rose it's time to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
done drawing your rose it's time to
outline<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.450> keep<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.619> wrist<00:01:10.860> nice<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
outline it keep your wrist nice and

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
outline it keep your wrist nice and
relaxed<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:13.159> just<00:01:14.159> draw<00:01:14.790> from<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.270> point<00:01:15.630> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
relaxed and just draw from one point to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:28.170 
relaxed and just draw from one point to
the<00:01:15.960> other<00:01:18.080> nice<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.409> smooth

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.289 

an<00:01:29.320> interesting<00:01:30.320> fact<00:01:30.680> about<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.460> rosehips

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
an interesting fact about the rosehips

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.719 
an interesting fact about the rosehips
is<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:33.049> they<00:01:33.259> contain<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> lot<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.100> vitamin<00:01:34.250> C

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
is that they contain a lot of vitamin C

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.499 
is that they contain a lot of vitamin C
and<00:01:35.420> they're<00:01:36.049> also<00:01:36.200> edible<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.580> when<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.149> see

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
and they're also edible so when you see

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.710 
and they're also edible so when you see
the<00:01:39.020> petals<00:01:39.409> fall<00:01:39.649> off<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.250> rose<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:41.149> it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
the petals fall off of it rose and it

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.760 
the petals fall off of it rose and it
leaves<00:01:41.899> behind<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:42.530> very<00:01:42.979> large<00:01:43.700> berry<00:01:44.149> like

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
leaves behind this very large berry like

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.580 
leaves behind this very large berry like
shape<00:01:46.119> those<00:01:47.119> are<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.659> rose<00:01:47.869> hips

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
shape those are the rose hips

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.120 
shape those are the rose hips
they're<00:01:48.979> usually<00:01:49.159> collected<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.130> there's

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
they're usually collected and there's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.570 
they're usually collected and there's
all<00:01:52.220> sorts<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.549> cool<00:01:52.789> stuff<00:01:53.060> done<00:01:53.330> with<00:01:53.509> them

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
all sorts of cool stuff done with them

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.710 
all sorts of cool stuff done with them
so<00:01:55.580> there<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:55.850> go<00:01:56.030> rose<00:01:56.539> hips<00:01:56.869> are<00:01:57.080> edible<00:01:58.720> now

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
so there you go rose hips are edible now

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.800 
so there you go rose hips are edible now
