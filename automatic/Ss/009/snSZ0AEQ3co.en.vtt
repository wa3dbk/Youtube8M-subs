start<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.300> fill<00:02:21.569> up<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.959> cartridge<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.040> we

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
start to fill up the cartridge and we

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.360 
start to fill up the cartridge and we
carry<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.150> pulling<00:02:24.510> until<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.349> see<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
carry on pulling until we can see the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.600 
carry on pulling until we can see the
first<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:27.090> bit<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.330> yellow<00:02:27.540> appear<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
first little bit of yellow appear in the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.400 
first little bit of yellow appear in the
syringe<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.569> there's<00:02:30.870> our<00:02:30.989> first<00:02:31.200> of

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
syringe there it is there's our first of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.930 
syringe there it is there's our first of
the<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.680> flu<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.190> we<00:02:32.280> don't<00:02:32.489> we<00:02:32.730> don't

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the bit of flu and we don't we don't

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.640 
the bit of flu and we don't we don't
fill<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.390> syringe<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.200> little<00:02:34.440> bit<00:02:34.560> of

fill up the syringe just a little bit of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.920 
fill up the syringe just a little bit of
ink<00:02:34.830> we're<00:02:35.310> not<00:02:35.550> going<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.060> recycle<00:02:36.540> that

ink we're not going to recycle that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.479 
ink we're not going to recycle that
we're<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> throw<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.680> away<00:02:37.890> because

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
we're going to throw that away because

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.479 
we're going to throw that away because
that<00:02:39.090> first<00:02:39.569> little<00:02:39.840> bit<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.200> ink<00:02:40.489> inevitably

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
that first little bit of ink inevitably

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.770 
that first little bit of ink inevitably
is<00:02:41.610> going<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.000> be<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.330> little<00:02:42.569> bit<00:02:42.750> that

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
is going to be the little bit that

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.470 
is going to be the little bit that
carries<00:02:43.349> any<00:02:43.530> debris<00:02:43.860> through<00:02:44.370> any<00:02:44.640> any<00:02:45.209> bit

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
carries any debris through any any bit

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360 
carries any debris through any any bit
of<00:02:45.510> dust<00:02:45.840> or<00:02:46.019> what-have-you<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.680> what<00:02:47.040> we<00:02:47.160> do

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
of dust or what-have-you and what we do

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.240 
of dust or what-have-you and what we do
is<00:02:47.580> haven't<00:02:48.330> done<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> yellow<00:02:48.989> let's<00:02:49.260> say<00:02:49.500> we

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
is haven't done the yellow let's say we

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.110 
is haven't done the yellow let's say we
then<00:02:50.430> get<00:02:50.700> rid<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.209> clean<00:02:52.080> clean<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.250> get

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
then get rid of that clean clean the get

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.390 
then get rid of that clean clean the get
rid<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> ink<00:02:54.690> clean<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.650> syringe<00:02:55.860> with

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
rid of the ink clean the syringe with

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.210 
rid of the ink clean the syringe with
fresh<00:02:56.850> with<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.660> with<00:02:57.989> with<00:02:58.590> fresh<00:02:58.980> water

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
fresh with with with with fresh water

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.850 
fresh with with with with fresh water
and<00:02:59.670> then<00:03:00.390> we<00:03:00.599> would<00:03:00.720> use<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.049> same<00:03:01.080> syringe

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
and then we would use the same syringe

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.479 
and then we would use the same syringe
that's<00:03:02.220> cleaned<00:03:02.549> out<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.930> magenta<00:03:04.489> then

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
that's cleaned out on the magenta then

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.240 
that's cleaned out on the magenta then
we<00:03:05.700> do<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.030> cyan<00:03:06.500> then<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.680> do<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.040> photo

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
we do the cyan then we do the photo

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.229 
we do the cyan then we do the photo
black<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.110> light<00:03:10.410> black<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:12.030> light

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
black and so on light black the light

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.530 
black and so on light black the light
cyan<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.170> light<00:03:13.830> magenta<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.299> light

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
cyan the light magenta and the light

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.199 
cyan the light magenta and the light
light<00:03:15.810> black<00:03:16.080> finally<00:03:16.650> cleaning<00:03:17.459> our<00:03:17.790> syringe

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
light black finally cleaning our syringe

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.039 
light black finally cleaning our syringe
between<00:03:18.840> each<00:03:19.140> color<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.100> making<00:03:20.940> sure<00:03:21.450> that

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
between each color and making sure that

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.900 
between each color and making sure that
we<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.500> take<00:03:22.739> out<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.100> little<00:03:23.310> bit<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.700> ink

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
we just take out a little bit of ink

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.620 
we just take out a little bit of ink
each<00:03:24.180> time<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.640> feel<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.600> feel

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
each time so so you feel that you feel

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.039 
each time so so you feel that you feel
that<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.739> reservoir<00:03:29.280> with<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.609> ink<00:03:30.049> so

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
that the the reservoir with the ink so

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.390 
that the the reservoir with the ink so
yeah<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.980> put<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.609> put<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.829> draw

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
yeah you put it you put that in and draw

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.660 
yeah you put it you put that in and draw
through<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.209> ink<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.660> each<00:03:36.870> one<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.440> then

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
through the ink on each one and then

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.300 
through the ink on each one and then
replace<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.940> bung<00:03:39.150> each<00:03:39.450> time<00:03:39.900> now<00:03:40.650> finally

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
replace the bung each time now finally

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.520 
replace the bung each time now finally
once<00:03:41.609> we've<00:03:41.880> once<00:03:42.209> we've<00:03:42.480> filled<00:03:43.260> all<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
once we've once we've filled all the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.059 
once we've once we've filled all the
reservoirs<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.489> we've<00:03:45.090> actually<00:03:45.889> well<00:03:46.889> and

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
reservoirs and we've actually well and

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.640 
reservoirs and we've actually well and
we've<00:03:47.220> primed<00:03:47.579> all<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.060> cartridges<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:49.319> last

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
we've primed all the cartridges the last

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.550 
we've primed all the cartridges the last
thing<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.069> need<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.310> do<00:03:50.609> is<00:03:50.910> go<00:03:51.600> back<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.900> our<00:03:52.260> a

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
thing we need to do is go back to our a

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.800 
thing we need to do is go back to our a
little<00:03:53.310> pack<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.730> spares<00:03:54.060> these

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
little pack of spares these

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.300 
little pack of spares these
installations<00:03:55.590> are<00:03:55.739> very<00:03:56.040> very

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
installations are very very

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.660 
installations are very very
straightforward<00:03:58.040> notice<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.190> we're<00:03:59.370> given

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
straightforward notice that we're given

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.789 
straightforward notice that we're given
a<00:03:59.760> nice<00:03:59.910> long<00:04:00.269> needle<00:04:00.750> there<00:04:00.900> now<00:04:01.109> that<00:04:01.260> long

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
a nice long needle there now that long

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.400 
a nice long needle there now that long
needle<00:04:02.190> is<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> very<00:04:02.639> nice<00:04:02.880> way<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.480> drawing<00:04:04.049> ink

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
needle is a very nice way of drawing ink

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.920 
needle is a very nice way of drawing ink
in<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.950> transferring<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.329> out<00:04:06.420> from<00:04:06.750> a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
in and transferring it in and out from a

in and transferring it in and out from a
bottle<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.760> actually

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
bottle in so you can you actually

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.160 
bottle in so you can you actually
transfer<00:04:09.590> ink<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.829> that<00:04:11.010> way<00:04:11.220> now<00:04:11.819> they<00:04:12.209> lice

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
transfer ink in that way now they lice

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.539 
transfer ink in that way now they lice
and<00:04:13.350> give<00:04:13.530> us<00:04:13.709> these<00:04:13.980> nice<00:04:14.420> these<00:04:15.420> nice

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
and give us these nice these nice

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.240 
and give us these nice these nice
breathers<00:04:17.579> now<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.269> breathers<00:04:19.010> enable<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
breathers now the breathers enable the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.500 
breathers now the breathers enable the
inks<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:21.299> travel<00:04:21.750> down<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.669> air<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.240> enter

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
so now we're ready to put this off to

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.670 
so now we're ready to put this off to
one<00:05:14.980> side<00:05:15.010> notice<00:05:15.880> we<00:05:16.240> notice<00:05:16.840> we<00:05:17.020> use<00:05:17.260> a<00:05:17.290> drip

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
one side notice we notice we use a drip

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.470 
one side notice we notice we use a drip
tray<00:05:17.860> you<00:05:18.250> can<00:05:18.370> get<00:05:18.580> these<00:05:18.730> drip<00:05:19.000> trays<00:05:19.240> from

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
tray you can get these drip trays from

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.870 
tray you can get these drip trays from
us<00:05:19.690> they<00:05:20.260> make<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.470> make<00:05:21.070> a<00:05:21.100> nice<00:05:21.370> job<00:05:21.730> of

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
us they make a make a nice job of

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.210 
us they make a make a nice job of
actually<00:05:22.030> holding<00:05:22.630> everything<00:05:22.900> together<00:05:23.220> now

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
actually holding everything together now

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.680 
actually holding everything together now
while<00:05:24.550> we're<00:05:24.730> doing<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:25.150> let's<00:05:25.450> make<00:05:25.660> it

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
while we're doing this let's make it

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.650 
while we're doing this let's make it
very<00:05:26.050> plain<00:05:26.290> it's<00:05:26.740> very<00:05:26.980> important<00:05:27.640> that<00:05:27.910> you

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
very plain it's very important that you

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.770 
very plain it's very important that you
keep<00:05:29.020> this<00:05:29.320> reservoir<00:05:30.010> at<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.790> printer<00:05:31.360> level

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
keep this reservoir at the printer level

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.110 
keep this reservoir at the printer level
so<00:05:32.290> it's<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.530> same<00:05:32.830> level<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.640> printer

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
so it's the same level that the printer

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.810 
so it's the same level that the printer
sits<00:05:34.420> on<00:05:34.660> don't<00:05:35.380> be<00:05:35.590> tempted<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:36.250> raise<00:05:36.490> the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
sits on don't be tempted to raise the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.740 
sits on don't be tempted to raise the
the<00:05:37.720> reservoirs<00:05:38.260> up<00:05:38.560> if<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:39.280> do<00:05:39.520> that<00:05:39.880> you<00:05:40.480> run

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
the reservoirs up if you do that you run

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.380 
the reservoirs up if you do that you run
the<00:05:40.900> risk<00:05:41.170> of<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.590> cartridges<00:05:42.390> siphoning

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
the risk of the cartridges siphoning

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.090 
the risk of the cartridges siphoning
back<00:05:43.660> into<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.170> machine<00:05:45.270> now<00:05:46.290> let's<00:05:47.290> move<00:05:47.680> the

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
back into the machine now let's move the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.810 
back into the machine now let's move the
let's<00:05:48.580> move<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.890> let-let's<00:05:50.890> let's<00:05:51.310> move<00:05:51.580> the

let's move the let-let's let's move the
camera<00:05:52.030> across<00:05:52.540> now<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:53.830> the<00:05:54.460> to<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.330> final

camera across now to the to the final
stage<00:05:56.760> where<00:05:57.760> where<00:05:58.180> we're<00:05:58.330> actually<00:05:58.420> going

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
stage where where we're actually going

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.690 
stage where where we're actually going
to<00:05:58.840> put<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.170> cartridges<00:05:59.830> into<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.340> machine

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
to put the cartridges into the machine

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.000 
to put the cartridges into the machine
and<00:06:00.940> make<00:06:01.390> sure<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:01.870> traveling<00:06:02.350> is<00:06:02.470> okay<00:06:02.950> so

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
and make sure the traveling is okay so

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.000 
and make sure the traveling is okay so
let's<00:06:03.700> again<00:06:04.240> change<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.350> view<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:05.860> the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
let's again change the view of the

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.880 
let's again change the view of the
camera<00:06:06.250> so<00:06:07.090> we're<00:06:07.270> looking<00:06:07.630> back<00:06:07.900> we're
