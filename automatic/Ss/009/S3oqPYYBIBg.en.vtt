hey come on Sava through the forum and
through<00:00:19.940> some<00:00:20.150> emails<00:00:22.660> I've<00:00:23.660> noticed<00:00:24.170> that

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
through some emails I've noticed that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.250 
through some emails I've noticed that
quite<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.830> few<00:00:24.950> people<00:00:25.840> have<00:00:26.840> a<00:00:26.870> problem

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
quite a few people have a problem

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.100 
quite a few people have a problem
getting<00:00:27.860> their<00:00:28.100> beats<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.610> come<00:00:28.820> up<00:00:32.110> we've

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
getting their beats to come up we've

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.619 
getting their beats to come up we've
probably<00:00:33.649> covered<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:34.879> some<00:00:35.149> older

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
probably covered this and some older

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.520 
probably covered this and some older
videos<00:00:37.239> but<00:00:38.239> I<00:00:38.300> figured<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:38.810> was<00:00:38.900> maybe<00:00:39.200> time

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
videos but I figured it was maybe time

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.850 
videos but I figured it was maybe time
to<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:41.090> go<00:00:41.300> over<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.690> again<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.050> show<00:00:42.470> you<00:00:42.530> how

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
to to go over it again and show you how

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.840 
to to go over it again and show you how

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
fall garden is every few days I plant a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.899 
fall garden is every few days I plant a
little<00:01:06.560> short<00:01:07.360> section<00:01:08.360> of<00:01:08.679> something<00:01:09.909> might

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
little short section of something might

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.350 

beet<00:01:38.770> seeds<00:01:39.189> or<00:01:40.119> much<00:01:41.049> bigger<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:43.060> your

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
cauliflower so they need to be planted a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:59.279 
cauliflower so they need to be planted a
little<00:01:51.549> deeper<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:58.119> unless<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:59.020> want<00:01:59.049> to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
have to do a whole lot of thinning you

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.479 
have to do a whole lot of thinning you
want<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.250> try<00:02:03.459> to<00:02:03.520> space<00:02:04.030> them<00:02:04.329> out<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:05.489> couple

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
want to try to space them out a couple

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:16.130 
want to try to space them out a couple
of<00:02:06.610> inches<00:02:06.700> apart<00:02:12.060> best<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.239> can

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.070 

once<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:18.170> seeds<00:02:19.170> spaced<00:02:20.160> out<00:02:21.080> you

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
once you have the seeds spaced out you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.280 
once you have the seeds spaced out you
want<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.350> cover<00:02:22.680> them<00:02:22.950> with<00:02:23.100> about<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:24.290> half

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
want to cover them with about a half

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.340 
want to cover them with about a half
inch<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.770> dirt<00:02:28.580> best<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:30.030> again<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.640> not

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
inch of dirt best you can again it's not

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:51.140 
inch of dirt best you can again it's not
it's<00:02:34.350> not<00:02:34.470> an<00:02:34.650> exact<00:02:35.070> science<00:02:50.030> chopping<00:02:51.030> them

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
it's not an exact science chopping them

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.800 
it's not an exact science chopping them
down<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.810> they<00:02:51.930> make<00:02:52.140> good<00:02:52.470> contact<00:02:53.370> with<00:02:53.810> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
down so they make good contact with the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:11.000 
down so they make good contact with the
soil<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:06.060> yes<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.810> guessed<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:09.709> water<00:03:10.709> them

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
soil and yes you guessed it water them

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:20.850 
soil and yes you guessed it water them
in

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.850 

and<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:22.099> do<00:03:22.280> this<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:23.000> order<00:03:23.239> them<00:03:23.860> about

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
and you do this you order them about

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:35.229 
and you do this you order them about
every<00:03:25.220> day<00:03:25.489> or<00:03:25.730> two<00:03:26.709> till<00:03:27.709> they<00:03:27.890> come<00:03:28.129> up<00:03:34.239> if
