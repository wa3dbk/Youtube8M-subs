00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.130 
there's a couple minor things that I
don't<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:29.010> like<00:00:29.550> EJ<00:00:30.390> actually<00:00:30.810> made<00:00:30.960> me<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
don't like like EJ actually made me a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.100 
don't like like EJ actually made me a
great<00:00:31.500> custom<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.899> commander<00:00:33.899> Steve

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
great custom of this commander Steve

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.830 
great custom of this commander Steve
Rogers<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.829> he<00:00:35.790> has<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> stars<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.660> his

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
Rogers and he has the stars on his

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.150 
Rogers and he has the stars on his
shoulders<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.200> they<00:00:37.500> didn't<00:00:37.739> include<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
shoulders but they didn't include it I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.889 
shoulders but they didn't include it I
know<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.460> there's<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> joint<00:00:39.210> there<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
know that there's a joint there but I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.810 
know that there's a joint there but I
figure<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.739> could<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:40.980> some<00:00:41.309> way<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> do

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
figure there could be some way to do

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.880 
figure there could be some way to do
that<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.570> also<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> star<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.680> should<00:00:43.860> be

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that and also the star I think should be

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
that and also the star I think should be
a<00:00:43.980> little<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:44.280> bigger<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.789> those<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.539> just

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
a little bit bigger but those are just

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
a little bit bigger but those are just
some<00:00:45.930> minor<00:00:46.140> things<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.680> mean<00:00:46.829> EJ<00:00:47.280> could<00:00:47.489> do

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
some minor things I mean EJ could do

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540 
some minor things I mean EJ could do
like<00:00:47.820> an<00:00:48.030> in-house<00:00:48.300> bro<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.460> do<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
like an in-house bro do it but do you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.240

the variant the regular one actually has

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.970

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.109 
arms can fully rotate they go in and out
rotate<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.500> bicep<00:01:40.950> band<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.460> two<00:01:41.610> points<00:01:41.970> at

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
rotate the bicep band at two points at

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.899 
rotate the bicep band at two points at
the<00:01:42.270> elbow<00:01:42.540> rotate<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.649> risks<00:01:44.369> right<00:01:44.579> here

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the elbow rotate at the risks right here

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.510 
the elbow rotate at the risks right here
they<00:01:45.780> don't<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.710> unfortunately

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
they don't go in and out unfortunately

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
they don't go in and out unfortunately
which<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.119> sucks<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.930> alright<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
which kind of sucks but it's alright I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.219 
which kind of sucks but it's alright I
guess<00:01:50.090> he<00:01:51.090> does<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.479> nice<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.930> crunch

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
guess he does have a nice out crunch

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.560 
guess he does have a nice out crunch
back<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> forth<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.369> he<00:01:53.939> does<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.329> full

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
back and forth and he does have full

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
back and forth and he does have full
waist<00:01:54.810> articulation<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.680> ball<00:01:56.219> jointed<00:01:56.610> hips

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
waist articulation the ball jointed hips

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760 
waist articulation the ball jointed hips
that<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.960> rotate<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.590> move

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that go in and out and rotate it to move

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.260 
that go in and out and rotate it to move
forward<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.130> back<00:01:59.280> rotate<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.180> upper

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
forward and back rotate at the upper

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.359 
forward and back rotate at the upper
part<00:02:00.420> leg<00:02:00.780> bent<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:01.530> points<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> knee

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
part leg bent at two points at the knee

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.569 
part leg bent at two points at the knee
and<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.119> ankles<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:04.229> rotate<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and this ankles can rotate you just the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.459 
and this ankles can rotate you just the
soft<00:02:05.880> plastic<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.659> can't<00:02:07.020> rotate<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.290> but

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
soft plastic so you can't rotate in but

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.020 
soft plastic so you can't rotate in but
there<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.710> no<00:02:07.860> ankle<00:02:08.190> pivot<00:02:08.459> except<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.910> goes

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
there is no ankle pivot except it goes

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.760 
there is no ankle pivot except it goes
forward<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.479> back<00:02:09.599> Steve<00:02:09.899> Rogers<00:02:10.289> comes<00:02:10.560> with

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
his photon shield on this back because

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.600 
his photon shield on this back because
it's<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.330> his<00:02:45.480> arm<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.380> everything<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.010> it's
