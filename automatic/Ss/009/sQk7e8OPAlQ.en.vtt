it's a husky 26 inch with a 5 horsepower
engine<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:42.469> we've<00:00:43.469> got<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.770> guests

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
engine on it and we've got some guests

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.209 
engine on it and we've got some guests
in<00:00:44.160> there<00:00:44.570> that's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.690> two-stage<00:00:46.230> machine<00:00:46.860> so

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
in there that's a two-stage machine so

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
in there that's a two-stage machine so
you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.610> there's<00:00:47.820> impeller<00:00:48.719> down<00:00:49.079> inside

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you can see there's impeller down inside

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
you can see there's impeller down inside
the<00:00:49.770> chute<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.390> then<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.840> front<00:00:52.550> there's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the chute and then out front there's

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.200 
the chute and then out front there's
also<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:54.199> bleed<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> two-stage<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
also a bleed now in a two-stage the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.439 
also a bleed now in a two-stage the
front<00:00:57.510> doesn't<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> spend<00:00:58.500> very<00:00:58.680> fast<00:00:59.449> so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
front doesn't have to spend very fast so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.720 
front doesn't have to spend very fast so
this<00:01:00.600> part<00:01:00.899> goes<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.289> slow<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.579> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this part goes really slow but that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.369 
this part goes really slow but that
kicks<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.480> high<00:01:03.629> speed<00:01:04.049> blower

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
kicks it into the high speed blower

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.789 
kicks it into the high speed blower
niche<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> back<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:07.619> high

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
niche in the back here and that high

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
niche in the back here and that high
speed<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.280> power<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.820> shoots<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
speed and power really shoots it out the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.899 
speed and power really shoots it out the
chute<00:01:09.840> pretty<00:01:10.080> good<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> whole<00:01:12.030> machine

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
chute pretty good and the whole machine

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.969 
chute pretty good and the whole machine
should<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:14.970> running<00:01:15.299> shortly<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.020> we'll<00:01:16.170> give

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
should be running shortly and we'll give

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.670 
should be running shortly and we'll give
it<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.130> pull<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.369> try<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> start<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.680> this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it a pull and try to start it here this

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
chute you can of course just the angle

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.390 
chute you can of course just the angle
that<00:02:16.630> you're<00:02:16.840> throwing<00:02:17.079> on<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.500> along<00:02:18.250> with

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
the engine speed though but we see these

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.069 
the engine speed though but we see these
little<00:02:21.519> holes<00:02:21.849> here<00:02:22.000> they<00:02:22.540> run<00:02:22.720> around<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
little holes here they run around the

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.020 
little holes here they run around the
outside<00:02:23.440> edge<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.860> chute<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.790> there's<00:02:24.970> a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
outside edge of the chute and there's a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.819 
outside edge of the chute and there's a
crank<00:02:25.329> handle<00:02:25.630> up<00:02:26.380> on<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.099> machine<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.530> crank

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
crank handle up on the machine the crank

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.550 
crank handle up on the machine the crank
handle<00:02:30.069> allows<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.359> without<00:02:32.290> getting

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
handle allows you to without getting

adjust<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.900> angle<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.380> chute<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:35.889> back<00:02:36.579> in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
adjust the angle the chute but back in

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.150 
adjust the angle the chute but back in
the<00:02:36.850> crank<00:02:37.120> handle<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.709> make<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:38.980> shoe

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
the crank handle you can make the shoe

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.970 
the crank handle you can make the shoe
rotate<00:02:39.670> different<00:02:40.150> direction<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:41.799> if<00:02:41.859> you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
rotate different direction so if you

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.860 
rotate different direction so if you
look<00:02:42.130> there<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.459> can<00:02:42.639> rotate<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.450> handle

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
look there you can rotate that handle

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.160 
look there you can rotate that handle
and<00:02:44.139> you<00:02:45.069> rotate<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.700> make<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.840> front

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
and you rotate that make it that front

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.500 
and you rotate that make it that front
chute<00:02:47.470> we've<00:02:47.709> it's<00:02:48.519> how<00:02:48.639> you<00:02:48.760> can<00:02:48.880> go<00:02:49.060> left<00:02:49.269> and
