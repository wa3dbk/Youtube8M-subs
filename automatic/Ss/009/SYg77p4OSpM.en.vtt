in<00:00:02.409> this<00:00:02.770> video<00:00:03.129> we<00:00:03.490> will<00:00:03.730> talk<00:00:04.000> about<00:00:04.150> the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.390 
in this video we will talk about the

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.260 
in this video we will talk about the
turtle<00:00:04.720> pump<00:00:05.190> now<00:00:06.190> many<00:00:06.760> of<00:00:06.910> you<00:00:06.970> may<00:00:07.210> be

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.270 
turtle pump now many of you may be

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.860 
turtle pump now many of you may be
wondering<00:00:07.840> why<00:00:08.170> we<00:00:08.320> call<00:00:08.530> this<00:00:08.680> a<00:00:08.830> turtle<00:00:09.160> pump

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
wondering why we call this a turtle pump

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.170 
wondering why we call this a turtle pump
first<00:00:10.870> off<00:00:11.230> as<00:00:11.500> you<00:00:12.010> can<00:00:12.190> see<00:00:12.400> the<00:00:12.760> shape<00:00:13.000> is

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
first off as you can see the shape is

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.440 
first off as you can see the shape is
similar<00:00:13.360> to<00:00:13.720> a<00:00:13.750> turtle<00:00:14.820> secondly<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:16.090> life<00:00:16.270> of

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
similar to a turtle secondly the life of

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.350 
similar to a turtle secondly the life of
the<00:00:16.600> pump<00:00:16.840> is<00:00:17.020> long<00:00:17.230> like<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.440> turtle<00:00:18.119> as<00:00:19.119> you

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
the pump is long like a turtle as you

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.300 
the pump is long like a turtle as you
can<00:00:19.539> see<00:00:19.780> the<00:00:20.110> turtle<00:00:20.440> pump<00:00:20.650> has<00:00:20.800> a<00:00:20.830> vacuum

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.440 
here we will talk about the vacuum

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
function at running time then we will

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.560 
function at running time then we will
talk<00:02:17.690> about<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.020> evacuation<00:02:18.230> time<00:02:18.950> and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
talk about the evacuation time and

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.850 
talk about the evacuation time and
finally<00:02:20.570> we'll<00:02:20.840> get<00:02:21.140> into<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.470> feed<00:02:21.650> pressure

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
finally we'll get into the feed pressure

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.210 
finally we'll get into the feed pressure

very constant and consistent this is due

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.440 
very constant and consistent this is due
