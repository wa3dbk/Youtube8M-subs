00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.870
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.240
 proposes to make small 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.390
 trays with jam for that he 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.550
 we need 50 g of flour 50 g of sugar 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.820
 one or two tablespoons of milk 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.130
 a pinch of salt and a little sugar 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.410
 ice cream 4 tablespoons jam 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.429
 or jelly of your choice and a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.890
 gelatin sheet 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.750
 we will also need molds 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.380
 so if you have musts the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.500
 container 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.540
 but otherwise minimal fine it molds 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.980
 will do it very well we will start 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.980
 to separate the yellows from the whites 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.710
 we are going to mix the yellows with 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.600
 close to half of the sugar and we go 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 to whiten one mix them well and one 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.460
 will see that the mixture cleared 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.509
 then we will go up our whites in snow 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:18.610
 and we're going to incorporate sugar as we go 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:23.020
 measure we will now be able to add 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.030
 the flour in the egg yolks on 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.250
 do not forget our little pinch of salt 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.750
 we will add a little bit of milk to 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.789
 about a tablespoon that must 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.289
 suffice 17 relax a little all that for 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.229
 to have something of about seven 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.600
 pick sure now we're even going aside 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.080
 the whip and we will use the spoon 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.700
 in wood to incorporate the egg white 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.710
 in the yellow and do not break them 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.200
 so we're already incorporating a first 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.860
 spoon we can mix a little bit 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 more quickly the lidc a little bit of 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.119
 relax the mixture and mix until 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.890
 what whites are well incorporated 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.330
 and that we have a nice mix have well 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.009
 smooth we put the oven to preheated to 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.649
 180 Â° now we will fill our molds 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.810
 so here I use a silicone mold 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.790
 but I always sand a little like that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.950
 it goes so fast still demolding if 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.930
 you use classic words think 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.760
 butter them and flour them before 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.349
 to make our trays a little 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.810
 crispy on the outside and 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.910
 mellow in the middle you sprinkle a 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.910
 little the bottom of the icing sugar mussels 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.159
 and now we will fill our 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.000
 footprints so as they are not 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.069
 very deep 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.349
 we fill them to the brim if you 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.700
 use muffin cups for 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.829
 fill up to about a third 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:03:01.690
 maximum half what's up when 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:03:05.170
 even swollen and always so that it 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.750
 crunchy one can we put a little 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:13.540
 little icing sugar on top of our 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:16.590
 cookies and now we bake for 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.590
 a dozen minutes 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.340
 two minutes before the end of cooking 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.140
 we will go mark the footprint 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.670
 middle of the trays to put the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.709
 jam with a spoon 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.940
 wood or something else like that 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.940
 just about this form 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.830
 while she chills 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.090
 we will take care of the filling so we 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.970
 will soak the sheet of 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.920
 gelatin in the water so that they 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.010
 soften and we'll put the jelly or 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.660
 jam in a small saucepan 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.120
 you can also pass it to the microphone 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.410
 waves if you have a jam with 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.570
 many pieces I advise you 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.980
 of the mixer to mix a shot a 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.440
 once she's hot and then like that 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.510
 it will work by itself and it's always 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.120
 better to add a little bit of 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.740
 gelatin it will still be better on 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.570
 the on the cakes do not bump 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.000
 indispensable you can also put 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.000
 a small tip of agar agar knife 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.090
 once the jam is well 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.030
 become liquid again 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.270
 we will get our little sheet of 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:33.690
 Gelatin is going to save them and we are going to 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.690
 put directly in the pans 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.230
 then hop we stop the fire and we go 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.360
 to be able to fill small trays on 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.770
 keep our jam warm 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.160
 so there we pay attention to a pack 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.160
 burnt 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.740
 of course we can garnish our little ones 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.900
 trays of jam of his choice 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.480
 but we can also put what we want 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.680
 for example a little ghana or why 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.750
 no spreads 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.000
 by the way if you want to do it yourself 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.780
