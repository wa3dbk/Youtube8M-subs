car<00:00:23.400> today<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:26.070> you'll<00:00:26.220> be

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
car today and and I think you'll be

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.990 
car today and and I think you'll be
excited<00:00:27.000> about<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.449> Prius<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.800> gets<00:00:29.250> 50<00:00:29.760> miles

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
excited about the Prius it gets 50 miles

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.820 
excited about the Prius it gets 50 miles
to<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> gallon<00:00:30.570> obviously<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.650> that's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
to the gallon obviously and so that's

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.420 
to the gallon obviously and so that's
why<00:00:31.949> people<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> hybrid<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.890> car<00:00:35.219> was

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
why people like the hybrid this car was

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.670 
why people like the hybrid this car was
built<00:00:35.670> from<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> ground<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> hybrid

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
built from the ground up as a hybrid

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.240 
built from the ground up as a hybrid
vehicle<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.790> never<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.690> regular<00:00:40.680> gas

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
vehicle it was never a regular gas

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.030 
vehicle it was never a regular gas
engine<00:00:41.820> car<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.690> crammed<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.469> hybrid

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
engine car and we crammed these hybrid

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.910 
engine car and we crammed these hybrid
components<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.350> like<00:00:46.350> some<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> our

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
components into it like some of our

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
components into it like some of our
competitors<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.700> there<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.270> I'm<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
competitors out there so I'm going to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.680 
competitors out there so I'm going to
show<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> why<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.860> better<00:00:50.300> built<00:00:51.300> from<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
show you why it's better built from the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.310 
show you why it's better built from the
ground<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:53.010> hybrid<00:00:53.960> there's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> lot<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
ground up as a hybrid there's a lot of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
ground up as a hybrid there's a lot of
good<00:00:55.500> things<00:00:55.739> about<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.280> full<00:00:56.640> hybrid

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
good things about this full hybrid

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.170 
good things about this full hybrid
vehicle<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> full<00:00:59.039> hybrid<00:00:59.309> means<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
vehicle what a full hybrid means is that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.799 
vehicle what a full hybrid means is that
the<00:01:00.539> car<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:01.050> run<00:01:01.289> off<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> electric

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the car can run off of just the electric

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.310 
the car can run off of just the electric
power<00:01:04.769> source<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.939> gasoline<00:01:06.600> engine<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
power source the gasoline engine it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.530 
power source the gasoline engine it
doesn't<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.280> running<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.150> entire

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
doesn't have to be running the entire

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.350 
doesn't have to be running the entire
time<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.680> propel<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.490> move<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.939> vehicle

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
time to propel and move the vehicle

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080 
time to propel and move the vehicle
forward<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.890> run<00:01:14.130> off<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
forward it actually can run off just the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.359 
forward it actually can run off just the
electric<00:01:15.540> motor<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.140> slow<00:01:16.439> speeds<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.100> kind<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
electric motor at slow speeds to kind of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.760 
electric motor at slow speeds to kind of
get<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.729> moving<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.330> get<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.630> rolling<00:01:18.840> then

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
get you moving and get you rolling then

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
get you moving and get you rolling then
once<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.549> efficient<00:01:21.180> than<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> gas

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
once it's more efficient than the gas

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
once it's more efficient than the gas
engine<00:01:22.320> kicks<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:24.000> already

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
engine kicks in as you're already

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
engine kicks in as you're already
rolling<00:01:24.780> obviously<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.680> takes<00:01:25.799> more<00:01:26.100> power

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
rolling obviously it takes more power

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.070 
rolling obviously it takes more power
and<00:01:26.580> energy<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.450> moving<00:01:27.780> than<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
and energy to get you moving than to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.929 
and energy to get you moving than to
keep<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.439> moving<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> gas

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
keep you moving and that's what the gas

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.600 
keep you moving and that's what the gas
engine<00:01:30.210> does<00:01:30.570> its<00:01:30.780> job<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.619> gas<00:01:31.950> engine<00:01:32.400> has

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
engine does its job this gas engine has

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
engine does its job this gas engine has
