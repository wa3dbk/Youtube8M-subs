00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
consider building one of these

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.490 
consider building one of these
camp-style<00:03:57.519> clamp<00:03:58.120> racks<00:03:58.420> what's<00:03:59.260> really

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
camp-style clamp racks what's really

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.199 
camp-style clamp racks what's really
cool<00:03:59.680> about<00:03:59.920> this<00:04:00.069> clamp<00:04:00.370> rack<00:04:00.640> is<00:04:00.879> that<00:04:01.060> any

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
cool about this clamp rack is that any

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.300 
cool about this clamp rack is that any
slot<00:04:01.569> can<00:04:01.810> hold<00:04:02.019> either<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.319> bar<00:04:02.680> clamp<00:04:03.040> or

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
slot can hold either a bar clamp or

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.789 
slot can hold either a bar clamp or
these<00:04:03.459> K<00:04:03.700> body<00:04:03.970> style<00:04:04.390> clamps<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.500> it's<00:04:05.680> pretty

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
these K body style clamps so it's pretty

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.740 
these K body style clamps so it's pretty
versatile<00:04:06.280> what<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.000> also<00:04:07.120> like<00:04:07.359> about<00:04:07.390> this

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
versatile what I also like about this

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.750 
versatile what I also like about this
clamp<00:04:08.079> rack<00:04:08.379> is<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.859> it<00:04:09.010> places<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.489> heads

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
clamp rack is that it places the heads

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.360 
clamp rack is that it places the heads
of<00:04:09.939> the<00:04:10.060> clamps<00:04:10.840> towards<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.230> bottom<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:12.159> the

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
of the clamps towards the bottom so the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.800 
of the clamps towards the bottom so the
majority<00:04:12.609> of<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.939> weight<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.329> clamp<00:04:13.599> is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
majority of the weight of the clamp is

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.819 
majority of the weight of the clamp is
down<00:04:14.019> towards<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.470> floor

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
down towards the floor

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.460 
down towards the floor
as<00:04:15.040> opposed<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.120> traditional<00:04:16.870> clamp<00:04:17.169> rack

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
as opposed to a traditional clamp rack

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.710 
as opposed to a traditional clamp rack
where<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.979> head<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.519> clamp<00:04:18.820> is<00:04:19.060> up

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
where the head of the clamp is up

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.900 
where the head of the clamp is up
towards<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.109> top<00:04:20.139> hey<00:04:20.889> why<00:04:21.100> not<00:04:21.130> subscribe<00:04:21.489> to
