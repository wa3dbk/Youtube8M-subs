00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.030
 another of these projects are promoted by the board explained martin 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.729
 saba 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.729
 that currently generates 240 jobs 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.070
 This company is dedicated to the cultivation and fattening of shrimp for export and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.289
 local consumption 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.669
 At least 98% of shrimp production this farm is exported with 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.649
 the highest standards of international quality towards the United States 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.649
 France Spain and Portugal 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.420
 the shrimp that are produced in this place reach doctors from 24 grams 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 up to 35 grams and that are the shrimp known as yumbo here are those of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.320
 higher demand and alex 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.250
 used in international cuisine to prepare delicious dishes the farm 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.990
 planting a pretty high speed we plant up to 80 square animals 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.990
 that's why that aggressive bacteria can be true 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.240
 the entities the shrimp festival 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.460
 comply 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.780
 I have the tandem with the pool 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.970
 we combine the same 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.820
 water what we have but that is not all 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.180
 but its channels 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.590
 We take it to our reservoir channels with the help of pumps 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.160
 a step 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.410
 yes about 40 inches 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.450
 we explain the water for your f10 true 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.210
 the entry of 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.170
 followers in this case perez was some other type of shrimp 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.600
 unless we have 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.470
 the long is going to bring us problems 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.150
 the new one we manage the next jousts that are destined an average of a 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
 meter though depth surrounded us 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.960
 To make it a pleasant environment for shrimp, what we are trying to do is to make it 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.770
 as natural as possible 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 nothing more than that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.750
 at sea 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.070
 of course extract move what is the larva in our laboratory that is 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.460
 find in monterrico 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.750
 is close to each scam 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.079
 by planting 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.029
 we counted the larva 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.809
 volumetric 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.849
 and as I told you previously we planted up to 80 animals per square meter 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.339
 Shrimp feeding is an important asset for the industry 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:31.059
 since in the house of tools not only they grew but a medea we 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.059
 we can know how many animals we are feeding 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.739
 the oscar agent omar we feed four times a day to the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.909
 seven in the morning at 10 in the morning 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.179
 at one o'clock in the afternoon four o'clock in the afternoon to do this we need a city 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.479
 a feeder and another auxiliary cecilia refuge has driven upward 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:56.219
 the investor is depositing the singer spent food feeders 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
 what the dialogue is in charge of rescuing it 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.299
 he tried to look for receipts 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.059
 so you know that shrimp associated costs
