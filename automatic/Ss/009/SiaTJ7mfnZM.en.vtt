to<00:00:01.110> enhance<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.680> drainage<00:00:02.129> that<00:00:03.060> we're

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
to enhance the drainage that we're

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.400 
to enhance the drainage that we're
building<00:00:04.140> here<00:00:04.500> we're<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.580> lay<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.410> layer

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.180 
building here we're going to lay a layer
of<00:00:08.570> porous<00:00:09.570> material<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.160> be

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
of porous material and that can be

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.480

anything it could be bark mulch like you

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.890 
anything it could be bark mulch like you
by<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:16.730> nursery<00:00:17.730> or<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.660> could<00:00:18.869> be

by the the nursery or it could be
chipper<00:00:19.560> material<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.699> God<00:00:20.970> said<00:00:21.270> if

chipper material that you God said if

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.179 
chipper material that you God said if
you<00:00:21.660> trim<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.289> trees<00:00:22.350> or<00:00:22.859> something<00:00:23.130> like

things that were chipped up we want

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460 
things that were chipped up we want
something<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:29.820> porous<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:31.080> will<00:00:31.199> allow

drainage down through the material we're
just<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.460> put<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> couple<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.000> inches

much moisture in them when they were
originally<00:01:18.720> packaged<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> they're<00:01:20.880> not

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
originally packaged and so they're not

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
originally packaged and so they're not

we<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.020> drainage<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:59.189> feel<00:01:59.909> that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
we have for drainage you feel that

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.249 
we have for drainage you feel that
there's<00:02:00.180> quite<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.570> moisture<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.049> this

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
there's quite a bit of moisture in this

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.240 
there's quite a bit of moisture in this
particular<00:02:01.409> material<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.130> up

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
particular material it was put up

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.389 
particular material it was put up
probably<00:02:05.719> for<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.869> reason<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.229> another<00:02:07.399> with

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
probably for one reason or another with

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
probably for one reason or another with
a<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.700> too<00:02:08.879> much<00:02:09.090> moisture<00:02:09.470> okay<00:02:10.470> that's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
a little too much moisture okay that's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.430 
a little too much moisture okay that's
probably<00:02:12.260> what<00:02:13.260> we're

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
probably what we're

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.150 
probably what we're
looking<00:02:13.650> at<00:02:14.360> I'm<00:02:15.360> going<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> spread<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.960> out

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
looking at I'm going to spread it out

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.150 
looking at I'm going to spread it out
and<00:02:17.160> hope<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.520> kind<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.820> sits<00:02:18.090> down<00:02:19.160> into

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
and hope that it kind of sits down into

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.200 
and hope that it kind of sits down into
the<00:02:22.070> it's<00:02:23.070> pretty<00:02:23.340> fluffy<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.090> going

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
the it's pretty fluffy but this is going

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.390 
the it's pretty fluffy but this is going
to<00:02:24.300> settle<00:02:24.540> quite<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> bit<00:02:24.960> when<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.130> get<00:02:26.280> our

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
to settle quite a bit when we get our

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.280 
to settle quite a bit when we get our
topsoil<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.030> all<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.600> there<00:02:27.810> we're

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
topsoil and all that on there we're

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.770 
topsoil and all that on there we're
going<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.590> probably<00:02:29.520> mound<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.480> up<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.660> little

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
going to probably mound it up a little

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.510 
going to probably mound it up a little
bit<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.080> won't<00:02:31.260> because<00:02:31.560> when<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:32.190> water<00:02:32.430> it

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
bit so won't because when we water it

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.670 
bit so won't because when we water it
it's<00:02:33.060> going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.390> settle<00:02:33.720> down<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.350> going<00:02:34.620> to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
it's going to settle down it's going to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.010 
it's going to settle down it's going to
compress<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.160> little<00:02:35.490> bit<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.360> still<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.960> is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
compress a little bit but still this is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.270 
compress a little bit but still this is
pretty<00:02:37.290> fluffy<00:02:37.530> stuff<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:39.060> will<00:02:39.210> allow

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
pretty fluffy stuff and it will allow

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.440 
pretty fluffy stuff and it will allow
for<00:02:41.280> water<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.760> penetrate<00:02:41.910> without<00:02:42.870> becoming

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
for water to penetrate without becoming

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.670 
for water to penetrate without becoming
compacted<00:02:45.450> enough<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.140> stop<00:02:46.410> water

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
compacted enough to stop water

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.770 
compacted enough to stop water
penetration<00:02:47.190> into<00:02:48.000> our<00:02:48.120> drainage<00:02:48.390> system

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
penetration into our drainage system

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.350 
penetration into our drainage system
that<00:02:48.870> we've<00:02:48.990> already<00:02:49.170> established
