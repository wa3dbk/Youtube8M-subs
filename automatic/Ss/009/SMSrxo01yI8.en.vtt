00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
comes to a close this was honestly one

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.179 
comes to a close this was honestly one
of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> coolest<00:01:37.259> chapters<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> bleach<00:01:38.009> I've

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
of the coolest chapters of bleach I've

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.800 
of the coolest chapters of bleach I've
read<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.670> long<00:01:38.909> time<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> first

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
read in a long time and it's the first

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.170 
read in a long time and it's the first
time<00:01:40.170> I've<00:01:40.350> read<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> enjoyed<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
time I've read it and enjoyed it on the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.670 
time I've read it and enjoyed it on the
same<00:01:42.390> level<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> was<00:01:43.290> reading<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
same level as when I was reading the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
same level as when I was reading the
soul<00:01:43.920> Society<00:01:44.430> art<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.820> started<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
soul Society art that started like I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
soul Society art that started like I
think<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> second<00:01:46.950> arc<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
think it was the second arc in the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
think it was the second arc in the
series<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> following

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
series and this one is kind of following

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.950 
series and this one is kind of following
in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> same<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:50.369> footsteps<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> speak

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
in the same like footsteps so to speak

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.620 
in the same like footsteps so to speak
and<00:01:52.460> what<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.700> most<00:01:53.970> about<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and what I like most about it is that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.539 
and what I like most about it is that
it's<00:01:54.930> getting<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:55.680> very<00:01:56.040> dark<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it's getting very very very dark and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
it's getting very very very dark and
these<00:01:57.299> brand<00:01:57.509> new<00:01:57.570> villains<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> vent<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
these brand new villains the vent and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
these brand new villains the vent and
right<00:01:58.590> there<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.799> incredibly<00:01:59.670> ruthless

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
right there just incredibly ruthless

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.910 
right there just incredibly ruthless
they<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:00.479> give<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> fuck<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:01.740> they

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
they don't give a fuck about what they

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
they don't give a fuck about what they
are<00:02:01.979> doing<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.909> fact<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.180> they're

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
are doing and the fact that they're

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.120 
are doing and the fact that they're
doing<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> Arrancar<00:02:04.530> who<00:02:04.740> before

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
doing this to the Arrancar who before

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.530 
doing this to the Arrancar who before
we're<00:02:05.340> seeing<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:06.149> really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
we're seeing is really really

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.590

missing is just very strange and it's

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.300 
missing is just very strange and it's
it's<00:02:09.930> really<00:02:10.050> cool<00:02:10.320> because<00:02:10.380> their<00:02:10.800> design<00:02:11.100> is

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it's really cool because their design is

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.190
