oil changes but let's take a look at the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.400 
oil changes but let's take a look at the
storage<00:03:50.940> up<00:03:51.150> front<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.050> what<00:03:52.230> some

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
storage up front you know what some

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.900 
storage up front you know what some
people<00:03:52.440> like<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.800> do<00:03:52.980> also<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.310> forgot<00:03:53.460> to<00:03:53.730> show

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
people like to do also I forgot to show

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.730 
people like to do also I forgot to show
you<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.480> can<00:03:54.630> fold<00:03:54.840> down<00:03:55.020> these<00:03:55.170> rear<00:03:55.410> seats

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
this right here is actually rollover

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.460 
this right here is actually rollover

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
little bit it has sensors in it that pop

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.530 
little bit it has sensors in it that pop
these<00:04:11.220> up<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.490> these<00:04:11.580> become<00:04:11.880> roll<00:04:12.120> bars<00:04:12.330> all

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540

another<00:04:31.960> nice<00:04:32.230> feature<00:04:32.500> about<00:04:32.800> these<00:04:33.070> is<00:04:33.280> this

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
another nice feature about these is this

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.420 
another nice feature about these is this
has<00:04:34.410> this<00:04:35.410> is<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.620> front<00:04:35.890> of<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.040> top<00:04:36.220> right

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430

here<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.730> convertible<00:04:37.150> top<00:04:37.210> it's<00:04:37.540> nice<00:04:37.690> and

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
here the convertible top it's nice and

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.510 
here the convertible top it's nice and
hard<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.200> what<00:04:38.320> that<00:04:38.470> does<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:38.920> not<00:04:39.460> only

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
hard and what that does is not only

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.280 
hard and what that does is not only
protects<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.270> event<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.750> an<00:04:40.870> accident

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
but it keeps the buffeting down at high

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.910 
but it keeps the buffeting down at high
speeds<00:04:43.210> these<00:04:43.540> are<00:04:43.660> high<00:04:43.780> speed<00:04:44.050> cars<00:04:44.350> and<00:04:44.620> it

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
speeds these are high speed cars and it

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.410 
speeds these are high speed cars and it
keeps<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.220> top<00:04:45.430> from<00:04:45.640> flapping<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.180> getting

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
keeps the top from flapping and getting

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.060 
keeps the top from flapping and getting
very<00:04:46.990> noisy<00:04:47.380> while<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.590> drive<00:04:47.740> that's<00:04:47.950> why
