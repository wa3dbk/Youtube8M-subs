00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
algae in this chamber right here so I

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.090 
algae in this chamber right here so I
went<00:01:07.030> out<00:01:07.179> and<00:01:07.210> bought<00:01:07.509> this<00:01:07.799> light<00:01:08.799> they're

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
went out and bought this light they're

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.910 
went out and bought this light they're
just<00:01:09.280> clamps<00:01:09.909> on<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.319> wall<00:01:11.530> right<00:01:11.740> there

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
just clamps on to the wall right there

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.830 
just clamps on to the wall right there
and<00:01:12.219> I<00:01:12.729> installed<00:01:13.299> a<00:01:14.069> unless<00:01:15.069> you<00:01:15.159> can<00:01:15.310> see<00:01:15.609> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and I installed a unless you can see it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.399 
and I installed a unless you can see it
super<00:01:16.840> computer

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.510 

an<00:01:19.679> LED<00:01:20.490> light<00:01:21.229> 45<00:01:22.229> watts<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.799> only<00:01:23.069> gives<00:01:23.310> off

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
an LED light 45 watts and only gives off

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.819 
an LED light 45 watts and only gives off
I<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.909> it's<00:01:26.909> very<00:01:27.420> very<00:01:28.380> less<00:01:28.590> heat

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
I think just it's very very less heat

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.309 
I think just it's very very less heat
like<00:01:29.039> I<00:01:29.100> could<00:01:29.250> touch<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:29.990> no<00:01:30.990> heat

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
like I could touch it right now no heat

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.010 
like I could touch it right now no heat
whatsoever<00:01:32.209> so<00:01:33.209> I<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.569> try<00:01:33.719> out<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
whatsoever so I was going to try out the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.599 
whatsoever so I was going to try out the
LED<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:36.270> little<00:01:36.539> set<00:01:36.719> down<00:01:36.959> here<00:01:37.520> see<00:01:38.520> if

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
LED on this little set down here see if

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.380 
LED on this little set down here see if
I<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.939> which<00:01:39.359> I'm<00:01:39.659> loving<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.109> right<00:01:40.170> now

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
yep that's first chamber live rock on

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.149 
yep that's first chamber live rock on
the<00:01:45.000> water<00:01:45.179> enters<00:01:45.569> this<00:01:45.740> microphone<00:01:46.740> stock

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the water enters this microphone stock

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:56.740 
the water enters this microphone stock
right<00:01:47.459> now<00:01:49.759> just<00:01:50.759> trying<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> polish<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.509> water

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.540 

then<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.530> second<00:01:57.800> chamber<00:01:57.980> enters<00:01:58.400> my

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
then the second chamber enters my

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.050 
then the second chamber enters my
protein<00:01:59.000> skimmer<00:02:00.130> doing<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.190> good<00:02:01.280> job<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060
