and lower in order to get a similar
effect<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.490> I'm<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.880> doing

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
effect to what I'm going to be doing

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.150 
effect to what I'm going to be doing
today<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.960> try<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:25.890> hair<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
today you can try it if your hair is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.560 
today you can try it if your hair is
shorter<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.730> probably<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
shorter it's probably going to be a

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.439 
shorter it's probably going to be a
little<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:28.019> looser<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.849> would<00:00:30.029> recommend

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
little bit looser so I would recommend

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.569 
little bit looser so I would recommend
this<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> longer<00:00:31.109> hair<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.040> my<00:00:32.309> hair<00:00:32.340> has

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
this for a longer hair so my hair has

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.190 
this for a longer hair so my hair has
been<00:00:32.669> curled<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> curling<00:00:33.450> iron<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
been curled with the curling iron and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.830 
been curled with the curling iron and
all<00:00:34.290> we're<00:00:34.440> gonna<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> low<00:00:35.550> braid<00:00:36.390> not
