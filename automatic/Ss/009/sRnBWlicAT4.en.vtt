redstone<00:00:13.530> video<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.490> been<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> little<00:00:14.820> while

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
redstone video it's been a little while

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.339 
redstone video it's been a little while
since<00:00:15.150> I've<00:00:15.300> made<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.660> few<00:00:16.020> days<00:00:16.170> at<00:00:16.320> least

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
since I've made one few days at least

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.220 
since I've made one few days at least
and<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.520> want<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.700> make<00:00:17.790> a<00:00:17.880> new<00:00:18.060> one<00:00:18.230> I've

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and so I want to make a new one I've

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.380 
and so I want to make a new one I've
recently<00:00:19.890> discovered<00:00:20.610> something<00:00:21.210> with

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
recently discovered something with

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.069 
recently discovered something with
myself<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:22.529> found<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.489> after<00:00:23.910> I'd<00:00:24.029> come<00:00:24.960> up

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
myself I found out after I'd come up

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.179 
myself I found out after I'd come up
with<00:00:25.259> it<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.649> had<00:00:25.739> been<00:00:25.770> discovered

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
with it that it had been discovered

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.179 
with it that it had been discovered
prior<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.880> me<00:00:27.119> mate<00:00:27.329> me<00:00:27.779> discovering<00:00:28.200> it<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:29.040> I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
prior to me mate me discovering it but I

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.530 
prior to me mate me discovering it but I
wanted<00:00:29.399> to<00:00:29.489> make<00:00:29.579> a<00:00:29.640> video<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.270> anyway

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
wanted to make a video about it anyway

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.020 
wanted to make a video about it anyway
because<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.200> was<00:00:31.439> new<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.800> me<00:00:31.829> and<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.730> thought<00:00:32.970> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
because it was new to me and I thought I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.880 
because it was new to me and I thought I
discovered<00:00:33.570> anyway<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.559> kind<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.739> playing

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
discovered anyway I was kind of playing

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.130 
discovered anyway I was kind of playing
around<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.910> tick<00:00:36.210> pulses<00:00:36.720> and<00:00:36.930> i

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
around with one tick pulses and i

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.790 
around with one tick pulses and i
discovered<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.800> i<00:00:38.579> could<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> very

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
discovered that i could make a very

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.479 
discovered that i could make a very
compact<00:00:40.800> binary<00:00:41.489> counter<00:00:42.800> through<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
compact binary counter through this this

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.090 
compact binary counter through this this
is<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.820> I've<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.539> three<00:00:46.050> pistons<00:00:46.769> one<00:00:46.980> off

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
is all I've got three pistons one off

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.119 
is all I've got three pistons one off
the<00:00:47.339> other<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.960> an<00:00:48.960> interrupted<00:00:49.620> signal<00:00:49.980> with

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the other and an interrupted signal with

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.509 
the other and an interrupted signal with
sand<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:51.320> as<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.499> can<00:00:52.679> see<00:00:52.859> the<00:00:53.129> binaries

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
sand and as you can see the binaries

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.500 
sand and as you can see the binaries
counting<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.329> its<00:00:54.929> supposed<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.910> now<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
counting as its supposed to now just to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.160 
counting as its supposed to now just to
prove<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.780> I've<00:00:58.079> got<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> decoder<00:00:58.769> over<00:00:59.010> here

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
prove that I've got a decoder over here

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.729 
prove that I've got a decoder over here
to<00:01:01.940> show<00:01:02.940> us<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.809> does<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.290> increment

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
to show us that it does the increment

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.370 
to show us that it does the increment
one<00:01:04.949> by<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.540> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.690> 0<00:01:06.960> 1<00:01:07.350> 2<00:01:07.740> 3<00:01:07.770> 4<00:01:08.690> 5<00:01:09.690> 6<00:01:09.720> 7

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
one by one this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.440 
one by one this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
there's<00:01:11.369> um<00:01:11.759> yeah<00:01:15.079> and<00:01:16.640> it's<00:01:17.640> counting<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.240> not

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
there's um yeah and it's counting up not

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.740 
there's um yeah and it's counting up not
normally<00:01:20.540> three<00:01:21.540> bits<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:24.240> goes<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.600> at

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
normally three bits and it goes back at

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.969 
normally three bits and it goes back at
the<00:01:24.810> start<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.200> could<00:01:25.380> use<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the start so you could use this for a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.520 
the start so you could use this for a
lot<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.250> different<00:01:26.280> things<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.930> continues<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
lot of different things it continues to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530 
lot of different things it continues to
send<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:28.979> tick<00:01:29.189> pulse<00:01:29.460> every<00:01:30.030> single<00:01:30.360> time

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
send a one tick pulse every single time

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.620 
send a one tick pulse every single time
and<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.409> reason<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.280> because

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
and the reason for that is because

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.700 
and the reason for that is because
actually<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> make<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> thing<00:01:34.200> first<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
actually I make it the thing first and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually I make it the thing first and
then<00:01:34.860> we'll<00:01:34.950> explain<00:01:35.280> why<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.670> works<00:01:36.799> hold<00:01:37.799> on

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
then we'll explain why it works hold on

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.469 
then we'll explain why it works hold on
a<00:01:37.979> moment<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.490> will<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.969> let's<00:01:39.210> put<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
a moment and will it let's put it

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.539 
a moment and will it let's put it
together<00:01:39.710> okay<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.009> we've<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.219> everything<00:01:41.399> we

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
together okay so we've got everything we

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.859 
together okay so we've got everything we
need<00:01:42.140> first<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.320> all<00:01:43.430> what<00:01:44.430> you've<00:01:44.549> got

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
need first of all what you've got

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
need first of all what you've got
initially<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:48.740> something<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.859> this<00:01:50.039> with

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
initially is a something like this with

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.300 
initially is a something like this with
a<00:01:51.170> redstone<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.619> into<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.950> block<00:01:53.280> their

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
a redstone going into that block their

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.219 
a redstone going into that block their
attended<00:01:53.909> at<00:01:54.000> a1<00:01:54.270> tech<00:01:54.479> pulse<00:01:54.719> through<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
attended at a1 tech pulse through the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.420 
attended at a1 tech pulse through the
block<00:01:55.549> to<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.570> next<00:01:57.960> section<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.680> content

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
block to the next section so content

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.679 
block to the next section so content
that<00:01:59.579> will<00:01:59.640> continue<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.149> long<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.509> have

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
that will continue as long as you have

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.169 
that will continue as long as you have
repeaters<00:02:01.229> no<00:02:01.560> greater<00:02:01.950> than<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.399> tick<00:02:02.670> or

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
repeaters no greater than one tick or

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.020 
repeaters no greater than one tick or
redstone<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.229> continue<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.890> perpetuate<00:02:05.609> that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
redstone you continue to perpetuate that

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.070 
redstone you continue to perpetuate that
one<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.869> tick<00:02:07.109> box<00:02:08.270> now<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.539> check<00:02:09.720> pulse<00:02:09.869> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
one one tick box now one check pulse is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.560 
one one tick box now one check pulse is
a<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.470> useful<00:02:10.740> in<00:02:11.100> red<00:02:11.280> stone<00:02:11.550> because<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
a very useful in red stone because it

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.360 
a very useful in red stone because it
makes<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.230> sticky<00:02:13.380> piston<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.950> leave<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.310> to

you<00:02:33.280> an<00:02:33.370> example<00:02:33.670> let's<00:02:33.969> um<00:02:34.209> put<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.590> on<00:02:35.799> here

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
you an example let's um put this on here

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.759 
you an example let's um put this on here
B<00:02:36.849> now<00:02:37.299> as<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:38.079> notice<00:02:38.379> they've<00:02:38.560> all<00:02:38.680> been

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
B now as you notice they've all been

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.369 
B now as you notice they've all been
pushed<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.129> that's<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.909> first<00:02:40.209> reaction<00:02:40.599> it's

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
pushed up that's the first reaction it's

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.780 
pushed up that's the first reaction it's
a<00:02:41.469> really<00:02:41.650> quick<00:02:41.950> pulse<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.430> goes<00:02:42.609> through

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
a really quick pulse that goes through

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.280 
a really quick pulse that goes through
all<00:02:42.909> of<00:02:42.939> them<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.569> one<00:02:43.719> tech<00:02:43.900> pulse<00:02:44.109> is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
all of them and the one tech pulse is

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.839 
all of them and the one tech pulse is
gathered<00:02:44.620> but<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.129> you<00:02:45.280> notice<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:45.609> one's

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
gathered but as you notice this one's

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.750 
gathered but as you notice this one's
back<00:02:46.060> down<00:02:46.269> again<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.719> mean<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
back down again I mean that's the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.179 
back down again I mean that's the
original<00:02:49.150> one<00:02:49.450> now<00:02:50.379> as<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.590> notice<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.010> one

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
original one now as you notice this one

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.589 
original one now as you notice this one
gets<00:02:51.400> pulled<00:02:51.639> down<00:02:51.790> again<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.180> first<00:02:52.359> time

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
gets pulled down again the first time

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.869 
gets pulled down again the first time
and<00:02:52.900> that's<00:02:53.439> because<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:54.280> restaurant<00:02:54.700> here

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
and that's because this restaurant here

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.520 
and that's because this restaurant here
couldn't<00:02:55.209> continue<00:02:55.419> any<00:02:55.689> further<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:56.379> when

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
couldn't continue any further now when

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.500 
couldn't continue any further now when
this<00:02:56.650> comes<00:02:56.889> back<00:02:57.010> through<00:02:57.340> again<00:02:57.370> it'll<00:02:58.299> pull

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
this comes back through again it'll pull

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
this comes back through again it'll pull
this<00:02:59.049> down<00:02:59.319> and<00:02:59.650> push<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.159> up<00:03:00.220> which<00:03:01.090> is

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
this down and push this up which is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.379 
this down and push this up which is
counting<00:03:02.530> for<00:03:02.709> binary<00:03:02.889> still<00:03:03.280> now<00:03:03.939> next<00:03:04.209> time

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
counting for binary still now next time

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.940 
counting for binary still now next time
this<00:03:04.569> will<00:03:04.719> get<00:03:04.840> pulled<00:03:05.049> down<00:03:05.139> again<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.650> then

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
this will get pulled down again and then

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.699 
this will get pulled down again and then
this<00:03:06.459> will<00:03:06.639> get<00:03:06.819> pushed<00:03:07.060> up<00:03:07.239> sorry<00:03:07.989> pull<00:03:08.469> down

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
this will get pushed up sorry pull down

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.979 
this will get pushed up sorry pull down
there<00:03:08.950> Bofur<00:03:09.250> get<00:03:09.430> pushed<00:03:09.669> up<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.629> counts

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
there Bofur get pushed up so it counts

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.770 
there Bofur get pushed up so it counts
in<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.799> binary<00:03:12.280> not<00:03:12.639> only<00:03:12.819> would<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.389> it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
in like binary not only would and it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.509 
in like binary not only would and it
will<00:03:13.870> go<00:03:13.959> all<00:03:14.169> the<00:03:14.230> way<00:03:14.500> through<00:03:14.919> right<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.489> the

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
will go all the way through right to the

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.300 
will go all the way through right to the
end<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.879> then<00:03:16.090> reset<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:17.590> works<00:03:17.919> for<00:03:18.129> any

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
end and then reset it works for any

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.319 
end and then reset it works for any
length<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.959> can<00:03:20.109> be<00:03:20.260> decoded<00:03:20.889> as<00:03:21.280> easy<00:03:21.879> as

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
length and it can be decoded as easy as

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.330 
length and it can be decoded as easy as
this<00:03:22.599> there<00:03:23.439> are<00:03:23.530> probably<00:03:23.709> other<00:03:23.949> ways<00:03:24.159> to

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
this there are probably other ways to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.409 
this there are probably other ways to
Dakota<00:03:24.669> but<00:03:24.849> this<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.060> probably<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.359> easiest

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
Dakota but this is probably the easiest

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.409 
Dakota but this is probably the easiest
way<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.930> put<00:03:26.169> a<00:03:26.199> block<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.799> sand<00:03:27.069> on<00:03:27.280> top<00:03:27.419> of

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
way you put a block of sand on top of

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.439 
way you put a block of sand on top of
each<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.750> these<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.169> have<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.280> go<00:03:30.639> into<00:03:31.090> a

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
each of these and have it go into a

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:37.050 
each of these and have it go into a
redstone<00:03:32.139> signal<00:03:35.069> which<00:03:36.069> is<00:03:36.370> broken<00:03:36.669> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
redstone signal which is broken the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.030 
redstone signal which is broken the
moment<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:38.699> the<00:03:39.699> sand<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.479> retracted<00:03:41.139> see

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
moment the the sand is retracted see

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.580 
moment the the sand is retracted see
watch<00:03:42.250> when<00:03:42.669> this<00:03:42.790> goes<00:03:43.000> through<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.590> will

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
watch when this goes through that will

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.979 
watch when this goes through that will
get<00:03:44.739> pulled<00:03:45.010> down<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:46.329> other<00:03:46.449> three<00:03:46.810> were

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
get pulled down and the other three were

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.089 
get pulled down and the other three were
pushed<00:03:47.319> up<00:03:48.689> see<00:03:49.689> and<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.409> counts<00:03:50.709> like<00:03:50.799> normal

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
pushed up see and it counts like normal

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.030 
pushed up see and it counts like normal
binary<00:03:51.449> I<00:03:52.449> hope<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.109> can<00:03:53.259> find<00:03:53.409> this<00:03:53.560> useful<00:03:53.709> I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
binary I hope you can find this useful I

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.159 
binary I hope you can find this useful I
found<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.729> pretty<00:03:55.120> useful<00:03:55.359> when<00:03:55.629> I<00:03:55.659> figured<00:03:56.079> it

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
found it pretty useful when I figured it

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.069 
found it pretty useful when I figured it
out<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:57.459> then<00:03:57.849> I<00:03:58.090> realized<00:03:58.479> it<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.900> done

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
out and then I realized it it done

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.240 
out and then I realized it it done
before<00:03:59.229> of<00:03:59.470> course<00:03:59.500> has<00:03:59.739> been<00:03:59.889> done<00:04:00.040> for

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
before of course has been done for

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.649 
before of course has been done for
everything<00:04:00.370> I've<00:04:00.729> come<00:04:00.970> up<00:04:01.000> with<00:04:01.150> this<00:04:01.449> been

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
everything I've come up with this been

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.229 
everything I've come up with this been
done<00:04:01.870> before<00:04:02.019> but<00:04:02.669> it's<00:04:03.669> pretty<00:04:03.970> awesome

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
done before but it's pretty awesome

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.849 
done before but it's pretty awesome
either<00:04:04.659> way<00:04:04.780> I'm<00:04:04.959> not<00:04:05.079> going<00:04:05.229> to<00:04:05.290> take<00:04:05.439> credit

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859
