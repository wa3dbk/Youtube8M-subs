hey guys what's up g4tv is cool here
here<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.720> have<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.929> deck<00:00:04.380> profile<00:00:04.799> for<00:00:05.069> you<00:00:05.130> guys

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
here I have a deck profile for you guys

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.750 
here I have a deck profile for you guys
it's<00:00:05.640> basically<00:00:06.629> dimensional<00:00:07.350> robos<00:00:07.760> since

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
it's basically dimensional robos since

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.549 
it's basically dimensional robos since
the<00:00:08.940> trial<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.240> came<00:00:09.510> out<00:00:09.719> recently<00:00:09.900> I

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
the trial that came out recently I

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.320 
the trial that came out recently I
actually<00:00:11.130> bought<00:00:11.400> four<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.790> them<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.120> actually

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
actually bought four of them I actually

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.700 
actually bought four of them I actually
recommend<00:00:12.630> buying<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.320> these<00:00:13.469> because

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
recommend buying for these because

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.410 
recommend buying for these because
they're<00:00:13.860> not<00:00:14.009> really<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.700> bad<00:00:14.940> if<00:00:15.240> you're

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
they're not really that bad if you're

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.359 
they're not really that bad if you're
playing<00:00:15.990> dimensional<00:00:16.500> police<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.070> really

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
playing dimensional police it's a really

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.490 
playing dimensional police it's a really
good<00:00:17.640> stable<00:00:18.570> trial<00:00:18.810> deck<00:00:18.960> there's<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.199> lot<00:00:19.470> of

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
good stable trial deck there's a lot of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.990 
good stable trial deck there's a lot of
good<00:00:19.590> stuff<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.189> Dec<00:00:20.400> actually<00:00:20.850> that

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
good stuff in this Dec actually that

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.090 
good stuff in this Dec actually that
makes<00:00:21.180> dimensional<00:00:22.050> robos<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.529> lot<00:00:22.920> more

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
makes dimensional robos a lot more

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.330 
makes dimensional robos a lot more

also if you have three or more other
dimensional<00:00:49.680> robos<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.219> may<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.789> them

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
dimensional robos you may put all them

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.000 
dimensional robos you may put all them
into<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> soul<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.989> superior<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:52.680> into<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
into the soul and superior right into a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.910 
into the soul and superior right into a
grade<00:00:53.250> 3<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
grade 3 that's more of a you know if you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.200 
grade 3 that's more of a you know if you
don't<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.730> don't<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
don't have if you don't have much of a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420 
don't have if you don't have much of a
choice<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.160> other<00:00:59.160> than<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
choice you do it other than that to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.150 
choice you do it other than that to
great<00:00:59.910> grades<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> good<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.129> good

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
great grades it's a good it's a good

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
great grades it's a good it's a good
grade<00:01:02.460> 0<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> dimensional<00:01:03.809> Robo

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
grade 0 actually it's a dimensional Robo

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.359 
grade 0 actually it's a dimensional Robo
so<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.379> works<00:01:05.869> as<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:07.560> other<00:01:07.680> grade<00:01:07.950> 3<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
so it works as for my other grade 3 I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.840 
so it works as for my other grade 3 I
run<00:01:08.760> super<00:01:09.150> nerd<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.290> new<00:01:10.500> break<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.430> super

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
run super nerd the new break right super

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.990 
run super nerd the new break right super
dimensional<00:01:12.299> rowboat<00:01:12.810> die<00:01:13.560> Kaiser<00:01:14.000> he's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
dimensional rowboat die Kaiser he's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
dimensional rowboat die Kaiser he's
actually<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.450> cool<00:01:15.750> he's<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> really

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
actually really cool he's a really

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.730 
actually really cool he's a really
powerful<00:01:16.799> unit<00:01:17.430> actually<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.740> powerful

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
powerful unit actually so a powerful

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.820 
powerful unit actually so a powerful
grade<00:01:19.950> 3<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.909> yeah<00:01:21.180> his<00:01:21.570> ability<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.259> basically

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
grade 3 so yeah his ability is basically

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
grade 3 so yeah his ability is basically
limit<00:01:23.460> break<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> dimensional

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
limit break for when a dimensional

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.560 
limit break for when a dimensional
police<00:01:25.530> unit<00:01:26.009> rides<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.369> top<00:01:26.580> rides<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.240> top<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
police unit rides on top rides on top of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.710 
police unit rides on top rides on top of
this<00:01:27.720> again<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.829> counterblast<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.450> gains

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
this again you counterblast one it gains

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.700 
this again you counterblast one it gains
10k<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.710> critical<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.400> also<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> ability

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
10k one critical and also the ability

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.980 
10k one critical and also the ability
when<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.159> unit<00:01:35.549> attacks<00:01:35.939> drive<00:01:36.509> checks<00:01:36.810> into

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
when this unit attacks drive checks into

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.819 
when this unit attacks drive checks into
a<00:01:37.140> grade<00:01:37.350> 3<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.970> may<00:01:39.180> select<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.990> card<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
a grade 3 you may select one card in the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920 
a grade 3 you may select one card in the
Guardian<00:01:41.189> circle<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.790> retire<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.750> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
Guardian circle and retire it so it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
Guardian circle and retire it so it's
basically<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.710> retire<00:01:44.040> nullify<00:01:44.640> perfect

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
basically can retire nullify perfect

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.170 
basically can retire nullify perfect
guards<00:01:45.329> which<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.290> good<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.939> as<00:01:47.939> for

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
guards which is really good and as for

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.319 
guards which is really good and as for
my<00:01:48.390> other<00:01:48.659> grade<00:01:48.960> threes<00:01:49.460> it's<00:01:50.460> basically

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
my other grade threes it's basically

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.109 
my other grade threes it's basically
super<00:01:51.720> dimensional<00:01:52.200> Robo<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:53.119> ultimate

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
super dimensional Robo or ultimate

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.389

ability<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.090> basically<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.719> cross<00:01:57.930> ride<00:01:58.229> where

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
ability is basically to cross ride where

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.209 
ability is basically to cross ride where
it<00:01:58.710> gains<00:01:59.390> 2k<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.229> regular<00:02:02.040> day<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
it gains 2k if you have regular day you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.789 
it gains 2k if you have regular day you
shouldn't<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.640> soul<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.000> limit<00:02:03.930> break<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.469> it

shouldn't of soul and limit break for it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.389 
shouldn't of soul and limit break for it
gains<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:06.149> k1<00:02:06.570> crit<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.110> becomes<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.590> 23<00:02:08.220> k

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
gains to k1 crit so it becomes a 23 k

last<00:03:48.519> one<00:03:48.670> this<00:03:48.790> unit<00:03:49.090> attacks<00:03:49.329> hits<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:49.989> may

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
last one this unit attacks hits you may

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.870 
last one this unit attacks hits you may
pay<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.380> cost<00:03:50.680> if<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.160> do<00:03:51.310> draw<00:03:51.639> one<00:03:51.850> card

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
pay the cost if you do draw one card

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.059 
pay the cost if you do draw one card
it's<00:03:52.389> actually<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.720> really<00:03:52.900> good<00:03:53.019> unit<00:03:53.319> in<00:03:53.530> 27<00:03:53.920> k

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
it's actually a really good unit in 27 k

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.199 
it's actually a really good unit in 27 k
booster<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.560> finally<00:03:56.560> we<00:03:56.739> get<00:03:56.920> 10k<00:03:57.459> attackers

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
booster and finally we get 10k attackers

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.300 
booster and finally we get 10k attackers
I<00:03:58.450> only<00:03:58.959> run<00:03:59.109> 3<00:03:59.380> i'm<00:03:59.500> play<00:03:59.709> testing<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.190> out

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
I only run 3 i'm play testing it out

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.210 
I only run 3 i'm play testing it out
right<00:04:00.370> now<00:04:00.730> see<00:04:01.060> if<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.299> runs<00:04:01.450> well<00:04:01.720> with<00:04:01.900> three

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
right now see if it runs well with three

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.800 
right now see if it runs well with three
so<00:04:03.220> yeah<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:05.310> then<00:04:06.310> three<00:04:07.060> perfect<00:04:07.450> guard<00:04:07.599> I

don't really don't really have a I like

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.300 
don't really don't really have a I like
this<00:04:40.449> you<00:04:40.599> just<00:04:40.840> build<00:04:41.080> anyway<00:04:41.319> and<00:04:41.530> finally

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
this you just build anyway and finally

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.850 
this you just build anyway and finally
shield<00:04:42.610> third<00:04:42.969> grade<00:04:43.659> zeros<00:04:44.110> is<00:04:44.319> basically

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
shield third grade zeros is basically

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:57.059 
shield third grade zeros is basically
the<00:04:45.189> standard<00:04:45.819> for<00:04:46.449> heels<00:04:49.409> six<00:04:50.409> crits<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:56.069> six

drawers<00:04:57.430> I<00:04:57.939> always<00:04:58.930> do<00:04:59.199> it<00:04:59.289> my<00:04:59.590> build<00:04:59.800> 664<00:05:00.490> just

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
drawers I always do it my build 664 just

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.929 
drawers I always do it my build 664 just
because<00:05:01.000> this<00:05:01.389> stack<00:05:02.099> you<00:05:03.099> really<00:05:03.400> want<00:05:03.610> stuff

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 
because this stack you really want stuff

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.089 
because this stack you really want stuff
to<00:05:03.969> guard<00:05:04.300> wit<00:05:04.479> because<00:05:05.080> if<00:05:05.259> once<00:05:05.830> your

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
to guard wit because if once your

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.100 
to guard wit because if once your
attacks<00:05:06.490> are<00:05:06.639> done<00:05:06.879> your<00:05:07.509> rear<00:05:07.719> guards

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
attacks are done your rear guards

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.480 
attacks are done your rear guards
probably<00:05:08.379> won't<00:05:08.650> hit<00:05:08.830> for<00:05:09.009> much<00:05:09.189> so<00:05:09.430> you

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
probably won't hit for much so you

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.519 
probably won't hit for much so you
really<00:05:09.789> want<00:05:09.969> to<00:05:10.029> make<00:05:10.150> sure<00:05:10.210> that<00:05:10.389> you<00:05:11.289> have

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529 
really want to make sure that you have

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.649 
really want to make sure that you have
the<00:05:11.560> resources<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.669> you<00:05:13.000> also<00:05:13.180> have<00:05:13.479> the

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
the resources and you also have the

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.909 
the resources and you also have the
shields<00:05:14.050> so<00:05:14.889> yeah<00:05:15.069> I<00:05:15.310> this<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.300> my<00:05:16.740> rather<00:05:17.740> not

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
shields so yeah I this is my rather not

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.830 
shields so yeah I this is my rather not
my<00:05:18.069> build<00:05:18.310> but<00:05:18.490> Carter<00:05:18.759> tacos<00:05:19.120> build<00:05:19.360> i<00:05:19.599> plan

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
my build but Carter tacos build i plan

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.420 
my build but Carter tacos build i plan
on<00:05:19.870> experimenting<00:05:20.680> with<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:20.860> more<00:05:21.189> and<00:05:21.370> more

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
on experimenting with it more and more

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.179 
on experimenting with it more and more
let's<00:05:22.360> see<00:05:22.539> how<00:05:23.080> well<00:05:23.289> it<00:05:23.319> can<00:05:23.469> work<00:05:23.740> and

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
let's see how well it can work and

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.790 
let's see how well it can work and
everything<00:05:24.430> else<00:05:24.729> I<00:05:25.060> may<00:05:26.050> run<00:05:26.199> glory<00:05:26.500> maker

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
everything else I may run glory maker

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.399 
everything else I may run glory maker
but<00:05:27.159> I<00:05:27.219> think<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.729> don't<00:05:27.939> want<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.479> because<00:05:28.870> the

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
but I think I don't want to because the

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.469 
but I think I don't want to because the
deck<00:05:29.650> itself<00:05:29.800> is<00:05:30.279> fine<00:05:30.610> way<00:05:30.909> it<00:05:31.060> is<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:32.460> i<00:05:33.479> plan

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
deck itself is fine way it is and i plan

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.480 
deck itself is fine way it is and i plan
on<00:05:34.509> experimenting<00:05:35.289> it<00:05:35.440> with<00:05:35.620> with<00:05:36.099> it<00:05:36.250> more

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
on experimenting it with with it more

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.279 
on experimenting it with with it more
and<00:05:36.610> more<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:37.029> see<00:05:37.210> how<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.449> works<00:05:37.659> I<00:05:37.960> want<00:05:38.199> to

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
and more to see how it works I want to

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.430 
and more to see how it works I want to
try<00:05:38.500> Kaiser<00:05:38.830> but<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.520> problem<00:05:39.879> is<00:05:39.969> that<00:05:43.440> you

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
try Kaiser but the problem is that you

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.110 
try Kaiser but the problem is that you
know<00:05:44.589> your<00:05:44.770> opponent<00:05:44.919> has<00:05:45.099> to<00:05:45.310> be<00:05:45.430> at<00:05:45.550> grade<00:05:45.789> 2

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
know your opponent has to be at grade 2

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.480 
know your opponent has to be at grade 2
or<00:05:46.569> grade<00:05:47.050> 3<00:05:47.289> in<00:05:47.409> already<00:05:47.650> uses<00:05:47.919> effect<00:05:48.310> so

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
or grade 3 in already uses effect so

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.040 
or grade 3 in already uses effect so
it's<00:05:48.610> like<00:05:48.759> I<00:05:48.909> would<00:05:49.449> rather<00:05:49.569> what<00:05:49.810> she<00:05:49.839> was

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
it's like I would rather what she was

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.140 
it's like I would rather what she was
that<00:05:50.199> great<00:05:50.349> too<00:05:50.589> but<00:05:50.860> overall<00:05:51.759> the<00:05:51.969> techs

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
that great too but overall the techs

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.209 
that great too but overall the techs
really<00:05:52.449> fun<00:05:52.659> it's<00:05:52.960> easy<00:05:53.319> to<00:05:53.589> pick<00:05:53.740> up<00:05:53.830> and<00:05:53.979> play

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
really fun it's easy to pick up and play
