00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
three things there are most of them are

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.640 
three things there are most of them are
in<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.210> body<00:00:41.420> there<00:00:42.020> are<00:00:42.230> a<00:00:42.260> big<00:00:42.620> component<00:00:43.490> of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
in the body there are a big component of

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650 
in the body there are a big component of
disagreement<00:00:45.650> number<00:00:46.250> one<00:00:46.460> food<00:00:46.790> food

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
disagreement number one food food

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.140 
disagreement number one food food
creates<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.230> lot<00:00:48.380> excitement<00:00:49.010> food<00:00:49.580> creates<00:00:49.970> a

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
creates a lot excitement food creates a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.180 
creates a lot excitement food creates a
lot<00:00:50.330> of<00:00:50.360> curiosity<00:00:51.730> food<00:00:52.730> creates<00:00:53.240> a<00:00:54.190> primal

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
lot of curiosity food creates a primal

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.640 
lot of curiosity food creates a primal
dominant<00:00:55.910> behavior<00:00:56.530> territorial<00:00:57.530> behavior

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
dominant behavior territorial behavior

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.310 
dominant behavior territorial behavior
so<00:00:58.280> that's<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:58.640> food<00:00:58.930> now<00:00:59.930> let's<00:01:00.170> talk<00:01:00.260> about

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
so that's just food now let's talk about

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.220 
so that's just food now let's talk about
the<00:01:00.650> component<00:01:01.160> of<00:01:01.280> human<00:01:01.850> human<00:01:02.630> in<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.840> party

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
the component of human human in a party

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.079 
the component of human human in a party
in<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.380> barbecue<00:01:03.829> gets<00:01:04.009> exciting<00:01:04.699> he's<00:01:04.789> getting

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
in a barbecue gets exciting he's getting

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.940 
in a barbecue gets exciting he's getting
together<00:01:05.329> with<00:01:05.719> somebody<00:01:05.929> else<00:01:06.319> and<00:01:06.740> and

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
together with somebody else and and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.069 
together with somebody else and and
sometimes<00:01:07.939> they<00:01:08.149> don't<00:01:08.270> like<00:01:08.479> certain<00:01:08.689> people

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
sometimes they don't like certain people

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:10.870 
sometimes they don't like certain people
in<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.350> party<00:01:09.679> so<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:10.399> a<00:01:10.429> component

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
in the party so that is a component

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.090 
in the party so that is a component
because<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.569> dogs<00:01:11.810> will<00:01:12.020> feel<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.890> energy

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
because the dogs will feel that energy

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.300 
because the dogs will feel that energy
and<00:01:13.520> then<00:01:13.939> it's<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.210> component<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:15.310> alcohol

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
and then it's the component of alcohol

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.270 
and then it's the component of alcohol
so<00:01:17.299> some<00:01:18.049> people<00:01:18.229> get<00:01:18.560> aggressive<00:01:19.130> with

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
so some people get aggressive with

so some people get aggressive with
alcohol<00:01:19.789> some<00:01:20.389> people<00:01:20.689> get<00:01:20.869> really<00:01:21.639> mellow

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:22.639 
alcohol some people get really mellow

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:24.999 
alcohol some people get really mellow
lay<00:01:23.179> back<00:01:23.389> with<00:01:23.450> with<00:01:24.079> alcohol<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:24.619> it<00:01:24.859> go
