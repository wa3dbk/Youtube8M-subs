so<00:00:02.190> now<00:00:03.049> while<00:00:04.049> my<00:00:04.250> the<00:00:05.250> transmission<00:00:05.910> cover

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
so now while my the transmission cover

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.009 
so now while my the transmission cover
is<00:00:06.509> off<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.560> will<00:00:08.490> take<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.059> opportunity<00:00:09.570> to

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
is off I will take this opportunity to

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.200 
is off I will take this opportunity to
show<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.059> how<00:00:13.009> variable<00:00:14.210> constantly

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
show you how variable constantly

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.060 
show you how variable constantly
variable<00:00:15.690> transmission<00:00:15.859> or<00:00:16.859> called<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.670> CVT<00:00:19.070> is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
variable transmission or called a CVT is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.349 
variable transmission or called a CVT is
working<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.029> i<00:00:21.900> will<00:00:22.230> run<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.920> engine<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:24.119> show

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
working so i will run the engine to show

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.769 
working so i will run the engine to show
you<00:00:24.420> how<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.990> works<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:26.250> see<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> belt<00:00:27.480> is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
you how it works so now see the belt is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.319 
you how it works so now see the belt is
already<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.859> little<00:00:29.369> loose<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.619> it<00:00:31.619> will

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
already a little loose but it will

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.440 
already a little loose but it will
tighten<00:00:33.329> by<00:00:33.750> itself<00:00:34.399> if<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.640> when<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> run<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
tighten by itself if I when I run the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.619 
tighten by itself if I when I run the
engine<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.460> dis<00:00:38.460> dis<00:00:39.120> front<00:00:39.420> pulley

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
engine this is the dis dis front pulley

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.400 
engine this is the dis dis front pulley
is<00:00:39.930> directly<00:00:40.500> connected<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
is directly connected to to the the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.639 
is directly connected to to the the
engine<00:00:43.980> crankshaft<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.440> motion<00:00:46.440> is

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
engine crankshaft and the motion is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.360 
engine crankshaft and the motion is
driven<00:00:46.920> tah<00:00:47.629> with<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> belt<00:00:48.989> cowards<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
driven tah with the belt cowards the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.740 
driven tah with the belt cowards the
real<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.750> rear<00:00:51.989> poly<00:00:52.850> very<00:00:53.850> poorly<00:00:54.239> where<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
real the rear poly very poorly where the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.500 
real the rear poly very poorly where the
clutch<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.719> anyway<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:58.800> movie<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.879> worth<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
clutch is and anyway a movie is worth a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.979 
clutch is and anyway a movie is worth a
thousand<00:01:01.170> words<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.879> show<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> right

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
thousand words so i will show you right

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.649 
thousand words so i will show you right
there

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.039 

I<00:01:09.280> don't<00:01:10.280> know<00:01:10.399> if<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:10.729> can<00:01:10.999> hear<00:01:11.359> me<00:01:11.420> properly

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
I don't know if you can hear me properly

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.860 
I don't know if you can hear me properly
but<00:01:12.530> now<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:12.829> can<00:01:13.310> see<00:01:13.789> that

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
but now you can see that

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.800 
but now you can see that
we<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.710> fully<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:17.670> here

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
we are fully right here

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.999 
we are fully right here
when<00:01:20.110> it's<00:01:20.350> on<00:01:20.680> an<00:01:20.860> idle<00:01:21.310> speed<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.439> belt<00:01:23.950> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
when it's on an idle speed the belt is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.109 
when it's on an idle speed the belt is
narrower<00:01:27.009> here<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.329> is<00:01:28.899> larger<00:01:29.799> here<00:01:30.100> but<00:01:30.909> now

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
narrower here and is larger here but now

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.600 
narrower here and is larger here but now
check<00:01:31.630> out<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.979> I<00:01:33.250> increase<00:01:34.180> with<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:35.079> truffle

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
check out as I increase with the truffle

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:59.639 
check out as I increase with the truffle
check<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.659> belt<00:01:37.929> moving

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.420 

so<00:02:00.649> I<00:02:00.680> don't<00:02:01.039> know<00:02:01.460> if<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.969> solve<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.930> properly

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
so I don't know if you solve it properly

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:11.910 
so I don't know if you solve it properly
but<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:05.689> rapture<00:02:07.030> changed<00:02:09.940> at<00:02:10.940> idle<00:02:11.510> speed

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
but the rapture changed at idle speed

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.880 
but the rapture changed at idle speed
the<00:02:12.920> rap<00:02:13.160> show<00:02:13.400> here<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.849> smaller<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:15.560> is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the rap show here is smaller and this is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.270 
the rap show here is smaller and this is
bigger<00:02:16.430> but<00:02:16.760> higher<00:02:17.269> speed<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.620> rash<00:02:18.830> O'Hara

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
bigger but higher speed the rash O'Hara

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.589 
bigger but higher speed the rash O'Hara
is<00:02:19.459> bigger<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.120> here<00:02:20.480> it's<00:02:20.750> smaller<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.530> hope

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
is bigger and here it's smaller I hope

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.870 
is bigger and here it's smaller I hope
this<00:02:24.310> demonstration<00:02:25.310> was<00:02:25.790> clear<00:02:26.540> enough
