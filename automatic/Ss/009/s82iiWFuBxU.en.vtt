00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.090
 the one that farts bands like being here 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.570
 speak in itself but 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.110
 and well, today I am going to comment on 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.840
 how to fix the two suites of your galaxy 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.850
 or from your android rather because some 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.890
 sometimes it shows an error in what 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.830
 if you want to eliminate one of these 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.340
 folders one of these pages obviously 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.340
 it will not be possible 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.450
 for the same system error then 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.350
 the way to solve it is from the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.700
 next way then we're going to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.380
 here the applications to the configuration 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.520
 and we are going to 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.000
 application manager here is 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.360
 can see 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.590
 is then we give him manager 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.590
 applications we hope 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.079
 let's go to what is called 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.670
 all to this tab 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.310
 okay 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.950
 and we look 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.079
 the 2 wheat that in this case would be start 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.079
 touchwiz then let's look for it 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.010
 a pretty heavy variety 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.300
 of files we are already getting to see 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.650
 here is the ix initiated twist 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.690
 there you can see then we select 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.800
 and here it's going to look like these 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:39.220
 way that's how it's going to look ok 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.050
 then so that he all louis what 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.320
 let's put back as it was 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.510
 previously without the problem of error 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.640
 we simply show 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.590
 notifications we disable it 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.150
 let's accept we give to what 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.380
 delete data 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.740
 let's accept and force closure 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.490
 and ready now simply a matter of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.490
 go out 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.900
 It will stop a few seconds the course 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.410
 can see it's already standing it's going to 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.970
 restart the torch guys this is so that 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.860
 the error comes out 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.860
 and he says to me like he's 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.490
 newly 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.950
 started the android system what 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.950
 does this mean that once 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.239
 the system I accept is simply 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.439
 restarted the tows system and everything is 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.170
 as it was at the beginning of the of 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:48.860
 buy your cell phone 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.930
 and well, here we can eliminate 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.000
 all the data 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.310
 all the lashes that we want without 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.299
 no problem that we are going to accept and it is 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.299
 I eliminate again 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.540
 we are going to accept and I already said it was deleted 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.980
 and how can you see in less than two 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.440
 minutes we were able to compose what 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.470
 it would be the touch is of your android system 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.850
 in this case for my samsung galaxy 12 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.950
 I hope you liked that you give them 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.940
 little hand up to share it 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.580
 see you in the next tutor 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.740
 thank you very much come back later and 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.740
