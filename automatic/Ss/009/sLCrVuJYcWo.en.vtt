00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and Lego definitely won the extra mile

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.400 
and Lego definitely won the extra mile
into<00:00:18.060> making<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.480> game<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> lot<00:00:18.990> more<00:00:19.170> fun

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
into making this game a lot more fun

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.330 
into making this game a lot more fun
because<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.970> added<00:00:21.359> ability<00:00:22.050> cart<00:00:22.350> which<00:00:23.250> i

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
because they added ability cart which i

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
because they added ability cart which i
thought<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.869> extremely<00:00:24.869> unique<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410

definitely something that Lego has never

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.890 
definitely something that Lego has never
done<00:00:28.080> before<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.060> would<00:00:30.869> definitely
