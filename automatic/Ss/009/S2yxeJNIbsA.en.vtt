00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.510
 good first welcome thank you very much 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.430
 these sensations first and very good 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.259
 The truth is that the reception has been very 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.930
 good on the part of all the companions 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.720
 of the coaching staff and good I feel 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.359
 quite happy to be here at last 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 and working hard to start well 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.560
 the season 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.930
 yes yes I was already waiting a bit to 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.930
 something that the two clubs closed a little 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.470
 the agreement and if you want to join the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.280
 group and start working on everything 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:47.129
 because I think it's a club with a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.670
 philosophy of play that I can 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.830
 come very well and that attracts me quite 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.140
 from the point of view of seeing it and everything 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.620
 that has always followed a lot of lightning and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.870
 I think it's a nice club where 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.870
 will take the first step 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.020
 if you demand a lot as you say but 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 but well I think that's nice 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.960
 also and although it is risky as 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.300
 how the game coach plays me 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.640
 like and that's why I've also 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.490
 decided to come to this group yes yes the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.050
 admission from the first day because the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.050
 technical body the baÃ±eros the 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.390
 transmit and and well that's something I 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.890
 I consider it very important always 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 transmission in football and as he says 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.350
 always always going out to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.400
 win complicated left home good to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.850
 final it has been still 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.940
 from one club to another nearby in the same 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.550
 city and good even if it's another club 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.890
 I have been from Madrid since I was 8 years old but 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.020
 but I think it was time to give the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.270
 jump and what better way to do it than 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.190
 the ray if I knew her here 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.340
 when this turns out to be castilla and 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.050
 well it's always good to give you 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.240
 a little adaptation so very well and 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.070
 good about all work I think that with 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.380
 Work can get better or worse 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.140
 things but but without working like that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.930
 you are constant in the end people see it and 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.230
 I believe that is what people want 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.870
 see that the team regardless of 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.340
 that wins or loses then the fight and that 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.340
 leave everything until the end
