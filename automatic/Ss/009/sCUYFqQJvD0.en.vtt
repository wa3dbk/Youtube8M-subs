pliers<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:59.079> just<00:03:00.120> grip<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.390> loop<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:02.380> my

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
pliers and just grip the loop with my

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.300 
pliers and just grip the loop with my
flat<00:03:02.799> nose<00:03:03.010> pliers<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.739> I'm<00:03:05.860> going<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.040> push

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
flat nose pliers and I'm going to push

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.780 
flat nose pliers and I'm going to push
the<00:03:06.780> remaining<00:03:07.780> four<00:03:08.079> inches<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.530> wire<00:03:08.790> around

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
the remaining four inches of wire around

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.150 
the remaining four inches of wire around
that<00:03:10.329> loop<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.440> create<00:03:11.859> a<00:03:11.890> coil<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
that loop so that I create a coil and

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.099 
that loop so that I create a coil and
the<00:03:18.250> wire<00:03:18.760> might<00:03:19.060> slide<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:19.959> use<00:03:20.079> your

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
the wire might slide you just use your

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.160 
the wire might slide you just use your
thumb<00:03:21.000> your<00:03:22.000> front<00:03:22.269> finger<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.900> want<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.109> be

it's<00:03:27.790> going<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.030> slip<00:03:28.359> just<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.720> little<00:03:28.930> at

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
it's going to slip just a little at

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.710 
it's going to slip just a little at
