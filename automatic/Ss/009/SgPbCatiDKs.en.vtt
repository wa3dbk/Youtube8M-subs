00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
in my opinion if you are gonna make cuts

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.770

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.580 
better your result so what I do a lot of
tax<00:03:44.340> nervous<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.880> now<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.600> short<00:03:46.020> incision

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
tax nervous do now is a short incision

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.300 
tax nervous do now is a short incision
and<00:03:47.630> it<00:03:48.630> allows<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.200> get<00:03:49.950> enough

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
and it allows you to get enough

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.210 
and it allows you to get enough
clearance<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.820> get<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.530> cape<00:03:52.530> over<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.010> neck

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
clearance to get the cape over the neck

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.550 
clearance to get the cape over the neck
and<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.520> skull<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.090> do<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.140> rest<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.470> your

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
cut if you're if you're so inclined to

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.560 
cut if you're if you're so inclined to
actually<00:04:01.230> keep<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.800> fit<00:04:02.610> you<00:04:02.730> know<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.000> skin

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
actually keep the fit you know the skin

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.949 
actually keep the fit you know the skin
off<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.930> face<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:05.040> skull<00:04:05.370> is<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:06.300> Y

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
off the face and the skull is a Y

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.650 
off the face and the skull is a Y
incision<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:08.910> don't<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:09.480> one

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
incision and and I don't like that one

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.590 
incision and and I don't like that one
either<00:04:09.810> because<00:04:10.590> it's<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:11.940> harder<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:12.390> get

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
either because it's it's harder to get

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.180 
either because it's it's harder to get
to<00:04:12.810> as<00:04:13.050> a<00:04:13.110> taxidermist

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
to as a taxidermist

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.699 
to as a taxidermist
you've<00:04:14.640> got<00:04:14.820> more<00:04:15.090> sewing<00:04:15.480> with<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> Y<00:04:16.200> incision

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
you've got more sewing with a Y incision

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.490 
you've got more sewing with a Y incision
because<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.730> angle<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.330> antlers<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.380> know

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
because the angle on antlers you know

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.420 
because the angle on antlers you know
they

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
they

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.360 
they
slant<00:04:20.820> back<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.650> there's<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.740> sharp<00:04:23.100> angle

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
slant back and there's a sharp angle

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.120 
slant back and there's a sharp angle
between<00:04:23.759> the<00:04:24.360> skull<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.650> base<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:26.100> that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
between the skull and the base of that

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.580 
between the skull and the base of that
pedicle<00:04:26.789> so<00:04:27.509> it's<00:04:27.900> harder<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.410> get<00:04:28.560> your

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
pedicle so it's harder to get your

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.010 
pedicle so it's harder to get your
sewing<00:04:28.979> done<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.639> you<00:04:30.090> got<00:04:30.270> more<00:04:30.479> sewing<00:04:30.930> to

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
sewing done and you got more sewing to

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.740 
sewing done and you got more sewing to
do<00:04:31.229> so<00:04:32.039> you<00:04:32.100> tend<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.669> take<00:04:32.850> bigger<00:04:33.120> stitches

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
do so you tend to take bigger stitches

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.140 
do so you tend to take bigger stitches
just<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.410> get<00:04:34.620> through<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.250> it's<00:04:35.850> harder

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
just to get through it and it's harder

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.629 
just to get through it and it's harder
to<00:04:36.300> hide<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:36.750> incision<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.919> what<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.160> will<00:04:38.460> do

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
to hide that incision so what I will do

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.499 
to hide that incision so what I will do
is<00:04:39.000> I'll<00:04:39.449> do<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.690> short<00:04:40.229> T<00:04:40.560> incision<00:04:41.220> from<00:04:41.970> the

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
is I'll do a short T incision from the

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.900 
is I'll do a short T incision from the
middle<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.259> pedicles<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.669> just

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
middle of the pedicles and I just

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.770 
middle of the pedicles and I just
connect<00:04:45.300> those<00:04:45.509> okay<00:04:46.370> so<00:04:47.370> now<00:04:47.789> you've<00:04:48.030> got<00:04:48.240> and

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
connect those okay so now you've got and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.480 
connect those okay so now you've got and
this<00:04:48.900> is<00:04:49.110> kind<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.500> exaggerated<00:04:50.190> on<00:04:50.280> this

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
this is kind of exaggerated on this

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.370 
this is kind of exaggerated on this
dough<00:04:50.699> because<00:04:51.210> if<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:51.509> have<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.660> big<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.289> know

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
dough because if you have a big you know

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.310 
dough because if you have a big you know
big<00:04:52.650> set<00:04:52.919> of<00:04:53.009> bases<00:04:53.460> on<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.639> buck<00:04:53.940> your<00:04:54.810> incision

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
big set of bases on a buck your incision

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.020 
big set of bases on a buck your incision
is<00:04:55.380> probably<00:04:55.680> only<00:04:55.830> going<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.220> be<00:04:56.370> about<00:04:56.460> two

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
is probably only going to be about two

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.469 
is probably only going to be about two
inches<00:04:57.060> maybe<00:04:57.750> two<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.349> half<00:04:59.150> so<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.210> make

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
inches maybe two and a half so you make

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.150 
inches maybe two and a half so you make
an<00:05:00.630> incision<00:05:00.750> right<00:05:01.110> between<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.800> antlers

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
an incision right between the antlers

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.140 
an incision right between the antlers
and<00:05:02.430> then<00:05:03.060> connect<00:05:03.509> that<00:05:03.599> one<00:05:04.070> with<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.150> short

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
and then connect that one with a short

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.420 
and then connect that one with a short
incision<00:05:06.770> depending<00:05:07.770> on<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:07.949> size<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.340> the

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
incision depending on the size of the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.370 
incision depending on the size of the
