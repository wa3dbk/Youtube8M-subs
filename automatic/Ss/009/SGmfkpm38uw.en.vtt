00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.009
 my dear, your friends, welcome to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.759
 another video from yours from my 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.990
 time to 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.180
 in today 's video I'm going to give 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740
 follow the ranch guide to the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.810
 the page I 'm doing 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.240
 if you did not see the first episode going 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 naked I'll leave nobody in the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 for you can follow and today I go 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.019
 speak a topic very much 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.829
 important are the supplies to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.910
 prashanth are the basic supplies that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.809
 you have to keep in mind that a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.850
 paladin will use in a hut is pot of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.280
 mano and ammunition 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.719
 even though the minister considers both 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.410
 so come back is arrow or even 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.930
 expired so it 's all in the same package 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.969
 good to start the first thing you have 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.820
 what to think about how much hunting you will go 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.799
 there new you must always look for the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.939
 kef equilibrium that the equilibrium of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.470
 between cargo and ammunition 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:15.299
 the you have a useful team nexxera quepe 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.860
 total of your character 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:27.630
 - use the break of essential items that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:29.970
 It's armor bp passes things in general is 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 A cap today is interesting to leave 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:40.560
 it is always 200 to 300 200 to 300 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.540
 oz of space left for you is power 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 vote useful because how much in 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.310
 will tired you will spend az and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.880
 some change so you need to have 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 one leaving a seat margin of 200 to 300 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.000
 you have no problem who when I 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.250
 I say find the balance I want to say 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.469
 at the same time as its mission 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.140
 end 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.940
 You'll get a little pot but you can not. 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.250
 can never end 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.860
 because this is somewhat dangerous 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.380
 in a hut you are without size in the middle of the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.720
 case is somewhat dangerous you have 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.960
 to find a balance that I do not know 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.990
 over 20 for you can get out of here 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.190
 running for example and effective without 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.550
 ammunition 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.660
 well it 's more so it was not a mean thing 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.280
 obvious right have to find the balance 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.160
 So how do you think this 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.800
 Balance is for me to speak the truth, I 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.120
 I already tried to make an equation then 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.270
 Who does not know I do college? 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.710
 engineering and then the first period is 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.270
 I tried to make an equation that only 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.980
 is an equation of two variables that I 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.990
 I'll give it next week so I moved and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.340
 to find out how, from this equation, I 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.830
 I came here to bring you but for 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.250
 while it has to be in the chutometer 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.000
 but who just talks kicked and will start with 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.190
 which will always start with pot in 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.380
 over you you do not know the balance 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.040
 sure but you know how much more it contains 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.580
 any less 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.400
 then just get little pot always access 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.380
 because you had better go without 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.730
 ammunition than the week in the middle of here 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.830
 because without ammunition 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.470
 you still have a year to be able to give a 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.940
 tom out of big heart xuxa error 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.730
 and defending themselves on the hills of the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.080
 Yes, if you stay the week, face the chance. 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.209
 you die very big so you go 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.660
 Are you going to see how much 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.820
 Jorge, you can transfer mana 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.209
 promise until you arrive at the ideal 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.850
 ideal is that you always end up with 11 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.840
 As I already said 20 pots and none 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.940
 punishment 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.640
 this would be the best use of 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.140
 time and that you can have a ranking 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.959
 something else that you must also take into account 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.650
 mind is that there is a weight is palladino 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.200
 a very important thing because he 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.900
 can not carry so much weight against 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.320
 How much a corner and he has to take 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.300
 A lot of things to understand. 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.560
 a very good tip you always look for 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.400
 use the softbus life and ran away during the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.570
 night because you go beyond 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.320
 you will save money because the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:30.590
 soft boot price in four hours 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.800
 compensates where you are using positions 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.090
 Back to the top 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.460
 to run away 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.699
 so whenever you get it like that 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.850
 you have condition of that have softbus 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.770
 life in and food for you in your good hut 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.699
 It's another thing that you need too. 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.210
 always carry an emergency kit let's 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.039
 to say so is that you will include in the 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.130
 account of its essential items is 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.199
 indispensable that you deduce from your 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.800
 capital to give relief that is cap 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.530
 last is this emergency essentials 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.539
 to me it's like this is one more weapon 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.740
 strong of what you use for example you 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.960
 will marry power boat takes but is 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.330
 not many other fans are hunting with the 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.039
 only with normal goals so if you do not have 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.820
 money does not have light to use your 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.470
 tasks XanxerÃª expired just a spy 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.410
 thing for when your mission 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.330
 end you do not get in the shit so only 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.510
 colatto so there's nothing to hit the 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.710
 bishan treated me here I died 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.159
 have to have something to be able to 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.070
 run away something else you have is you have to 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:44.720
 try to have a sense of life or when 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.000
 they spoke louder and the chan type they are 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.650
 also important in case of emergency 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.060
 well I think it's more or less what 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.810
 I wanted to pass it on to you in the 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.630
 today 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.130
 so summarize when you go by 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.580
 first time you start up you have to 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:01.099
 always strive for balance is because 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.470
 the balance that goes will give you the breast 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:06.889
 largest chip per hour and longer than 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.699
 you'll be able to stay in the file you have 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:13.430
 that optimizing this function is then you 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.070
 will always start with your situation 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.080
 I was getting the excess powder said you 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.960
 Adjust this until you get this 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.909
 balance you want you will 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.919
 take a little later or when you 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.870
 get used to more with backup and such 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.289
 You're going to get better, go weighing 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.330
 it's too strong 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.819
 adjusting 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:39.529
 and those other tips I gave 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:41.059
 emergency items and your 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.199
 team the uncle you have to take in 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:45.050
 mind that you have to always leave a 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.669
 space to catch the good luch 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.969
 so this is it people I hope you have 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:52.129
 It helped you guys the next video. 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.959
 I want to talk about the weapons of 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:58.309
 paladin crossbow and shotguns and 

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:00.649
