video I compared it to another pudding
that<00:00:18.600> um<00:00:18.869> or<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.640> cells<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.779> think<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
that um or as cells and I can I think I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.779 
that um or as cells and I can I think I
believe<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.830> said<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.640> one

better<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.619> think<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> reason<00:00:26.609> being<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
better and I think the reason being is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.810 
better and I think the reason being is
because<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.320> cooler<00:00:28.710> temperature<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
