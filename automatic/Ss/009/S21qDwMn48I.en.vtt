00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
squirrely it's a lot faster towing that

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.420 
squirrely it's a lot faster towing that
you<00:02:23.020> want<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.230> do<00:02:23.320> on<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.470> street<00:02:23.770> but<00:02:23.800> it's<00:02:24.340> a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
pretty good test here of what these

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.060 
pretty good test here of what these
structures<00:02:26.110> can<00:02:26.350> really<00:02:26.590> do<00:02:26.770> when<00:02:26.980> they're

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
structures can really do when they're

00:02:27.070 --> 00:03:18.730 
structures can really do when they're
hooked<00:02:27.220> up<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.520> trailer

you no points for trying versus you know

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.720 
you no points for trying versus you know
if<00:03:33.960> it<00:03:34.140> doesn't<00:03:34.440> make<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.740> then<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.370> know<00:03:35.490> 30
