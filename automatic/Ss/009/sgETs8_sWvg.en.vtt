00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hi everyone, today I wanted to do this 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.870
 video that will be very fast to make you 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.610
 see what i bought from ubs is 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.219
 finally arrived the new collection 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 essence which is called hartley color 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.230
 it seems this one is color art 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 practically to this new collection 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 who has a little bag inside of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.699
 pigments that I really like 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.619
 I'm crazy about these pigments 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.570
 they cost very little because they cost 2 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.460
 euro and 99 vol 1 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 the biggest version and now I want 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.329
 show you what I purchased not 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.910
 I took all of them, but I still have 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.399
 I took a matter of things that I care about 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.640
 much to let you see then before 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.680
 all taken precisely this brush which 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.050
 it's done so you see text 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.239
 fast rho out so maybe you can 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.829
 see him better by the way I don't know if 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 you have seen but I am recording among the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.070
 sunflowers later maybe I'll take them back 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.930
 because they are too beautiful are mine 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 in fact, favorite flowers on the foot once 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.260
 sunflowers sunflowers 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.210
 closed this parenthesis then the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.770
 brush is made so practically a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.810
 a soft latex brush 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.119
 I really have no idea everything can 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.710
 serve but I had to take it because 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.170
 I want to experience try to see 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.299
 actually that I use part me 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.039
 because it is not 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.509
 I don't know I never have to surprise linen 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.020
 done in this way actually it is 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.569
 simply a piece of plastic placed 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.039
 there on a brush then this collection 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.899
 practically away from the base for the eyes 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.000
 that the base for the lips than the base 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.459
 for the enamel then the same one 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.829
 collection you can create those 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:43.009
 establishments you can create both the enamel 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.140
 that the lipstick that the eyes phase 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.310
 let's say and pigments for the eyes I have 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 taken only the eye base is the base 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.120
 for the enamel because to that for the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.990
 lips honestly no 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.000
 I didn't like a gloss for a long time 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.190
 transparent therefore usable 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.630
 quietly in another way than sense 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.210
 any gloss can be used 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.190
 transparent and therefore seemed useless to me 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.200
 go and spend to buy that 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.240
 instead I wanted to try the eye base 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.810
 which I did this way you see in 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.740
 this little bottle and the applicator 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.060
 done so I hope you can see 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.910
 and in any case it comes out in this way white ve 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.910
 I also show it blossomed 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.940
 practically remains a creamy sauce 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.220
 much is absolutely transparent and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.750
 it remains a sort of sticky creamy sauce 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.000
 now of course I still have to use them 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.070
 because I bought I arrived home 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.440
 I made the video for you to share 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.540
 immediately with you my purchases and then 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.640
 slowly maybe I'll try again and I'll do it 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.740
 then know what I think 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.540
 Now maybe with his ciamo 1 on 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.450
 a thousand I bought because open them 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.100
 all are backhand social and then pian 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.670
 plan maybe I will do a more review 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.180
 in-depth or tutorials with these 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.989
 products 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.760
 instead this is also the basis for nails 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.660
 perhaps quite useless reality is a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.070
 easy 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.180
 this remains very very sticky 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.430
 freedom practically has to do from 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.430
 glue for pigments I actually 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.020
 account to use the fix plus 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.120
 however, I may try a 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.390
 see also how to do this 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.459
 mind a very little thing there instead 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.920
 nail base is practically a 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.159
 very simple transparent enamel that 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.930
 says distribute some pigment on the 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:38.930
 paper and then punish them with a small brush e 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.760
 then paint the nails of that 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.129
 I don't know everyone actually did the 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.079
 case of buying it but it is now heaven and 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.920
 so I will think the first thing that 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.750
 I will try to do a manicure with 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.120
 this with the use of this glaze 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.950
 the pigments are eco these are the three 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.340
 basic things that I bought then the 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.910
 this is the eye base brush here 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.220
 that instead the nails peace or practically 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.040
 the package the size of the pigments is 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.170
 this one here and it's really small 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.040
 Now I do not know how to let you see tone 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.359
 from 2.3 mg so I really am 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.370
 small ones you can actually take 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.139
 even those even smaller than that 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.019
 they look like lipsticks 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.270
 big invitations but I preferred these 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.270
 because I know that I still use pigments 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.789
 particularly and often and so I have 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.560
 preferred to try them directly so you 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.360
 I say which ones I took this is the color 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.050
 in trim that I preferred immediately from the 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.770
 fused the number 12 this here I think 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.630
 see you see but you will never see it 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.650
 however trust me at number 12 then ho 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.090
 got this here which is the number 0 9 b 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.360
 rai 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.450
 described so I can see you is the 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.270
 number 09 and is practically a one 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.950
 species of white cream golden that to me 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.930
 really like paired with tricks 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.550
 made with the golden mac pigment that of 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.530
 here of course right now 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.810
 escapes the name or cultured alt should 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.850
 however, I immediately noticed him 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.900
 I had already spotted him when I was 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.970
 I was looking at the previews of the new one 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.920
 collection directly on the site e 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.360
 in fact then seeing him live he has me 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.850
 still more convinced why it is 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.850
 really very nice i try to do it for you 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.820
 see taken this blue that you are the 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.100
 number 18 and it's called little mermaid ve 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.750
 I write them because I will be also 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.940
 English but to pronounce it is a mess 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.060
 I hope you can read it and it is 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.540
 practically a very bright blue of its own 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.030
 a beautiful electric blue turquoise is 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.290
 still however these were therefore 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.900
 colors you know they are my favorites 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.610
 during the summer and also this falls 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.610
 in those I will surely use 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.370
 lots of other fluo pigments and a 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:59.320
 This orange here is the white 0 6 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:02.830
 orange mind this here is a lot 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.070
 similar to another pigment mac 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.140
 I had neither samples, however, since that 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.440
 pigment mac hadn't occupied me for 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.910
 I am curious to see how 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.220
 know how this will be here thanks 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.950
 really good are two euros and 90 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.240
 91 and therefore if indeed it is true that 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.240
 are 2.3 mg 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.400
 this because he told me 1.2 grams 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:32.780
 girls 1,4 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.780
 the grammy are the ones I 'm telling myself 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.550
 I'll show you the difference maybe it is 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.050
 better than I invite you to say great I go 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.400
 in this regard he resisted anyway 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.530
 product does not know little 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.510
 in the sense that you are writing as 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.940
 pigments are usually supposed to 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.800
 last really long so I got it 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.610
 still this time is not it is much more 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.720
 to finish I still got this that is 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:01.890
 14 straw verismo said so it is 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.710
 it is practically a pink color again 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.420
 old rose more than anything else here 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.070
 and I really like the color between 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.600
 the other is very much cimmerian in 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.300
 camera will not be seen however it really is 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.820
 so much shimmer and is therefore to those types of 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.980
 colors that I love so much and me 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.720
 really really like to use them 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.520
 I like a lot on my skin either 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.490
 in summer and winter then 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.890
 absolutely like I saw it sin and 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.070
 the last one to this one here which is 0 

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:33.190
 4 broadway starlet practically to a 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.840
 pigment made only of glitter not 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.940
 I'm looking forward to trying this out here is 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.030
 beautiful second mansi has used a 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.020
 wet that actually under only 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:44.980
 tapped on tricks to give 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:47.920
 precisely the brilliant expert zoe and da 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.140

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.830

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.840
 display some tricks 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.130
 tutorials with these pigments in the meantime 

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.180
 let me know if you have them too 

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.590
