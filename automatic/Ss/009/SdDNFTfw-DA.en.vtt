00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.109
 the elÃ©onore deposit is located under a 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.200
 huge pool of artificial water the 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.509
 opinaca reservoir in addition to this 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.430
 surface water is a large network 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.890
 of underground faults that gives our 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.259
 teams of daunting challenges at the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.210
 drilling the removal of the carotti tube under 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.710
 high water pressure causes very 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.379
 often great dangers 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.140
 pushed by the pressure the tube risk 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.239
 to be ejected the missile in his 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.100
 wake he may then occasioned 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 serious accidents both human and 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.120
 materials 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.280
 sas to these situations we chose 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.280
 to act before an accident occurs 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.690
 International Surgery work 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.489
 is to give us samples 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 in the form of drill core which is 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.660
 the basis of the whole process of a mine 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.490
 the most important element 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.590
 the geologist is the drill core 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.620
 the elonore deposit is first of all 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.240
 under the tank opinaca the tank 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.790
 opinaca it is not a natural lake 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.130
 it's an artificial lake so it does not have any 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.470
 sediment deposits in the bottom like 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.420
 a normal lake to have which makes that 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.490
 existing fracture network communicates 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.410
 directly with the lake bottom and the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.330
 nature does not like emptiness so we are 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.140
 in a gallery we follow it or there is a 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.200
 huge pressure 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.690
 we just broke a wall is so 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.070
 we want to go out and the most 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.020
 quick to get out it's the hole of 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.150
 drilling how many times the amount of 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.979
 we hope it's a big one 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.229
 problematic to do I know enough 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.630
 dangerous in terms of health safety of 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.850
 result kind of situation for but 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.520
 already the bench the big challenge it's 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.350
 definitely the water hit evento 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.490
 who was extremely strong 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.900
 it was dangerous for all 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.360
 workers who did not know too 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.000
 been ejected two tube injections that's 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.130
 when we intercept a vein of water that 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.680
 a blow that we burned that we have a strong 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.330
 another a carrot the 2 3 m is when 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.970
 we come to go find the tube 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.080
 carotid and inside the vein of water 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.970
 does the work for us at 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.980
 literally pushes out 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.080
 rhodes the killer carotti the first 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.150
 tube injections that had not 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.280
 necessarily a cry of accidents at 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.660
 level of workers but we knew 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.340
 that the situation could become very 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.220
 risky in the future when I pulled out 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.310
 the tubes were gone in contest 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.600
 to 2 then that's the ca the rebound to the bac 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.370
 then sato bathurst not really 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.530
 we did not have to see her that 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.510
 head we could not accept nor tolerate 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.110
 that these people are at risk at every 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.610
 time it actually happened this 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.460
 that it's really this tip the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.890
 Convoy at the beginning winner ejection is 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.050
 what is coming very high speed 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.880
 in the hole when we were confronted with 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.530
 that's where we saw I think the strength 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.030
 of the team that is in place on these 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.450
 always be the same dream team and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.480
 clegg climbed hall health health security 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.660
 private just to 0 make a small 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.330
 to prevent the election all one does not 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.440
 did not work we applied the 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.120
 people feel involved 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.650
 when people walk behind you that 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.120
 the direction as much the direction of the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.460
 logical chain is big safe and that at 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.380
 this moment in the water it's easier for 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.090
 attack them find solutions to 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.040
 four months a very very healthy idea has 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.520
 been found that allows to have the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.340
 operations these outputs the bricks tu 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.040
 really belong to the methods each 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.990
 dribble is obliged to have sheltered then to 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.620
 more about these options where to 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.320
 to use it 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.120
 so at that moment it's fixed at 36 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.520
 street hand to the last part at the end 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.750
 then we proceed to the recovery and 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.890
 that's when she would do 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.920
 return to work 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.180
 here we see an adjustment is that 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.490
 inside just what my 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.440
 choice that locks the tube 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.810
 the two pieces to make one that is 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.280
 of the skins slow down and control 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.980
 the youngsters are currently struggling 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.480
 force that's going to do it's just 20 years old and 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.280
 miles is born the operator will come 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.830
 help him that he's just going to have a 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.540
 pellet control the output these few 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.550
 minutes of installation more for 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.220
 open up a lot finally a lot 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.620
 time and then injury 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.900
 in bowling since when the man with each 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.660
 times companion a vein of water have the name 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:30.540
 the wound and his voice well it's really 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:33.780
 safer with the view and the 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.660
 bretteur one is eliminated from the ejection of 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.300
 often in cash from eun and we did not 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.480
 had one and one is able to spend 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.400
 22 years before it is impossible to think 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.470
 we can now go with this 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.800
 system what makes it useful 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.480
 we 've gone from 0 to 100% 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.340
 of efficiency in the control of the tube 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.760
 in the background the bridge 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.050
 it's a very simple tool but we 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.750
 achieved results 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.750
 expected at the level of elimination 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.060
 of risk very effectively we put in 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.070
 a joint program with our 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.910
 partners to solve a problem that 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.480
 was really very very complex it's 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.450
 a solution 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.140
 quite simply, I think it's 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.270
 a success 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.850
 the message that it sends what has yet 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.620
 the place for innovation 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.780
 involve workers in the 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.020
 brainstorming process like that can 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.440
 bring the creation of things all 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.590
 simple 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.760
 very small but of great efficiency 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.440
 today what we are looking for is 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.630
 to always go a little higher in 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.020
 health safety or the well-being of our 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.020
 our workers
