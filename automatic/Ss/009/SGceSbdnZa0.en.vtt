00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.110
 or 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.529
 if you have something 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140
 do not 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.390
 well with me 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.800
 you know that I can not also in this be 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.800
 writing and we will see 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.110
 I do not know is that way you're getting almost as 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.110
 childish as if not 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.920
 what do you think if we go when it ends in 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.910
 the class I suppose you can take 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.910
 a few more minutes 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.440
 it's fine it's fine I'll accompany you but 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.440
 as we say perez 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.910
 I think you should not use your 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 skills in school who 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.660
 inhibit appears out of nowhere it would be 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.890
 difficult to try to invite some 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.080
 excuse 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.950
 she is a classmate of the school and 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.250
 one of my greatest friends 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.159
 it is known as the number 3 integra 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.430
 the observers under the code name in 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.380
 shadow 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.630
 his great skills like 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.670
 disappearance and the transfer of objects 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.280
 solids make you excellent 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.280
 and an amazing fighter 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.149
 it's about my expressive friends 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.009
 his face without emotions and the absence of 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.619
 internal voice without looking like a person 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.289
 enigmatic and difficult to deal with 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.910
 others as for me such 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.680
 features are really real 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.569
 agents facing me 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.290
 worries no matter how 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.750
 great be like for example I have not you 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 forgotten homework and that was worth 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.400
 a lot that I'm going to do 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.990
 I say that I live to reassure myself 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.470
 seer 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.840
 and that the exam is in the part of 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.890
 behind the needle there were more questions and 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.890
 I'm sure I will fail 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.370
 creative to reassure me is not either 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.370
 pÃ©rez / green 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.600
 help for some strange reason the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.480
 knife of the other animation has been 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.050
 stuck in the back causing thus a 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.050
 massive hemorrhage 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.440
 do not 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.859
 having 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.939
 post it 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.950
 although she is almost always in kiel 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.049
 entertaining feed your chips and in 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.790
 Sometimes he uses his skills to his 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.189
 convenience 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.159
 well I think it would be better if they split 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:26.040
 the project themes without you think 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.420
 if you take care of the first two topics 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.430
 well, what 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.030
 then you take care of the last 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.030
 topics you 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.030
 d 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.659
