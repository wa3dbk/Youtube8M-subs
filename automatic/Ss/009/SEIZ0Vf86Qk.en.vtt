00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.219
 that the application of homeopathy in 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.870
 plants is something new good if it is 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.020
 relatively new the first 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.530
 experiments were made in 1927 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.170
 then we still do not carry 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.940
 100 years applying homeopathy in 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.640
 plants but of course they have been 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.400
 very many experiments works of 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.430
 expertise with this topic test 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.810
 with this subject serious investigations and 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.480
 so 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.010
 mental openness 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.930
 it means to open our heart 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.060
 our mind 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.600
 and realize that there are new 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.239
 methods the world advances 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.309
 who does not understand that those advances 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.450
 there are good just going to be 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.630
 out then we do 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.030
 that adventure that the farm for me aunt 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.670
 it's an adventure, of course, it 's a 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.740
 adventure because entering into areas of 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.020
 new knowledge is always a 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.620
 adventure is always risky always 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.050
 is to change the paradigms and the first 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.530
 that start then they certainly have a 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.440
 competitive advantage because when this 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.120
 method is generalized well it is 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.450
 there's just going to be a lot that goes 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.630
 to have this way of producing and the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.790
 first that started this practice 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.080
 of course they will have the advantage of 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.060
 have a greater knowledge already have 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.149
 well-off crops 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.280
 the agro- patico crop also has 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.380
 an adaptation time the time of 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.590
 adaptation is between 1 and 3 years 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.729
 depending on the degree of the button 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.670
 depending on the pollution of 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.409
 Soil of the plant type depending on whether 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.720
 are young old plants if they are 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.750
 trees if they are vegetables if they are short 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.170
 cycle or long cycle all that goes to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.679
 determine how fast you will observe 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.019
 the effects of homeopathy 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.299
 practically in 34 days they already have 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.180
 first effects is giving notice that 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.030
 there are new shoots 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.540
 of pest that there is increase in force is a 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.909
 pretty fast method despite what 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.040
 you think about homeopathy knowing 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.090
 Repertory Tsar knowing how to choose 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.489
 medicine is really amazing the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.140
 way in which the reactions of the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.750
 plants 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.420
 the plants understand perfectly well 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.400
 the application of homeopathy the one 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.840
 battle to understand sometimes is the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.360
 human health is man 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.890
 open the new horizons in the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.330
 agriculture is perhaps the most difficult 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.129
 because farmers normally 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.200
 traditionally they represent a field 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.430
 very hard very resistant to changes 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.900
 precisely because many things are 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.049
 transmit from generation to generation 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.540
 but I've just been taken for 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.580
 this side many things that are transmitted 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.129
 from generation to generation simply 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.349
 the application of 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.079
 Homeopathy in plants can 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.810
 applied from a pot in a 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.769
 small farm a micro orchard an orchard 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.340
 family up to large extensions what 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.220
 What are missing are people committed to the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.200
 future of humanity with the future of 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.170
 agriculture 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.800
 and people who have enough opening 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.170
 mental to start new method 9 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.709
 way of thinking not only 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.620
 sustainable but regenerative we must 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 make up what we did in the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.260
 past generations so much damage that 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.230
 we did to nature and to the ground already 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.930
 the plants themselves applying the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.379
 hybridization handcuffed applying to 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.440
 very many thousands of millions 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.360
 of tons of pesticides thinking that 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.640
 We were going to solve the health of 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.680
 plants and not only us 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.900
 We solved the health of the plants but 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.079
 we also hurt our 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.079
 yes 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.230
 ah
