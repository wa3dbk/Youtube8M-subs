00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.950
 Hey guys, the LED TV resolutions from 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.610
 rock and we will do it 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.610
 stuffed pepper 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.869
 so people let's start doing 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.869
 filling 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.670
 Let's vote a little oil or 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.670
 oil in the pan 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.160
 let it warm while I go 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.160
 painting a garlic 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.770
 and threw the onion was to give a little 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.090
 in her 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.090
 immediately rinse 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:32.109
 now we're adding garlic 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.439
 now he will play well without leaving 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.439
 burn 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.289
 now we're going to add the sausage 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.289
 smoked being cut into cubes 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.280
 while it reinforces the onion and the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.280
 garlic I'm going to get the tomatoes 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.280
 good now that the sausage is well that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.280
 I had to add to the load. 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:28.050
 Let's play well and then add the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:30.540
 Tomato the staff now our face is gone 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.080
 we will add the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.080
 tomato 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.900
 a little olive 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.970
 can wear black can wear green 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.690
 Let's let this tomato make a 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.190
 bit inside the eye and let's go 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.560
 correct salt is important to save on 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.140
 because the smoked sausage she has already 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.140
 is well played and olive too 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.450
 Good, now we're going to fix the salt. 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.680
 and to finish 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.130
 I'm going to put the blue whiting to take a little 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.130
 of little basil parsley 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.100
 good staff then our stuffing is 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.370
 ready 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.230
 now we're going to cut the metal in half 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.050
 you can do so much of fulfilled 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.220
 while cut exactly mine will 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.840
 make both types show yellow and 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.660
 red 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.579
 if you take out the seeds you have inside 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.579
 of chili 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.610
 We're halfway through the stuffing now. 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.060
 Let's put our meat on the people. 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.060

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.680
 Good, let's go let's go 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.680
 placing a shape 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.570
 our thoughts are closed 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:22.690
 Now we're going to take it to the oven. 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:25.780
 I already said that if it at 180 degrees we go 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.280
 let him find until they pepper the 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.480

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.480
 Let's see how the pepper is. 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.060
