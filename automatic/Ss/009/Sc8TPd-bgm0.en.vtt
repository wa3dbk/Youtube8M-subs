00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
got a little more hardware but the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.040 
got a little more hardware but the
concept<00:02:57.260> will<00:02:57.530> be<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.800> same<00:02:59.950> come<00:03:00.950> over<00:03:01.190> here

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
concept will be the same come over here

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.030 
concept will be the same come over here
got<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.230> relieved<00:03:03.620> puck<00:03:04.150> spacer<00:03:05.150> goes<00:03:05.330> first
