worth it and that's why I've hopefully

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.289 
worth it and that's why I've hopefully
next<00:01:33.659> year<00:01:33.810> man<00:01:34.130> sookay<00:01:35.130> reworks<00:01:35.759> might<00:01:36.030> seem

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
next year man sookay reworks might seem

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
next year man sookay reworks might seem
in<00:01:36.450> my<00:01:36.570> opinion<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.829> mud<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
in my opinion to do it more like mud and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.429 
in my opinion to do it more like mud and
I<00:01:38.310> say<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.119> much<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.930> need<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.170> pace

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
I say this so much they need to pace

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
I say this so much they need to pace
themselves<00:01:40.710> throughout<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.490> year<00:01:41.640> for

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
themselves throughout the year for

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.090 
themselves throughout the year for
instance<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.780> we're<00:01:42.960> getting<00:01:43.079> 99<00:01:43.470> s<00:01:44.040> in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
instance so when we're getting 99 s in

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.819 
instance so when we're getting 99 s in
my<00:01:44.220> opinion<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> first<00:01:45.390> 99<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.500> should

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
my opinion we see the first 99 it should

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.340 
my opinion we see the first 99 it should
be<00:01:46.860> around<00:01:47.280> maybe<00:01:47.549> playoff<00:01:48.180> time<00:01:48.509> maybe<00:01:49.020> even

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
be around maybe playoff time maybe even

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
be around maybe playoff time maybe even
later<00:01:49.799> than<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.399> because<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.240> for

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
later than that because then for

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.819 
later than that because then for
instance<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> guy<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.170> Paul<00:01:52.560> Pierce

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
instance we get a guy like Paul Pierce

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.800 
instance we get a guy like Paul Pierce
yesterday<00:01:53.250> who<00:01:53.399> let's<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.090> honest<00:01:54.450> man<00:01:54.600> that's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
yesterday who let's be honest man that's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.080 
yesterday who let's be honest man that's
a<00:01:54.930> pretty<00:01:55.320> sick<00:01:55.770> car<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.189> throw<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.790> Paul

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
a pretty sick car to throw back Paul

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
a pretty sick car to throw back Paul
Pierce<00:01:57.360> even<00:01:57.659> though<00:01:57.719> his<00:01:57.869> stats<00:01:58.170> honestly

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
Pierce even though his stats honestly

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.740 
Pierce even though his stats honestly
aren't<00:01:59.369> anything<00:01:59.670> too<00:01:59.969> special<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.600> would

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
aren't anything too special it would

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
aren't anything too special it would
still<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.079> fun<00:02:01.380> card<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> use<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.159> for

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
still be a fun card to use it for

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
still be a fun card to use it for
instance<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:02.969> they<00:02:03.149> paced<00:02:03.509> themselves

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
instance you know they paced themselves

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.630 
instance you know they paced themselves
because<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> game<00:02:04.950> came<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.369> think

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
because when the game came out I think

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.950 
because when the game came out I think
of<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> players<00:02:06.719> were

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
of you know a lot of the players were

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.230 
of you know a lot of the players were
about<00:02:07.110> 89<00:02:07.649> over<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.220> right<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.700> range

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
about 89 over all right in that range

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.090 
about 89 over all right in that range
so<00:02:09.480> if<00:02:09.600> 2k<00:02:10.110> would<00:02:10.320> have<00:02:10.410> released<00:02:10.680> that<00:02:10.890> Paul

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
so if 2k would have released that Paul

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.950 
so if 2k would have released that Paul
Pierce<00:02:11.340> earlier<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.360> year<00:02:12.390> i<00:02:12.600> think<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
Pierce earlier in the year i think that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.810 
Pierce earlier in the year i think that
card<00:02:13.200> would<00:02:13.410> have<00:02:13.530> been<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.800> lot<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.310> fun<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.700> use

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
card would have been a lot of fun to use

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.280 
card would have been a lot of fun to use
but<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.210> point<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> game<00:02:15.720> went<00:02:16.110> for

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
but at this point in the game went for

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.200 
but at this point in the game went for
instance<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.520> dominique

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
instance they have the dominique

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.700 
instance they have the dominique
challenge<00:02:18.720> where<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.930> could<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.380> spend

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
challenge where you could if you spend

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.750 
challenge where you could if you spend
an<00:02:19.800> hour<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.250> your<00:02:20.370> time<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:21.240> can<00:02:21.510> get<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.870> free

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
an hour of your time you can get a free

they release the Paul Pierce at at 89

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.870 
they release the Paul Pierce at at 89
and<00:02:28.110> ages<00:02:28.740> doesn't<00:02:29.130> make<00:02:29.220> sense<00:02:29.370> because<00:02:29.730> at

this point in the game an 89 overall
card<00:02:32.040> literally<00:02:32.610> means<00:02:33.300> nothing<00:02:34.080> and
