00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.830
 his father the father sees him from afar and says 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.880
 that Jesus acknowledged today is 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.579
 recognizing more than one here 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.439
 more than one who had sinned this week 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.539
 that had left this week that 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.670
 had gone that had fallen behind that 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.070
 he had stepped back he is 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.429
 recognizing and you're here in the house of 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.649
 father and he recognizes you and you know what happens 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.200
 at that moment the father runs out to 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.880
 where your son does not allow the devil 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.560
 keep accusing him and keep saying no 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.479
 how is it that you are saying that 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.149
 treat like one of my servants if you are 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.530
 my son embraces him kisses him and he listens and 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.530
 He says dad what you had 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.750
 found is not sin against heaven I have 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.819
 sin against you I no longer deserve that I 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.820
 call your son treat me like anybody 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.250
 of your employees 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.200
 never allow the devil to accuse you of 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.840
 that way he had not understood that it was 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.509
 a son but there was another son true 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.670
 older and that older was obedient was not 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.800
 how this disobedient did not have 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.920
 understood that he was a son you know why 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.270
 what does dad get in front of this 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.940
 conversation he had with his youngest son 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.650
 He says no sir as well I'm going to 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.930
 ask for the best footwear the best 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.880
 I dress to put a ring that makes 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.760
 you regain the authority that 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.220
 you had before but besides that I'm going to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.750
 make a feast you would have expected 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.000
 you if you had passed him the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.130
 your son that you had a child that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.570
 according to what would have left home and would have 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.420
 stolen from the inheritance and will have returned 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.940
 as if nothing not freed from a beating 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.400
 a dead woman finishes it rather more of 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.470
 one I imagine here in a garden and 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.070
 You will see that I put it and give it its good 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.440
 footprint and it was what deserved true 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.040
 I deserved that but that father's love 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.040
 led to more 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.330
 to sit at the table with shame is 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.780
 tell 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.250
 ok you said you left I love it but you know 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.900
 What you feel if you do not deserve is a 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.610
 fish imagine worth the son 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.780
 prodigal to know that his dad was 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.700
 having a party when I do not know 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.770
 I deserved that I was dressing him 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.420
 better when he did not deserve it he was 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.520
 putting a ring that subtracted the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.940
 restored his sonhood when 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.770
 He did not deserve it gives you a worth a 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.070
 shame that says I never go back to 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.070
 sin
