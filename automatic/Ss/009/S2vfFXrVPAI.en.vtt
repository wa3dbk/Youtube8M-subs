down and then what we did was that the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.020 
down and then what we did was that the

gym was pretty busy our plan was to go

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.199 
gym was pretty busy our plan was to go
to<00:01:31.060> dumbbell<00:01:31.630> incline<00:01:31.810> press<00:01:32.649> but<00:01:33.160> all<00:01:33.729> the

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
to dumbbell incline press but all the

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.169 
to dumbbell incline press but all the
benches<00:01:34.450> were<00:01:34.599> taken<00:01:34.959> so<00:01:35.200> we<00:01:35.819> ended<00:01:36.819> up<00:01:37.119> doing

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
benches were taken so we ended up doing

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.559 
benches were taken so we ended up doing
OHP<00:01:37.869> first<00:01:39.179> before<00:01:40.179> incline<00:01:42.030> we're<00:01:43.030> shooting

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
OHP first before incline we're shooting

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.529 
OHP first before incline we're shooting
for<00:01:44.729> 10<00:01:45.729> reps<00:01:45.940> but<00:01:46.410> we<00:01:47.410> were<00:01:47.500> both<00:01:48.539> hitting

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
for 10 reps but we were both hitting

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.419 
for 10 reps but we were both hitting
about<00:01:49.810> 7<00:01:50.289> to<00:01:50.410> 8<00:01:50.440> with<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.009> weight<00:01:51.160> that<00:01:51.310> we

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
about 7 to 8 with the weight that we

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.089 
about 7 to 8 with the weight that we
chose<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.810> we<00:01:55.929> stuck<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.319> the<00:01:56.410> weight<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.830> then

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
chose so we stuck to the weight and then

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.600 
chose so we stuck to the weight and then
what<00:01:57.759> we<00:01:57.849> did<00:01:58.030> was<00:01:58.239> just<00:01:58.830> decrease<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.160> rest

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
the heads of the shoulder deltoids so I

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.250 
the heads of the shoulder deltoids so I
think<00:04:22.580> when<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.360> used<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.690> do<00:04:23.810> this<00:04:23.960> this

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
think when I used to do this this

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.529 
think when I used to do this this
machine<00:04:24.650> regularly<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.310> was<00:04:25.490> doing<00:04:25.729> like<00:04:25.850> 155

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
machine regularly I was doing like 155

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.740 
machine regularly I was doing like 155
on<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:26.990> stack<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:28.880> actually<00:04:29.180> had<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.479> drop

on the stack and I actually had to drop

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.129 
on the stack and I actually had to drop
it<00:04:29.930> down<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.320> think<00:04:30.620> 90<00:04:31.250> pounds<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:32.900> get<00:04:33.050> the

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
it down to I think 90 pounds to get the

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.310 
it down to I think 90 pounds to get the
form<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.940> quality<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:35.539> wanted<00:04:35.870> with

form and the quality that I wanted with

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.490 
form and the quality that I wanted with
the<00:04:36.350> reps

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
the reps

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.230 
the reps
