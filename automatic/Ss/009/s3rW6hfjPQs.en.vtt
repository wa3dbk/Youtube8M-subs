00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.950
 friends hello today in this video 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.830
 a lesson I would like to show you one more 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:18.590
 kind of weaving weaving crosswise so for 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.779
 example i took 4 balls for 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:29.779
 160 modeling a size let you 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:36.050
 show that is, for starters, we take two 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:39.260
 shdm measure the bubble on each i will measure 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.200
 bubble on 2 fingers measure the bubble 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.430
 do we twist take 2 shdm measure off 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.170
 bubble 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.690
 same size ie try 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.270
 need in this weaving bubbles stand 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:04.510
 one size 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:04.510
 do I take on 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.440
 the next two balls 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:19.950
 also measure a vial of 2 fingers on 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:22.700
 one on the second to do a spike of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700
 twisted tubes 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.330
 what we got here are two pairs 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:43.619
 see what we do next game 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:53.090
 I make again a bubble of the same size as 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:56.900
 here goes would have made that size and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.900
 now look twisting 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.830
 he listened 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:13.120
 let's fix these bubbles 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.120
 so that they do not spin not from you. 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.120
 bind 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:37.590
 Now we take extremely shdm measure also 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:42.900
 bubble one bubble 2 let's do it 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:52.349
 cards and here in this picture are the percentages 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:55.860
 we also make a bubble and these 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.970
 all the same way we repeat 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.590
 energy side 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:11.390
 again we make a bubble on extremely 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:14.390
 problems, we also do 1 2 hands 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.390
 we twist 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.560
 from the ceiling 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:35.880
 now we take you inside and here as well 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.880
 also doing a bubble on here and 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.989
 look here again completely again after 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.470
 we twisted someone 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:04.000
 here again find about not doing two bubbles 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:04.000
 1 doing the second verse 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.750
 at this summit we make 1.56 durable 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:34.780
 repeating doing two bubbles will be sent 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.930
 so you can notice we get 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.930
 here is a cookie 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.570
 if you say you need to do this 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.500
 strip 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:03.680
 yes so to speak wider you can here 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.510
 bind more then there are a couple of shdm 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.870
 and in the same way making bubbles connect 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.560
 twist you just be strip -5 gone 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:19.910
 I took you an example for example 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:25.570
 four steps well let's show further what 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.570
 continues in the same way we do 1 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.300
 I apologize immediately if somewhere 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.960
 let's say how this bubble turned out 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.090
 more is less just i'm a little bit 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.680
 I keep it not quite convenient for myself 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:10.720
 so it can be heated 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.720
 of the ball it was clearly phil 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:31.759
 and so on everything is clear if something 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.759
 incomprehensible you can watch yet 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:43.470
 also watch on my channel others 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:47.150
 types of weaving if you like this 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.699
 video lesson do not forget to put likes 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.169
 subscribe to my channel 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.169
