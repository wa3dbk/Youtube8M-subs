and obtrusively let's see some of the
features<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.520> has<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.690> have<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.870> bottle

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
features that it has you have a bottle

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.540 
features that it has you have a bottle
opener<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.960> here<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.320> have<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.950> serrated

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
opener right here you have a serrated

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.830 
opener right here you have a serrated
blade<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:50.559> to<00:00:50.829> sharpen<00:00:51.520> scallops<00:00:52.059> this

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
blade with to sharpen scallops this

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.170 
blade with to sharpen scallops this
third<00:00:53.230> one<00:00:53.410> here<00:00:53.470> near<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.280> edge<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:54.790> not

third one here near the edge is not

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.950 
third one here near the edge is not
sharpened<00:00:55.840> so<00:00:56.110> I<00:00:56.350> think<00:00:56.950> that's<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:58.300> prevent

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
sharpened so I think that's to prevent

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.240 
sharpened so I think that's to prevent
you<00:00:59.170> from<00:00:59.200> accidentally<00:00:59.800> cutting<00:01:00.160> yourself

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
you from accidentally cutting yourself

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.720 
you from accidentally cutting yourself
because<00:01:00.850> these<00:01:01.660> two<00:01:01.989> here<00:01:02.350> are<00:01:02.590> fairly<00:01:03.219> sharp

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
because these two here are fairly sharp

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.379 
because these two here are fairly sharp
and<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:05.140> this<00:01:05.500> tip<00:01:05.950> here<00:01:06.219> you<00:01:06.340> have<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> tapered

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:10.410 
and on this tip here you have a tapered
edge<00:01:08.139> that<00:01:08.920> can<00:01:09.069> serve<00:01:09.340> as<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.700> small

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420

would not call this a nail file or any
kind<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.090> file<00:01:25.359> because<00:01:25.779> it's<00:01:26.619> too<00:01:26.950> smooth<00:01:27.369> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
kind of file because it's too smooth to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.069 
kind of file because it's too smooth to
file<00:01:29.170> anything<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.029> plan<00:01:31.420> on<00:01:31.689> filing<00:01:31.929> your

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
nails with it good luck so at best this

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.940 
nails with it good luck so at best this
would<00:01:35.560> serve<00:01:35.829> as<00:01:36.189> a<00:01:36.779> textured<00:01:37.779> surface<00:01:38.289> to

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
would serve as a textured surface to

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.190 
would serve as a textured surface to
give<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.279> better<00:01:39.549> grip<00:01:39.939> with<00:01:40.630> your<00:01:40.779> fingers

if you were to hold it like this so

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.719 
if you were to hold it like this so
let's<00:01:44.170> try<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.439> sound<00:01:44.799> some<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.249> the<00:01:45.310> common

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
let's try the sound some of the common

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.389 
let's try the sound some of the common
tasks<00:01:46.179> that<00:01:46.299> you<00:01:46.419> would<00:01:46.569> normally<00:01:47.109> use<00:01:47.399> this

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
tasks that you would normally use this

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.989 
tasks that you would normally use this
tool<00:01:48.729> in<00:01:48.969> a<00:01:49.060> day-to-day<00:01:49.389> basis<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.909> example

tool in a day-to-day basis for example

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.669 
tool in a day-to-day basis for example
here<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.990> have<00:01:53.740> number<00:01:54.369> 12<00:01:54.669> Bank<00:01:54.999> line<00:01:55.499> so<00:01:56.499> we're

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
here I have number 12 Bank line so we're

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:03.499 
here I have number 12 Bank line so we're
gonna<00:01:56.770> see<00:01:57.130> how<00:01:57.429> well<00:01:57.639> it<00:01:58.060> can<00:01:58.270> cut<00:01:58.509> this<00:01:58.719> rope

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.149 

works<00:02:04.509> some<00:02:04.750> bad<00:02:04.930> it's<00:02:05.530> not<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.829> good<00:02:06.009> as<00:02:06.130> a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
works some bad it's not as good as a

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.040 
works some bad it's not as good as a
knife<00:02:06.399> but<00:02:06.820> you're<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:07.600> gonna<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:07.869> much

knife but you're not gonna have much

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.820 
knife but you're not gonna have much
trouble<00:02:08.739> cutting<00:02:09.670> rope<00:02:10.209> with<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.830> serrated

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
trouble cutting rope with this serrated

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.330 
trouble cutting rope with this serrated
edge<00:02:11.980> here's<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.060> piece<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.890> plastic<00:02:14.890> clamshell

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
edge here's a piece of plastic clamshell

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.150 
edge here's a piece of plastic clamshell
packaging<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> lot<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.900> things<00:02:17.160> come

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
packaging that a lot of things come

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.790 
packaging that a lot of things come
packaged<00:02:18.700> inside<00:02:19.030> up<00:02:19.480> these<00:02:19.630> days<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.620> let's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
packaged inside up these days so let's

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:33.300 
packaged inside up these days so let's
see<00:02:20.950> how<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.310> cuts<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.450> not<00:02:32.019> too<00:02:32.200> bad<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
see how it cuts so not too bad and the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.000 
see how it cuts so not too bad and the
bottle<00:02:33.610> opener<00:02:33.970> works<00:02:34.209> pretty<00:02:34.420> well<00:02:34.540> also<00:02:35.200> and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
bottle opener works pretty well also and

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.190 
bottle opener works pretty well also and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the other thing I like is that it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.340 
the other thing I like is that it
doesn't<00:02:38.530> try<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> do<00:02:39.310> anything<00:02:40.319> hokey<00:02:41.319> or

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
doesn't try to do anything hokey or

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.740 
doesn't try to do anything hokey or
ridiculous<00:02:42.100> like<00:02:42.489> have<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> little<00:02:43.330> knife

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
ridiculous like have a little knife

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
blade that folds in and out there's no

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.110 
blade that folds in and out there's no
need<00:02:46.299> for<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.569> it's<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:46.780> keeping<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.440> simple

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
need for it it's just keeping it simple

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.350 
need for it it's just keeping it simple

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
keeping it less likely to break anything

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.800 
keeping it less likely to break anything
and<00:02:52.870> you're<00:02:53.590> not<00:02:53.769> as<00:02:53.920> likely<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.280> cut<00:02:54.640> yourself

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
and you're not as likely to cut yourself
