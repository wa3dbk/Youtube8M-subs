Rena<00:00:24.560> sorry<00:00:24.890> four-cylinder

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.410 

so<00:00:28.790> let's<00:00:28.970> see<00:00:29.150> how<00:00:29.240> it<00:00:29.390> drives

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.599 

before<00:00:34.960> that's<00:00:35.170> really<00:00:35.589> smooth

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.970 

again<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.149> like<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.600> Toyota<00:00:41.019> bumps<00:00:41.679> that<00:00:41.859> they

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
again I like the Toyota bumps that they

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.850 
again I like the Toyota bumps that they
have<00:00:42.219> now

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
have now

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.530 
have now
makes<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.160> easier<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.640> find<00:00:44.730> exactly<00:00:45.360> where

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
makes it easier to find exactly where

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:55.819 
makes it easier to find exactly where
you<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> steering<00:00:46.680> wheel

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.969 

at<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> stop<00:00:56.579> sign<00:00:57.079> traffic

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.770 

now<00:01:05.979> I<00:01:06.040> have<00:01:06.190> driven<00:01:06.400> this<00:01:06.580> before<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.210> it's

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
now I have driven this before and it's

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.440 
now I have driven this before and it's
not<00:01:08.080> either<00:01:08.440> powered<00:01:08.890> they<00:01:09.729> did<00:01:09.940> reduce<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
not either powered they did reduce the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.780 
not either powered they did reduce the
weight<00:01:10.630> of<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:10.900> car<00:01:11.200> 300<00:01:12.009> pounds<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
weight of this car 300 pounds and I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.570 
weight of this car 300 pounds and I
believe<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:15.909> makes<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.240> big<00:01:16.420> difference<00:01:17.580> what

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
believe that makes a big difference what

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.190 
believe that makes a big difference what
do<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.700> think<00:01:18.850> about<00:01:18.940> fuel<00:01:19.509> economy<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:20.050> one

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
do you think about fuel economy this one

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.370 
do you think about fuel economy this one
doesn't<00:01:20.350> have<00:01:20.440> 25<00:01:20.979> city<00:01:21.490> 35<00:01:22.060> highway<00:01:24.330> again

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
doesn't have 25 city 35 highway again

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.200 
doesn't have 25 city 35 highway again
not<00:01:26.380> dead<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.070> we'll<00:01:27.280> see<00:01:27.460> here<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.820> second

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
not dead and we'll see here in a second

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:43.539 
not dead and we'll see here in a second
we<00:01:28.750> get<00:01:29.020> in<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.140> highway

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.919 

as<00:01:44.549> good<00:01:44.850> power<00:01:45.090> could<00:01:45.450> pick<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.810> an

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
as good power could pick up an

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.859 
as good power could pick up an
acceleration<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> beat<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.039> traffic<00:01:47.869> meaning

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
acceleration to beat the traffic meaning

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.690 
acceleration to beat the traffic meaning
that<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.380> good<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> merge<00:01:49.979> onto<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.429> highway

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
that it's good to merge onto a highway

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.210 
that it's good to merge onto a highway
for<00:01:50.969> need<00:01:51.329> be

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.880 

and<00:01:58.220> while<00:01:58.520> this<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> Toyota<00:01:59.530> you<00:02:00.530> know<00:02:00.650> that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
and while this is a Toyota you know that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.280 
and while this is a Toyota you know that
feels<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.220> little<00:02:01.250> bit<00:02:01.460> floaty<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:02.210> have<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.080> lot

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
feels a little bit floaty I have a lot

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.350 
feels a little bit floaty I have a lot
of<00:02:03.640> Road<00:02:04.640> feel<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:06.890> without<00:02:07.700> being<00:02:08.119> too

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
of Road feel in this without being too

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.670 
of Road feel in this without being too
harsh<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:09.140> know<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.920> suspension<00:02:10.459> must<00:02:10.670> be

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680

he doesn't have the greatest pickup but

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.440 
he doesn't have the greatest pickup but
it<00:02:36.950> does<00:02:37.069> have<00:02:37.280> enough<00:02:37.370> acceleration<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:38.300> push

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
it does have enough acceleration to push

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.080 
it does have enough acceleration to push
