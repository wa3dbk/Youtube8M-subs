00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
there was garage girls in I'm here with

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.799 
there was garage girls in I'm here with
Scott<00:00:08.130> again<00:00:08.549> a<00:00:08.580> progressive<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.420> we're

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
Scott again a progressive and we're

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.470 
Scott again a progressive and we're
standing<00:00:10.020> in<00:00:10.290> front<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.830> new<00:00:11.010> 970<00:00:12.000> series

standing in front of the new 970 series

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.990 
standing in front of the new 970 series
I<00:00:12.780> know<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.800> is<00:00:13.950> more<00:00:14.160> like<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> race<00:00:14.700> minded

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
I know this is more like a race minded

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.150 
I know this is more like a race minded
setup<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.540> you've<00:00:18.779> got<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.140> piggy<00:00:20.009> back

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
setup and you've got this piggy back

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.590 
setup and you've got this piggy back
reservoir<00:00:20.730> right<00:00:22.640> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> our<00:00:23.939> new<00:00:24.060> 1970

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
reservoir right this is our new 1970

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.920 
reservoir right this is our new 1970
series<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> 36<00:00:26.460> millimeter<00:00:26.939> more

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930

mono tube shock piggyback reservoir and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.770 
mono tube shock piggyback reservoir and
the<00:00:31.949> some<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> highlights<00:00:33.330> in<00:00:33.449> this<00:00:33.570> shock

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the some of the highlights in this shock

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.180 
the some of the highlights in this shock
as<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.739> cutaway

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
as you can see in this cutaway

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880 
as you can see in this cutaway
it's<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.600> aboard<00:00:36.870> shock<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.380> deflective

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's one aboard shock with deflective

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.950 
it's one aboard shock with deflective
dist<00:00:38.190> valving<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.630> it's<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> very

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
dist valving so it's a very

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.479 
dist valving so it's a very

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
got hard anodized aluminum coating

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
got hard anodized aluminum coating
thread<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.100> preload<00:00:47.219> adjusters<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:48.000> of

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
thread of preload adjusters and of

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.340 
thread of preload adjusters and of
course<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> piggyback<00:00:48.570> reservoir<00:00:49.140> base

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
course the piggyback reservoir base

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.910 
course the piggyback reservoir base
which<00:00:49.739> contains<00:00:50.190> our<00:00:50.399> gas<00:00:50.760> face<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.390> oil<00:00:51.920> this

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
which contains our gas face and oil this

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.979 
which contains our gas face and oil this
is<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.340> also<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.789> externally<00:00:54.570> adjustable

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is it also has externally adjustable

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
is it also has externally adjustable
compression<00:00:55.500> damping<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> nice

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
compression damping with this nice

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
compression damping with this nice
little<00:00:56.670> knob<00:00:57.149> over<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> side

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
little knob over here on the on the side

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.139 
little knob over here on the on the side
you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.980> dial<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> firm<00:00:59.850> up<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you can just dial it in to firm up the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360 
you can just dial it in to firm up the
compression<00:01:00.570> damping<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
compression damping so you can see the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.619 
compression damping so you can see the
inner<00:01:02.550> workings<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> turn<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
inner workings of that as you turn the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.240 
inner workings of that as you turn the
knob<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> actually<00:01:04.379> closes<00:01:04.739> off<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:05.009> orifice

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
knob it actually closes off an orifice

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.570 
knob it actually closes off an orifice
through<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.530> deflective<00:01:07.530> dis<00:01:07.710> valve<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
through this deflective dis valve in the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.070 
through this deflective dis valve in the
for<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> compression<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.390> damping<00:01:09.689> adjuster

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
for the compression of damping adjuster

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.010 
for the compression of damping adjuster
so<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:11.010> allows<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.520> rider<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.840> only

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so it allows the rider to not only

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
so it allows the rider to not only
adjust<00:01:13.409> spring<00:01:13.619> preload<00:01:13.860> via<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> threaded

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
adjust spring preload via the threaded

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450 
adjust spring preload via the threaded
adjusters<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.320> he's<00:01:16.500> someone<00:01:17.100> who<00:01:17.250> wants

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
adjusters but if he's someone who wants

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.219 
adjusters but if he's someone who wants
to<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.640> somewhat<00:01:18.390> high<00:01:18.510> performance<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.110> know

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to go somewhat high performance you know

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.050 
to go somewhat high performance you know
Canyon<00:01:19.650> riding<00:01:20.009> something<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
Canyon riding something like that it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.340 
Canyon riding something like that it
really<00:01:21.210> needs<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> firm<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> suspension<00:01:22.259> up

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
really needs to firm the suspension up

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
really needs to firm the suspension up
for<00:01:22.470> stability<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> cornering<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.240> also

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
for stability and cornering you can also

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
for stability and cornering you can also
affect<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> damping<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.710> give<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.070> high

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
affect the damping to give you that high

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
affect the damping to give you that high
performance<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:26.880> characteristic<00:01:27.509> these

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
performance right characteristic these

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
performance right characteristic these
