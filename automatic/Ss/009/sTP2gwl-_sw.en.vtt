00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.179
 Hello dear friends with you sorting 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:26.420
 and today I go through a mini-game minion rush 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.070
 before the map created by the skipper himself 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:35.000
 skipper and his friends 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.960
 yes let's read the rules rules 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.660
 such are 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.809
 although no start we will start reading 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.250
 First, I greet you on the minion card 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.180
 rush 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:50.989
 rule is not 4 I can not know I do not know what 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.170
 it means not using a bike until 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:01.940
 play on the world of flour and does not prevent us 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:03.920
 let's put the world map authors on the world 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.830
 skipper clubs 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:13.130
 clips camper ok 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.310
 have a good game thanks so here are the links to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.310
 their channels 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.650
 I'll leave the skipper link to the skipper channel 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.729
 these ones unfortunately I don't know but if 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.060
 will find u will also give you oh there 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.799
 also 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.799
 but we will not put a cake and start 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.799
 So 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.240
 the card is a run with 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.120
 obstacles 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:51.810
 Guy is not the first time 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:55.650
 played something like that we do not run fast 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 opt and ok ok we died 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:03.750
 nothing we still have a lot of time and run 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.470
 run run oh so I podlagnul but ok 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.720
 ok run-run even faster 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:20.960
 once again and run run run run 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:26.030
 parts for ufa so need 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:35.330
 so yes the main thing is not to crash into these 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:35.330
 things I think everyone understands it oh okay 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.709
 so the map is created without a single mod without 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.860
 single plug as skipper claims i 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:52.340
 I believe him because I do not have a mod 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:56.660
 not worth the fashion and I have a minimap 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.280
 rang the fields as it is called ok 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.100
 now we are still a little bit 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.330
 cheaters ran over the fence and you 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.130
 punished let's say okay run on 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.459
 we run we run we run we run we run we run 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.459
 run 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.790
 I we also do not need to fall many 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.340
 will ask themselves how are they 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.290
 so did the card almost this 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.250
 everything is created on 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.959
 command block that is all very 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.480
 difficult every command block so 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.019
 set 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.650
 display not all drive to enter at home 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.739
 this is a long card pretty long 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.250
 thanks, of course, what kind of pen for such 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.659
 good card 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.560
 tried of course very much if 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.560
 minor improvements 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:01.579
 well, as the skipper said, everything will be still 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.540
 bite they will still create maybe 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:09.959
 such cards are modifying them 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.419
 ok and yes again ran over the fence but me 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.480
 it seems there is no possibility I can jump 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:18.239
 jumped run run run run 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:25.250
 we knit yes as I understand it here for 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:30.570
 you need a certain time to run can 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:35.210
 I passed there is nothing to wow on 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:39.270
 I really thought that a little bit more and for 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.240
 in fact, the cards are pretty good 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:51.520
 even very good 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:54.069

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.780
