sucked into the Sun now this happens to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
sucked into the Sun now this happens to
many<00:00:40.890> planets<00:00:41.460> when<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.700> reach<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.120> end<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
many planets when they reach the end of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.479 
many planets when they reach the end of
the<00:00:42.450> line<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.899> also<00:00:43.140> happens<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.770> moons<00:00:44.160> on

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the line it also happens to moons on

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
the line it also happens to moons on
nearby<00:00:44.730> Mars<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:46.020> let's<00:00:46.230> hope<00:00:46.410> our<00:00:46.530> own<00:00:46.739> moon

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
nearby Mars so let's hope our own moon

its<00:00:52.649> official<00:00:53.039> name<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.460> GJ<00:00:54.120> 1214b<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
its official name is GJ 1214b and it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.729 
its official name is GJ 1214b and it
ain't<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.800> far<00:00:56.039> away<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.579> 42<00:00:57.210> light-years

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
ain't that far away at 42 light-years

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.160 
ain't that far away at 42 light-years
discovered<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.890> 2009<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.969> entire<00:01:00.449> planet<00:01:01.020> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
discovered in 2009 this entire planet is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.959 
discovered in 2009 this entire planet is
one<00:01:01.469> massive<00:01:01.800> ocean<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> would<00:01:02.850> have

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
one massive ocean and it would have

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.640 
one massive ocean and it would have
depths<00:01:03.420> much<00:01:03.600> deeper<00:01:04.019> than<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.500> earth

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
depths much deeper than here on earth

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
depths much deeper than here on earth
they<00:01:05.189> also<00:01:05.339> believed<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.090> would<00:01:06.240> have

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
they also believed that it would have

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.560 
they also believed that it would have
formed<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> core<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.369> basically<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
formed the core so it's basically like a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.410 
formed the core so it's basically like a
planet<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.500> which<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.159> think<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> few<00:01:11.760> swimmers

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
planet in which I think a few swimmers

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
planet in which I think a few swimmers
could<00:01:12.630> survive<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.710> Kevin<00:01:14.010> Costner

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
could survive that and Kevin Costner

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
could survive that and Kevin Costner
flying<00:01:14.880> into<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> number<00:01:15.570> 3<00:01:15.900> spot<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.409> have

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
flying into the number 3 spot we have

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.410 
flying into the number 3 spot we have
