back<00:01:22.469> to<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> human<00:01:23.450> right<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:24.689> okay<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
back to the human right here okay so I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.770 
you are a mob and it appears the pig can
run<00:01:43.560> quickly<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.579> switch<00:01:44.909> over<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.450> your

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
run quickly you can switch over to your

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
run quickly you can switch over to your
ability<00:01:46.350> bone<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:47.070> clicking<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
ability bone and right clicking that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.099 
ability bone and right clicking that
will<00:01:47.640> allow<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> use<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.270> mobs<00:01:48.659> ability

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
will allow you to use that mobs ability

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.620 
will allow you to use that mobs ability
so<00:01:49.289> a<00:01:49.320> pig<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:50.159> spam<00:01:50.520> cooked<00:01:50.969> pork<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.390> think

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
so a pig can spam cooked pork I think

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510 
so a pig can spam cooked pork I think
this<00:01:51.719> is<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.369> can

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
this is a little off because you can

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
this is a little off because you can
basically<00:01:53.640> sit<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.180> spam<00:01:54.420> although<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.590 
basically sit there and spam although I
did<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.320> know<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.649> bone<00:01:55.979> had<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> usage<00:01:57.060> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
did not know this bone had a usage so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.849 
did not know this bone had a usage so
maybe<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.020> quite<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.409> off<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.770> can

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
maybe it's not quite as off but you can

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.440 
maybe it's not quite as off but you can
kind<00:01:59.039> of<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.520> kind<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.850> spam<00:02:00.090> pork

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.670 
of just giving you abilities I think
that<00:05:45.430> is<00:05:45.550> amazing<00:05:45.999> so<00:05:46.689> there's<00:05:46.870> our<00:05:47.020> people

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
that is amazing so there's our people

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.959 
that is amazing so there's our people
and<00:05:47.770> you<00:05:47.830> can<00:05:47.949> guess<00:05:48.129> that<00:05:48.159> the<00:05:48.460> Enderdragon

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
and you can guess that the Enderdragon

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.760 
and you can guess that the Enderdragon
basically<00:05:49.659> congesting<00:05:50.110> molesting<00:05:50.529> fireballs

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
basically congesting molesting fireballs

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:59.159 
basically congesting molesting fireballs
