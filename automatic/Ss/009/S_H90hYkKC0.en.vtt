yeah he works that armored vehicle plant
so<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.470> steel<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.790> called<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> our

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
so this steel I think it's called a our

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.140 
so this steel I think it's called a our
502<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.520> will<00:01:11.760> stop

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.540 

so<00:01:15.150> anyway<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.630> been<00:01:15.780> working<00:01:15.930> great<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.550> so

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
so anyway it's been working great so so

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.680 
so anyway it's been working great so so
I<00:01:17.610> sublet<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.090> log<00:01:19.040> give<00:01:20.040> myself<00:01:23.690> almost

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
I sublet this log give myself almost

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.350 
I sublet this log give myself almost
four<00:01:25.050> inches<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.590> might<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.220> able<00:01:26.370> to<00:01:26.580> just

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
four inches I might be able to just

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.150 
four inches I might be able to just
split<00:01:27.480> it<00:01:27.660> down<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> middle<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.560> down<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
split it down the middle and it down the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:43.780 
split it down the middle and it down the
middle<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:39.690> was<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.200> challenge<00:01:41.600> but

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
middle and get that was a challenge but

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.600 
middle and get that was a challenge but
basically<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.570> started<00:01:46.050> by<00:01:46.290> drawing<00:01:47.220> some

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
basically just started by drawing some

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.190 
basically just started by drawing some
square<00:01:47.910> lines<00:01:48.890> pounding<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> throw-in<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:51.210> had

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
square lines pounding the throw-in I had

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.080 
square lines pounding the throw-in I had
to<00:01:52.350> beat<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> crap<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.820> in

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to beat the crap out of it to get it in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.270 
to beat the crap out of it to get it in
and<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.500> took<00:01:56.160> a<00:01:56.280> lot<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:58.259> split<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and it really took a lot to to split it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.999 
and it really took a lot to to split it
but<00:01:59.490> then<00:01:59.780> there's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> little<00:02:01.050> bit<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.440> bump

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
but then there's a little bit of a bump

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
but then there's a little bit of a bump
so<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.630> brushed<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.720> down<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.020> my<00:02:04.110> chainsaw

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
so I I brushed it down with my chainsaw

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.010 
so I I brushed it down with my chainsaw
a<00:02:04.619> bit<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.670> almost<00:02:05.940> almost<00:02:06.540> perfectly

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
a bit and it's almost almost perfectly

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.510 
a bit and it's almost almost perfectly
flat<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.880> then<00:02:09.030> I've<00:02:09.259> traced<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.890> my<00:02:11.100> axe

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
flat so then I've traced one of my axe

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.170 
flat so then I've traced one of my axe
handles<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:14.030> within<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> giving<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.180> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
handles and within and giving it a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.780 
handles and within and giving it a
little<00:02:18.570> bit<00:02:18.690> different<00:02:19.310> feel<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.549> you<00:02:20.670> can

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
little bit different feel to it you can

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
little bit different feel to it you can
see<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.030> more<00:02:21.209> curvy<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.440> really<00:02:22.830> like

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
see it's more curvy so I really like

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.070 
see it's more curvy so I really like
this<00:02:23.640> hatchet<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.360> really<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:26.900> style<00:02:27.900> of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
this hatchet I really like that style of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.410 
this hatchet I really like that style of
handle<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.769> I'm<00:02:28.920> gonna<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.910> recreate

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
handle so I'm gonna kind of recreate

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.229 
handle so I'm gonna kind of recreate
that<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:35.970> kind<00:02:36.180> of

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
that here so you can see you can kind of

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.850 
that here so you can see you can kind of
see<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:37.799> curve<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> log<00:02:39.799> so<00:02:40.799> I'm

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
see that the curve of the log so I'm

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.740 
see that the curve of the log so I'm
gonna<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.940> do<00:02:42.030> my<00:02:42.150> best<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.420> utilize<00:02:42.720> that

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
gonna just do my best to utilize that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.620 
gonna just do my best to utilize that
and<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.920> yeah<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.220> think<00:02:44.340> by<00:02:44.850> splitting<00:02:45.420> it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
and so yeah I think by splitting it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.390 
and so yeah I think by splitting it
rather<00:02:46.200> than<00:02:46.440> milling<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:46.980> think<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.220> get

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
rather than milling it I think you get

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.210 
rather than milling it I think you get
more<00:02:48.209> strength<00:02:48.540> out<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.260> wood<00:02:49.440> because

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
more strength out of the wood because

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.220 
more strength out of the wood because
you're<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.120> keeping<00:02:51.269> all<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> grain<00:02:51.840> intact

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
you're just keeping all the grain intact

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.800 
you're just keeping all the grain intact
I'm<00:02:52.830> almost<00:02:53.100> done<00:02:53.310> making<00:02:53.940> my<00:02:54.060> shape<00:02:54.360> or<00:02:54.630> so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
I'm almost done making my shape or so

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.900 
I'm almost done making my shape or so
I'm<00:02:54.900> gonna<00:02:55.019> try<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.440> once<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.370> got<00:02:56.549> this<00:02:56.670> cut

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
I'm gonna try and once I got this cut

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.170 
I'm gonna try and once I got this cut
out<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:58.190> take<00:02:59.190> my<00:02:59.430> or<00:02:59.880> take<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.150> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
out I'm going to take my or take it to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.810 
out I'm going to take my or take it to
my<00:03:00.299> shave<00:03:00.510> horse<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.400> draw<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> knife<00:03:02.489> it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
my shave horse and and draw a knife it

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.080 
my shave horse and and draw a knife it
just<00:03:03.600> as<00:03:03.780> traditional<00:03:04.290> as<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.440> can<00:03:05.090> using

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
just as traditional as I can using

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.270 
just as traditional as I can using
traditional<00:03:06.239> methods<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.989> we'll<00:03:07.950> see<00:03:08.130> how<00:03:08.190> it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
traditional methods and we'll see how it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.810 
traditional methods and we'll see how it
turns<00:03:08.400> out<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.170> part<00:03:10.440> one<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.650> my<00:03:11.400> cherry

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
turns out this is part one of my cherry

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.760 
turns out this is part one of my cherry
