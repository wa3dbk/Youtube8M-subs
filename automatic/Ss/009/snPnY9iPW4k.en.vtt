use shimmer moss which I don't have

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.280 
use shimmer moss which I don't have
anymore<00:00:35.340> because<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:35.820> were<00:00:36.030> quite<00:00:36.899> similar

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
anymore because they were quite similar

to my monsters just a little more green

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.549 
to my monsters just a little more green
so<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> sold<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:41.899> this<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.290> wonder

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
so I sold it but this is what wonder

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.450 
so I sold it but this is what wonder
grass<00:00:43.739> looks<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.660> pair<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
grass looks like and then pair it and

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.880 
grass looks like and then pair it and
then<00:00:47.460> pair<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.030> over<00:00:48.539> wonder<00:00:48.870> grass<00:00:49.110> off<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
then pair it over wonder grass off this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
then pair it over wonder grass off this
brown<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.309> um<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.149> there's<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.870> bottom<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
brown one um and there's the bottom is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
brown one um and there's the bottom is
gulfstream<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.059> gulfstream<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
gulfstream so if you up gulfstream you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
gulfstream so if you up gulfstream you
could<00:00:54.840> use<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.280> over<00:00:56.579> here

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
could use that and then this over here

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.720 
could use that and then this over here
is<00:00:56.879> Coco<00:00:57.449> Beach<00:00:57.660> pigment<00:00:58.260> which<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.859> used<00:00:59.129> which

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.719 

isn't<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.239> discontinued<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> was

limited<00:01:05.729> edition<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.270> something<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.869> um<00:01:07.080> if

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
limited edition or something but um if

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
limited edition or something but um if
you<00:01:08.820> don't<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.240> cocoa<00:01:09.689> beach<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.140> could<00:01:10.290> use

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you don't have cocoa beach you could use

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.010 
you don't have cocoa beach you could use
chocolate<00:01:10.799> brown<00:01:11.130> pigment<00:01:11.430> which<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.659> isn't

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
chocolate brown pigment which that isn't

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
chocolate brown pigment which that isn't
as<00:01:13.170> bronzy<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.220> cocoa<00:01:14.580> beach<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.210> could

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
as bronzy as cocoa beach or you could

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.870 
as bronzy as cocoa beach or you could
use<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.720> multi<00:01:16.409> shadow<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:17.700> have

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
use on multi shadow which i don't have

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
use on multi shadow which i don't have
so<00:01:18.180> i<00:01:18.210> can't<00:01:18.450> watch<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> each<00:01:19.229> other<00:01:19.439> but

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so i can't watch it as to each other but

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.280 
so i can't watch it as to each other but
i've<00:01:19.710> read<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> they're<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.250> similar<00:01:21.290> so

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
i've read that they're really similar so

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.200 
i've read that they're really similar so
I<00:01:22.320> already<00:01:22.830> applied<00:01:27.770> jump<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.000> Urban<00:01:30.000> Decay

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210

I already applied jump it Urban Decay
primer<00:01:30.270> potion<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.189> then<00:01:32.189> I'm<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> take

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
primer potion and then I'm going to take

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.789 
primer potion and then I'm going to take
my<00:01:34.170> 239<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.070> Wonder<00:01:35.400> grass<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
my 239 in Wonder grass and I'm going to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:50.750 
my 239 in Wonder grass and I'm going to
apply<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.520> lid

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.940 

if<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:51.510> have<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> green<00:01:52.350> base<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.800> could

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
if you have like a green base you could

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.680 
if you have like a green base you could
probably<00:01:53.160> just<00:01:53.430> use<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.640> instead<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.330> wonder

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
probably just use that instead of wonder

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.170 
probably just use that instead of wonder
grass<00:01:55.070> or<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:56.340> don't<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.640> wonder<00:01:56.940> graphs

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
grass or if you don't have wonder graphs

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.610 
grass or if you don't have wonder graphs
you<00:01:57.330> could<00:01:57.510> probably<00:01:57.720> use<00:01:58.080> swimming<00:02:00.620> but

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
you could probably use swimming but

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.110 
you could probably use swimming but
wonder<00:02:01.980> dress<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.460> i<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.730> so<00:02:02.940> that's
