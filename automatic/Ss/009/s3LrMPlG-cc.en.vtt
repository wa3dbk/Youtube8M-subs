00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
and then you don't need to test the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.509 
and then you don't need to test the
connection<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.860> want<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.340> now

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
right now you have to start blocking it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.020 
right now you have to start blocking it
right<00:03:03.500> now<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.280> then<00:03:04.430> when<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:04.549> sign<00:03:04.790> in<00:03:05.000> now

it<00:03:05.360> works<00:03:05.920> let<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.040> let<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.489> be<00:03:07.580> patient<00:03:08.060> might

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
it works let it let it be patient might

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.060 
it works let it let it be patient might
take<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.260> while<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.739> be<00:03:10.190> patient<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:12.799> should

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
take a while so be patient and it should

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.960 
take a while so be patient and it should
work<00:03:13.100> if<00:03:13.459> you

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
work if you

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.000
