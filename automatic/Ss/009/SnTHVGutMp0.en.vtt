00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:11.679 
the basic six count swing step this is

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.839 
the basic six count swing step this is
also<00:00:11.889> known<00:00:12.250> as<00:00:12.610> the<00:00:13.480> jitterbug<00:00:13.990> step<00:00:14.849> this

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.820 
back step now somewhere about the 1960s
in<00:00:58.000> Los<00:00:58.540> Angeles<00:00:59.229> that<00:00:59.799> step<00:01:00.220> began<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.210> evolve

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
in Los Angeles that step began to evolve

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.710 
in Los Angeles that step began to evolve
into<00:01:02.830> a<00:01:03.280> step<00:01:03.909> that<00:01:04.239> week<00:01:05.229> and<00:01:05.650> unfortunately

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
into a step that week and unfortunately

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.920 
into a step that week and unfortunately
I<00:01:07.720> was<00:01:08.230> around<00:01:08.500> back<00:01:08.710> then<00:01:09.160> called<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.720> hop

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
I was around back then called the hop

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.840 
I was around back then called the hop
now<00:01:11.830> what<00:01:12.010> we<00:01:12.130> did<00:01:12.430> is<00:01:12.820> we<00:01:13.800> we<00:01:14.800> sort<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.220> changed

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
now what we did is we we sort of changed

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.220 
now what we did is we we sort of changed
the<00:01:17.040> step<00:01:18.040> around<00:01:18.370> someone<00:01:19.060> still<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.960> same

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
the step around someone still the same

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.040 
the step around someone still the same
basic<00:01:20.620> six<00:01:21.190> count<00:01:21.520> but<00:01:22.180> we're<00:01:22.600> moving<00:01:22.930> our

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
basic six count but we're moving our

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.410 
basic six count but we're moving our
feet<00:01:23.260> differently<00:01:23.890> one<00:01:24.250> thing<00:01:24.580> we're<00:01:25.060> taking

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
feet differently one thing we're taking

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.420 
feet differently one thing we're taking
out<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.690> rock<00:01:25.900> stick<00:01:26.230> so<00:01:26.740> instead<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.190> going

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
out the rock stick so instead of going

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.320 
out the rock stick so instead of going
rock<00:01:28.060> step<00:01:28.720> right<00:01:29.320> we're<00:01:29.560> going<00:01:29.890> step<00:01:30.400> step

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
rock step right we're going step step

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.930 
rock step right we're going step step
other<00:01:31.900> thing<00:01:32.260> is<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:32.950> triple<00:01:33.340> step<00:01:33.550> right

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
other thing is on the triple step right

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.960 
other thing is on the triple step right
it's<00:01:34.390> dead<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.690> going<00:01:34.960> side<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.380> side<00:01:35.909> side<00:01:36.909> to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
it's dead of going side to side side to

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.850 
it's dead of going side to side side to
side<00:01:37.590> right

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
side right

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.090 
side right
we're<00:01:39.190> going<00:01:39.460> back<00:01:41.130> back<00:01:42.540> okay<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:44.409> what<00:01:44.980> it

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
we're going back back okay so what it

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.890 
we're going back back okay so what it
looked<00:01:45.310> like<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.909> this<00:01:46.270> five<00:01:46.900> six<00:01:47.580> seven<00:01:48.580> eight

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
looked like is this five six seven eight

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.670 
looked like is this five six seven eight
back<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.290> step<00:01:50.740> back<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.820> step<00:01:52.330> step<00:01:52.900> step

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
back and step back and step step step

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.290 
back and step back and step step step
back<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.090> step<00:01:55.479> back<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.530> step<00:01:57.010> step<00:01:57.580> step

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
back and step back and step step step

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.640 
back and step back and step step step
back<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.620> step<00:01:59.950> back<00:02:00.729> good<00:02:01.150> step<00:02:01.479> step<00:02:02.200> step

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
back and step back good step step step

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.980 
back and step back good step step step
so<00:02:03.490> that's<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:04.120> hop<00:02:04.860> from<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.220> west<00:02:06.850> coast

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
so that's the hop from the west coast

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.240 
so that's the hop from the west coast
primarily<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.110> Los<00:02:08.229> Angeles<00:02:08.799> area<00:02:09.479> circa

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
primarily in Los Angeles area circa

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.620 
primarily in Los Angeles area circa
1960s

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
1960s

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.120 
1960s
yeah<00:02:13.170> about<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.430> same<00:02:14.730> time<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.690> earlier<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
yeah about the same time the earlier of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.120 
yeah about the same time the earlier of
course<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.580> begin<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> 1950s<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:20.010> a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
course to begin to the 1950s in a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.710 
course to begin to the 1950s in a
Midwest<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:21.770> Chicago<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.210> guess<00:02:24.210> they<00:02:24.450> saw

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
Midwest like Chicago I guess they saw

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.450 
Midwest like Chicago I guess they saw
what<00:02:24.990> we<00:02:25.140> were<00:02:25.260> doing<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.770> west<00:02:26.040> coast<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
what we were doing in the west coast and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.730 
what we were doing in the west coast and
said<00:02:26.670> yeah<00:02:27.020> we're<00:02:28.020> going<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> complete

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
said yeah we're going to do a complete

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.380 
said yeah we're going to do a complete
together<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:30.030> first<00:02:30.780> thing<00:02:31.050> we<00:02:31.230> did<00:02:31.500> was

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
together so first thing we did was

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.140 
together so first thing we did was
instead<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.990> side<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.680> side<00:02:35.150> triple

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
instead of going side to side triple

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.170 
instead of going side to side triple
step<00:02:36.450> triple<00:02:36.990> step<00:02:38.000> instead<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.150> going<00:02:39.710> back

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
step triple step instead of going back

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.560 
step triple step instead of going back
back<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.540> step<00:02:43.020> back<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:44.070> step<00:02:44.490> they<00:02:45.120> decided

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
back and step back a step they decided

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.380 
back and step back a step they decided
they<00:02:45.810> wanted<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:46.650> forward<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:48.060> what<00:02:48.210> they

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
they wanted to go forward so what they

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.140 
they wanted to go forward so what they
did<00:02:48.450> was<00:02:49.820> forward<00:02:50.820> step<00:02:51.770> forward<00:02:52.770> step<00:02:52.950> okay

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
did was forward step forward step okay

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.640 
did was forward step forward step okay
now<00:02:54.690> instead<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:56.060> rock<00:02:57.060> step<00:02:57.630> right<00:02:58.290> four

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
now instead of the rock step right four

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.120 
now instead of the rock step right four
five<00:02:58.830> six<00:02:59.280> or<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.840> step<00:03:01.710> step<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.520> we<00:03:02.700> did<00:03:02.970> in

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
five six or the step step that we did in

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.790
