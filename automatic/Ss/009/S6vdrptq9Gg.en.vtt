00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.890 
contact and one of the reasons we do
that<00:00:22.280> is<00:00:22.610> we<00:00:22.730> want<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.060> make<00:00:23.210> sure<00:00:23.270> we<00:00:23.600> get<00:00:23.750> the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
unfortunately what happens is when you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.920
