00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
now let's go over the different parts of

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.539 
now let's go over the different parts of
the<00:00:02.970> machine<00:00:03.140> this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.380> machine<00:00:04.799> basics<00:00:05.250> one

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
the machine this is machine basics one

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.430 
the machine this is machine basics one
will<00:00:05.879> go<00:00:06.029> over<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.299> few<00:00:06.540> more<00:00:06.720> parts<00:00:06.899> later<00:00:07.230> but

things are good now look over on this
side<00:00:17.840> this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.320> hand<00:00:19.560> wheel<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.580> turn<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
side this is the hand wheel you turn it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.560 
side this is the hand wheel you turn it
with<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> top<00:00:21.930> coming<00:00:22.260> towards<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.359> to<00:00:24.359> make

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
with the top coming towards you to make

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.529 
with the top coming towards you to make
the<00:00:24.750> Machine<00:00:25.140> form<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.099> stitch<00:00:26.400> now<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the Machine form a stitch now if you

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.849 
the Machine form a stitch now if you
want<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> two<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.109> needed<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.830> could

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
want to two are needed to you could

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.640 
want to two are needed to you could
actually<00:00:29.220> make<00:00:29.730> an<00:00:29.939> entire<00:00:30.300> garment<00:00:30.810> using

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
actually make an entire garment using

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.030 
actually make an entire garment using
only<00:00:32.030> the<00:00:33.030> hand<00:00:33.329> wheel<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.710> machine

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
only the hand wheel and the machine

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
only the hand wheel and the machine
however<00:00:35.969> that's<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> tire<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.350> out

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
however that's going to tire you out

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.970 
however that's going to tire you out
real<00:00:37.920> fast<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.579> let's<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.000> at<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> next<00:00:39.300> part

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
real fast so let's look at the next part

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.209 
real fast so let's look at the next part
down<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.600> foot<00:00:42.930> pedal<00:00:43.320> just

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
down here this is the foot pedal just

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.860 
down here this is the foot pedal just
like<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.579> car<00:00:44.820> accelerator<00:00:45.329> when<00:00:45.809> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
like with a car accelerator when you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.340 
like with a car accelerator when you
push<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.440> goes<00:00:47.160> push<00:00:48.030> harder<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.140> goes

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
push on it it goes push harder it goes

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.850 
push on it it goes push harder it goes
faster

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
faster

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.010 
faster
there<00:00:52.040> it<00:00:52.160> is<00:00:52.220> going<00:00:52.490> to<00:00:52.550> us<00:00:52.670> as<00:00:52.940> I<00:00:53.390> ease<00:00:53.630> up<00:00:53.840> on

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
there it is going to us as I ease up on

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.250 
there it is going to us as I ease up on
it<00:00:54.230> it<00:00:54.860> goes<00:00:55.100> slower<00:00:55.490> and<00:00:55.820> tell<00:00:56.120> it<00:00:56.330> forming

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
it it goes slower and tell it forming

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.200 
it it goes slower and tell it forming

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
presser foot that's the foot right here

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.290 
presser foot that's the foot right here
it's<00:01:11.900> called<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.380> presser<00:01:12.590> foot<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:13.670> presses

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
it's called the presser foot it presses

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.400 
it's called the presser foot it presses
the<00:01:14.450> fabric<00:01:14.900> down<00:01:15.170> onto<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.060> feed<00:01:17.060> dogs<00:01:17.410> the

the fabric down onto the feed dogs the
feed<00:01:18.650> dogs<00:01:18.680> feed<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.790> fabric<00:01:20.300> through

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
feed dogs feed the fabric through

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.060 
feed dogs feed the fabric through
forming<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.590> stitch<00:01:22.450> we<00:01:23.450> have<00:01:23.630> over<00:01:23.960> here<00:01:24.070> the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
forming the stitch we have over here the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.120 
forming the stitch we have over here the
presser<00:01:25.610> foot<00:01:25.850> lever<00:01:26.259> it<00:01:27.259> raises<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.100> lowers

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
presser foot lever it raises and lowers

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.330 
presser foot lever it raises and lowers
the<00:01:28.940> presser<00:01:29.300> foot<00:01:29.530> hood<00:01:30.530> up<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.040> fit<00:01:31.220> the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
the presser foot hood up you can fit the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.270 
the presser foot hood up you can fit the
fabric<00:01:31.670> under<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:31.970> push<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:32.869> down<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:34.130> can

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
fabric under it push it down and you can

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.600 
fabric under it push it down and you can
so<00:01:35.920> now<00:01:36.920> let's<00:01:37.160> come<00:01:37.340> over<00:01:37.550> here<00:01:38.380> we<00:01:39.380> have<00:01:39.619> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
so now let's come over here we have the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.749 
so now let's come over here we have the
stitch<00:01:41.000> length<00:01:41.330> knob<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:43.040> determines<00:01:43.399> how

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
stitch length knob this determines how

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.749 
stitch length knob this determines how
long<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.479> stitches<00:01:44.869> are<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.259> this<00:01:45.979> case<00:01:46.250> the

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
long the stitches are in this case the

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.680 
long the stitches are in this case the
numbers<00:01:47.060> go<00:01:47.210> from<00:01:48.190> zero<00:01:49.190> down<00:01:49.460> here<00:01:49.790> all<00:01:50.149> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
numbers go from zero down here all the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.900 
numbers go from zero down here all the
way<00:01:50.720> up<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:50.930> four<00:01:51.290> in<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:52.100> case<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.700> number

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
way up to four in that case the number

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.030 
way up to four in that case the number
indicates<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.630> number<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:53.960> millimeters<00:01:54.470> each

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
indicates the number of millimeters each

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.240 
indicates the number of millimeters each
stitches<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:56.330> for<00:01:56.960> means<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:58.040> you're<00:01:58.159> making

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
stitches so for means that you're making

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.230 
stitches so for means that you're making
a<00:01:58.490> four<00:01:58.760> millimeter<00:01:59.000> long<00:01:59.510> stitch<00:02:00.940> to<00:02:01.940> means

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
a four millimeter long stitch to means

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.350 
a four millimeter long stitch to means
you're<00:02:02.360> making<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.659> two<00:02:02.870> millimeter<00:02:03.080> stitch

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
you're making a two millimeter stitch

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.990 
you're making a two millimeter stitch
zero<00:02:05.360> mean<00:02:05.570> you're<00:02:05.690> not<00:02:05.810> moving<00:02:06.170> at<00:02:06.260> all<00:02:07.000> now

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
zero mean you're not moving at all now
