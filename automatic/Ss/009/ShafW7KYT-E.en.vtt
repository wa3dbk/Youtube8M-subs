00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
so just as a little add-on I'm going to

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.369 
so just as a little add-on I'm going to
talk<00:00:08.080> about<00:00:08.260> gating<00:00:09.900> people<00:00:10.900> gate<00:00:11.080> drums

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
talk about gating people gate drums

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.629 
talk about gating people gate drums
quite<00:00:11.620> a<00:00:11.650> lot<00:00:11.860> I'm<00:00:12.039> going<00:00:12.280> to<00:00:12.370> do<00:00:12.430> it<00:00:12.490> on<00:00:12.549> the

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
quite a lot I'm going to do it on the

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.240 
quite a lot I'm going to do it on the
kick<00:00:13.350> the<00:00:14.350> reason<00:00:14.590> for<00:00:14.740> doing<00:00:14.799> it<00:00:14.949> here<00:00:15.100> would

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
kick the reason for doing it here would

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.910 
kick the reason for doing it here would
be<00:00:15.369> just<00:00:15.549> to<00:00:15.639> clean<00:00:15.850> it<00:00:16.000> up<00:00:16.090> a<00:00:16.180> bit<00:00:16.800> here<00:00:17.800> to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
be just to clean it up a bit here to

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.099 
be just to clean it up a bit here to
kick<00:00:18.100> on<00:00:18.250> its<00:00:18.400> own<00:00:18.580> some<00:00:19.480> I<00:00:19.630> mean<00:00:19.869> if<00:00:19.990> you're

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
kick on its own some I mean if you're

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.000 
kick on its own some I mean if you're
going<00:00:20.199> to<00:00:20.289> do<00:00:20.410> this<00:00:20.470> it's<00:00:20.619> probably<00:00:20.740> good<00:00:20.980> to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
going to do this it's probably good to

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.279 
going to do this it's probably good to
do<00:00:21.160> right<00:00:21.369> at<00:00:21.429> the<00:00:21.490> start<00:00:21.730> but<00:00:22.080> doing<00:00:23.080> at<00:00:23.169> the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
do right at the start but doing at the

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.319 
do right at the start but doing at the
end<00:00:23.439> helps<00:00:24.130> you<00:00:24.220> get<00:00:24.339> more<00:00:24.550> realistic<00:00:25.029> view<00:00:25.179> as

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
end helps you get more realistic view as

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.460 
end helps you get more realistic view as
to<00:00:25.390> whether<00:00:25.539> it's<00:00:25.749> making<00:00:25.990> a<00:00:26.050> difference<00:00:26.079> on

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
to whether it's making a difference on

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.679 
to whether it's making a difference on
anything<00:00:26.710> right<00:00:27.699> as<00:00:27.939> you<00:00:28.179> can<00:00:28.300> play<00:00:28.449> the<00:00:28.480> kick

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
anything right as you can play the kick

anything right as you can play the kick
on<00:00:28.810> its<00:00:28.929> own<00:00:29.019> again<00:00:29.140> I<00:00:33.660> mean<00:00:34.660> this<00:00:34.810> kick<00:00:35.050> in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
on its own again I mean this kick in

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.139 
on its own again I mean this kick in
particular<00:00:35.530> has<00:00:35.829> got<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:35.980> lot<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.220> overspill<00:00:36.820> so

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
particular has got a lot of overspill so

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.900 
particular has got a lot of overspill so
you<00:00:37.210> can<00:00:37.329> hear<00:00:37.449> a<00:00:37.510> lot<00:00:37.629> of<00:00:37.800> snare<00:00:38.910> everything

happen now what I'm going to do I'm
going<00:00:44.109> to<00:00:44.230> use<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.379> gate<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.280> noise<00:00:45.430> k<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:45.969> if<00:00:46.030> I

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
going to use a gate and noise k so if I

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.049 
going to use a gate and noise k so if I
go<00:00:46.120> down<00:00:46.239> amex<00:00:46.719> and<00:00:46.840> go<00:00:46.960> annoys<00:00:47.170> gay<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:48.059> whole

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
go down amex and go annoys gay and whole

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.229 
go down amex and go annoys gay and whole
point<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.390> noise<00:00:49.600> gate<00:00:49.870> is<00:00:50.050> to<00:00:50.469> remove

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
point of noise gate is to remove

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.490 
point of noise gate is to remove
unwanted<00:00:52.239> noise<00:00:52.539> in<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.780> background<00:00:52.929> and<00:00:53.320> you

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
unwanted noise in the background and you

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.299 
unwanted noise in the background and you
do<00:00:53.620> it<00:00:53.710> by<00:00:53.739> setting<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.160> threshold<00:00:56.309> search

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
do it by setting the threshold search

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.950 
do it by setting the threshold search
with<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.550> threshold<00:01:03.210> by<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.269> loudest<00:01:04.720> noise

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
with the threshold by the loudest noise

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.730 
with the threshold by the loudest noise
which<00:01:05.260> is<00:01:05.410> in<00:01:05.730> the<00:01:06.730> sound<00:01:07.360> file<00:01:07.720> which<00:01:08.710> is

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
which is in the sound file which is

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.870 
which is in the sound file which is
going<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.040> be<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.189> kick<00:01:09.400> because<00:01:09.700> it's

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
going to be the kick because it's

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.100 
going to be the kick because it's
closest<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.390> mic<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.600> it's<00:01:10.869> going<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.020> be

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
closest to the mic and it's going to be

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.810 
closest to the mic and it's going to be
the<00:01:11.200> loudest<00:01:11.290> thing<00:01:11.619> ba<00:01:12.100> was<00:01:12.250> filled<00:01:12.460> quieter

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
the loudest thing ba was filled quieter

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.890 
the loudest thing ba was filled quieter
obviously<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:14.229> your<00:01:14.380> thing<00:01:14.590> meters<00:01:14.950> on<00:01:15.100> your

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
obviously when your thing meters on your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.649 
obviously when your thing meters on your
on<00:01:16.900> this<00:01:17.229> at<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.409> side<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.909> know<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.479> can't

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
on this at the side you know you can't

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.300 
on this at the side you know you can't
constantly<00:01:19.960> coming<00:01:20.290> in<00:01:20.409> at<00:01:20.560> minus<00:01:20.890> sixteen

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
constantly coming in at minus sixteen

constantly coming in at minus sixteen
minus<00:01:21.549> twelve<00:01:21.909> minus<00:01:22.210> seven<00:01:22.570> point<00:01:22.750> six<00:01:22.930> DB<00:01:23.560> I

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.139 
minus twelve minus seven point six DB I
first<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:24.009> your<00:01:24.220> dynamic<00:01:24.610> level<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.939> tracks

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
first you your dynamic level the tracks

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.719 
first you your dynamic level the tracks
constantly<00:01:25.570> changing<00:01:26.049> what<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:26.950> does<00:01:27.100> here<00:01:27.369> if

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
constantly changing what it does here if

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.200 
constantly changing what it does here if
you<00:01:27.880> set<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.180> threshold<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:30.070> will<00:01:30.369> cut

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
you set the threshold and it will cut

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.630 
you set the threshold and it will cut
out<00:01:31.360> anything<00:01:31.930> below<00:01:32.110> what<00:01:33.070> comes<00:01:33.280> in<00:01:33.430> at<00:01:33.549> that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
out anything below what comes in at that

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.760 
out anything below what comes in at that
particular<00:01:33.790> threshold<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:35.049> if<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.259> met<00:01:35.409> all

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
particular threshold so if you met all

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.990 
particular threshold so if you met all
you<00:01:35.829> have<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.159> have<00:01:36.189> to<00:01:36.310> actually<00:01:36.490> change<00:01:36.790> me

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
you have you have to actually change me

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.370 
you have you have to actually change me
there's<00:01:37.329> no<00:01:37.450> set<00:01:37.719> rule<00:01:37.899> for<00:01:38.079> that<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.229> have<00:01:38.259> to

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
there's no set rule for that you have to

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.109 
there's no set rule for that you have to
move<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.250> around<00:01:39.280> until<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:39.790> find<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.090> right

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
move it around until you find the right

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:51.300 
move it around until you find the right
one<00:01:43.290> few<00:01:44.290> snow<00:01:44.500> is<00:01:44.560> getting<00:01:44.770> through<00:01:45.040> there<00:01:50.310> so

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
one few snow is getting through there so

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.920 
one few snow is getting through there so
you<00:01:51.369> know<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.700> isolate<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.240> kick<00:01:52.450> obviously

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
you know that isolate the kick obviously

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.120 
you know that isolate the kick obviously
if<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.140> was<00:01:53.259> there<00:01:53.409> on<00:01:53.500> its<00:01:53.649> own<00:01:53.740> in<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.920> mix

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
if that was there on its own in the mix

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.099 
if that was there on its own in the mix
it<00:01:54.250> might<00:01:54.369> start<00:01:54.579> sounding<00:01:54.789> weird<00:01:54.939> I<00:02:01.020> mean<00:02:02.020> you

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
it might start sounding weird I mean you

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.630 
it might start sounding weird I mean you
could<00:02:02.200> do<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.469> like<00:02:02.649> that<00:02:02.770> but<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.460> know<00:02:03.579> you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
could do it like that but you know you

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.709 
could do it like that but you know you
have<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.850> tweak<00:02:04.149> around<00:02:04.180> with<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:04.659> it

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
have to tweak around with it so it

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.260 
have to tweak around with it so it
doesn't<00:02:04.780> sound<00:02:05.079> weird<00:02:05.969> remember<00:02:06.969> the<00:02:07.060> lot<00:02:07.180> of

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
doesn't sound weird remember the lot of

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.370 
doesn't sound weird remember the lot of
the<00:02:07.329> kick<00:02:07.509> is<00:02:07.630> coming<00:02:07.899> through<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.080> overheads

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
the kick is coming through the overheads

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.719 
the kick is coming through the overheads
too<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:08.740> you<00:02:08.830> might<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:09.130> want<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.399> kick<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.700> a

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
too so you might just want the kick is a

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.740 
too so you might just want the kick is a
really<00:02:10.770> jerky<00:02:11.770> kind<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.040> coat<00:02:12.940> rack<00:02:13.330> anyway

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
really jerky kind of coat rack anyway

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.030 
really jerky kind of coat rack anyway
now<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.349> follow<00:02:14.379> me<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:14.890> what<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
now if you follow me this is what I

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.339 
now if you follow me this is what I
would<00:02:15.129> do<00:02:15.310> set<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.120> look-ahead<00:02:16.360> another

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
would do set the look-ahead another

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.690 
would do set the look-ahead another
thing<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.590> explain<00:02:17.830> what<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.160> apartment

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
thing can explain what that is apartment

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.520 
thing can explain what that is apartment
means<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> plug<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.750> she<00:02:20.020> looks<00:02:20.260> into

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
means that the plug and she looks into

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.660 
means that the plug and she looks into
the<00:02:20.620> future<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.980> find<00:02:21.099> out<00:02:21.340> what's<00:02:21.459> going<00:02:21.489> to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
the future to find out what's going to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.979 
the future to find out what's going to
happen<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.060> adjust<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:22.599> a<00:02:22.660> little<00:02:22.780> bit<00:02:22.930> of

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
happen and adjust with a little bit of

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.570 
happen and adjust with a little bit of
time<00:02:23.170> left<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.590> would<00:02:23.739> set<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.980> attack<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.370> one

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
time left I would set the attack to one

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.790 
time left I would set the attack to one
as<00:02:24.760> well<00:02:26.879> now<00:02:27.879> these<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:29.379> just<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.709> to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
as well now these you just have to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.050 
as well now these you just have to
change<00:02:30.069> depending<00:02:30.459> on<00:02:30.610> how<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.760> sound<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:33.060> it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
change depending on how the sound is it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.440 
change depending on how the sound is it
gives<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.330> bit<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.480> body<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:34.989> unless<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
gives a bit of body to it unless the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.550 
gives a bit of body to it unless the
keeps<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.569> gate<00:02:37.750> open<00:02:38.050> for<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.230> little<00:02:38.410> bit<00:02:38.530> of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
keeps the gate open for a little bit of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.900 
keeps the gate open for a little bit of
time<00:02:40.200> join<00:02:41.200> us<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.620> does<00:02:41.860> as<00:02:41.980> well<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.849> you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
time join us on this does as well so you

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.949 
time join us on this does as well so you
know<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.150> give<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.390> kick<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.569> bit<00:02:46.750> more<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.900> a

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
know you give it a kick a bit more of a

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.039 
know you give it a kick a bit more of a
realistic<00:02:47.380> envelope<00:02:51.780> probably<00:02:52.780> should<00:02:52.870> turn

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
realistic envelope probably should turn

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.270 
realistic envelope probably should turn
off<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> reverb<00:02:53.590> at<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:53.830> point<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.130> she's

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
off the reverb at this point I she's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830 
off the reverb at this point I she's
getting<00:02:54.549> more<00:02:54.670> realistic<00:02:55.150> are<00:02:55.450> doing<00:02:55.660> what's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
getting more realistic are doing what's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.240 
getting more realistic are doing what's
going<00:02:56.080> on<00:03:01.470> anyway<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.620> sounds<00:03:02.860> right<00:03:03.040> now

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
going on anyway that sounds right now

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.860 
going on anyway that sounds right now
the<00:03:03.549> final<00:03:03.760> thing<00:03:03.910> at<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.480> moment<00:03:04.750> game

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
the final thing at the moment game

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.750 
the final thing at the moment game
reductions<00:03:05.319> 100<00:03:05.829> DB<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.549> it's<00:03:06.670> completely

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
reductions 100 DB so it's completely

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.600 
reductions 100 DB so it's completely
silencing<00:03:07.720> everything<00:03:08.079> which<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.440> not<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
silencing everything which is not the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.509 
silencing everything which is not the
kick<00:03:10.290> now<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.739> might<00:03:11.920> want<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:12.489> a

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
kick now you might want it to be a

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.580 
kick now you might want it to be a
little<00:03:12.670> bit<00:03:12.760> more<00:03:12.940> musical<00:03:13.390> rise<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.870> up

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.660 

because<00:03:20.590> if<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:20.920> have<00:03:21.069> a<00:03:21.099> gate<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.340> just

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
because if you have a gate that just

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.430 
because if you have a gate that just
kick<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.180> just<00:03:22.360> cuts<00:03:22.540> everything<00:03:22.870> out<00:03:23.139> then

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
kick that just cuts everything out then

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.780 
kick that just cuts everything out then
it<00:03:23.560> starts<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.889> sound<00:03:24.010> about<00:03:24.220> mechanical<00:03:24.639> and

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
it starts to sound about mechanical and

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.640 
it starts to sound about mechanical and
weird<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.150> often<00:03:25.900> like<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.230> said<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.470> can't

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
weird and often like I said you can't

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.720 
weird and often like I said you can't
pick<00:03:26.799> up<00:03:26.889> in<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.100> mix<00:03:27.280> because<00:03:27.400> there's<00:03:27.639> so

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
pick up in the mix because there's so

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.099 
pick up in the mix because there's so
much<00:03:27.850> other<00:03:28.000> stuff<00:03:28.120> going<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.569> but<00:03:28.750> sometimes

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
much other stuff going on but sometimes

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.080 
much other stuff going on but sometimes
you<00:03:29.200> can<00:03:29.410> anyway<00:03:29.950> what<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:30.760> would<00:03:31.000> suggest

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
you can anyway what I would suggest

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.670 
you can anyway what I would suggest
doing<00:03:31.359> is<00:03:31.630> probably<00:03:31.870> having<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.170> reduction<00:03:32.590> of

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
doing is probably having a reduction of

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.610 
doing is probably having a reduction of
between<00:03:32.920> about<00:03:33.040> minus<00:03:33.930> 25<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.139> about<00:03:35.319> minus

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
between about minus 25 and about minus

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.860 
between about minus 25 and about minus

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
12 depend on what sounds right one thing

to<00:03:43.900> keep<00:03:44.079> in<00:03:44.170> mind<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.470> you're<00:03:44.620> never<00:03:44.739> going<00:03:45.040> to

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
to keep in mind is you're never going to

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.199 
to keep in mind is you're never going to

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
get it perfect with the gate and

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.640 
get it perfect with the gate and
sometimes<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:46.840> better<00:03:46.989> just<00:03:47.079> not<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:47.380> bother

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
sometimes it's better just not to bother

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.960 
sometimes it's better just not to bother
with<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.950> or<00:03:48.069> else<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.310> can<00:03:48.459> end<00:03:48.609> up<00:03:48.700> making

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
with it or else you can end up making

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.170 
with it or else you can end up making
things<00:03:49.150> some<00:03:49.329> weird<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:51.459> can<00:03:51.609> also<00:03:51.760> do<00:03:52.000> any

very<00:03:53.980> advanced<00:03:54.850> technique<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.950> let's<00:03:57.459> hear

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
very advanced technique so let's hear

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:16.189 
very advanced technique so let's hear
that<00:03:57.609> in<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.880> mix

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.539 

well<00:04:17.199> you<00:04:17.350> know<00:04:17.470> dunno<00:04:17.799> depends<00:04:18.160> if<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.400> think

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
well you know dunno depends if you think

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.890 
well you know dunno depends if you think
it<00:04:18.639> makes<00:04:18.729> any<00:04:18.910> difference<00:04:19.000> online<00:04:19.479> i<00:04:19.509> think

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
it makes any difference online i think

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.180 
it makes any difference online i think
it<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:19.989> tidies<00:04:20.440> up<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.680> lot<00:04:20.799> when<00:04:20.829> you<00:04:21.009> hit<00:04:21.160> a

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
it just tidies up a lot when you hit a

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.879 
it just tidies up a lot when you hit a
hominid<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.850> boom<00:04:22.030> boom<00:04:22.210> boom<00:04:22.810> ba<00:04:23.229> the

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
hominid that boom boom boom ba the

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.320 
hominid that boom boom boom ba the
sustained<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.490> kick<00:04:24.699> goes<00:04:24.880> down<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.150> little

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
sustained of the kick goes down a little

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.540 
sustained of the kick goes down a little
bit<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:25.690> they're<00:04:25.810> kind<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:27.400> it's

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
bit and they're kind of the just it's

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.670 
bit and they're kind of the just it's
just<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.789> way<00:04:27.880> of<00:04:27.970> tidying<00:04:28.449> up<00:04:28.600> your<00:04:28.870> track<00:04:29.650> a

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
just the way of tidying up your track a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.590 
just the way of tidying up your track a
little<00:04:29.800> bit<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.280> because<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:31.150> kicks<00:04:31.389> had<00:04:31.539> a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
little bit and because the kicks had a

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.290 
little bit and because the kicks had a
lot<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.780> low-end<00:04:32.050> eq<00:04:32.800> boosted<00:04:33.310> that's<00:04:33.910> boosted

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
lot of low-end eq boosted that's boosted

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.400 
lot of low-end eq boosted that's boosted
on<00:04:34.419> all<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.690> things<00:04:34.900> that<00:04:35.020> are<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.139> between

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
on all the things that are in between

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.719 
on all the things that are in between
like<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.680> overspill<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.250> all<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:36.639> you

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
like the overspill and all that so you

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:37.890 
like the overspill and all that so you
can<00:04:36.789> end<00:04:36.940> up<00:04:36.970> with<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.150> bit<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.389> low<00:04:37.570> Rumble

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
can end up with a bit of a low Rumble

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.999 
can end up with a bit of a low Rumble
that<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.050> don't<00:04:38.229> particularly<00:04:38.470> need<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.949> you

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
that you don't particularly need and you

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.350 
that you don't particularly need and you
can<00:04:39.039> get<00:04:39.250> rid<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.520> with<00:04:39.699> noise<00:04:39.880> gate<00:04:40.120> and

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
can get rid of it with noise gate and

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.029 
can get rid of it with noise gate and
can<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.169> spend<00:04:41.410> with<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.620> knowledge<00:04:41.740> base<00:04:41.979> a

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
can I spend with the knowledge base a

00:04:42.039 --> 00:05:04.230 
can I spend with the knowledge base a
bit<00:05:01.949> for<00:05:02.949> me<00:05:03.099> I<00:05:03.130> can<00:05:03.370> hear<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.580> little<00:05:03.880> bit<00:05:04.000> going

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
bit for me I can hear a little bit going

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.560 
bit for me I can hear a little bit going
a<00:05:04.360> bit<00:05:04.449> unrealistic<00:05:05.460> anyway<00:05:06.460> that<00:05:06.880> is<00:05:06.910> that's

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
a bit unrealistic anyway that is that's

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
a bit unrealistic anyway that is that's
how<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.810> ride<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:07.990> gate<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.229> you<00:05:08.320> could<00:05:08.440> try

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
how to ride a gate and you could try

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.219 
how to ride a gate and you could try
that<00:05:08.650> if<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:08.860> want<00:05:09.009> it<00:05:09.690> put<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.750> reverb<00:05:11.080> back

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
that if you want it put the reverb back

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:24.479 
that if you want it put the reverb back
on<00:05:21.000> okay<00:05:22.000> great
