00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
this was a well it was like them on the

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.369 
this was a well it was like them on the
demos<00:04:05.049> supering<00:04:06.340> restyle<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:08.390> they<00:04:09.319> were

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
demos supering restyle and they were

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.960 
demos supering restyle and they were
different<00:04:09.680> from<00:04:09.890> our<00:04:10.250> Japanese<00:04:10.489> teams

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
different from our Japanese teams

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.080 
different from our Japanese teams
because<00:04:11.299> like<00:04:11.769> in<00:04:12.769> Japan<00:04:13.130> they<00:04:13.370> don't<00:04:13.400> rush<00:04:13.790> so

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
because like in Japan they don't rush so

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.690 
because like in Japan they don't rush so
much<00:04:14.120> they<00:04:14.599> go<00:04:14.750> slowly<00:04:15.049> using<00:04:15.560> one<00:04:15.890> minute<00:04:16.430> 45

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
much they go slowly using one minute 45

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:30.030 
much they go slowly using one minute 45
