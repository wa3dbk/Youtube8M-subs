00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
ball below your feet so I've hit my tee

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.420 
ball below your feet so I've hit my tee

shot here on this par 5 and I've hit it

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.160 
shot here on this par 5 and I've hit it

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
up the left hand side a little bit and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.109 
up the left hand side a little bit and
on<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.039> left-hand<00:00:28.340> side<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:28.610> this<00:00:28.699> fairway

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
on the left-hand side of this fairway

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.340 
on the left-hand side of this fairway
there's<00:00:29.330> a<00:00:29.390> little<00:00:29.539> bit<00:00:29.690> of<00:00:29.750> camber<00:00:29.990> on<00:00:30.230> the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
there's a little bit of camber on the

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.840 
there's a little bit of camber on the
fairway<00:00:30.710> like<00:00:30.920> you<00:00:31.070> can<00:00:31.250> see<00:00:31.460> here<00:00:31.670> and<00:00:31.789> I've

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
fairway like you can see here and I've

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.479 
fairway like you can see here and I've
ended<00:00:32.090> up<00:00:32.239> with<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.449> ball<00:00:32.750> below<00:00:32.960> my<00:00:33.290> feet<00:00:33.489> so

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
ended up with the ball below my feet so

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.500 
ended up with the ball below my feet so
the<00:00:34.580> thing<00:00:34.760> I've<00:00:34.879> got<00:00:35.090> to<00:00:35.180> be<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.300> little

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
the thing I've got to be a little

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.840 
the thing I've got to be a little
careful<00:00:35.600> of<00:00:36.050> here<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.470> this<00:00:37.340> shots<00:00:37.610> going<00:00:37.790> to

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
careful of here is this shots going to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.330 
careful of here is this shots going to
play<00:00:38.090> differently<00:00:38.629> to<00:00:39.530> what<00:00:39.739> it<00:00:39.860> would<00:00:40.070> if<00:00:40.190> I

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
play differently to what it would if I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.509 
play differently to what it would if I
was<00:00:40.489> setting<00:00:40.760> off<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:40.910> flat<00:00:41.300> lie<00:00:41.559> so<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:43.309> ball

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
was setting off a flat lie so the ball

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:44.500 
was setting off a flat lie so the ball
here<00:00:43.760> is<00:00:43.850> going<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.030> be<00:00:44.089> a<00:00:44.150> couple<00:00:44.420> inches

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
here is going to be a couple inches

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.479 
here is going to be a couple inches
below<00:00:44.809> my<00:00:44.930> feet<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:45.920> I've<00:00:45.979> got<00:00:46.129> to<00:00:46.159> make<00:00:46.339> some

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
below my feet so I've got to make some

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.520 
below my feet so I've got to make some
adjustments<00:00:47.089> to<00:00:47.180> my<00:00:47.300> setup<00:00:47.720> for<00:00:47.900> that<00:00:48.050> I've

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
adjustments to my setup for that I've

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.500 
adjustments to my setup for that I've
also<00:00:48.739> going<00:00:49.040> to<00:00:49.129> be<00:00:49.250> aware<00:00:49.610> of<00:00:49.670> how<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.059> lie<00:00:50.479> is

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
also going to be aware of how the lie is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.140 
also going to be aware of how the lie is
going<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:50.960> affect<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.409> ball<00:00:51.620> flight<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
going to affect the ball flight so the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.420 
going to affect the ball flight so the
easiest<00:00:53.330> way<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.839> think<00:00:53.989> about<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.470> is<00:00:54.769> the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
easiest way to think about it is the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.610 
easiest way to think about it is the
ball<00:00:55.670> in<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.000> air<00:00:56.210> is<00:00:56.720> going<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.019> tend<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:57.500> go

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
ball in the air is going to tend to go

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.189 
ball in the air is going to tend to go
in<00:00:57.799> the<00:00:57.890> same<00:00:58.100> direction<00:00:58.159> as<00:00:58.909> the<00:00:58.970> lie<00:00:59.839> of<00:00:59.870> the

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
in the same direction as the lie of the

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.740 
in the same direction as the lie of the
ground<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.549> lie<00:01:01.760> of<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.970> ground<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:02.449> if<00:01:02.629> I

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
ground so the lie of the ground is if I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.780 
ground so the lie of the ground is if I
drop<00:01:03.080> ports<00:01:03.680> of<00:01:03.799> water<00:01:04.040> sorry<00:01:04.400> on<00:01:04.610> this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
drop ports of water sorry on this

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.880 
drop ports of water sorry on this
fairway<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.750> water<00:01:05.960> would<00:01:06.140> run<00:01:06.350> down<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
fairway the water would run down the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.070 
fairway the water would run down the
hill<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.729> that's<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.150> direction<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.840> ball

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
hill so that's the direction this ball

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.990 
hill so that's the direction this ball
is<00:01:09.200> going<00:01:09.260> to<00:01:09.409> tend<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.830> go<00:01:09.979> in<00:01:10.220> once<00:01:10.549> I<00:01:10.700> get<00:01:10.880> it

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
is going to tend to go in once I get it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.120 
is going to tend to go in once I get it
up<00:01:11.119> in<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.390> air<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.260> I've<00:01:12.350> got<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.619> be<00:01:12.710> aware<00:01:12.860> of

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
up in the air so I've got to be aware of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.460 
up in the air so I've got to be aware of
that<00:01:13.460> in<00:01:13.700> terms<00:01:13.910> of<00:01:14.090> my<00:01:14.270> alignment<00:01:14.630> as<00:01:14.930> you

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
that in terms of my alignment as you

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.660 
that in terms of my alignment as you
look<00:01:15.620> down<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.950> fairway<00:01:16.220> here<00:01:16.520> you'll<00:01:16.640> see

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
look down the fairway here you'll see

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.370 
look down the fairway here you'll see
there's<00:01:16.970> bunkers<00:01:17.330> up<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.630> right<00:01:17.810> hand<00:01:18.080> side<00:01:18.200> I

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
there's bunkers up the right hand side I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.230 
there's bunkers up the right hand side I
want<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.830> make<00:01:18.950> sure<00:01:18.980> I<00:01:19.160> stay<00:01:19.220> whale<00:01:19.670> work<00:01:19.940> well

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
want to make sure I stay whale work well

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.330 
want to make sure I stay whale work well
away<00:01:20.660> from<00:01:20.690> them<00:01:21.140> I'm<00:01:21.680> trying<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.100> stay<00:01:22.280> at

away from them I'm trying to stay at

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.940 
away from them I'm trying to stay at
more<00:01:22.580> left<00:01:22.940> hand<00:01:23.270> side<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.500> with<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.740> ball

below my feet and its tendency to go
towards<00:01:27.380> those<00:01:27.530> bunkers<00:01:27.980> I've<00:01:28.190> got<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.400> make

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
towards those bunkers I've got to make

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.430 
towards those bunkers I've got to make
sure<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.760> am<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.060> little<00:01:29.270> more<00:01:29.540> left<00:01:29.900> than<00:01:30.170> I

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
sure I am a little more left than I

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.070 
sure I am a little more left than I
would<00:01:30.680> if<00:01:30.800> this<00:01:30.980> was<00:01:31.160> a<00:01:31.190> flat<00:01:31.520> lie<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:32.870> other

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
would if this was a flat lie the other

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.260 
would if this was a flat lie the other
thing<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.440> want<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.710> do<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.160> I<00:01:34.730> want<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:35.000> get<00:01:35.120> into
