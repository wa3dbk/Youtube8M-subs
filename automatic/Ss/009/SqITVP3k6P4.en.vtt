 not bad either and greet daily 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.020
 the marmot as two action thunderstorms 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello we together the film factory 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.580
 business years is now in the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.490
 cinemas as hifi and every day greets that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.500
 marmot story there is one 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.060
 alien race these extremely superior and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.600
 Everything in the world is in ruins 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.460
 ash 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.529
 and you do not seem to have any at all 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.519
 possibility to find more how can i 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.119
 defeat them 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.550
 and so is manager bill cage 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.470
 suddenly on a station and must without 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 any battle experience in the battle 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 pull it turns out absolute 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.290
 Suicide Command is already dying 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.140
 after a few moments in the battle 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.000
 but wakes up again and he hangs up 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 once in such a time loop that he 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.780
 the battle over and over and over 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.610
 should experience again 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.649
 and he does that, too, and thereby becomes 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.270
 an ever better soldier and 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.550
 maybe there will eventually be yes 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.420
 but still the possibility of the aliens 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.370
 defeat 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 that sounds very crazy it is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.379
 also how this crazy looks like that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.339
 behind here in the trader I tell them 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:10.790
 Now the goals sounds crazy and she sounds 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.540
 have to listen to me you all live depends 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.330
 I can help you 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.409
 which day is the day for you today 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.759
 the billing 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.460
 They are currently with the new recruits 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.460
 arrived 30 seconds to abort 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.009
 a new day people call destiny 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.610
 I was there as never before in his thinking 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.610
 but maybe 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:52.110
 arising from the weapon 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.610
 come to me when she wakes up 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.610
 a new day today 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.510
 who allowed them to talk to me 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.160
 tomorrow at the booth of the 2 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.290
 they know what happens to us 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.720
 fight against an organism 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.630
 You can restart the day and now 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.110
 you can too 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.300
 a new day people 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.140
 how do I control it 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.140
 they have to die 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.390
 Every day I have my fight 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.390
 instructor 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.300
 to repeat 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.300
 a 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.880
 her leg is broken no I'm still 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.200
 a 10th 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.200
 we start again from scratch 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.080
 i can not do that i am not a soldier 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.400
 they are your weapon every time you 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.209
 they know more 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.740
 make sure we win 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.640
 they always come only a little bit why 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.640
 it matters so much what happens to me 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.200
 I wish I did not know her 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.200
 but I'll do the knowing that we're coming 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.510
 we expected each other 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.510
 because we have been here before 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.489
 where is a helmet 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.489
 I do not say any 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.450
 how many times we've been here as 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.450
 often 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:58.640
 For me it is an eternity of the new 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.040
 Nevertheless, the first time seen 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.780
 I somehow did not know that 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.700
 hey why should it be in this movie now 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.190
 go and also with all further 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.010
 views of the carrier material thought 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.410
 I only then run the movie in the cinema 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.090
 and I know this one okay 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.590
 direction, it should now go there 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.000
 There is not much else around 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.490
 it will be explained that will just be 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.380
 assuming point that is so and that 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.150
 everything is visually very cool too 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.320
 has been implemented and makes tom cruise 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.600
 his thing also good 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.479
 There are many tom cruise hater 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.490
 out there and I know that too 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.020
 reason for that , there it is 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.340
 you can scientology and co 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.810
 we can understand ourselves, too 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.850
 just focus on the movie there 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.740
 he does his job well in any case 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.160
 in typical tom cruise money he has yes 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.919
 The films always have such a certain amount 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.990
 reinlegt where you know so okay acts 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.090
 just just a tom cruise just now 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.250
 the 1 meter 70 man is now big 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.050
 there must stand and the visual 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.360
 effects and the spectacle and this 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.220
 whole story netting that open up 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.330
 every case fun all together and it is 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.830
 now for me, not an absolute 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.289
 masterpiece and he will be in the reviews 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.330
 also highly praised is for me 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.130
 rather the feeling can be currently running 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.600
 not so much in the cinema we have to 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.610
 have now again something good 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.479
 because I was not completely exhausted 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.490
 the seat hewn 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.110
 I'm not one of the people now 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.479
 hey also say crazy things 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.180
 I really need to have the logic so often 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.800
 but have explained in the smallest detail 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.090
 I would like to have a little more 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.860
 you now one creates ever wish 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.570
 that action films just from the 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.700
 last ten years yes is common 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.650
 The cut is incredibly fast 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.240
 and I'm sure that's just these 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.830
 alien race looks fantastic 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.810
 and that's just these 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.760
 catching arms you see every now and then 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.139
 and they are incredibly fast and 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.940
 are agile on the way 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.380
 that animates the fantastic but 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.750
 that they look fantastic and also 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.070
 by the nature of the figure design i 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.080
 just would like to have something sometimes 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.370
 seen more is clear to me that 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.320
 these figures are incredibly fast 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.389
 move and that there too 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.220
 impossibility of defeating it behind 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.840
 is, which also references to the fight watch 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.729
 Often it is very fast and there too 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.200
 I cut that down more easily 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.760
 think there come people I would like 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.050
 also see something and do not want to 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.159
 somehow the feeling I got 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.380
 was an epileptic seizure right away 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:13.220
 everything is so general 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.950
 an appeal 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.390
 filmmaker quietly ringed a bit 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.370
 Rest in that I am a better one 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.620
 Survey then I have something on the 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.300
 but it is always like that he is always 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.160
 again such a slightly ironic under 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.930
 bring in note so he takes himself 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.810
 not at all seriously 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.000
 though tom cruise is in turn itself 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.400
 putting it in such a simple way can do it 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.260
 a few mugs into an importance 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.970
 Overall , the film opens up 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.310
 every case is just fun 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.780
 not the big throw and the story 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.770
 I would have also wished could 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.250
 you give yourself a bit more effort 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.050
 can 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.240
 but it makes fun in any case 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.290
 but not to look at it anymore 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.580
 not less 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.320
 my personal rating falls 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.510
 accordingly in any case 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.160
 above average film but 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.360
 I do not believe in five years now 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.860
 more so many people in the memory 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.570
 there will be six of me 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.760
 You can score ten points each 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.040
 giving a case is fun and straight action 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.380
 scifi fans will absolutely love this movie 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.150
 love and if you just like that 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.620
 fans are looking from this genre then 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.770
 in any case the film to her 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.790
 will definitely be rewarded with 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.160
 just under two hours super 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.450
 but cinema entertainment who but what 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.310
 wants to look at other and says so 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.960
 I'm not 25m now 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.270
 maybe with the fairy tale adaptation 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.610
 or angelina jolie I have you here 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.290
 below in the wallis are linked and who 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.090
 but says no I need now 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.990
 maybe somehow from others 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:35.210
 I'm used to our action comic 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.800
 very special review of x-men days of 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.110
 future peres future is past 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.090
 here below we have linked from 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.979
 Times Square should be made in New York 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.440
 more may travel soon too 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:49.540
 again new film criticism here the 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.540
