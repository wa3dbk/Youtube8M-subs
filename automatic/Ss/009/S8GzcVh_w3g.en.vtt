00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
play it a lot more for the computer and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.040 
play it a lot more for the computer and
I<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.920> play<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:41.520> Xbox<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.090> co-op<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.719> really

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
I do play it for Xbox to co-op is really

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.209 
I do play it for Xbox to co-op is really
fun<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.930> this<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.440> pull<00:00:46.680> hard<00:00:46.950> because

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
fun and this is just pull hard because

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.500 
fun and this is just pull hard because
they<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> keep<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:48.030> time<00:00:48.059> frame

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it's half an hour so it's probably just

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.209

gaming a while back this wasn't recently

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.000 
gaming a while back this wasn't recently
but<00:01:11.070> um<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:13.020> were<00:01:13.080> introducing<00:01:13.799> games

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
modern warfare 4 cod 4 for the food were

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.420 
modern warfare 4 cod 4 for the food were
tied<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:22.939> fur<00:01:24.020> for<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.950> Wii<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:28.280> they<00:01:29.280> also

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
tied for fur for the Wii and they also

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
tied for fur for the Wii and they also
have<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:32.150> Tom<00:01:33.150> Clancy's<00:01:33.840> Ghost<00:01:33.869> reckon<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
have like Tom Clancy's Ghost reckon I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.630 
have like Tom Clancy's Ghost reckon I
was<00:01:35.700> looking<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.509> M<00:01:36.659> games<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
was looking they have some M games but I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.920 
was looking they have some M games but I
think<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> main<00:01:39.090> reason<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.570> can't<00:01:39.840> be

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
think that the main reason we can't be

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.109 
think that the main reason we can't be
taken<00:01:40.200> seriously<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.759> look<00:01:41.970> at

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
taken seriously is that if you look at

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.179 
taken seriously is that if you look at
it<00:01:42.270> PlayStation<00:01:42.960> does<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> same<00:01:43.680> thing<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.040> we

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
it PlayStation does the same thing as we

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.800 
it PlayStation does the same thing as we
they<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.490> PlayStation<00:01:45.030> Move<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.450> they<00:01:45.659> have

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
they have PlayStation Move and they have

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.270 
they have PlayStation Move and they have
the<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.200> hardcore<00:01:46.470> play<00:01:46.829> side<00:01:47.159> of

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
guess give everyone one of each and then

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.600
