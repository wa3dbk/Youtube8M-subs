you<00:04:03.900> dance<00:04:04.140> second<00:04:13.280> degree<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.790> think<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.510> the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
you dance second degree I think that the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.720 
you dance second degree I think that the
one<00:04:16.110> thing<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.470> love<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:16.860> much<00:04:16.980> about<00:04:17.040> dance<00:04:17.519> is

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
one thing I love so much about dance is

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.150 
one thing I love so much about dance is
that<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.000> can<00:04:18.180> move<00:04:18.299> people<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.500> think<00:04:19.799> not

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
that it can move people and I think not

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.920 
that it can move people and I think not
only<00:04:20.220> did<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:20.730> move<00:04:20.850> me<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.299> think

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
only did it move me but I think

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.140 
only did it move me but I think
everybody<00:04:22.410> will<00:04:22.530> agree
