already told you guys and remove it
carefully<00:00:06.720> out<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.319> box<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.710> again

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
carefully out of the box and again

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.370 
carefully out of the box and again
without<00:00:08.189> touching<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.910> metal<00:00:09.210> part<00:00:09.450> so

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
without touching that metal part so

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.190 
without touching that metal part so
there<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.830> go<00:00:11.360> maybe<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.509> already<00:00:12.690> noticed

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
there you go maybe you already noticed

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.130 
there you go maybe you already noticed
but<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:14.610> party's<00:00:15.599> day<00:00:17.029> if<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.270> got<00:00:18.449> more<00:00:18.840> gigs

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
but the party's day if you got more gigs

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.230 
but the party's day if you got more gigs
more<00:00:19.980> gigs<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.310> ram<00:00:20.460> than<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> previous

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
more gigs of ram than the previous

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.210 
more gigs of ram than the previous
you'll<00:00:21.779> notice<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:22.619> also<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.010> little

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
you'll notice that it's also a little

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.429 
you'll notice that it's also a little
heavier<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.850> try<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> get<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.019> there<00:00:25.199> with

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
heavier and try to get in there with

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
heavier and try to get in there with
this<00:00:25.590> about<00:00:25.980> 30<00:00:26.340> degree<00:00:26.699> angle<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:27.269> should<00:00:27.449> get

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
this about 30 degree angle it should get

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.960 
this about 30 degree angle it should get
in<00:00:27.869> there<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.050> then<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.439> normally<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.580> push

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
in there and then you normally just push

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.729 
in there and then you normally just push
in<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:31.320> ram<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.809> should<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.170> sort<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
in the ram so it should do sort of a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.950 
in the ram so it should do sort of a
click<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.309> guess<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.950> 41<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.960> again

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
click I guess so that's 41 and again

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.860 
click I guess so that's 41 and again
repeat<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> same<00:00:40.680> procedure<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.870> second

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
repeat the same procedure for the second

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.160 
repeat the same procedure for the second
one<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.710> twice<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.539> ram<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> from

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
one if you got twice so my ram is from

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.920 
one if you got twice so my ram is from
Kingston<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.700> also<00:00:47.850> brand<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.420> most<00:00:48.719> uh

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
Kingston it's also brand but most uh

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.630 
Kingston it's also brand but most uh
most<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> people<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.930> ram<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.640> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
most of the people get the ram of the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
most of the people get the ram of the
mac<00:00:53.850> ram<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.629> owc<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:55.890> crucial<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.600> i'll<00:00:57.930> put

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
mac ram from owc or crucial so i'll put

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
mac ram from owc or crucial so i'll put
all<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> links<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> description<00:00:59.430> for<00:01:00.059> you

guys there you go so I'm going to turn

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.690 
guys there you go so I'm going to turn
it<00:01:05.519> over<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.320> again<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:07.920> 30<00:01:08.369> degree

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it over and again with about 30 degree

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.630 
it over and again with about 30 degree
angle<00:01:09.020> try<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:11.430> should<00:01:11.610> be

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
angle try to get in there it should be

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.830 
angle try to get in there it should be
pretty<00:01:11.909> easy<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.479> got<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
pretty easy to get them in so you got to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.359 
pretty easy to get them in so you got to
be<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:16.080> they're<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:17.330> correctly<00:01:19.369> sometimes

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
be sure they're in correctly sometimes

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.230 
be sure they're in correctly sometimes
it<00:01:20.580> might<00:01:20.750> be<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:21.960> tricky<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> there

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it might be a little tricky but so there

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
it might be a little tricky but so there
you<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.390> for<00:01:24.810> me<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.140> enough<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:26.909> you're

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you go for me there enough so now you're

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.069 
you go for me there enough so now you're
done<00:01:27.350> be<00:01:28.350> sure<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.829> they're<00:01:29.040> both<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
done be sure that they're both in the

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.539 
done be sure that they're both in the
sort<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.170> laches<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> got<00:01:32.369> two

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
sort of laches here so you got two

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
sort of laches here so you got two
latches<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> then<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.049> basically<00:01:34.200> done<00:01:34.560> for

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
latches and then you basically done for

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
latches and then you basically done for
adding<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> new<00:01:35.610> ram<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:38.090> I'm<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> sure

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
adding the new ram so I'm going to sure

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510 
adding the new ram so I'm going to sure
the<00:01:39.570> whole<00:01:39.720> thing<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.049> although<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the whole thing now although you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
the whole thing now although you
basically<00:01:42.030> done<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.509> most<00:01:42.899> difficult<00:01:43.320> part

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
basically done the most difficult part

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.600 
basically done the most difficult part
just<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.680> put<00:01:46.680> back<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.280> parts

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
just not have to put back all the parts

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.280 
just not have to put back all the parts
you<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.060> did<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:50.479> just<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> pretty

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
you and did so just this one is pretty

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.999 
you and did so just this one is pretty
easy<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.770> put<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:54.360> put<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.170> keep

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
easy to put on just put this and keep

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.749 
easy to put on just put this and keep
the<00:01:56.790> latch<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.899> keep<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> open<00:01:58.380> so

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
the latch here just keep it open so

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.510 
the latch here just keep it open so
you'll<00:01:59.759> see<00:02:00.060> why<00:02:00.270> later<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.979> put<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you'll see why later so now just put the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.820 
you'll see why later so now just put the
screws<00:02:02.759> back<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.270> same<00:02:03.420> position

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
screws back in the same position

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.410 
screws back in the same position
so<00:02:06.820> again<00:02:07.180> for<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:07.660> one<00:02:08.100> be<00:02:09.100> sure<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.670> get<00:02:10.360> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
so again for this one be sure to get the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.210 
so again for this one be sure to get the
same<00:02:10.750> screw<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.260> God<00:02:11.410> out<00:02:11.560> there<00:02:11.710> because<00:02:11.860> it's

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
same screw to God out there because it's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.240 
same screw to God out there because it's
different<00:02:12.460> of<00:02:12.700> all<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.000> other<00:02:13.150> ones<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.830> for

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
different of all the other ones so for

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.950 
different of all the other ones so for
that<00:02:15.400> one<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:16.330> pretty<00:02:16.600> careful<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.600> then<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
that one be pretty careful so then the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:30.090 
that one be pretty careful so then the
four<00:02:20.170> bottom<00:02:20.470> ones<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:29.080> then<00:02:29.380> just<00:02:29.650> take<00:02:29.920> your

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
four bottom ones so then just take your

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:39.360 
four bottom ones so then just take your
screwdriver<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.970> screw<00:02:31.240> them<00:02:31.360> all<00:02:31.570> in<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:39.130> be

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
screwdriver and screw them all in so be

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.780 
screwdriver and screw them all in so be
sure<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.970> break<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.720> screws<00:02:41.020> because<00:02:41.350> uh

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
sure to not break the screws because uh

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.790 
sure to not break the screws because uh
so<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.300> avoid<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.410> correct

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
so to avoid that have the correct

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.790 
so to avoid that have the correct
screwdriver<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.020> try<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.080> put<00:02:47.350> them<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.650> as

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
screwdriver and try to put them in as

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.980 
screwdriver and try to put them in as
careful<00:02:48.190> as<00:02:48.250> possible<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.570> don't<00:02:49.840> want

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
careful as possible so you don't want

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.850 
careful as possible so you don't want
this<00:02:50.110> crew<00:02:50.320> is<00:02:50.350> great<00:02:50.680> because<00:02:50.890> then<00:02:52.860> you

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
this crew is great because then you

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.940 
this crew is great because then you
can't<00:02:54.100> get<00:02:54.220> them<00:02:54.370> out<00:02:54.520> anymore<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:56.500> careful

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
can't get them out anymore so be careful

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:24.930 
can't get them out anymore so be careful
on<00:02:57.040> that<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.650> you'll<00:03:24.070> notice<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.730> four

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
on that so you'll notice that the four

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.400 
on that so you'll notice that the four
bottom<00:03:25.239> ones<00:03:25.390> are<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.660> most<00:03:25.720> annoying<00:03:25.959> that

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
bottom ones are the most annoying that

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.170 
bottom ones are the most annoying that
that's<00:03:26.950> why<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.220> took<00:03:27.280> me<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.670> most<00:03:27.820> of<00:03:28.000> time

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
that's why it took me the most of time

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.900 
that's why it took me the most of time
and<00:03:28.480> just<00:03:29.080> be<00:03:29.260> sure<00:03:29.500> they're<00:03:29.769> they're<00:03:30.489> not<00:03:30.519> too

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
and just be sure they're they're not too

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.660 
and just be sure they're they're not too
tight<00:03:31.269> but<00:03:31.630> just<00:03:32.140> okay<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.650> know<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.489> how

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
tight but just okay you know just how

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.710 
tight but just okay you know just how
you<00:03:33.700> found<00:03:34.000> them<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.610> again<00:03:36.970> be<00:03:37.120> sure<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.570> not

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
you found them so again be sure to not

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:59.990 
you found them so again be sure to not
break<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.140> screws

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.180 

so<00:04:01.000> again<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:01.450> need<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.630> good<00:04:01.840> screwdriver<00:04:02.440> i

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080

the<00:04:21.970> screws<00:04:22.560> now<00:04:23.560> it's<00:04:23.710> pretty<00:04:23.920> easy<00:04:24.040> just

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
the screws now it's pretty easy just

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.790 
the screws now it's pretty easy just

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
have to put it in the battery so to put

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.740 
have to put it in the battery so to put
in<00:04:26.920> the<00:04:27.070> battery<00:04:27.430> you<00:04:27.550> have<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.940> make<00:04:28.390> sure<00:04:28.420> the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
in the battery you have to make sure the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.960 
in the battery you have to make sure the
latch<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:28.930> totally<00:04:29.500> open<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.280> if<00:04:30.580> it's<00:04:30.760> closed

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
latch is totally open so if it's closed

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.850 
latch is totally open so if it's closed
the<00:04:31.210> battery<00:04:31.540> won't<00:04:31.720> going<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.260> don't<00:04:32.650> try<00:04:32.830> to

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
the battery won't going so don't try to

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.980 
the battery won't going so don't try to
force<00:04:33.160> just<00:04:33.760> first<00:04:34.150> check<00:04:34.360> if<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.600> latches

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
force just first check if the latches

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.980 
force just first check if the latches
open<00:04:37.650> then<00:04:38.650> just<00:04:38.920> put<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.400> bottom<00:04:39.730> here<00:04:39.990> put

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
the bottom of the battery in first and

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.890 
the bottom of the battery in first and
then<00:04:44.830> it<00:04:45.130> will<00:04:45.280> just<00:04:45.310> just<00:04:46.240> get<00:04:46.450> in<00:04:46.600> pretty

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
then it will just just get in pretty

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.330 
then it will just just get in pretty
easy<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.610> keep<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:48.850> latch<00:04:49.090> open<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:50.100> put<00:04:51.100> in

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
easy and keep that latch open to put in

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.190 
easy and keep that latch open to put in
the<00:04:51.490> back<00:04:51.640> cover<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:54.600> then<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:55.780> should<00:04:55.960> click

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
the back cover and then it should click

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.030 
the back cover and then it should click
and<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.830> latch<00:04:57.100> will<00:04:57.700> automatically<00:04:58.570> close

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
and the latch will automatically close

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.180 
and the latch will automatically close
so<00:05:01.140> going<00:05:02.140> to<00:05:02.230> load<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.530> camera<00:05:02.920> bit<00:05:03.870> so<00:05:05.190> now

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
so going to load the camera bit so now

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.180 
so going to load the camera bit so now
just<00:05:06.430> turn<00:05:06.910> over<00:05:06.940> your<00:05:07.450> mac<00:05:08.290> and<00:05:10.740> put<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:11.830> open

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
and put it back on so it's going to take

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.920 
and put it back on so it's going to take
a<00:05:14.860> little<00:05:15.460> going<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.330> take<00:05:16.450> a<00:05:16.480> little<00:05:16.630> longer

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
a little going to take a little longer

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.620 
a little going to take a little longer
than<00:05:17.230> usual<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:18.040> go<00:05:18.400> on<00:05:18.610> but<00:05:19.270> that's<00:05:19.480> because

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
than usual to go on but that's because

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.750 
than usual to go on but that's because
you<00:05:19.900> just<00:05:20.080> change<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.530> DRAM<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.580> that's

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
you just change the DRAM so that's

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.340 
you just change the DRAM so that's
pretty<00:05:21.940> normal<00:05:22.120> but<00:05:22.360> as<00:05:22.540> long<00:05:22.840> as<00:05:22.990> you<00:05:23.140> that

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
pretty normal but as long as you that

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.920 
pretty normal but as long as you that
noise<00:05:23.590> I<00:05:23.860> mean<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.610> sound<00:05:24.910> starting<00:05:25.810> up

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
noise I mean that sound starting up

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.020 
noise I mean that sound starting up

sound and the apple logo it should be

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.390 
sound and the apple logo it should be
all<00:05:28.180> good<00:05:31.200> for<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.290> RAM<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.680> took<00:05:32.860> out<00:05:33.070> be

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
all good for the RAM you took out be

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.090 
all good for the RAM you took out be
sure<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.790> keep<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.510> ram<00:05:35.050> if<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:35.770> still<00:05:35.980> have

sure to keep the ram if you still have

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.540 
sure to keep the ram if you still have
your<00:05:36.220> varun<00:05:36.550> T<00:05:36.700> on<00:05:37.140> your<00:05:38.140> Mac<00:05:38.350> you<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:39.190> your

mat breaks you need those Rams need

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.720 
mat breaks you need those Rams need
those<00:05:43.090> ramparts<00:05:43.960> if<00:05:44.800> you<00:05:44.980> want<00:05:45.160> to<00:05:45.250> replace

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
those ramparts if you want to replace

00:05:45.730 --> 00:06:07.580 
those ramparts if you want to replace
your<00:05:46.090> Mac<00:05:46.440> so

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.700 

so<00:06:08.590> we're<00:06:08.860> on<00:06:09.340> my<00:06:09.789> mac<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.360> just<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.169> check<00:06:11.409> if

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
so we're on my mac and just to check if

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.129 
so we're on my mac and just to check if
you're<00:06:12.129> correctly<00:06:12.669> inserted<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.330> RAM<00:06:13.509> go

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
you're correctly inserted the RAM go

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.170 
you're correctly inserted the RAM go
through<00:06:14.379> your<00:06:14.469> Apple<00:06:14.949> in<00:06:15.069> the<00:06:15.099> top<00:06:15.460> left

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
through your Apple in the top left

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.760 
through your Apple in the top left
corner<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.750> just<00:06:17.740> click<00:06:18.490> on<00:06:18.639> about<00:06:19.300> this<00:06:19.569> mac

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
corner and just click on about this mac

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.959 
corner and just click on about this mac
normally<00:06:20.770> there<00:06:21.099> should<00:06:21.250> be<00:06:21.400> the<00:06:21.520> amount<00:06:21.849> of

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
normally there should be the amount of

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.119 
normally there should be the amount of
RAM<00:06:22.210> your<00:06:22.389> edit<00:06:22.780> right<00:06:23.020> here<00:06:23.349> in<00:06:23.440> memory<00:06:23.770> for

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
RAM your edit right here in memory for

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.909 
RAM your edit right here in memory for
me<00:06:24.250> it's<00:06:24.400> for<00:06:24.430> gigs<00:06:24.849> of<00:06:25.090> ddr3<00:06:25.629> RAM<00:06:26.050> so<00:06:26.590> that<00:06:26.770> is

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
me it's for gigs of ddr3 RAM so that is

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.459 
me it's for gigs of ddr3 RAM so that is
totally<00:06:27.219> correct<00:06:27.430> if<00:06:28.120> you<00:06:28.479> only<00:06:28.629> see<00:06:28.900> two<00:06:29.139> gigs

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:29.469 
totally correct if you only see two gigs

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:32.640 
totally correct if you only see two gigs
and<00:06:29.710> you<00:06:29.740> answered<00:06:30.430> it<00:06:30.550> for<00:06:30.879> for<00:06:31.150> example<00:06:31.650> this

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
and you answered it for for example this

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.700 
and you answered it for for example this
can<00:06:33.490> have<00:06:33.639> two<00:06:33.819> possibilities<00:06:34.389> so<00:06:35.199> the<00:06:35.530> first

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
can have two possibilities so the first

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.740 
can have two possibilities so the first
possibility<00:06:36.280> is<00:06:36.520> obviously<00:06:36.969> that<00:06:37.270> you<00:06:37.419> didn't

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
possibility is obviously that you didn't

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.050 
possibility is obviously that you didn't
insert<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.169> top<00:06:38.560> one<00:06:38.770> correctly<00:06:39.190> or<00:06:39.430> the

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
insert the top one correctly or the

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.990 
insert the top one correctly or the
second<00:06:40.449> possibility<00:06:40.629> which<00:06:41.199> is<00:06:41.379> most

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
second possibility which is most

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.700 
second possibility which is most
frequent<00:06:43.000> to<00:06:43.090> occur<00:06:43.389> is<00:06:43.629> that<00:06:44.259> while

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
frequent to occur is that while

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.629 
frequent to occur is that while
inserting<00:06:45.400> the<00:06:45.669> top<00:06:45.940> ram<00:06:46.240> the<00:06:46.840> bottom<00:06:47.349> Ram

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
inserting the top ram the bottom Ram

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.360 
inserting the top ram the bottom Ram
popped<00:06:48.639> up<00:06:48.879> popped<00:06:49.509> out<00:06:50.110> so<00:06:50.529> that<00:06:50.650> means<00:06:50.860> well

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
popped up popped out so that means well

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.809 
popped up popped out so that means well
you<00:06:51.550> were<00:06:51.750> entering<00:06:52.750> the<00:06:52.900> second<00:06:53.349> ram<00:06:53.560> the<00:06:54.490> the

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:54.819 
you were entering the second ram the the

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:57.809 
you were entering the second ram the the
one<00:06:55.000> you<00:06:55.120> put<00:06:55.270> it<00:06:55.360> underneath<00:06:55.719> there<00:06:56.139> it<00:06:56.819> just

00:06:57.809 --> 00:06:57.819 
one you put it underneath there it just

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:02.279 
one you put it underneath there it just
removed<00:06:58.419> it<00:06:58.659> from<00:06:58.990> itself<00:06:59.319> because<00:06:59.889> you<00:07:01.289> those

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
removed it from itself because you those

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.559 
removed it from itself because you those
latches<00:07:02.740> remember<00:07:03.490> yeah<00:07:04.000> because<00:07:04.180> you

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:04.569 
latches remember yeah because you

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.570 
latches remember yeah because you
pressed<00:07:05.440> on<00:07:05.589> those<00:07:05.740> latches<00:07:05.949> at<00:07:06.310> the<00:07:06.400> same

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
pressed on those latches at the same

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.519 
pressed on those latches at the same
time<00:07:06.759> you<00:07:06.909> were<00:07:07.000> entered<00:07:07.300> the<00:07:07.389> second<00:07:07.839> one<00:07:07.930> the

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:08.529 
time you were entered the second one the

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:10.680 
time you were entered the second one the
first<00:07:08.560> one<00:07:08.889> popped<00:07:09.370> up<00:07:09.550> so<00:07:10.000> that<00:07:10.419> could<00:07:10.629> be

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
first one popped up so that could be

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.369 
first one popped up so that could be
also<00:07:10.960> a<00:07:11.379> problem<00:07:12.250> so<00:07:12.669> if<00:07:12.699> that<00:07:12.969> happens<00:07:13.599> you
