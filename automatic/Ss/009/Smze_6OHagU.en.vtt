 and that in the lap for action of the municipality of Teresina and knowing the teachers 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.259

 so as not to be bad 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.499
 much for us is of the utmost importance 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:03.249
 since we see college at school, it's because if we do not 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:08.599
 this impact on the school environment and college comes to 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.319
 very 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.029
 for us it is very different from the Syrian 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.229
 I'm an educator and I'm an educator. 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.949
 and see the importance and feel the need that our children 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:21.809
 have 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:23.729
 ovi silver wellington 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.629
