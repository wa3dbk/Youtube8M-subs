00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.910
 youtube channel is all in sulfur and we 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:15.900
 We understand the problem at number 175 right 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:19.439
 Do we look under the letter a 896 -269 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.369
 equal to 227 let's check whether this is true 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.789
 so let's count left to this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.789
 difference 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.750
 896 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.040
 -269 from the six nine deduct not 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.100
 we can take out of 16 subtract 9 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:47.160
 we get 7 out of nine occupied left 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.980
 eight of eight subtract six 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.730
 it turns out 2 here 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.280
 From the eight we deduct tw 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.629
 6 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:05.400
 this difference is 627 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.110
 and on the right 227 but these are different numbers 627 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.939
 and 327 are different numbers so here is not 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.460
 right 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.820
 incorrectly written would be wrong sometimes 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.060
 put sometimes strike out it's equal 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:25.070
 here is incorrect under letter and the answer is incorrect 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:32.509
 under the letter b 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:39.360
 so we have here 67 multiplied by 45 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:46.670
 so so so let's multiply 5 by 7 35 5 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:54.560
 write 3 in mind 5 by 6 30 further 3 by mind 33 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:57.119
 so counted 4 by 728 8 we write two in mind 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.750
 4 to 6 24 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:12.280
 further two in mind 26 count here 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:19.850
 five 3 + 8 is 11 1 we write 1 in mind 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:22.480
 1 in mind 3 to 6 to 9 to 1 in mind is 10 0 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.070
 write and here is 1 in mind 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:32.690
 2 to 1 in mind, this is three here 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:36.560
 the work gives us 3015 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:41.530
 and 2875 on the right but again these are not equal 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:45.950
 between themselves therefore wrong wrong 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:51.380
 because 3115 and 2875 is not the same thing 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:54.610
 so therefore wrong so let's go on 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.140
 see what we have there under the letter v 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.000
 at least one is right it will be interesting 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.140
 or all will look wrong 32 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.950
 multiply by 55 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.450
 let's multiply 5 by 210 0 we write 1 in 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.930
 mind 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:22.250
 5 by 3 to 8 dish say something 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:27.560
 5 to 2 is 10 0 we write 1 in mind 1 in mind 5 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:32.390
 by 3 it's 15 to 1 in 16 like this here 5 on 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:38.049
 2 is 10 0 we write 1 in mind 5 by 315 to 1 in 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.860
 mind 16 now add up here 06 to 06 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.519
 1 to 6 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.459
 it is 7 and here again something is not right 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.450
 look oh you can not see sorry 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.530
 sorry sorry you didn't see 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.760
 006 zero is six 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:01.820
 1 to 6 is 7 and here 1 it turns out that 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:08.000
 under the letter of 32 multiplied by 55 this is 1760 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:13.930
 and here 7400 8040 here 1760 and here 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.930
 7040 again wrong again wrong 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.340
 Well , now at hand will again 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.260
 wrong it will be generally funny let's 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:31.160
 We calculate that we have left it on the left 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:34.500
 us 1000 1 divide by 13 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.300
 it's on our left and on the right we have 100 minus 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.020
 23 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.139
 100 minus 23 let's do everything first 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.360
 on the right we calculate 100 minus 23 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.330
 here from 0 3 we can not live occupy 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.590
 here zero therefore we occupy further and 10 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.630
 subtract 3 it will be 7 here was zero 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.190
 from here they took therefore here 10 and from here 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.090
 took on so there are nine left 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.590
 nine minus two is seven 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.580
 it turns out that on the right we have 100 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:10.500
 minus 23 is 77 will it work out here 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:14.539
 77 let's see means 10 to 13 not 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.949
 divided therefore we will divide right away 113 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:22.020
 well, let's maybe 7 just 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:27.720
 take 7 by 320 11 we write two in mind 7 on 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:31.080
 17 to 2 in mind 9 if we subtract 91 from a hundred 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.210
 we get 9 how and how to calculate from 0 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.979
 9 of 0 1 cannot deduct therefore 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.010
 occupy further here is zero therefore 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:43.050
 take up further and 10 subtract 1 will be 9 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.870
 9 of 9 to subtract from 0 edinichki 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.320
 doing nothing left so 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:53.729
 ask edinichku 91 but again we take on 7 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:59.270
 7 for 13 already considered this 91 we already here 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:02.159
 I believe that 91 so well here is true 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.150
 means in this example only under the letter 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:08.729
 g right all the other letters are both and you are there 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.250
 we got this wrong 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.560
 the problem is all 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.080
 My name is Andrew Andreevich My channel on 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.669
 youtube all ru 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:22.039
 improve multiplication table necessarily 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.039
 learn well all bye
