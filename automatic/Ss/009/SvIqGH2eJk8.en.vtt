00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.279 
be back here on skydive radio let's see
today's<00:00:14.910> topic<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.670> today's<00:00:17.670> topic<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:18.180> about

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
today's topic and today's topic is about

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.460 
today's topic and today's topic is about
three<00:00:19.289> ring<00:00:19.529> systems<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:21.230> you<00:00:22.230> know<00:00:22.320> how

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
three ring systems that are you know how

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.790 
three ring systems that are you know how
some<00:00:22.769> are<00:00:23.210> reversed<00:00:24.210> yep<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.019> haven't<00:00:25.619> seen

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
some are reversed yep I haven't seen

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.290 
some are reversed yep I haven't seen
that<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> while<00:00:26.369> yeah<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.970> used<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> make

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
that for a while yeah we used to make

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.929 
that for a while yeah we used to make
them<00:00:27.480> actually<00:00:27.779> had<00:00:28.109> airtime<00:00:28.820> normally<00:00:29.820> on

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
them actually had airtime normally on

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.900 
them actually had airtime normally on
most<00:00:30.179> rigs<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.170> three<00:00:31.380> rings<00:00:31.700> but<00:00:32.700> on

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
most rigs you see the three rings but on

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.700 
most rigs you see the three rings but on
these<00:00:33.030> reverse<00:00:33.390> ones<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.230> kind<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
these reverse ones you just see kind of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.100 
these reverse ones you just see kind of
the<00:00:34.800> riser<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> top<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> them

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the riser going or at the top of them

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.639 
the riser going or at the top of them
yeah<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.640> can<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.760> talk<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> little<00:00:39.120> bit<00:00:39.329> about

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
yeah so can we talk a little bit about

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.979 
yeah so can we talk a little bit about
what<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> pros<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> cons<00:00:41.520> are<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.030> those<00:00:42.239> two

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
what the pros and cons are to those two

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.420 
what the pros and cons are to those two
different<00:00:43.260> systems<00:00:43.410> yeah<00:00:43.890> yeah<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.399> sure

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
different systems yeah yeah for sure

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.360 
different systems yeah yeah for sure
well<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.930> there's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.020> couple<00:00:46.350> issues<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.219> hit

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
well the there's a couple issues to hit

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430 
well the there's a couple issues to hit
one<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.629> when<00:00:48.780> you've<00:00:48.899> got<00:00:49.050> reverse

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
one is that when you've got reverse

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.439 
one is that when you've got reverse
risers<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.219> drag<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.670> rig<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.329> you're

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
risers and you drag your rig when you're

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.760 
risers and you drag your rig when you're
still<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.840> lines<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.440> you're<00:00:52.739> not

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
still in your lines like I do you're not

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.040 
still in your lines like I do you're not
rubbing<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.309> closing<00:00:53.789> loop<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.629> dirt<00:00:54.840> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
rubbing your closing loop on the dirt so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
rubbing your closing loop on the dirt so
that's<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.649> an<00:00:55.860> advantage<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:57.090> other

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that's that's an advantage the other

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
that's that's an advantage the other
advantage<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> reverse<00:00:58.350> risers<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
advantage of the reverse risers and the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.639 
advantage of the reverse risers and the
reason<00:00:59.550> why<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.329> chose<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.469> those

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
reason why we chose to do them all those

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
reason why we chose to do them all those
years<00:01:01.829> ago<00:01:02.190> when<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.609> built<00:01:02.820> quite<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> few<00:01:03.300> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
years ago when we built quite a few of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
years ago when we built quite a few of
them<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.010> now<00:01:05.010> you're<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.400> cutting<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
them is that now you're not cutting a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.350 
them is that now you're not cutting a
hole<00:01:06.150> through<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> riser<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.530> allow<00:01:07.799> that

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
hole through the riser to allow that

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
hole through the riser to allow that
that<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.600> closing<00:01:10.049> loop<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.320> pass<00:01:10.560> through

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that little closing loop to pass through

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.719 
that little closing loop to pass through
right<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.850> you've<00:01:12.000> got<00:01:12.110> more<00:01:13.130> more<00:01:14.130> area<00:01:14.549> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
right so you've got more more area of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.690 
right so you've got more more area of
webbing<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.750> technically<00:01:16.259> stronger<00:01:16.860> so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
webbing so it's technically stronger so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390 
webbing so it's technically stronger so
you<00:01:18.060> know<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.299> were<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> context<00:01:20.280> of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you know we were in the context of

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240 
you know we were in the context of
summarizer<00:01:21.000> breakage<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.100> we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
summarizer breakage back then and we

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
summarizer breakage back then and we
figured<00:01:23.549> well<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> answer<00:01:24.630> let's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
figured well this is the answer let's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.240 
figured well this is the answer let's
just<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.229> cut<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> hole<00:01:25.710> through<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.040> riser

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
just not cut a hole through the riser

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
just not cut a hole through the riser
let's<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.939> reverse<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.960> everything

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
let's just reverse it so that everything

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
let's just reverse it so that everything
can<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> inside<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:29.820> kind

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
can be on the inside and it's all kind

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.249 
can be on the inside and it's all kind
of<00:01:30.060> protected<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.200> felt<00:01:31.650> better<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
of protected that just felt better and

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.700 
of protected that just felt better and
then<00:01:34.259> somebody<00:01:35.070> had<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> bag<00:01:35.490> lock<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.710> then

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
then somebody had a bag lock and then

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
then somebody had a bag lock and then
their<00:01:38.070> belly<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> earth<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.030> they're

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
their belly to earth and they're

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
their belly to earth and they're
trailing<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.689> whole<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:41.009> cut

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
trailing the whole thing and they cut

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.950 
trailing the whole thing and they cut
away<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.299> parachute<00:01:42.720> doesn't<00:01:42.990> leave<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
away and the parachute doesn't leave and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
away and the parachute doesn't leave and
the<00:01:45.960> jumper<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.409> smart<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.979> ended<00:01:47.549> up

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the jumper was smart and ended up

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.960 
the jumper was smart and ended up
sitting<00:01:48.090> upright<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> left<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.220> we

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
sitting upright and then it left and we

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.389 
sitting upright and then it left and we
thought<00:01:51.149> about<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.479> went<00:01:51.600> oh<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> three

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
thought about it went oh so the three

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.969 
thought about it went oh so the three
ring<00:01:53.700> when<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.119> leaves<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.659> pivots<00:01:55.140> its<00:01:55.500> wings

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
ring when it leaves it pivots its wings

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.370 
ring when it leaves it pivots its wings
and<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.759> swinging<00:01:57.030> towards<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.049> pests

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and if it's swinging towards you pests

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
and if it's swinging towards you pests
pressing<00:01:58.860> against<00:01:59.280> your<00:01:59.399> shoulder<00:01:59.670> right

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
pressing against your shoulder right

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
want to go even though you've extracted

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.620 
want to go even though you've extracted
the<00:02:03.960> cables<00:02:04.469> you've<00:02:05.369> got<00:02:05.729> yourself<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.240> hang-up

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the cables you've got yourself a hang-up

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.139 
the cables you've got yourself a hang-up
now<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.160> hard<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.580> sit<00:02:08.970> up

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
now it's it's not that hard to sit up

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.340 
now it's it's not that hard to sit up
however<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:10.739> want<00:02:10.979> to

here in I porsi pointed it out and he

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
least he's trained he knows that in the

where<00:02:50.260> he's<00:02:50.740> still<00:02:51.010> belly<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.400> earth<00:02:51.430> that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
where he's still belly to earth that

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.880 
where he's still belly to earth that
he's<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.600> have<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.810> drop<00:02:53.200> his<00:02:53.410> knees<00:02:53.620> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
he's going to have to drop his knees so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.730 
he's going to have to drop his knees so
that<00:02:53.920> his<00:02:54.190> three-ring<00:02:54.760> releases<00:02:55.210> but<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.750> think

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
that his three-ring releases but I think

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.800 
that his three-ring releases but I think
there's<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:57.090> pretty<00:02:58.090> substantial

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
there's a pretty substantial

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.510 
there's a pretty substantial
justification<00:02:59.170> especially<00:02:59.980> now<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.250> we're

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
justification especially now that we're

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.070 
justification especially now that we're
adding<00:03:00.700> extra<00:03:01.120> layers<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.540> webbing<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:01.990> the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
adding extra layers of webbing in the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.990 
adding extra layers of webbing in the
traditional<00:03:02.620> risers<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.670> even<00:03:03.910> though

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
traditional risers that even though

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.640 
traditional risers that even though
you're<00:03:04.150> poking<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.540> hole<00:03:04.690> through<00:03:05.020> it<00:03:05.050> it's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
you're poking a hole through it it's

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.100 
you're poking a hole through it it's
still<00:03:05.920> plenty<00:03:06.850> strong<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.660> handle<00:03:08.020> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
still plenty strong to handle the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.230 
still plenty strong to handle the
largest<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.620> jumpers<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.190> if<00:03:09.520> you're<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:09.940> big

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
largest of jumpers and if you're so big

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.490 
largest of jumpers and if you're so big
that<00:03:10.270> you're<00:03:10.720> worried<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.110> your<00:03:11.230> risers

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
that you're worried that your risers

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.440 
that you're worried that your risers
going<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.980> break<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.520> can<00:03:12.670> always<00:03:12.820> use<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
going to break you can always use the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.990 
going to break you can always use the
wider<00:03:13.780> risers<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:14.530> your<00:03:15.280> recommendation

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
wider risers so your recommendation

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.430 
wider risers so your recommendation
would<00:03:16.060> be<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.300> go<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.960> standard

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
would be to go to the standard

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.390 
would be to go to the standard
forward-facing<00:03:17.920> riser<00:03:18.460> it<00:03:18.790> is<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.630> okay<00:03:20.400> Brian

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400
