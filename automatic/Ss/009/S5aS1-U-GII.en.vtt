00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
let's give it a try it's like a

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:46.390 
let's give it a try it's like a
davidsfarm<00:02:33.890> cold<00:02:34.280> start<00:02:36.640> here<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:37.790> go<00:02:42.880> yes<00:02:45.400> at

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
davidsfarm cold start here we go yes at

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.309 
davidsfarm cold start here we go yes at
first<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.910> was<00:02:47.120> really<00:02:47.239> frustrated<00:02:47.510> because

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
first I was really frustrated because

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.050 
first I was really frustrated because
the<00:02:51.040> starter<00:02:52.040> wouldn't<00:02:52.310> turn<00:02:52.459> over<00:02:52.519> just<00:02:52.970> I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
the starter wouldn't turn over just I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.890 
the starter wouldn't turn over just I
heard<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.620> fender<00:02:54.620> side<00:02:54.920> solenoid<00:02:55.819> click<00:02:56.209> so

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
heard that fender side solenoid click so

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.110 
heard that fender side solenoid click so
I<00:02:56.930> went<00:02:57.170> down<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.920> pigtail<00:02:58.400> was<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:58.970> not

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
I went down and the pigtail was just not

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.809 
I went down and the pigtail was just not
tight<00:02:59.450> enough<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.959> I<00:03:00.079> tightened<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.819> and

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
tight enough so I tightened it and

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.600 
tight enough so I tightened it and
apparently<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.170> was<00:03:03.290> enough<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:04.190> get<00:03:04.459> it

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
apparently that was enough to get it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.610 
apparently that was enough to get it
enough<00:03:04.849> amperage<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.900> turn<00:03:06.260> over<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.590> motor

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
enough amperage to turn over the motor

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.340 
enough amperage to turn over the motor
