strongest plan to cut two tomato plants

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.259 
strongest plan to cut two tomato plants
off<00:00:28.019> at<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> base<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
off at the base and I just out of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.120 
off at the base and I just out of
curiosity<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.990> stuck<00:00:31.550> those<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:33.239> cuttings<00:00:33.809> in

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
curiosity I stuck those two cuttings in

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.639 
curiosity I stuck those two cuttings in
water<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.030> only<00:00:36.270> been<00:00:36.450> about<00:00:36.510> 11<00:00:37.410> it's

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
water and it's only been about 11 it's

water and it's only been about 11 it's
been<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:37.950> living<00:00:38.399> days<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.360> look<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.629> look

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
been about living days and look at look

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.470 
been about living days and look at look
at<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> amount<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.379> roots<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.920> are<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.190> this

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
at the amount of roots that are on this

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.520 
at the amount of roots that are on this
on<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.870> two<00:00:43.670> cuttings<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:45.289> that's<00:00:46.289> pretty

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
on these two cuttings here that's pretty

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.029 
on these two cuttings here that's pretty
amazing<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:47.129> quickly<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:49.410> tomato<00:00:49.739> plant

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
amazing how quickly the tomato plant

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.110 
amazing how quickly the tomato plant
puts<00:00:50.309> out<00:00:50.460> roots<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:52.760> propagating<00:00:53.760> tomato

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
puts out roots so propagating tomato

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
puts out roots so propagating tomato
plant<00:00:54.420> cuttings<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> pet<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
plant cuttings if you want to pet you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
plant cuttings if you want to pet you
ate<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> tomato<00:00:57.149> plant<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:58.199> seems<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:58.920> easy

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
ate a tomato plant it seems pretty easy

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.189 
ate a tomato plant it seems pretty easy
seems<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> no-brainer<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.600> another

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
seems to be a no-brainer and another

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.740 
seems to be a no-brainer and another
thing<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.700> sort<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.939> example<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
thing is this is sort of example if you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.410 
thing is this is sort of example if you
have<00:01:06.780> tomato<00:01:07.260> plants<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.970> grew<00:01:09.240> under

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
have tomato plants that you grew under

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.130 
have tomato plants that you grew under
grow<00:01:09.720> lights<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.680> left<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.780> their<00:01:12.780> cells

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
grow lights or you left in their cells

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.969 
grow lights or you left in their cells
too<00:01:13.470> long<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.220> sort<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.729> grew<00:01:15.000> leggy

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
too long and they sort of grew leggy

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
too long and they sort of grew leggy
this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.159> why<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.450> take<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.049> tomato

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
this is why you you can take the tomato

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.210 
this is why you you can take the tomato
plant<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.090> bury<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.479> lot<00:01:21.720> deeper<00:01:22.049> than<00:01:25.220> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
plant and bury it a lot deeper than the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
plant and bury it a lot deeper than the
way<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.400> exists<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.960> cell<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.680> it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
way it exists in the cell when it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.510 
way it exists in the cell when it
sprouted<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.400> it'll<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.360> form<00:01:30.990> roots<00:01:31.520> all

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
sprouted and it'll just form roots all

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.910 
sprouted and it'll just form roots all
along<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.840> stem<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.439> you've<00:01:34.619> buried

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
along that that stem that you've buried

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.819 
along that that stem that you've buried
and<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> lot<00:01:36.210> stronger<00:01:36.990> plant<00:01:37.500> because

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
and you get a lot stronger plant because

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.080 
and you get a lot stronger plant because
it<00:01:37.979> has<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.430> more<00:01:38.460> routes<00:01:39.110> along<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.530> stem

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
it has a lot more routes along that stem

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
it has a lot more routes along that stem
so<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.540> an<00:01:42.750> example<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.380> how<00:01:43.530> easy

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so this is just an example of how easy

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.580 
so this is just an example of how easy
it<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> propagate<00:01:45.079> tomato<00:01:46.079> plant<00:01:46.380> cuttings

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it is to propagate tomato plant cuttings

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.859 
it is to propagate tomato plant cuttings
by<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.189> placing<00:01:47.399> them<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.820> water<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.689> is

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
by just placing them in water so this is

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.260 
by just placing them in water so this is
New<00:01:51.990> England<00:01:52.320> gardening

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.170
