00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.000
 walking by providence in one of 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.970
 those old galleries near the 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.700
 metro manuel montt we find sighs 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.130
 from spain where Laurean says he has the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.189
 most reliable chocolate recipe 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.220
 Madrid hot as says 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.550
 The thick chocolate from Madrid is 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.500
 It 's like that but chocolate is thick 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.810
 the more to spoon for better this 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.970
 chocolate already comes with espresso before the 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.730
 express before they put it in the factory I think 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.280
 which is how the dream makes Saturn 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.540
 dissolves in milk or water a taste of 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.540
 each one also I prefer it with 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.600
 milk and when boiling just when you 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.670
 it breaks the boil there is excess like a good 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.890
 Spanish recommends consuming it in a 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.950
 cold morning for example and of course 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.590
 with freshly made churros the idea is that 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.210
 when the churro slather it impregnates of 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.219
 chocolate 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.809
 another option is to prepare it at home 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.870
 brand pump nothing brought directly 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.660
 from France these three are offered 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.050
 formats and listen to the tips for 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.860
 enjoy it 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.840
 ml of milk and 25 grams of product 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.940
 let's get a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 Thick important is to keep in mind that 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.460
 It can also be prepared with milk 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.190
 skim we revolve that was 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.799
 so that no lumps as it is 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.100
 serve at least 5 minutes the idea is 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.190
 form a hot mousse 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.620
 look at the texture of chocolate 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.290
 if you want to innovate more propose to place 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.360
 a mint syrup for example the fed 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.850
 has also incorporated its offer of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.520
 refined chocolates this range of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.340
 products to enjoy at home the idea 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.190
 is to realize the strength that cocoa has 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 African plus the subtlety of flavors 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.210
 and Aaron who has the sovereign cocoa 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.390
 they have four varieties in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.210
 presentations of 400 grams classic 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.300
 Irish cream with spices like 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.340
 orange and one that surely will not generate 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 faults without sugar 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.750
 another option is this palette that 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.920
 dip in a cup of hot milk or 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.440
 also in coffee that is a kind of 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.600
 chocolate that serves to 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.300
 and enjoy a coffee or milk alone 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.580
 hit while stirring until it 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.340
 dissolve a real special pleasure 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.160
 for this time that well prepared is 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.040
 can enjoy in a restaurant or in your 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.040
