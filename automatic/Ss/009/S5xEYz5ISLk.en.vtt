 will call on the head the name of the shoulders and 54 years 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.890
 especially you never prepare 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.960

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.860

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.810
 [music] 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.030
 remembered a long story how can you 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.010
 will tell you it came to my mind 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.650
 which recently recalled you know everything 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.900
 something from his childhood remember something 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.120
 especially bright and recently I realized that I 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.520
 remembered one apparently very bright moments 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.470
 its very very very early childhood 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.370
 when i'm looking for crawling we lived then 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.309
 asbestos 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.270
 father was military and here is 1 in winter he 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.940
 comes home 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.920
 about military leather boots 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.320
 passes the corridor of my room 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.930
 go into the room I was then looking for quite 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.930
 turkey walk could not only crawled and 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.630
 now my name is i remember this moment to 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.850
 body as though now I see crawl 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.160
 regiment feeling row wedge others smell 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.560
 there I see these fathers military boots 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.840
 kirzachi I understand I smile terribly 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.700
 send a live mustache face then he is not yet 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.250
 shaved mustache vegetable mustache dad 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.720
 disgusting and I remembered it and then 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.310
 it turned out that this moment 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.750
 photographed at home so far 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.720
 lies a picture of where these will hold me 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.550
 on my hands to give everything and I'm near diaper 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.550
 I also smile such a story 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.730
 in fact it is bright that is clear 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.520
 dreams right that terribly terribly want 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.950
 exercise one i would like 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 ride on the ship of the eighteenth 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
 seventeenth century around the world 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.000
 yes very very difficult and in compliance 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.800
 but it seems to me that if I have to 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.410
 you can work on it 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.390
 like and or let him dream your 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.030
 it doesn't matter how good it will be 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.590
 the ship is equipped you can cram in there 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.540
 modern equipment to be 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.680
 itâ€™s safe to look like 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.300
 creams Will be cool is not quite 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.520
 depressed and in fact you have not seen but 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.860
 she was forced here by the sea-doo for a long time herself 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.720
 lay that but as soon as they started shooting in 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
 and oh on the background of the queen she decided that this 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.840
 not for her she jumped like that 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.730
 by doing something else I drove here and I am so plain 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.860
 often sara did you see this posture about it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.360
 all the same all the same resigned 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.540
 about the first game that I tried 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.609
 on the computer this story was told 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.760
 already many times but in many others 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.120
 resources and videos not via so therefore now 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.799
 I think you can answer this question 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.920
 my first game so far was 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.200
 warcraft 2 neighbor has the same asbestos 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.780
 to the computer he often invited me 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.819
 to play together we played stupid 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.220
 by the way newcomers recently found this 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.010
 quest and most likely show you it and 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.769
 warcraft terribly terribly loved warcraft 2 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.139
 shit in general all his you his father's right 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.430
 from taking save and crap there game 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.269
 it was fun and then actually 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.269
 first fell in love 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.300
 The most excellent question I did not help 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.300
