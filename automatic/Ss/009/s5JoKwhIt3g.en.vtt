00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
go okay the battery in the sim card are

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.010 
go okay the battery in the sim card are
not<00:02:34.510> here<00:02:35.340> mobile<00:02:36.340> phone<00:02:36.840> model<00:02:37.840> SGH<00:02:38.080> t<00:02:39.270> 679<00:02:40.270> so

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
not here mobile phone model SGH t 679 so

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.600 
not here mobile phone model SGH t 679 so
the<00:02:41.320> I'm<00:02:41.590> guessing<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> sim<00:02:42.100> card<00:02:42.130> goes<00:02:42.430> here

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
the I'm guessing a sim card goes here

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.420 
the I'm guessing a sim card goes here
battery<00:02:42.940> goes<00:02:43.060> here<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.540> let's<00:02:44.280> find<00:02:45.280> this

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
battery goes here so let's find this

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.220 
battery goes here so let's find this
stuff<00:02:46.740> up<00:02:48.540> merchandise<00:02:49.540> return<00:02:50.200> label<00:02:50.560> slice

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
stuff up merchandise return label slice

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.590 
stuff up merchandise return label slice
ah<00:02:53.910> here<00:02:54.910> we<00:02:54.940> go<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.570> sim<00:02:56.110> card<00:02:57.180> push<00:02:58.180> here<00:02:58.450> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
ah here we go the sim card push here to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.420 
ah here we go the sim card push here to
detach<00:02:58.960> sim<00:03:00.030> ok<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.920> went<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:02.980> break<00:03:03.160> this<00:03:03.370> thing

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
detach sim ok I went on break this thing

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.980 
detach sim ok I went on break this thing
never<00:03:04.000> actually<00:03:04.210> worked<00:03:04.480> with<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.780> sim<00:03:04.960> card

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
never actually worked with the sim card

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.950 
never actually worked with the sim card
before<00:03:05.610> ok<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.120> we<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.870> little<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.960> guess

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
before ok so we have this little I guess

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.950 
before ok so we have this little I guess
thing<00:03:12.150> camera<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.210> not<00:03:13.240> focusing<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:13.870> it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
thing camera is not focusing on it

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.150 
thing camera is not focusing on it
whatever<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:14.920> I'm<00:03:15.370> assuming<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.270> goes<00:03:16.510> in

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
whatever so I'm assuming this goes in

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:27.210 
whatever so I'm assuming this goes in
like<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:19.890> perhaps<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:25.590> can<00:03:26.590> only<00:03:26.770> assume<00:03:26.980> that

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
like this perhaps I can only assume that

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.640 
like this perhaps I can only assume that
is<00:03:28.020> incorrectly<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:31.440> don't<00:03:32.440> know<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.530> guess

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
is incorrectly I don't know I guess

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.270 
is incorrectly I don't know I guess
