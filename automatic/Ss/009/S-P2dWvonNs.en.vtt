00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:34.099
 Come on, help me, I can not say you 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:34.099
 lose everything clearly 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.000
 tomorrow heinrich tomorrow 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:54.670
 I read a big story 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:58.840
 I think it's good that's good 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:04.150
 dangerous but I'm pretty good 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.950
 honestly what should I say I think so 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.979
 a bit sentimental 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.979
 American good and evil clearly separated 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:22.180
 in the first story there you mean 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:24.070
 your mother me or maybe and 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.330
 this old grossman with the home around 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.330
 to then so I to be around 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.740
 if you someday part of the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.740
 want to hear truth that christians 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:54.020
 you leave this box I have everything 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.380
 Seen what I'm interested in 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.130
 bucket totally obscured is overlooked that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.750
 someone comes to me theater i want 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:11.590
 best ladies on the way the super license 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.590
 set of technics 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:29.890
 I just want to lie here and 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:29.890
 read criticizes americans great 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.910
 the short story guest was reading 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.090
 you could be on 18 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.739
 that's not all that great anymore 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.630
 Can you go the judgment 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.600
 yes, I can do that as well 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.049
 fantasy is often more exciting is reality 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.049
 That's why I love literature 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:20.080
 if women 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.709
 eyecolour: Blue 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.709
 but good or 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.709
 OK 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.150
 nene with the names of a friend 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:36.870
 the internat there was not even leon 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.570
 it was a kindergarten pretty good at it 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.530
 So what will be a true course 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.950
 This is littered today on the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.950
 boys up 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.160
 no longer meet big brother 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.610
 now nothing of my still 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.860
 sister 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.130
 but no matter what she feels or what 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.130
 I want that after the dramatic 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.010
 this was 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.400
 you have you 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.850
 Castro 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.229
 frances cellar where the devil are you in 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.229
 on the way 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.100
 I want the desert 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.249
 time that we have a little girl with you 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.299
 which he was traveling 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.299
 I like that 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.009
 not every father at 7 at his 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.299
 child sits on the edge of the bed therefore 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.609
 inevitably a good father 

00:04:57.299 --> 00:05:01.609
 you're what would be let 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.810
 We liked the conclusion that our school 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.210
 said to me that I experience that 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.210
 the journey the minus 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.879
 that is probably not done that 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.879
 grow up
