00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.000 
batteries you can pull out which I kind
of<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> dies<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.320> job<00:01:01.559> site<00:01:01.829> you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
of like if it dies on the job site you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.270 
of like if it dies on the job site you
can<00:01:02.600> plug<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> back<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.229> charge<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
can plug it back in and charge it and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
can plug it back in and charge it and
keep<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.780> has<00:01:12.780> the

keep going so this is it it has the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.490 
keep going so this is it it has the
receiver<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:17.490> actually<00:01:18.049> removes<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
receiver here that actually removes and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
receiver here that actually removes and
you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:21.470> turn<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.770> remotely<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> what

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you can turn it on remotely this is what

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.039 
you can turn it on remotely this is what
I<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.560> everything<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.310> here

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
I really like is everything is on here

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.170 
I really like is everything is on here
all<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.619> controls<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.340> there's<00:01:29.729> literally

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
all your controls is there's literally

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.030 
all your controls is there's literally
no<00:01:30.479> buttons<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:32.329> which<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> actually

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
no buttons on here which is actually

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
no buttons on here which is actually
kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.220> good<00:01:35.430> deterrent<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:36.869> because

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
kind of a good deterrent as well because

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.370 
kind of a good deterrent as well because
if<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> steal<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.840> got<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.140> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
if you steal that you got to have this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.499 
if you steal that you got to have this
thing<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.640> doesn't<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.030> work<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
thing so it doesn't really work so you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.990 
thing so it doesn't really work so you
can<00:01:45.630> either<00:01:45.780> turn<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.159> or

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
can either turn it on with this in it or

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.730 
can either turn it on with this in it or
you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.360> pull<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.649> hit

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
you can pull it out and then you can hit

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.499 
you can pull it out and then you can hit
the<00:01:49.860> power<00:01:50.100> button<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:51.000> within<00:01:51.270> 30

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the power button and I think within 30

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.660 
the power button and I think within 30
minutes<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> hit<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> power<00:01:52.560> button

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
minutes if you hit the power button

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.090 
minutes if you hit the power button
it'll<00:01:53.670> turn<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.649> it's<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:57.500> we<00:01:58.500> will<00:01:58.740> shut

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it'll turn on so it's on we will shut

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.639 
it'll turn on so it's on we will shut
off<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.829> sound<00:02:03.049> but<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.170> does<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.500> two

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
off the sound but it does have two

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.050 
off the sound but it does have two
different<00:02:04.890> settings<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.369> thing<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.640> really

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
different settings one thing I really

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.609 
different settings one thing I really
like<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.049> receiver<00:02:07.439> actually<00:02:07.619> tells<00:02:08.129> you

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
like is the receiver actually tells you

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
like is the receiver actually tells you
how<00:02:10.619> much<00:02:10.860> you're<00:02:11.069> off<00:02:11.310> from<00:02:11.700> grade<00:02:11.970> down<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.480> I

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
how much you're off from grade down to I

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.820 
how much you're off from grade down to I
believe<00:02:12.900> about<00:02:13.230> two<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
believe about two and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.970 
believe about two and
is<00:02:15.080> now<00:02:16.080> an<00:02:16.200> inch<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.560> 3/4<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.800> you're

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
is now an inch and 3/4 so if you're

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.500 
is now an inch and 3/4 so if you're
above<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.430> below<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:20.850> if<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:20.970> set<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.330> if

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
above or below so if you set you if

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.880 
above or below so if you set you if
you're<00:02:21.660> close<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.900> great<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> said<00:02:22.770> it

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
you're close to great and you said it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.710 
you're close to great and you said it
and<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.700> know<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.940> lands<00:02:24.150> right<00:02:24.360> there<00:02:24.570> you

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
and you know it lands right there you

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.820 
and you know it lands right there you
know<00:02:24.840> you're<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> half<00:02:25.260> inch

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
know you're a half inch

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.440 
know you're a half inch
you<00:02:26.100> go<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> half<00:02:26.490> inch<00:02:26.730> down<00:02:26.940> that's<00:02:27.180> really

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
you go a half inch down that's really

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.530 
you go a half inch down that's really
nice

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.710 

this<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.200> calibrate<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.280> if<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.270> drop

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
this is to calibrate it so if you drop

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.240 
this is to calibrate it so if you drop
it<00:02:36.960> or<00:02:37.050> something<00:02:37.440> it'll<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:37.890> come<00:02:38.190> up

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
it or something it'll actually come up

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.070 
it or something it'll actually come up
on<00:02:38.490> here<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.820> say<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.150> need<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.600> recalibrate

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
on here and say you need to recalibrate

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.410 
on here and say you need to recalibrate
so<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.710> can<00:02:40.860> do<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:41.550> follow

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
so you can do that and you just follow

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.170 
so you can do that and you just follow
the<00:02:42.480> directions<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> booklet<00:02:43.760> that's<00:02:44.760> for

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the directions in the booklet that's for

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.480 
the directions in the booklet that's for
your<00:02:45.420> sound<00:02:46.820> this<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.120> change<00:02:48.420> how<00:02:49.490> close

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
your sound this is to change how close

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.750 
your sound this is to change how close
our<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:51.900> tolerances<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.430> got<00:02:53.610> three

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
our up tolerances and it's got three

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.110 
our up tolerances and it's got three
settings<00:02:54.330> which<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.630> nice<00:02:54.840> an<00:02:55.140> eighth<00:02:56.120> quarter

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
settings which is nice an eighth quarter

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.850 
settings which is nice an eighth quarter
and<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.930> half<00:02:58.170> inch<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.550> when<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.860> raise

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
and a half inch so that when you raise

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.380 
and a half inch so that when you raise
it<00:03:02.040> through<00:03:02.310> it'll<00:03:02.700> tell<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.180> you're

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
it through it'll tell you if you're

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.300 
it through it'll tell you if you're
within<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:06.590> also<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:07.770> increments

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
within that so and also your increments

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.720 
within that so and also your increments
of<00:03:08.400> what<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.610> tells<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:11.100> screen<00:03:11.520> which

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
of what it tells you on the screen which

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.690 
of what it tells you on the screen which
is<00:03:11.760> nice<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:13.190> usually<00:03:14.190> keep<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.459> at<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.640> quarter

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
is nice I usually keep it at a quarter

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.449 
is nice I usually keep it at a quarter
this<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.300> put<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.570> sleep<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.190> hold

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
this you can put to sleep so you hold

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.979 
this you can put to sleep so you hold
this<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:23.400> little<00:03:23.489> Z's<00:03:23.820> come<00:03:24.060> up<00:03:24.239> laser

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
this and the little Z's come up laser

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.009 
this and the little Z's come up laser
stock<00:03:25.320> rotating<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:27.239> that's<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.930> know

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
stock rotating so that's just you know

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.570 
stock rotating so that's just you know
if<00:03:28.140> you're<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:28.380> using<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.100> can<00:03:29.310> do<00:03:29.400> that

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
if you're not using it you can do that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.210 
if you're not using it you can do that
it<00:03:29.730> also<00:03:30.120> will<00:03:30.690> hold<00:03:30.989> your<00:03:31.200> slope<00:03:31.680> which<00:03:32.070> I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
it also will hold your slope which I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.460 
it also will hold your slope which I
really<00:03:32.580> like<00:03:32.730> because<00:03:32.760> my<00:03:33.060> old<00:03:33.300> one<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:34.230> shut

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
really like because my old one you shut

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.160 
really like because my old one you shut
it<00:03:34.500> off<00:03:34.739> or<00:03:35.250> anything<00:03:35.570> you<00:03:36.570> lose<00:03:36.720> your<00:03:36.930> slope

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
it off or anything you lose your slope

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.920 
it off or anything you lose your slope
you<00:03:37.290> have<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.739> all<00:03:37.830> over<00:03:37.860> again<00:03:38.190> so

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
you have to do it all over again so

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.410 
you have to do it all over again so
that's<00:03:39.930> nice<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:41.850> hold<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.060> by<00:03:42.300> and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
that's nice so you just hold that by and

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.380 
that's nice so you just hold that by and
again<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:44.550> spin<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:46.550> that<00:03:47.550> is<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:48.120> your

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
again and you spin it that is for your

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.830 
again and you spin it that is for your
anti-theft<00:03:49.790> one<00:03:50.790> thing<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.180> really<00:03:51.630> like

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
anti-theft one thing that I really like

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840 
anti-theft one thing that I really like
because<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.739> my<00:03:52.890> job<00:03:53.130> sites<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.519> lot<00:03:53.670> by

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
because I'm on my job sites a lot by

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:02.050 
because I'm on my job sites a lot by
myself<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:55.500> let<00:03:55.590> me<00:03:55.680> put<00:03:55.830> this<00:03:55.950> in<00:03:56.130> here

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.259 

and<00:04:03.060> I'll<00:04:04.049> turn<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.409> audio<00:04:04.560> back<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:08.269> all

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
and I'll turn the audio back on all

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.569 
and I'll turn the audio back on all
right<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.140> one<00:04:10.409> thing<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:10.829> like<00:04:11.219> is<00:04:13.579> the

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
right so one thing that I like is the

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.729 
right so one thing that I like is the
laser<00:04:14.909> will<00:04:15.750> actually<00:04:16.320> find<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:18.650> when<00:04:19.650> you

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
laser will actually find you when you

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.680 
laser will actually find you when you
need<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.919> set<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.220> your<00:04:20.340> pitch<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.180> can<00:04:21.570> do

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
need to set up your pitch so you can do

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.350 
need to set up your pitch so you can do
it<00:04:21.870> if<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.470> watch<00:04:22.710> my<00:04:22.979> old<00:04:23.550> videos<00:04:23.759> of<00:04:24.030> how<00:04:24.300> to

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
it if you watch my old videos of how to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.029 
it if you watch my old videos of how to
set<00:04:24.600> up<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.750> laser<00:04:24.900> level<00:04:25.320> with<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.470> pitch<00:04:25.710> you

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
set up a laser level with a pitch you

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.700 
set up a laser level with a pitch you
can<00:04:26.910> see<00:04:27.539> that<00:04:27.690> video<00:04:27.960> playing<00:04:28.169> in<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.410> corner

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
can see that video playing in the corner

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.870 
can see that video playing in the corner
if<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.860> want<00:04:29.009> to<00:04:29.100> watch<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:31.520> explain<00:04:32.520> a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
if you want to watch that explain a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.670 
if you want to watch that explain a
little<00:04:33.300> bit<00:04:33.539> in<00:04:33.720> depth<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.229> what<00:04:34.410> I'm<00:04:34.500> talking

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
little bit in depth of what I'm talking

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.379 
little bit in depth of what I'm talking
about<00:04:34.889> now<00:04:35.220> but<00:04:35.490> when<00:04:35.789> you<00:04:35.849> set<00:04:36.030> up<00:04:36.060> your<00:04:36.150> laser

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
about now but when you set up your laser

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.719 
about now but when you set up your laser
for<00:04:36.599> a<00:04:36.660> pitch<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.229> can<00:04:37.860> tell<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.280> go<00:04:38.400> up<00:04:38.580> or

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
for a pitch you can tell it to go up or

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.939 
for a pitch you can tell it to go up or
down<00:04:38.759> to<00:04:39.060> find<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.389> laser<00:04:39.660> just<00:04:40.530> like<00:04:40.680> my<00:04:40.800> old

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
down to find the laser just like my old

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.460 
down to find the laser just like my old
one<00:04:41.190> but<00:04:41.550> if<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:42.539> hold<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:42.960> button<00:04:45.470> it'll

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
one but if you hold this button it'll

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.980 
one but if you hold this button it'll
actually<00:04:46.710> if<00:04:47.460> you<00:04:47.550> by<00:04:47.729> yourself<00:04:48.300> see<00:04:48.780> on<00:04:48.870> my

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
actually if you by yourself see on my

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.900 
actually if you by yourself see on my
old<00:04:49.229> one<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.560> had<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.770> be<00:04:49.889> over<00:04:50.280> by<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.520> laser

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
old one you had to be over by the laser

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.390 
old one you had to be over by the laser
one<00:04:51.300> person<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.020> other<00:04:52.050> person<00:04:52.340> had<00:04:53.340> to

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
one person and the other person had to

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.710 
one person and the other person had to
be<00:04:53.460> holding<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.910> laser<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.360> had<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.599> get

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
be holding the laser you had to get

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.990 
be holding the laser you had to get
creative<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.349> hold<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.770> prop<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.490> up<00:04:56.699> against

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
creative and hold it prop it up against

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.140 
creative and hold it prop it up against
something<00:04:59.599> this<00:05:00.599> will<00:05:01.410> actually<00:05:02.190> rotate<00:05:02.789> the

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
something this will actually rotate the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.200 
something this will actually rotate the
laser<00:05:03.389> beam<00:05:03.660> up<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.050> down<00:05:04.229> until<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.710> finds

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
laser beam up and down until it finds

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.770 
laser beam up and down until it finds
the<00:05:06.210> receiver<00:05:06.630> itself<00:05:07.349> which<00:05:07.680> is<00:05:07.860> really<00:05:08.159> cool

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
the receiver itself which is really cool

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.520 
the receiver itself which is really cool
it<00:05:09.780> does<00:05:10.020> take<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:11.570> little<00:05:12.570> bit<00:05:12.930> it's<00:05:13.199> not<00:05:13.380> too

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
it does take a little bit it's not too

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.230 
it does take a little bit it's not too
long<00:05:13.770> but<00:05:15.710> it's<00:05:16.710> nice<00:05:17.070> because<00:05:17.099> it<00:05:17.729> will<00:05:17.880> find

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
long but it's nice because it will find

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.360 
long but it's nice because it will find
it<00:05:18.449> so<00:05:19.169> you<00:05:19.229> really<00:05:19.289> only<00:05:19.590> need<00:05:19.650> one<00:05:19.889> person

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
it so you really only need one person

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.740 
it so you really only need one person
which<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:20.639> nice<00:05:20.849> so<00:05:23.300> there<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.419> go<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:24.720> just

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
which is nice so there you go so just

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.960 
which is nice so there you go so just
started<00:05:25.199> picking<00:05:25.470> it<00:05:25.560> up<00:05:28.070> so<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.220> moves<00:05:29.550> quick

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
started picking it up so it moves quick

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.330 
started picking it up so it moves quick
until<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.419> finds<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:31.310> receiver<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.610> then

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
until it finds the receiver and then

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.290 
until it finds the receiver and then
goes<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.370> little<00:05:35.520> bit<00:05:35.789> slower<00:05:36.090> but<00:05:37.220> they'll

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
goes a little bit slower but they'll

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.210 
goes a little bit slower but they'll
move<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.360> stick<00:05:42.740> we<00:05:43.740> don't<00:05:43.889> need<00:05:43.949> to<00:05:44.039> listen

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
move the stick we don't need to listen

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.870 
move the stick we don't need to listen
for<00:05:44.370> that

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.879 

you

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.860 

you

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.850 

okay<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.380> we<00:06:06.130> are<00:06:06.780> locked<00:06:07.780> in<00:06:08.020> so<00:06:08.590> that<00:06:08.710> took

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
okay so we are locked in so that took

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.100 
okay so we are locked in so that took
about<00:06:09.100> I'd<00:06:09.880> say<00:06:10.120> a<00:06:10.150> minute<00:06:10.600> or<00:06:10.720> minute<00:06:10.870> and<00:06:11.080> a

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
about I'd say a minute or minute and a

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.370 
about I'd say a minute or minute and a
half<00:06:11.290> to<00:06:11.470> do<00:06:11.650> but<00:06:12.040> it's<00:06:12.669> really<00:06:13.060> nice<00:06:13.380> when

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
half to do but it's really nice when

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.300 
half to do but it's really nice when
you're<00:06:14.710> by<00:06:14.830> yourself<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:15.490> it<00:06:15.580> also<00:06:15.729> tells<00:06:16.090> you

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
you're by yourself and it also tells you

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.180 
you're by yourself and it also tells you
your<00:06:18.310> percent<00:06:18.729> slope<00:06:19.680> that's<00:06:20.680> another<00:06:20.919> thing

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
your percent slope that's another thing

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.400 
your percent slope that's another thing
I<00:06:21.280> like<00:06:21.580> is<00:06:23.699> using<00:06:24.699> this<00:06:24.880> when<00:06:25.419> you<00:06:25.540> change<00:06:25.900> you

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
I like is using this when you change you

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.860 
I like is using this when you change you
can<00:06:26.530> just<00:06:26.710> change<00:06:26.979> your<00:06:27.190> slope<00:06:27.510> so<00:06:28.510> as<00:06:28.660> long<00:06:28.780> as

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
can just change your slope so as long as

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.659 
can just change your slope so as long as
you<00:06:28.960> figure<00:06:29.169> out<00:06:29.320> your<00:06:29.560> slope<00:06:29.889> calculation

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
you figure out your slope calculation

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.310 
you figure out your slope calculation
you<00:06:31.419> can<00:06:31.449> just<00:06:31.720> change<00:06:31.960> it<00:06:32.199> right<00:06:32.380> here<00:06:34.320> so

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
you can just change it right here so

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.260 
you can just change it right here so
this<00:06:35.650> one<00:06:35.830> actually<00:06:36.040> does<00:06:36.430> slow<00:06:36.669> my<00:06:36.880> old<00:06:37.030> one

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
this one actually does slow my old one

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.610 
this one actually does slow my old one
did<00:06:37.419> not<00:06:37.600> which<00:06:38.530> is<00:06:38.710> really<00:06:38.979> nice<00:06:39.270> and<00:06:40.620> that

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
did not which is really nice and that

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.070 
did not which is really nice and that
corresponds<00:06:42.580> nicely<00:06:42.610> with<00:06:43.150> my<00:06:43.270> new<00:06:43.450> Trimble

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
corresponds nicely with my new Trimble

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.030 
corresponds nicely with my new Trimble
system<00:06:44.500> as<00:06:44.620> well<00:06:44.800> so<00:06:44.860> works<00:06:45.820> out<00:06:46.000> nice<00:06:47.040> um

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
system as well so works out nice um

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.150 
system as well so works out nice um
that's<00:06:48.460> pretty<00:06:48.610> much<00:06:48.880> it<00:06:49.260> it's<00:06:50.260> a<00:06:50.350> nice<00:06:50.830> laser

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
that's pretty much it it's a nice laser

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.980 
that's pretty much it it's a nice laser
I<00:06:51.280> like<00:06:51.580> it<00:06:51.900> I<00:06:54.270> guess<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:55.419> only<00:06:55.539> other<00:06:55.750> things

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
I like it I guess the only other things

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.960 
I like it I guess the only other things
it<00:06:56.200> goes<00:06:56.380> into<00:06:56.560> sleep<00:06:56.740> mode<00:06:56.919> if<00:06:57.370> it's<00:06:57.520> not<00:06:57.669> used

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
it goes into sleep mode if it's not used

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.909 
it goes into sleep mode if it's not used
within<00:06:58.419> a<00:06:58.539> half<00:06:58.750> an<00:06:58.870> hour<00:06:59.020> which<00:06:59.289> is<00:06:59.320> nice<00:06:59.650> and

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
within a half an hour which is nice and

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.610 
within a half an hour which is nice and
it<00:06:59.979> also<00:07:00.160> shuts<00:07:00.520> off<00:07:01.000> completely<00:07:01.500> it's<00:07:02.500> not

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
it also shuts off completely it's not

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.730 
it also shuts off completely it's not
used<00:07:02.949> within<00:07:03.130> two<00:07:03.430> hours<00:07:04.200> which<00:07:05.200> is<00:07:05.320> nice<00:07:05.530> as

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
used within two hours which is nice as

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.330 
used within two hours which is nice as
well<00:07:05.770> so<00:07:07.530> you're<00:07:08.530> not<00:07:08.620> wasting<00:07:08.800> battery<00:07:09.130> if

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
well so you're not wasting battery if

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.580 
well so you're not wasting battery if
you<00:07:09.430> don't<00:07:09.580> have<00:07:09.700> to<00:07:09.910> so<00:07:10.380> there<00:07:11.380> you<00:07:11.440> go<00:07:11.560> guys
