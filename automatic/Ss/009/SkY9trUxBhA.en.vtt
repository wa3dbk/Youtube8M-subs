00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.600
 friends of you but here we are ready with 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.520
 a new video in our history 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.820
 we talked about android and windows 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.310
 phone also of the firefox system e 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.189
 today we are finally going to perform 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.130
 the unboxing of a device that has the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.230
 ubuntu operating system here it is 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.750
 ubuntu we had already seen a few years ago 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.820
 at the mobile world congress 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.520
 but we weren't able to try yet 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.320
 a device with this party system 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.410
 also because it was not easy 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.670
 finally we make it with the second 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.590
 official device with ubuntu with note 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.280
 with the ubuntu operating system that is 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.490
 always from the Spanish company b crew that 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.540
 after recalling put on the market the 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:06.140
 version and 4.5 better than the water model 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.180
 ris and 4.5 created the second 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.060
 smartphone with the system 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.890
 operating ubuntu and that is it is 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.600
 this one came first among other things 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.229
 than expected because it had to get to or 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.420
 less shipments had to start later 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.719
 22 but we received today that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.060
 on the 23rd there was the spirit of the week 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.100
 last how you see the package again 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.609
 completely sealed we have here 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.619
 the ghetto login or bi cube 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:36.289
 we wanted to do unboxing then 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.139
 discover the device with you 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.869
 let's see the package here 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:44.030
 where we are given some 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.389
 device features 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.130
 we have the 3g connection we have a 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:55.249
 5 inch HD ips display 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.279
 processor is identical to let's say al 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:01.060
 previous model and 4.5 that a cortex 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:04.450
 here he is a cortex from one 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.509
 3 gigabytes the processor is an e 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.310
 mediatek then we have 16 gigabytes of 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.330
 internal memory of 1 GB of RAM 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.010
 the slot to increase the note to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.660
 internal memory the possibility of having 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.230
 two micro sim then a dual sim 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 bluetooth 4.0 2500 milan battery for 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.720
 now 13 megapixels on the back and 5 megapixels 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.519
 on the front side but I'd say of 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.950
 don't waste any more time we go to 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.630
 open the package trying not to 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.780
 make mistakes because obviously you can't 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.000
 then redo the video and then I have to 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.720
 concentrate not to say rubbish 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.049
 here we go now to open the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.330
 packaging I am very very curious about 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.980
 see this device 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.519
 here it is box among other things a lot 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.530
 elegant we are going to open it to discover 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:01.299
 then the device 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.459
 here it is with the nation of course 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.470
 Black 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.470
 here the device we remove immediately 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.560
 pastine because otherwise it is not grasped 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.370
 words we hold because they are instructions 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:19.000
 on how to disassemble the various ones 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.769
 precisely slot for micro for micro 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.060
 sim and then for the sd 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.829
 here it is a little black cube 8 I'd say 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.190
 first impression I don't like so much 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.380
 game that there is as you can see between 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.440
 glass frame and back 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.440
 it almost seems like the display is almost there 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.290
 detached from the back 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.859
 but in short, it looks beautiful 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.010
 really very well done with writing 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:54.040
 engraved in the beautiful cover with the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.560
 also this logo engraved inside 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.090
 of the cover that definitely makes a 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.880
 nice double flash LED effect e 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:09.160
 high end microphone I assume it is for 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:14.910
 the asd then sd slot on the side 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.510
 Instead we have a clean hand, 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.690
 we have 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.570
 the speakers and then the budget of the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.690
 volume and the power button 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.340
 let's see if we can see the display 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:38.440
 5-inch repeat display with one 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:41.380
 resolution in hd therefore 1200 80 x 720 e 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.210
 we see the first switching on of ubuntu 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.160
 I'm very curious 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.790
 I can't wait to try it of course 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.620
 we will try thoroughly and then make a video 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.670
 review 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.550
 here is the first we say step by 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.140
 go to configure our ubuntu 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.180
 phone 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:06.430
 English is now the host, maybe now 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.670
 we run into the first in the first 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.900
 let's say settings to be skipped 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.730
 because we have absolutely no desire 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.670
 to put the sim a little and here is that 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:25.390
 he asks us say no security like that 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:27.760
 let's avoid making wifi and so on 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.430
 in other words, these are the first 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:35.980
 switching on the device 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.230
 ubuntu aquariis and 5 more of a short one 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.150
 particular device that we are very 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.000
 curious to try 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.540
 I said we will try it we will test it thoroughly 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.240
 and then we will talk to you about del 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.090
 telephone and above all of the 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.860
 ubuntu operating system of course 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.810
 let's go see it then too 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.110
 we conclude the vivid thing to see the 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.840
 remaining contents of the package where 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.140
 we find the most peer manuals 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.340
 in short, all the various maps 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.560
 and papers 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:15.140
 then we simply find out how we can 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:18.320
 imagine the usb cable charger for 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:22.880
 to be able to recharge the device 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.550
 here it is and then the wall adapter 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.680
 in short, nothing else, perhaps in honor of 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.600
 chronicle therefore we have also seen the 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.150
 complete contents of the package 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.220
 in short I have to try it we'll see we'll do 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.830
 focus on this new system 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.920
 operating in such a way as to make you enter 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.620
 even in the ubuntu world I would say that right 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.690
 all a greeting from Francesco column for 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.690
 you but who beton hi everyone
