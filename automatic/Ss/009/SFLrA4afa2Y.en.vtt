other than that no I mean it's the same

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.610 
other than that no I mean it's the same
concept<00:01:44.190> as<00:01:44.369> Lumia<00:01:44.940> 800

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
concept as Lumia 800

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.270 
concept as Lumia 800
I<00:01:46.820> carbonate<00:01:47.820> materials<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.280> unibody

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
I carbonate materials and unibody

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
I carbonate materials and unibody
concept<00:01:51.120> it<00:01:51.270> also<00:01:51.510> has<00:01:51.660> an<00:01:51.780> 8<00:01:51.930> megapixel

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
concept it also has an 8 megapixel

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.310 
concept it also has an 8 megapixel
camera<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.850> 2.2<00:01:54.450> aperture<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
camera and a 2.2 aperture which is a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.050 
camera and a 2.2 aperture which is a
wide<00:01:55.560> aperture<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.250> brings<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.670> more<00:01:56.820> life

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
wide aperture which brings in more life

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.270 
wide aperture which brings in more life
so<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.600> that's<00:01:58.080> one<00:01:58.350> difference<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.920> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
so that's that's one difference here it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.980 
so that's that's one difference here it
also<00:01:59.430> has<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> front<00:02:00.000> facing<00:02:00.060> camera<00:02:00.720> 1

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
also has a front facing camera 1

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.920 
also has a front facing camera 1
megapixel<00:02:01.500> front<00:02:01.980> facing<00:02:02.010> camera<00:02:05.480> and<00:02:06.480> so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
megapixel front facing camera and so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.109 
megapixel front facing camera and so
it's<00:02:07.050> 4.3<00:02:07.620> inch<00:02:07.740> screen<00:02:07.850> clear<00:02:08.850> black<00:02:09.090> display

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
it's 4.3 inch screen clear black display

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.450 
it's 4.3 inch screen clear black display
which<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.930> need<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.350> kit<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.130> is
