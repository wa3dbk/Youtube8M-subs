looking<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.290> water<00:01:52.530> server<00:01:52.799> business<00:01:53.070> what

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
looking on water server business what

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
looking on water server business what
time<00:01:53.549> servers<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.119> sure<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.899> zoom

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
time servers I'm not sure you can zoom

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.380 
time servers I'm not sure you can zoom
in<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
in like that and you can it's just so

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.270 
in like that and you can it's just so
cool<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.960> zoom<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.770> still<00:01:59.100> like

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
cool you can zoom in you can still like

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.480 
cool you can zoom in you can still like
we<00:01:59.790> rounded

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
we rounded

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.999 
we rounded
so<00:02:01.390> that's<00:02:01.509> just<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.720> cool<00:02:01.930> zoom<00:02:02.259> in<00:02:02.439> we'll<00:02:02.829> show

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
so that's just a cool zoom in we'll show

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.170 
so that's just a cool zoom in we'll show
you<00:02:03.040> some<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.310> other<00:02:03.460> control<00:02:03.790> so<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.060> go

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
you some of the other control so you go

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.870 
you some of the other control so you go
to<00:02:04.439> video<00:02:05.439> settings<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.130> they<00:02:06.430> have<00:02:06.549> so<00:02:06.820> many

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
to video settings and they have so many

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.550 
to video settings and they have so many
more<00:02:07.299> things<00:02:07.360> they<00:02:08.289> have<00:02:08.640> performance<00:02:10.560> they

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
more things they have performance they

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.820 
more things they have performance they
have<00:02:11.739> vsync<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.910> when<00:02:13.390> vsync<00:02:13.840> does<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.380> you

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
have vsync and when vsync does as you

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.030 
have vsync and when vsync does as you
can<00:02:14.980> see<00:02:15.300> down<00:02:16.300> here<00:02:16.590> leasing<00:02:17.590> limit<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
can see down here leasing limit the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.740 
can see down here leasing limit the
water<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.519> certain<00:02:18.819> amount<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.090> frames<00:02:19.360> and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
water to a certain amount of frames and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.080 
water to a certain amount of frames and
so<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.380> makes<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.739> not<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.430> smooth<00:02:21.849> but

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
so that makes it not that smooth but

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.350 
so that makes it not that smooth but
it's<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.569> little<00:02:22.780> good<00:02:22.959> balanced<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.610> they

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
it's a little good balanced and they

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.070 
it's a little good balanced and they
have<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.290> they<00:02:27.099> have<00:02:27.220> fog<00:02:27.610> start<00:02:28.000> I'm<00:02:28.870> not

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
have on a they have fog start I'm not

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.339 
have on a they have fog start I'm not
sure<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.940> make<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.330> for<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.780> fog<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.050> little

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
sure you make it for the fog a little

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.840 
sure you make it for the fog a little
bit<00:02:32.440> farther<00:02:32.620> back<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.580> kind<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.760> like

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
bit farther back it's kind of like

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.820 
bit farther back it's kind of like
render<00:02:34.120> distance<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.600> guess<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.470> can't<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.739> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
render distance I guess you can't in the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.800 
render distance I guess you can't in the
back<00:02:35.980> mini<00:02:36.640> map<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.459> yeah<00:02:40.299> there's<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.630> mini

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
back mini map and so yeah there's a mini

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.660 
back mini map and so yeah there's a mini
i<00:02:41.019> guess<00:02:41.290> i<00:02:41.470> don't<00:02:41.590> know<00:02:41.799> i<00:02:41.830> know<00:02:41.980> those<00:02:42.370> that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
i guess i don't know i know those that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.150 
i guess i don't know i know those that
old<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.910> was<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> mini<00:02:43.269> mad<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.590> i<00:02:44.620> actually

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
old it was a mini mad but i actually

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.270 
old it was a mini mad but i actually
know<00:02:45.459> what<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.730> does<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.980> ok<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.040> video

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
know what that does but ok the video

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.699 
know what that does but ok the video
settings<00:02:48.700> they<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.690> things<00:02:50.019> they<00:02:50.260> have<00:02:50.410> like

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
settings they have things they have like

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.870 
settings they have things they have like
mini-map<00:02:51.160> level<00:02:51.640> on<00:02:52.019> being<00:02:53.019> on<00:02:53.140> level<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:53.880> so

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
mini-map level on being on level one so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.009 
mini-map level on being on level one so
maximum<00:02:55.690> smoothing<00:02:57.450> max<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.720> don't<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.989> don't

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
maximum smoothing max I don't I don't

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.330 
maximum smoothing max I don't I don't
even<00:02:59.200> know<00:02:59.410> what<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.560> does<00:02:59.830> but<00:03:00.220> if

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
even know what that does but if

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.920 
even know what that does but if

normal as you can see everything was

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.850 
normal as you can see everything was
like<00:05:20.740> clear<00:05:21.100> personal<00:05:21.610> HD<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.300> bit<00:05:22.900> so<00:05:23.560> cool

the shadows these trees that tree like

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.500 
the shadows these trees that tree like
right<00:05:26.800> there<00:05:27.040> for<00:05:27.460> one<00:05:27.729> of<00:05:27.820> those<00:05:27.940> everything

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
right there for one of those everything

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.780 
right there for one of those everything
is<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:28.930> looks<00:05:29.080> different<00:05:29.260> but<00:05:29.650> i<00:05:29.919> guess<00:05:30.550> that's

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
is it looks different but i guess that's

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.719 
is it looks different but i guess that's
just<00:05:30.820> because<00:05:31.060> it's<00:05:31.390> not<00:05:31.590> really<00:05:32.590> i<00:05:32.800> don't

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
just because it's not really i don't

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.010 
just because it's not really i don't
know<00:05:33.790> it's<00:05:33.970> probably<00:05:34.030> just<00:05:34.390> how<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:34.600> mod<00:05:34.810> is
