mobile<00:01:13.040> phones<00:01:13.310> for<00:01:13.790> years<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:14.360> even<00:01:15.170> had

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
mobile phones for years I even had

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.649 
mobile phones for years I even had
mobile<00:01:15.770> phones<00:01:16.040> that<00:01:16.460> could<00:01:16.760> take<00:01:17.030> video<00:01:17.450> but

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
mobile phones that could take video but

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.540 
mobile phones that could take video but
it<00:01:17.690> wasn't<00:01:18.020> until<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.230> got<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.590> iphone<00:01:19.010> that<00:01:19.520> I

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
it wasn't until I got the iphone that I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.570 
it wasn't until I got the iphone that I
took<00:01:19.700> video<00:01:20.330> on<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.690> phone<00:01:21.200> seriously<00:01:21.980> the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
took video on a phone seriously the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.910 
took video on a phone seriously the
first<00:01:22.820> reason<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.480> audio<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.530> second

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
first reason is the audio the second

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.190 
first reason is the audio the second
reason<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:25.910> very<00:01:26.000> easy<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.570> use<00:01:26.930> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
reason is that it's very easy to use and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.080 
reason is that it's very easy to use and
the<00:01:27.650> third<00:01:27.830> reason<00:01:28.070> is<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.700> image

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
the third reason is that the image

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.330 
the third reason is that the image
quality<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.690> outstanding<00:01:30.050> in<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.160> most

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
quality is outstanding in the most

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.610 
quality is outstanding in the most
extreme<00:01:31.760> circumstances<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.990> I'll<00:01:33.050> show<00:01:33.590> you

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
extreme circumstances and I'll show you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.350 
extreme circumstances and I'll show you
that<00:01:33.800> just<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.190> minute<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.860> in<00:01:37.130> February<00:01:37.940> my

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
that just a minute so in February my

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.060 
that just a minute so in February my
wife<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.840> went<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.230> Miami<00:01:39.650> for<00:01:40.010> a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
wife and I went to Miami for a

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.880 
wife and I went to Miami for a
long-anticipated<00:01:40.640> get<00:01:41.420> away<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.890> really

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
long-anticipated get away I really

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.580 
long-anticipated get away I really
wanted<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.280> see<00:01:43.490> how<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.880> iphone<00:01:44.540> 5<00:01:44.930> would

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
wanted to see how the iphone 5 would

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.320 
wanted to see how the iphone 5 would
perform<00:01:46.010> under<00:01:46.310> different<00:01:46.700> conditions<00:01:46.730> the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
perform under different conditions the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.990 
perform under different conditions the
idea<00:01:47.720> was<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.470> be<00:01:48.590> as<00:01:48.800> opportunistic<00:01:49.610> as

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
idea was to be as opportunistic as

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.820 
idea was to be as opportunistic as
possible<00:01:50.540> if<00:01:50.930> I<00:01:51.110> could<00:01:51.320> get<00:01:51.440> some<00:01:51.620> decent

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
possible if I could get some decent

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.280 
possible if I could get some decent
shots<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.550> even<00:01:52.970> do<00:01:53.090> entire<00:01:53.540> videos<00:01:54.050> of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
shots and even do entire videos of

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.980 
shots and even do entire videos of
acceptable<00:01:55.070> length<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.640> quality<00:01:55.850> then<00:01:56.780> my

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
acceptable length and quality then my

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.230 
acceptable length and quality then my
system<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.650> video<00:01:57.890> marketing<00:01:58.130> would<00:01:59.000> get<00:01:59.210> a

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
system of video marketing would get a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.680 
system of video marketing would get a
nice<00:01:59.660> big<00:02:00.200> boost<00:02:00.710> why<00:02:01.370> because<00:02:02.270> when<00:02:02.510> you<00:02:02.660> have

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
nice big boost why because when you have

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.170 
nice big boost why because when you have
