00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.930
 a TV set has entered the workshop 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.090
 with an intermittent fault when the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.389
 TV is cold at the beginning of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.360
 turn it on the tdt fails the image comes 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.000
 and pixel goes to the squares come out 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 typical of lack of signal and little by little 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.640
 after several minutes the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.039
 image and it looks good instead to the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.680
 sound happens the opposite to 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.260
 turn on the TV works well the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.200
 sound and as the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.719
 television the sound goes between cutting 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.450
 until disappear and television 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.110
 stay with image but without voice 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.640
 good morning how about this type of breakdowns 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.760
 intermittent are the most complicated 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.420
 although in this case we had a bit 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.480
 of luck the fault is repetitive tve in 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.969
 cold without image and with sound tv in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.149
 hot with image but without sound 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.250
 I have always done the following 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.920
 tests check the extensions of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.540
 outputs of the power supply 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.600
 general visual check with 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.150
 three possible welding cables 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.480
 ruptured components of the plates 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.880
 and similar and they have been the last two 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.550
 tests that have decided me because 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.950
 the fault was in false welds of 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.410
 the three chips with gea welding 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.550
 we remember that the welding of gea 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.040
 use 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.520
 tin pellets that are inserted below 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.190
 of the integrated or gea chips and with 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.710
 special welding stations 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.440
 hot air weld this new 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.350
 chip technology well these tests 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.290
 have been the technical ones of those before 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.450
 with the handle of a screwdriver they 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.180
 tapping the plates to see 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.390
 at which point the image disappeared and the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 sound came back until I realized that the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.610
 image disappeared and the sound returned to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.940
 tap on the main plate in the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.149
 area of these three gea chips the other 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.580
 test has been apply snow or spray 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.860
 refrigerant by the integrated ones of the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.050
 main plate when the TV and did 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.780
 while it was on with 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.050
 and without sound realizing that at 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.700
 cool the three gea chips 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.270
 the image disappeared and the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.180
 sound good resolution is to buy a 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.510
 my new plate and have a very expensive 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.750
 Gase welding station or try 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.180
 solve the three gea chips with a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.400
 hot air welder still at 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.980
 knowing that with this method you 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.680
 you need some practice and a little 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.680
 luck we can finish breaking the plate 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.840
 main we will expose it to the client for 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.300
 to decide how you are seeing in the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.120
 video the customer has decided to take a risk 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.210
 neither loses much the main plate is 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.270
 broken with aluminum adhesive tape or 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.970
 silver we have isolated the three chips of 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.250
 gea so that the heat only affects 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.650
 over them protecting the rest of 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.770
 Main board components we add 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.840
 flux so that it improves the resolve lasts to 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.180
 the tip of the hot air welder 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.640
 with the same aluminum adhesive tape 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.010
 we made a kind of 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.430
 nozzle with dimensions approximate 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.790
 of the chips or integrated gea for 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.819
 that channels the heat only to them the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.970
 microprocessor or fattest chip what re 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.989
 We heat approximately one minute 60 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.989
 seconds 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.690
 the other two chips of 20 to 30 seconds 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.230
 as you are already seeing in the video 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.319
 tutorial 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.140
 next very important to wait 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.629
 one hour for the chips to cool or 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.659
 return to room temperature by itself 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:54.659
 alone eye with this if we ride and 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.390
 we connect with the superheated chips it 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.269
 they are going to break and the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.879
 television after an hour we mounted 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.400
 all heatsink plates connectors 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.680
 screws and we tried super 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.680
 television repaired satisfactorily
