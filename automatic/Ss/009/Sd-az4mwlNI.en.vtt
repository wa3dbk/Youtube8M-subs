 I do not know if I'm protected by a 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.340
 angel or something because people have treated me 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.889
 very well in fact they are not supposed to leave 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.100

 200 maybe to the day the earrings 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.300
 what is it if you compare it with a 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.460
 normal work has already been the same 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.460
 and those are the same forms sounding 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.010
 a few hours that work I work 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.350
 four hours maximum is something risky 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.530
 this as how is how it was that 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.780

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:45.310
 ways long ago I did it myself 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:48.640

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.330

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.330
 united brothers 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.200
 that is spoken without being so that it is not 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.200
 to win 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.490
 I have a perfect 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.230
 one year six months already with the years 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.170
 when you do an exhibition with which 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.950
 it was attended 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.950
 advertising 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.330
 i 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.550
 I wanted to relive it to do to 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.430
 that people 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.430
 show people 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.830
 many times you are down many times 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.480
 you are up 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.390
 I can tell you, I am a director of two 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.510
 newspapers look at me I'm throwing fire at 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.340
 the best thing many people say that has 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.570
 a lot of money, not because you have a lot 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.630
 money 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.320
 you're going to stop doing what you're going to cross 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.320
 what are you really 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.750
