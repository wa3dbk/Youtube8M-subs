00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.970
 to turn on the bluetooth receiver it 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.680

 we hear the characteristic sound turning on 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.250
 bluetooth receiver and what is important 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.710
 Mark 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.010
 the tape mechanism is wiping and it doesn't 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.210
 rotates 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.210
 further connect our phone 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:57.530
 and we start music very conveniently that in 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.600
 the phone we have an equalizer and various 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.140
 processing for music that we can 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.420
 use with our tape recorder 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.890
 actually adding features that 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.490
 initially in this tape recorder not 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.490

 listen to music press the stop button and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.780
 bluetooth receiver switches itself off as i do 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.070
 already said the tape drive mechanism 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.220
 us off during playback 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.900
 via bluetooth receiver and therefore when 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.260
 pressing the play button of the cassette is not 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.030
 rotates however in order to 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.030
 listen to record audio cassette 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.910
 Enough to press it from behind 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.780

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.790

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.790
 we have assets 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.130
 thus modifying our 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.739
 tape recorder we have not lost the opportunity 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.319
 listen to audio cassettes and in doing so 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.489
