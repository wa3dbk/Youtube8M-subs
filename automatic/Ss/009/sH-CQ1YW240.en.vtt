00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the batteries living take care some will

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:37.580 
the batteries living take care some will
add<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> water<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.870 

should<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.680> exactly<00:01:39.040> like<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.400> doors<00:01:39.700> are

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.200 
should be exactly like a doors are
consistently

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.060 

you<00:01:47.210> can<00:01:47.479> leave<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:48.020> for<00:01:48.380> five<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.860> ten

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
you can leave this for five to ten

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.039 
you can leave this for five to ten
minutes<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.729> then<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.390> can<00:01:50.479> start<00:01:50.840> making

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
minutes and then you can start making

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.340 
minutes and then you can start making
your<00:01:51.229> distance<00:01:52.149> now<00:01:53.149> it's<00:01:53.360> done<00:01:53.600> now<00:01:53.960> we<00:01:54.020> keep

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
your distance now it's done now we keep

your distance now it's done now we keep
this<00:01:54.530> for<00:01:54.860> ten<00:01:55.039> minutes<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.280> are<00:01:58.429> taking<00:01:58.759> a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
this for ten minutes so you are taking a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.550 
this for ten minutes so you are taking a
dosa<00:01:59.240> tava<00:01:59.570> and<00:02:00.380> then<00:02:00.530> will<00:02:00.679> allow<00:02:00.799> it<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.250> heat

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
dosa tava and then will allow it to heat

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.469 
dosa tava and then will allow it to heat
so<00:02:03.560> now<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:04.069> pan<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.429> hot<00:02:04.670> enough<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:05.240> am<00:02:05.299> going

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
so now the pan is hot enough I am going

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:16.260 
so now the pan is hot enough I am going
to<00:02:05.630> swim<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.229> gas

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.510 

and<00:02:16.810> keep<00:02:17.050> spreading<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.740> a<00:02:17.830> circular<00:02:18.070> motion

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
and keep spreading in a circular motion

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.000 
and keep spreading in a circular motion
so<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:21.910> I'm<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.590> little<00:02:23.590> oil<00:02:23.800> on

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
so now here I'm going to little oil on

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:33.500 
so now here I'm going to little oil on
this

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:42.160 

this<00:02:34.510> takes<00:02:34.750> less<00:02:35.080> time<00:02:35.260> than<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.740> regular<00:02:35.950> dosa

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.650 

and<00:02:42.290> regular<00:02:43.040> dosa<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:43.730> also<00:02:43.880> did<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:44.480> just

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
and regular dosa we also did we just

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.570 
and regular dosa we also did we just
cook<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.990> one<00:02:45.200> side<00:02:45.500> but<00:02:45.800> here<00:02:46.040> we<00:02:46.220> gonna<00:02:46.370> cook

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
cook the one side but here we gonna cook

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.089 
cook the one side but here we gonna cook
the<00:02:46.730> other<00:02:46.760> side<00:02:47.000> also

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.099 

so<00:02:55.579> now<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:55.999> see<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.329> edges<00:02:56.689> are<00:02:56.840> getting

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
so now you can see the edges are getting

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.229 
so now you can see the edges are getting
brown<00:02:57.409> that's<00:02:58.099> when<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.640> know<00:02:58.819> your<00:02:59.030> doors

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
brown that's when you know your doors

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.129 
brown that's when you know your doors
are<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.950> it's<00:03:00.950> done<00:03:01.159> from<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.549> one<00:03:01.730> side<00:03:02.139> and

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
are that it's done from the one side and

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.069 
are that it's done from the one side and
I'm<00:03:03.290> going<00:03:03.409> to<00:03:03.530> flip<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:03.950> over<00:03:04.749> you<00:03:05.749> can<00:03:05.780> also

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
I'm going to flip this over you can also

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.039 
I'm going to flip this over you can also
add<00:03:06.409> your<00:03:06.439> filling<00:03:07.159> of<00:03:07.280> your<00:03:07.489> choice<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:08.049> can
