00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.719
 radiation radiation cosmic rays 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.190
 x-ray lion alfa gamma beta or ashore 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.699
 whole and its inhabitants bathes in 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.570
 areas and various and varied rays the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.779
 light radiation 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.439
 we see them heat radiation 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.180
 he puts on the radio waves we do not 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.349
 sees no we do not feel them with us 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.779
 an antenna and a good post 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.949
 hear and we must 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.630
 but there is radiation that we do not 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.860
 do not believe that we do not feel we know 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.940
 detect them it is the radiations 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.750
 that come from radioactive atoms 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.730
 like uranium for example what is this 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.629
 that a radioactive atom the whole earth 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.940
 we are less the sea the fish 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.469
 all this is done only by atoms the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 atoms in turn are made of protons 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.149
 and most neutrons and electrons 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.050
 atoms are still and remain 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.050
 what they are indefinitely 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.100
 others are unstable and 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.320
 it's to become stable like the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.820
 friends for that the unfortunate atom is 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.210
 obliged to give up some of his 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.060
 proton neutron or electro this is it a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.590
 radioactive radiation in the father atom 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.340
 Easter is composed of two protons and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.680
 neutrons 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.770
 it's alpha radiation it's 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.420
 relatively slow that in the atom father a 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.900
 electron it is a radiation not pay 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.729
 it's already going a little faster some 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.470
 atoms at the same time as alfa and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.750
 betas puts them a third kind of 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.729
 thing the gamma rays this is not 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.320
 particles is energy that is 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.630
 move like light or rays 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.130
 x and it goes also empty of atoms 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.200
 unstable there is a little everywhere in 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.940
 the universe so that alfa's 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.039
 betas and gamma there are a few 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.630
 everywhere there are some who come from 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.430
 below there is some who falls from the sky 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.560
 and the human body itself contains 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.340
 normally 30 mg of potassium 40 which 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.080
 throws firecrackers and scales at this 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 natural radioactivity never embarrassed 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.970
 nobody but radioactivity is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.090
 like other radiation too much 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.370
 sun it gives sunburns too 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.740
 heat it burns 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.820
 radioactivity is the same as above 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.170
 of a certain dose it becomes 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.580
 dangerous and that is what risks 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.020
 spend when you focus decor 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.370
 radioactive like uranium to do 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.810
 of nuclear energy certainly there are some 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.830
 critters like snails or 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.800
 shrimp it does not look like 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.530
 disturb but we are not shrimp 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.790
 and we like to know first that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.970
 become the beta alpha rays and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.980
 gamma the heavy and slow alfa are 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.870
 braked by teens surrounding the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.670
 particle stops settles two 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.360
 electrons and becomes a helium atom 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.850
 in the air the alfa no longer exists at 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.980
 about three centimeters 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.880
 the faster betas go further at 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.650
 three meters on average 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.860
 the electron goes into orbit around a 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.150
 atom and we talk about it more 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.800
 kids who do not have a mass 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
 are not braked to disappear 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.180
 they have to go in full force 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.780
 in an atomic nucleus that absorbs them 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.520
 250 m 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.920
 half of the kids will be gone at 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.990
 after 300 meters, only 10% 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.840
 but 300 meters and 10% 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.430
 it is still much that is why we 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.410
 never let the radioactive bodies to 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.390
 open air with lead containers 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.770
 or concrete walls the radiations 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.780
 are destroyed much faster 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.239
 that's protecting what's called 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.489
 direct irradiation 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.320
 but there is something else of gas 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.910
 liquids from dust in contact with a 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.360
 nuclear reaction become radioactive 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.680
 in turn if he escapes too big 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.660
 number he carries this radioactivity 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.620
 outside there is risk of 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.330
 contamination 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.590
 the solution obviously is to 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.209
 watch very closely everything that can 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.709
 go out 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.080
 certainly all this would be easier if 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.480
 in addition it made sense for the Special 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.810
 detect the radioactivity but that's 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.810
 another story
