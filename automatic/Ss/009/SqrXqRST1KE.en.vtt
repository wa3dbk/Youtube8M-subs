with positioning with a fast striker and
it's<00:03:53.950> very<00:03:54.160> important<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.360> formation

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
it's very important in this formation

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.449 
it's very important in this formation
because<00:03:56.260> it's<00:03:56.440> kind<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.739> threw<00:03:57.010> ball<00:03:57.220> base

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459

strikers and the center attacking bit go

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.850 
strikers and the center attacking bit go

your attack in this formation and this
is<00:04:23.930> where<00:04:24.080> things<00:04:24.230> get<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.500> little<00:04:24.620> bit<00:04:24.800> weird<00:04:25.070> I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
is where things get a little bit weird I

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.040 
is where things get a little bit weird I
shake<00:04:25.460> them<00:04:25.610> up<00:04:25.760> with<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.330> left<00:04:26.540> mid<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
shake them up with the left mid and the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.900 
shake them up with the left mid and the
right<00:04:27.230> mid<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.650> tell<00:04:28.130> them<00:04:28.310> both<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.730> stay

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
right mid I tell them both to stay

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.880 
right mid I tell them both to stay
forward<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.540> both<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.260> get<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:30.470> behind<00:04:30.590> so

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
forward and both to get in behind so

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.110 
forward and both to get in behind so
they're<00:04:31.070> not<00:04:31.280> going<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.700> help<00:04:31.880> on<00:04:32.030> the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
they're not going to help on the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.000 
they're not going to help on the
defensive<00:04:32.600> side<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.080> pitch<00:04:33.290> which<00:04:33.770> gives

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
defensive side of the pitch which gives

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.270 
defensive side of the pitch which gives
me<00:04:34.160> a<00:04:34.270> five-man<00:04:35.270> counter-attack<00:04:36.110> or<00:04:36.350> at<00:04:37.100> least

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
me a five-man counter-attack or at least

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.940 
me a five-man counter-attack or at least
five<00:04:37.580> players<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.150> are<00:04:38.240> going<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.480> be<00:04:38.660> on<00:04:38.960> the

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
five players that are going to be on the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.370 
five players that are going to be on the
opponent's<00:04:40.460> half<00:04:40.550> very<00:04:40.820> quickly<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.540> I<00:04:42.110> like

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
opponent's half very quickly and I like

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.050 
opponent's half very quickly and I like
that<00:04:42.620> I<00:04:42.740> personally<00:04:43.340> get<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> lot<00:04:43.760> out<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:43.970> that

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
that I personally get a lot out of that

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.520 
that I personally get a lot out of that
I'm<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.360> good<00:04:44.630> defensive<00:04:45.110> player<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.350> feel

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
I'm a good defensive player I feel

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.410 
I'm a good defensive player I feel
confident<00:04:45.950> on<00:04:46.070> that<00:04:46.190> side<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:47.030> pitch<00:04:47.210> and

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
confident on that side of the pitch and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.910 
confident on that side of the pitch and
I<00:04:47.510> think<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.780> makes<00:04:47.960> for<00:04:48.110> an<00:04:48.230> easy<00:04:48.380> attack<00:04:48.740> and

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
I think it makes for an easy attack and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.080 
I think it makes for an easy attack and
we're<00:04:49.040> gonna<00:04:49.130> have<00:04:49.310> five<00:04:49.520> people<00:04:49.820> playing

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
we're gonna have five people playing

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.880 
we're gonna have five people playing
defense<00:04:50.510> because<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:50.990> know<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.290> CDM<00:04:51.680> is

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
defense because you know the CDM is

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.350 
defense because you know the CDM is

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
going to be cut passing lanes and stay

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.030
