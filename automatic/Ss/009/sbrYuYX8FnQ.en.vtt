00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:43.779 
to tour the west coast because

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.629 
to tour the west coast because
apparently<00:04:44.779> touring<00:04:45.620> in<00:04:45.680> America<00:04:46.129> is<00:04:46.310> really

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
apparently touring in America is really

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.059 
apparently touring in America is really
difficult<00:04:46.789> for<00:04:47.389> Canadian<00:04:47.900> bands<00:04:48.259> which<00:04:48.949> is

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
difficult for Canadian bands which is

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.730 
difficult for Canadian bands which is
why<00:04:49.219> so<00:04:49.610> many<00:04:49.759> of<00:04:49.879> them<00:04:49.999> don't<00:04:50.360> do<00:04:50.659> it<00:04:50.810> so

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
why so many of them don't do it so

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.300 
why so many of them don't do it so
support<00:04:52.129> the<00:04:52.219> Canadian<00:04:52.639> bands<00:04:52.849> because

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
support the Canadian bands because

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.290 
support the Canadian bands because
Canada's<00:04:55.310> literally<00:04:55.699> three<00:04:55.909> hours<00:04:55.939> away

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
Canada's literally three hours away

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.659 
Canada's literally three hours away
there's<00:04:56.990> no<00:04:57.229> reason<00:04:57.710> that<00:04:57.740> Vancouver<00:04:58.460> bands

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
there's no reason that Vancouver bands

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.309 
there's no reason that Vancouver bands
should<00:04:59.270> not<00:04:59.419> be<00:04:59.539> able<00:04:59.629> to<00:04:59.779> play<00:04:59.900> in<00:05:00.110> Seattle

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
should not be able to play in Seattle

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.429 
should not be able to play in Seattle
and<00:05:00.740> then<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.699> last<00:05:01.879> band<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.599> not<00:05:02.900> a<00:05:02.930> new<00:05:03.169> band

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
and then the last band is not a new band

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.709 
and then the last band is not a new band
in<00:05:03.860> any<00:05:04.250> way<00:05:04.460> shape<00:05:04.729> or<00:05:04.879> form<00:05:04.939> this<00:05:05.330> is<00:05:05.449> a<00:05:05.479> band

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
in any way shape or form this is a band

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:07.029 
in any way shape or form this is a band
