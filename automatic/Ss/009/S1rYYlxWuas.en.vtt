won many years over in Europe it's
getting<00:00:37.330> a<00:00:37.390> lot<00:00:37.480> bigger<00:00:37.690> in<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.900> u.s.<00:00:38.140> it's

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
getting a lot bigger in the u.s. it's

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.979 
getting a lot bigger in the u.s. it's
getting<00:00:38.860> more<00:00:39.100> powerful<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:40.030> pro<00:00:40.449> guys<00:00:40.629> like

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
getting more powerful the pro guys like

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.319 
getting more powerful the pro guys like
it<00:00:41.200> so<00:00:41.829> you<00:00:42.340> I<00:00:42.489> think<00:00:42.579> you'd<00:00:42.850> be<00:00:42.940> seeing<00:00:43.090> more

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
it so you I think you'd be seeing more

it so you I think you'd be seeing more
of<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:43.600> in<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.290> future<00:00:44.440> as<00:00:44.680> far<00:00:44.710> as<00:00:45.010> when<00:00:45.160> the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
of this in the future as far as when the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.240 
of this in the future as far as when the
pro<00:00:45.700> guys<00:00:45.850> set<00:00:46.149> up<00:00:46.180> it's<00:00:46.720> been<00:00:46.899> updated<00:00:47.410> just

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
pro guys set up it's been updated just

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.840 
pro guys set up it's been updated just
like<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:49.120> 250<00:00:49.600> F<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.530> 450<00:00:50.980> F<00:00:51.130> the<00:00:51.700> weight

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
like the 250 F and the 450 F the weight

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.549 
like the 250 F and the 450 F the weight
savings<00:00:52.239> is<00:00:52.300> about<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.540> pound<00:00:52.870> we<00:00:53.380> have<00:00:53.500> the

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
savings is about a pound we have the

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.979 
savings is about a pound we have the
four<00:00:53.739> CS<00:00:54.010> Forks<00:00:54.370> on<00:00:54.550> here<00:00:54.820> we<00:00:55.210> feel<00:00:55.450> an<00:00:55.630> upgrade

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
four CS Forks on here we feel an upgrade

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.590 
four CS Forks on here we feel an upgrade
from<00:00:56.140> last<00:00:56.410> year<00:00:56.739> cool<00:00:57.520> thing<00:00:57.730> about<00:00:57.850> them<00:00:58.210> one

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
from last year cool thing about them one

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.959 
from last year cool thing about them one
size<00:00:58.870> rebound<00:00:59.380> one<00:00:59.590> side's<00:00:59.829> compression<00:01:00.460> even

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
size rebound one side's compression even

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.549 
size rebound one side's compression even
a<00:01:01.030> better<00:01:01.180> thing<00:01:01.420> about<00:01:01.629> them<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:02.140> can<00:01:02.260> adjust

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
a better thing about them you can adjust

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.920 
a better thing about them you can adjust
them<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.860> fly<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.370> we<00:01:04.000> rode<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.210> 450<00:01:04.809> on

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
them on the fly that we rode the 450 on

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.480 
them on the fly that we rode the 450 on
and<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.229> was<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.350> big<00:01:05.530> improvement<00:01:05.649> the<00:01:06.280> same

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
and that was a big improvement the same

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.400 
and that was a big improvement the same
thing<00:01:06.670> goes<00:01:06.820> for<00:01:06.850> this<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.869> shock<00:01:08.080> has<00:01:08.259> also

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
thing goes for this the shock has also

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.050 
thing goes for this the shock has also
been<00:01:08.619> revised<00:01:08.950> there's<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.759> new<00:01:09.880> machine

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
been revised there's a new machine

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.109 
been revised there's a new machine
linkage<00:01:10.660> the<00:01:11.229> pull<00:01:11.440> rod<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.800> 2.5<00:01:12.640> millimeters

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
linkage the pull rod is 2.5 millimeters

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.570 
linkage the pull rod is 2.5 millimeters
longer<00:01:13.510> so<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.409> should<00:01:14.650> be<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.950> little<00:01:15.250> stiffer

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
longer so it should be a little stiffer

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.880 
longer so it should be a little stiffer
on<00:01:15.640> top<00:01:15.909> so<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.900> doesn't<00:01:17.290> blow<00:01:17.470> through<00:01:17.740> is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
on top so it doesn't blow through is

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.270 
on top so it doesn't blow through is
easy<00:01:18.070> with<00:01:18.790> these<00:01:18.970> shock<00:01:19.330> changes<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.680> seat

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
easy with these shock changes the seat

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.340 
easy with these shock changes the seat
height<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.640> around<00:01:22.000> 8<00:01:22.270> millimeters<00:01:22.960> lower

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
height is around 8 millimeters lower

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.640 
height is around 8 millimeters lower
than<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.650> 2014<00:01:24.130> model<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:25.090> black<00:01:25.240> XL<00:01:25.750> rims<00:01:26.020> we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
than the 2014 model the black XL rims we

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.929 
than the 2014 model the black XL rims we
feel<00:01:26.860> these<00:01:27.010> have<00:01:27.189> been<00:01:27.280> stronger<00:01:27.670> again

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
feel these have been stronger again

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.490 
feel these have been stronger again
these<00:01:28.180> should<00:01:28.240> be<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.600> same<00:01:28.780> as<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:28.960> 450<00:01:29.350> that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
these should be the same as a 450 that

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.230 
these should be the same as a 450 that
we<00:01:29.590> really<00:01:29.830> like<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.549> chassis<00:01:30.939> is<00:01:31.030> almost

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
we really like the chassis is almost

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.810 
we really like the chassis is almost
identical<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.840> 2014<00:01:32.710> model<00:01:33.040> except<00:01:33.490> for<00:01:33.640> one

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
identical to 2014 model except for one

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.510 
identical to 2014 model except for one
thing<00:01:34.180> they<00:01:34.810> change<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.439> cross<00:01:35.770> tube<00:01:36.220> that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
thing they change the cross tube that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.859 
thing they change the cross tube that
connect<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.939> frame<00:01:37.180> sides<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.570> linkage

connect to the frame sides the linkage

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.350 
connect to the frame sides the linkage
it's<00:01:38.380> supposed<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.650> reduce<00:01:38.770> flex<00:01:39.360> reduces

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
it's supposed to reduce flex reduces

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.060 
it's supposed to reduce flex reduces
weight<00:01:40.570> we<00:01:40.900> also<00:01:41.020> have<00:01:41.170> new<00:01:41.350> softer<00:01:41.860> compound

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070
