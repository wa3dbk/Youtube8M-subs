00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
 people how to count the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.220
 prime factors 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.130
 we say that the number of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.830
 prime factors in group of two factors 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.110
 to 2 on the rationals you get 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.049
 counting the prime factors that 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.340
 find how it makes a power and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.200
 that contain at least one variable 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.370
 we have here we are through him 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.010
 x 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.430
 which is authorized in this way 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 two xx 2 squared 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.440
 4 then in this case we are going to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.620
 see that there are three factors 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.320
 1 2 and 3 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:47.450
 but like this variable 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.690
 and then it can not be a prime factor 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.390
 this is a prime factor as well as the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:00.400
 crystal but the prime factor is not x + 2 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.400
 squared but only the base 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.330
 two Palestinians 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.540
 who are teachers 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 and the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
 [Music] 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.930
 this is not control 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.930
 yes 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.070
 then you have to take into account that I 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.230
 realized that we observe the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.270
 updates and contain the factors 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.630
 cousins ​​the prime factors are those 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.880
 that as we said, they will not be able to 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.680
 say reducing is more like they are 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.780
 linear terms we already know 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.840
 those are definitely factors 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.860
 in this case also when six do not 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.680
 has several challenges is a factor 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.230
 or almost because it's a linear term 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.510
 and the square term repressor but not 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.810
 it can be reduced then it will also be 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.409
 a prime factor 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.409
 so 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.880
 three prime factors 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.430
 they are all linear x1 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.570
 and the kiel - 2 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.060
 and one of them is 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.060
 x squared more 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.410
 that is, those are the three factors 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.870
 how are you watching two million and one 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.690
 square but obviously like ya and 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.740
 on the basis of social protest all 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.840
 the power is not going to be a factor 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.970
 in all power is a factor but not 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:57.460
 a factor 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.460
 good yes no 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.580
 and techniques to factor that expression 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.670
 it would 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:16.640
 last 12 x 20 x minutes 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.040
 and then enter directly into the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.430
 Pressure factors set can 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.060
 get this or that is three words 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.849
 the printing has four prime factors 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.849
 has three prime factors 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.060
 one 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.410
 x2 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.660
 and here minutes 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.480
 now because this price 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.909
 we are observing there for it 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.849
 we are going to continue techniques we are going to 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.969
 make methods to be able to factor and 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:07.209
 obviously reducing expression as 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:09.849
 those simple expressions as they are 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.890
 seeing and being able to easily count the 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.610
 factors 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.690
 it's that easy 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.690
 all that
