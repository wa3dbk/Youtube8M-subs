00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.349
 hello everyone in this first video 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.210
 on game theory two ex we have 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.339
 demonstrated what is probably the 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.410
 main result of game theory 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.410
 two axes namely that there can not be 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.550
 to have in this game two zero games then 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.720
 what does it mean he can not 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.910
 not to have two zero games well 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.380
 it means that even if the party is going 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.390
 until the end and that the players 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.699
 end up filling the entire 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.580
 pawn board as seen here and 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.890
 well in the end there will necessarily be either 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.990
 a white pawn path that connects the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.070
 two white edges either a path of 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.390
 black pawns that connects the two edges 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.950
 blacks ie either the whites 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.329
 will have won either the blacks will have won 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.699
 you see that in this configuration 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.050
 that you have in front of you here these are 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.840
 the blacks who won because we have 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.789
 here a path since in black that connects 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.129
 the two black edges 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.780
 however, this configuration that we have here 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.980
 it is not enough to show that it is 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.260
 true in all cases we what we 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.269
 wants is to find a reasoning that 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.980
 will make us understand why is this 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.539
 whatever the position of the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.929
 white pawns and black pawns on this 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.150
 tray 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.550
 there will necessarily be a white path 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.530
 a black path 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.640
 so to understand that what I you 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.130
 propose is to start with 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.350
 simplify a little bit the position of 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.299
 this plateau there and to simplify for there 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.640
 to see more clearly somehow we are going 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.890
 remove a number of pions we 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.930
 let's take off all the black pieces already 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.869
 and among the white pawns we are not going 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.100
 keep that those connected to the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.259
 white butter that is here 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.700
 for example the white pawn that is here 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.470
 you see that it is well connected by a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.270
 white path to this pawn at that edge 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.920
 on the other hand that here here it is not 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.610
 connected so we'll remove it then 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.200
 let's take away all his pawns to be 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.750
 see more clearly and to keep only the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.210
 structure of the white pots that touches this 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.590
 board there hop you see that there all this 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.439
 that I remove is either the blacks are 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.659
 whites that did not touch this edge 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.340
 here we remove this one this one is 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.140
 finally we will remove all blacks who 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.579
 are of one we will remove that and in the end 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.310
 so we end up with a structure 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.350
 who only has white pawns 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.969
 like this then there is the structure 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.170
 white pawns that we get from 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.910
 of the starting configuration we 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.200
 had but we could have had another 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.970
 white pawn structure totally 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.830
 different from this one if we were gone 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.160
 from a different starting position 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.600
 for example it would have been possible if the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.530
 starting position had been different 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.330
 that his white pawns that we have here 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.070
 join the opposite bench if by 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.710
 example there had been white pawns 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.020
 lala is there and well ception there they 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.590
 are well connected to that edge there would have 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.330
 been kept 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.150
 in other words in this configuration 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.100
 we see that the whites had won here 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.140
 if once we removed all 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.130
 pieces that were removed we found 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.200
 that there is a white pawn on this line 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.280
 there it would have meant that in 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.510
 the starting position 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.310
 the whites had won because there 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.170
 did have a white line that connected 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.480
 the two white edges only in 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.500
 our configuration that is here well 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.930
 you see that this is not the case the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.100
 whites did not win so since the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.290
 whites did not win that means that 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.090
 necessarily blacks in v win but 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.160
 as we see breast from this 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.170
 line of white pawns and fine to see 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.090
 that what must be noted is that in 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.070
 reality even though we removed some 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.500
 pawns well it's possible to 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.430
 partially restore the position 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.990
 as it was before 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.430
 in particular it is possible to 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.360
 replace a number of pieces 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.040
 black 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.260
 look at this box, for example, 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.489
 find here what color was the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.530
 pawn who were on this square 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 we know they could not be 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.540
 white why are not they 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.420
 could not be white because if he 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.540
 had been white it would have been connected to 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.940
 edges that is there and therefore consequently 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.140
 if it had been connected we would have kept it 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.450
 this pawn that were there and so 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.230
 necessarily black 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.760
 now let's look at the case that is 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.950
 next door here is the same thing 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.830
 if it had been white we would have kept it 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.130
 so he was necessarily black and so 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.220
 after 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.260
 all the boxes that are next to this 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.030
 white blog that we kept his inevitably 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.610
 black because if she had been white 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.260
 we would have kept them otherwise here 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.930
 via a black lead here he assures black 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.510
 here and there there are also black pawns and 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.980
 you see that by doing that it means 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.680
 that in fact this white block that we have 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.810
 kept it is completely encircled by 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.580
 black pawns and in particular he is 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.459
 encircled by a line of black pawns 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.019
 who touch each other after 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.060
 others and seven minutes black pawns 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.980
 she pardoux well she's talking 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.520
 black edge that is here and where is this 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.090
 that she will arrive she will arrive on 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.100
 the other black edge in other words if 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.980
 never the white pawns we had 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.370
 kept do not touch that white edge that 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.990
 is upstairs 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.840
 in other words if whites do not have 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.300
 necessarily won that means they are 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.790
 encircled by a line of black pawns 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.350
 and this line of black pawns forms a 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.870
 path that connects the two black edges 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.060
 that's what we wanted to demonstrate 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.050
 either the whites had won either 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.180
 the whites did not win 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.860
 Well it means that blacks have 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.930
 well earned there can not be two 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.910
 null parts are a white path 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.830
 be a black path be the whites 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.830
 wins either the black wins and that's it
