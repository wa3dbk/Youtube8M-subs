I<00:00:04.160> will<00:00:05.160> be<00:00:05.370> reviewing<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:06.060> Evo<00:00:06.330> fired<00:00:06.810> arrow

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
I will be reviewing the Evo fired arrow

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.620 
I will be reviewing the Evo fired arrow
from<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.950> roof<00:00:08.130> line<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.580> did<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.150> other<00:00:09.360> two

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
from the roof line I did the other two

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.620 
from the roof line I did the other two
previously<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.530> chemic<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.730> medic<00:00:14.630> so

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
previously the chemic and the medic so

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.810 
previously the chemic and the medic so
we<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.109> three<00:00:16.440> vehicles<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.550> set

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
we have three vehicles here in the set

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.380 
we have three vehicles here in the set
we<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> bike<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:19.039> fire<00:00:20.039> truck<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:21.150> ladder

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
we have a bike a fire truck and a ladder

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
we have a bike a fire truck and a ladder
truck<00:00:21.859> so<00:00:22.859> we'll<00:00:22.980> start<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.880> ladder

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
truck so we'll start with the ladder

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.300 
truck so we'll start with the ladder
truck<00:00:24.600> which<00:00:25.080> looks<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.160> those

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
truck which looks like one of those

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.720 
truck which looks like one of those
Airport<00:00:27.000> fire<00:00:27.359> trucks<00:00:28.429> it's<00:00:29.429> got<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> little

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
Airport fire trucks it's got a little

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.670 
Airport fire trucks it's got a little
turret<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.119> top<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.570> doesn't<00:00:30.869> move<00:00:31.610> and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
turret on top that doesn't move and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
turret on top that doesn't move and
that's<00:00:34.680> pretty<00:00:34.829> much<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.630> it's<00:00:36.630> transform

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that's pretty much it so it's transform

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
that's pretty much it so it's transform
it<00:00:37.230> did<00:00:37.530> secondary<00:00:38.100> mode<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.820> open<00:00:39.420> up

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it did secondary mode you just open up

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.610 
it did secondary mode you just open up
the<00:00:39.660> back<00:00:40.160> pull<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:42.079> then<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.230> lift<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the back pull them in then you lift this

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:53.000 
the back pull them in then you lift this
and<00:00:43.890> pulled<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:47.010> needs<00:00:47.309> us<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.739> this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and pulled that in that needs us so this

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.369 
and pulled that in that needs us so this
is<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.610> secondary<00:00:54.120> mode<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.870> called<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
is the secondary mode it's called the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.760 
is the secondary mode it's called the
fire<00:00:55.829> shooter<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.610> believe<00:00:57.289> it's<00:00:58.289> pretty

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
fire shooter I believe it's pretty

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
fire shooter I believe it's pretty
uninspired<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.789> think<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.390> added

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
uninspired and I think this is added

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.529 
uninspired and I think this is added
just<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> secondary<00:01:02.940> bow<00:01:03.180> it's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
just to have a secondary bow it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
just to have a secondary bow it's
obviously<00:01:04.140> gonna<00:01:04.470> become<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> helicopter

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
obviously gonna become the helicopter

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.179 
obviously gonna become the helicopter
eventually<00:01:06.140> I'm<00:01:07.140> stupid<00:01:07.619> looking<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> I'm

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
eventually I'm stupid looking and I'm

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.840 
eventually I'm stupid looking and I'm
not<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> big<00:01:08.790> fan<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
not really a big fan of it so then you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.920 
not really a big fan of it so then you
have<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.420> bike<00:01:13.729> just<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> simple<00:01:15.509> scooter

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
have your bike just a simple scooter

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.050 
have your bike just a simple scooter
that<00:01:16.350> isn't<00:01:16.799> very<00:01:17.689> rescue<00:01:18.689> II<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:20.310> becomes<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that isn't very rescue II it becomes the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.399 
that isn't very rescue II it becomes the
fire<00:01:21.360> hover<00:01:21.689> by<00:01:22.080> folding<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> sled<00:01:23.369> me

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.249 

and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.850> open<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> wings<00:01:31.049> in

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and then you can open up the wings in

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.450 
and then you can open up the wings in
the<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.780> fire<00:01:37.049> hover

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the back so this is the fire hover

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.230 
the back so this is the fire hover
little<00:01:38.460> flying<00:01:38.759> scooter<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> guess<00:01:41.240> then

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
little flying scooter now I guess then

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
little flying scooter now I guess then
finally<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> ladder<00:01:43.140> truck<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:44.100> has

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
finally in the ladder truck which has

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.380 
finally in the ladder truck which has
this<00:01:44.490> articulator<00:01:45.299> arm<00:01:45.479> move<00:01:45.990> around<00:01:47.390> becomes

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
this articulator arm move around becomes

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.010 
this articulator arm move around becomes
the<00:01:48.780> fire<00:01:49.259> spinner<00:01:49.909> by<00:01:50.909> lifting<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.720> thing

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the fire spinner by lifting this thing

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.300 
the fire spinner by lifting this thing
in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.259> back<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.329> opening<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> front

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
in the back and then opening the front

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.399 
in the back and then opening the front
and<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.210> open<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.500> ladder

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
and then you just open up the ladder

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.880 
and then you just open up the ladder
like<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.049> fire<00:02:04.380> spinner

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
like this and this is the fire spinner

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.590 
like this and this is the fire spinner
which<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.460> guess<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.939> supposed<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.420> like

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
which I guess is supposed to be like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.260 
which I guess is supposed to be like
some<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.200> satellite<00:02:07.740> truck<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:09.090> don't

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
some kind of satellite truck they don't

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.609 
some kind of satellite truck they don't
really<00:02:09.450> explain<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.170> any<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.530> this

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
really explain to you what any of this

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.350 
really explain to you what any of this
stuff<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
stuff is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.970 
stuff is
so<00:02:11.540> let's<00:02:12.080> use<00:02:12.260> their<00:02:12.650> imagination<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:15.620> also

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so let's use their imagination that also

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.670 
so let's use their imagination that also
comes<00:02:16.220> with<00:02:16.280> these<00:02:16.490> two<00:02:16.820> claws<00:02:17.440> which<00:02:18.440> has<00:02:18.650> a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
comes with these two claws which has a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.940 
comes with these two claws which has a
larger<00:02:19.310> smaller<00:02:19.730> size<00:02:20.000> claw<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.530> vehicle

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
larger smaller size claw for the vehicle

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.040 
larger smaller size claw for the vehicle
you<00:02:21.980> can<00:02:22.190> attach<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:23.060> smaller<00:02:23.360> one<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.750> for

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
you can attach it the smaller one is for

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.310 
you can attach it the smaller one is for
the<00:02:24.290> little<00:02:24.440> bands<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:26.240> larger<00:02:26.630> one<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:27.020> for

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
the little bands the larger one is for

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.360 
the little bands the larger one is for
the<00:02:27.500> sedan<00:02:27.890> type<00:02:28.190> vehicles<00:02:30.040> finally<00:02:31.040> got<00:02:31.220> this

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
the sedan type vehicles finally got this

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.340 
the sedan type vehicles finally got this
cage<00:02:31.820> that<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.330> can<00:02:32.450> attach<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:33.080> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
cage that you can attach to the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.960 
cage that you can attach to the
underside<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.130> fire<00:02:34.370> darou

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
underside of the fire darou

let's open it up and put a little
vehicle<00:02:37.310> inside<00:02:37.550> if<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.850> want<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.790> to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
vehicle inside if you want to so to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.150 
vehicle inside if you want to so to
combine<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.930> into<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.230> fire<00:02:42.380> ground<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:43.130> just

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
combine it into the fire ground you just

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.270 
combine it into the fire ground you just
pretty<00:02:43.490> much<00:02:43.670> take<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.210> fire<00:02:44.390> shooter<00:02:45.280> fold

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
pretty much take the fire shooter fold

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.570 
pretty much take the fire shooter fold
that<00:02:46.430> part<00:02:46.730> down<00:02:47.830> then<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.980> take<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.340> fire

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
that part down then you take the fire

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.420 
that part down then you take the fire
spinner<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.570> close<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.110> part<00:02:51.380> back<00:02:51.560> up<00:02:51.830> fold

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
spinner and close this part back up fold

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.240 
spinner and close this part back up fold
this<00:02:52.640> back<00:02:52.820> down<00:02:53.860> open<00:02:54.860> up<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.160> rotors<00:02:55.810> and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
this back down open up the rotors and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.130 
this back down open up the rotors and
then<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.490> fold<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.940> front<00:02:59.209> cab<00:02:59.600> part<00:02:59.900> down

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
then you fold the front cab part down

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.740 
then you fold the front cab part down
like<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.100> there's<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.880> little<00:03:02.300> socket

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
like this and there's a little socket

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.430 
like this and there's a little socket
here<00:03:03.430> where<00:03:04.430> these<00:03:05.150> two<00:03:05.209> plugs<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.260> back

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
here where these two plugs in the back

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.910 
here where these two plugs in the back
go<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:11.390> then<00:03:11.990> you<00:03:12.170> simply<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.770> uh

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
go in and then you simply just uh

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.350 
go in and then you simply just uh
transform<00:03:14.739> fire<00:03:15.739> hover<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.430> fold<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.239> front

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
transform fire hover and fold the front

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.040 
transform fire hover and fold the front
part<00:03:17.690> down<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.180> becomes<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.780> rear<00:03:21.019> of

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
part down that this becomes the rear of

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.530 
part down that this becomes the rear of
the<00:03:21.170> helicopter<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.010> that's<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.330> fire

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
the helicopter and that's the fire

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.300 
the helicopter and that's the fire
driver<00:03:23.870> over<00:03:24.170> here<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:26.060> spins<00:03:26.330> like<00:03:26.420> this<00:03:27.310> the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
driver over here it spins like this the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.770 
driver over here it spins like this the
secondary<00:03:28.790> belts<00:03:29.120> don't<00:03:29.269> look<00:03:29.390> good<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:29.750> I

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
secondary belts don't look good but I

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.270 
secondary belts don't look good but I
think<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.140> combined<00:03:30.530> mode<00:03:30.739> actually<00:03:30.980> looks

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
think the combined mode actually looks

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.220 
think the combined mode actually looks
like<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.430> pretty<00:03:31.550> good<00:03:31.760> helicopter

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
like a pretty good helicopter

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
like a pretty good helicopter
considering<00:03:33.230> it's<00:03:33.350> three<00:03:33.739> land<00:03:33.980> vehicles<00:03:36.250> so

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
considering it's three land vehicles so

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.370 
considering it's three land vehicles so
then<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:37.610> take<00:03:37.790> these<00:03:37.970> two<00:03:38.360> claws<00:03:38.660> which<00:03:39.170> have

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
then you take these two claws which have

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.140 
then you take these two claws which have
these<00:03:39.530> little<00:03:39.769> pegs<00:03:39.950> here<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.550> they<00:03:40.880> go<00:03:41.000> into

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
these little pegs here and they go into

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:49.860 
these little pegs here and they go into
the<00:03:41.239> ports<00:03:41.660> on<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.900> side

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.740 

and<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.910> now<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.120> have<00:03:52.360> these<00:03:52.480> two<00:03:52.540> little

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
and so now you have these two little

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.030 
and so now you have these two little
claws<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.590> here

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
claws on here

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.770 
claws on here
and<00:03:54.550> what<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.849> do<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.239> take<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.599> other

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
and what you do is you take the other

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:04.080 
and what you do is you take the other
two<00:03:56.080> vehicle<00:04:01.410> take<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:03.160> fire<00:04:03.430> chemic<00:04:03.940> and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
two vehicle take the fire chemic and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.410 
two vehicle take the fire chemic and
medic<00:04:04.390> right<00:04:04.720> here<00:04:05.910> this<00:04:06.910> transform<00:04:07.660> um<00:04:09.420> like

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
medic right here this transform um like

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.710 
medic right here this transform um like
this<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:13.330> this<00:04:13.720> is<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.230> fire<00:04:14.680> chemic<00:04:15.549> or<00:04:16.120> fire

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
this so this is the fire chemic or fire

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:27.900 
this so this is the fire chemic or fire
medic<00:04:17.109> this<00:04:18.100> is<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.310> fire<00:04:18.669> chemic<00:04:26.910> and

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
medic this is a fire chemic and

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.909 
medic this is a fire chemic and
basically<00:04:28.570> just<00:04:28.990> attach<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:35.770> get

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
basically just attach it and you get

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.810 
basically just attach it and you get
your<00:04:36.690> your<00:04:37.690> flying<00:04:38.290> scorpion<00:04:39.070> helicopter

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
your your flying scorpion helicopter

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.300 
your your flying scorpion helicopter
thing<00:04:40.060> i<00:04:40.440> don't<00:04:41.440> really<00:04:41.530> understand<00:04:42.130> the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
thing i don't really understand the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.790 
thing i don't really understand the
point<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.700> attaching<00:04:43.270> two<00:04:43.990> trucks<00:04:44.289> as<00:04:44.470> arms

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
point of attaching two trucks as arms

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.610 
point of attaching two trucks as arms
but<00:04:45.130> it's<00:04:45.550> kind<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:45.880> cool-looking<00:04:46.440> it's<00:04:47.440> got

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
but it's kind of cool-looking it's got

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.469 
but it's kind of cool-looking it's got
some<00:04:48.400> decent<00:04:48.820> articulation<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:52.330> then

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
some decent articulation and then

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.379 
some decent articulation and then
finally<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:53.080> can<00:04:53.370> pull<00:04:54.370> out<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:54.760> last<00:04:55.090> peg

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
finally you can pull out this last peg

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:08.159 
finally you can pull out this last peg
here<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.490> then<00:04:57.490> attach<00:04:57.850> this<00:04:58.150> cage<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:07.180> there

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
here and then attach this cage and there

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:14.190 
here and then attach this cage and there
you<00:05:08.289> have<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:09.240> fire<00:05:10.240> gyro<00:05:11.460> flying<00:05:13.200> robot

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
you have it a fire gyro flying robot

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.760 
you have it a fire gyro flying robot
