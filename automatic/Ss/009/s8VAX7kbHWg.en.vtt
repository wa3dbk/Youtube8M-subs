the<00:00:34.739> face<00:00:35.100> if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.550> look<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> perimeter

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the face if you look at the perimeter

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.229 
the face if you look at the perimeter
and<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> bone<00:00:37.110> structure<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> face<00:00:38.239> one

and the bone structure of the face one
way<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> determine<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:42.149> hold<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
way to determine it is to hold a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.869 
way to determine it is to hold a
straight<00:00:43.020> edge<00:00:43.230> next<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> face<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.280> see

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
straight edge next to the face and see

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.619 
straight edge next to the face and see
if<00:00:45.270> you're<00:00:45.660> noticing<00:00:46.250> straight<00:00:47.250> lines<00:00:47.579> or<00:00:48.000> if

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
if you're noticing straight lines or if

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.900 
if you're noticing straight lines or if
instead<00:00:49.200> you're<00:00:49.530> getting<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.370> gradual

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
instead you're getting a more gradual

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.950 
instead you're getting a more gradual
contoured<00:00:53.910> shape<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> face<00:00:56.719> another<00:00:57.719> way

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
contoured shape to the face another way

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.220 
contoured shape to the face another way
that<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.680> tell<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.640> actually<00:01:00.000> hold<00:01:00.780> up

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that you can tell is to actually hold up

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.670 
that you can tell is to actually hold up
patterns<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> face<00:01:03.199> here<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
patterns to the face here you see a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
patterns to the face here you see a
contoured<00:01:05.519> pattern<00:01:07.040> here<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.520> an<00:01:08.729> angled

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
contoured pattern here you see an angled

contoured pattern here you see an angled
pattern<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.280> also<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:13.080> more

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
pattern you can also do that with more

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.850 
pattern you can also do that with more
simple<00:01:13.740> shapes<00:01:14.040> such<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.000> these<00:01:15.860> contoured

were angled the angles in this pattern

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.990 
were angled the angles in this pattern
would<00:01:25.290> bring<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> bone<00:01:26.189> structure<00:01:26.820> make

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
would bring out the bone structure make

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.140 
would bring out the bone structure make
it<00:01:27.150> look<00:01:27.360> stronger<00:01:27.780> more<00:01:28.170> vital<00:01:28.820> but<00:01:29.820> since

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it look stronger more vital but since

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.469 
it look stronger more vital but since
her<00:01:30.329> face<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.840> contoured<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.479> you've

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
her face is contoured and you've

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
her face is contoured and you've
probably<00:01:33.720> noticed<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.680> did<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:34.979> see

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
probably noticed that you did not see

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.359 
probably noticed that you did not see
those<00:01:35.430> distinct<00:01:36.030> lines<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.630> angles<00:01:37.369> then

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
those distinct lines and the angles then

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.480 
those distinct lines and the angles then
it<00:01:38.970> looks<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.360> little<00:01:39.479> harsh<00:01:39.930> instead<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it looks a little harsh instead and the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.840 
it looks a little harsh instead and the
contoured<00:01:42.060> pattern<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.630> more<00:01:42.840> harmonious<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
contoured pattern is more harmonious the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.690 
contoured pattern is more harmonious the
same<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.840> true<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:47.100> kinds

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
same is going to be true for all kinds

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.219 
same is going to be true for all kinds
of<00:01:47.790> patterns<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.600> neck<00:01:48.780> lines<00:01:49.640> for<00:01:51.229> jewelry

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
of patterns for neck lines for jewelry

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
of patterns for neck lines for jewelry
and<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:54.060> course<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.899> glasses<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and of course for glasses so here you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.050 
and of course for glasses so here you
can<00:01:57.450> see<00:01:57.750> with<00:01:57.960> scarves<00:01:58.350> how<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.640> angled

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
can see with scarves how the angled

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.219 
can see with scarves how the angled
pattern<00:02:00.590> looks<00:02:01.590> harsh<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:03.600> contoured

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
pattern looks harsh the contoured

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.459 
pattern looks harsh the contoured
pattern<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:05.240> more<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.540> softer<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.200> more

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
pattern is more is softer and more

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.499 
pattern is more is softer and more
enhancing<00:02:08.340> for<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.879> shape<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.300> her<00:02:09.450> face

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
enhancing for the shape of her face

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.000 
enhancing for the shape of her face
so<00:02:12.420> you've<00:02:13.420> probably<00:02:13.780> heard<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.500> opposite

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
so you've probably heard the opposite

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.789 
so you've probably heard the opposite
and<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.370> may<00:02:15.580> hear<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.090> again<00:02:16.330> but<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.590> can

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
and you may hear it again but you can

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.550 
and you may hear it again but you can
see<00:02:18.040> by<00:02:18.069> what<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.519> just<00:02:18.909> showed<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.690> it's

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
see by what I just showed you that it's

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.100 
see by what I just showed you that it's
better<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.010> repeat<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.970> overall<00:02:22.480> lines<00:02:22.840> of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
better to repeat the overall lines of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.710 
better to repeat the overall lines of
the<00:02:23.230> face<00:02:23.440> then<00:02:24.239> contradict<00:02:25.239> them<00:02:25.420> with<00:02:25.599> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
the face then contradict them with the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.520 
the face then contradict them with the
opposite<00:02:26.349> shape<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:27.819> other<00:02:28.150> words<00:02:28.569> if<00:02:28.930> your

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
opposite shape in other words if your

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.380 
opposite shape in other words if your
face<00:02:29.769> is<00:02:29.799> contoured<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.849> want<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.120> go<00:02:31.239> with

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
face is contoured you want to go with
