00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
this ritual and then we suddenly thought

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.349 
this ritual and then we suddenly thought
oh<00:00:22.320> maybe<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.369> wasn't<00:00:23.640> such<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.970> good<00:00:24.210> idea

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
