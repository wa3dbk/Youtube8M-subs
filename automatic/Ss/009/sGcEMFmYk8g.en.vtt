work very good on a black background and

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.240 
work very good on a black background and
duplicate<00:00:45.989> four<00:00:46.950> rows<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:48.210> five<00:00:50.300> copy<00:00:51.300> these

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
duplicate four rows of five copy these

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.650 
duplicate four rows of five copy these
paste<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.070> make<00:00:56.070> another<00:00:56.309> barricade<00:00:56.940> paste

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.119 

okay<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.719> we've<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.020> three<00:01:01.260> barricades<00:01:01.829> here

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
okay so we've got three barricades here

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.340 
okay so we've got three barricades here
kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> line<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.420> looks

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
kind of line them up a little bit looks

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.590 
kind of line them up a little bit looks
decent<00:01:05.900> okay<00:01:06.900> let's<00:01:07.110> duplicate<00:01:07.320> our<00:01:07.920> invader

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
decent okay let's duplicate our invader

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.700 
decent okay let's duplicate our invader
how<00:01:09.600> about<00:01:10.020> three<00:01:10.680> rows<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.070> 10<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:13.409> looks

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
how about three rows of 10 that looks

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
how about three rows of 10 that looks
pretty<00:01:13.950> good<00:01:14.180> okay<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.450> all

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
pretty good okay these are all

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.679 
pretty good okay these are all
duplicates<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.670> object<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
duplicates so I just have one object and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.359 
duplicates so I just have one object and
we'll<00:01:19.020> set<00:01:19.290> its<00:01:19.590> movement<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.420> invader

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
we'll set its movement to be invader

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
we'll set its movement to be invader
that's<00:01:23.369> pretty<00:01:23.640> simple<00:01:24.090> let's<00:01:24.659> elect<00:01:24.840> our

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
that's pretty simple let's elect our

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
that's pretty simple let's elect our
player<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> select<00:01:26.490> its<00:01:26.850> movement

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
player I'm going to select its movement

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.800 
player I'm going to select its movement
to<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.570> eight<00:01:27.780> direction<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.270> just<00:01:30.270> left<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to be eight direction and just left and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.969 
to be eight direction and just left and
right<00:01:31.549> let's<00:01:32.549> run<00:01:32.880> our<00:01:32.909> game<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.680> can<00:01:34.680> move<00:01:34.799> our

player via the arrow keys and our
invaders<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.900> moving<00:01:39.900> across<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.590> down<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
invaders are moving across and down the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
invaders are moving across and down the
screen<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:42.979> let's<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.460> shooting<00:01:45.390> so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
I'm going to do a new condition and test

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.609 
I'm going to do a new condition and test
for<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.229> space<00:01:55.380> key<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.909> launch<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:58.049> object

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
for the space key and launch an object

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.100 
for the space key and launch an object
and<00:01:58.829> that'll<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.189> shot<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.880> it'll<00:02:00.869> launch

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and that'll be the shot and it'll launch

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
and that'll be the shot and it'll launch
oops<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> launch<00:02:04.649> straight<00:02:05.100> up

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
oops it is going to launch straight up

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.420 
oops it is going to launch straight up
okay<00:02:07.750> now<00:02:08.350> we<00:02:08.410> need<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.830> test<00:02:09.040> for<00:02:09.160> when<00:02:09.340> the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
okay now we need to test for when the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.980 
okay now we need to test for when the
shot<00:02:09.700> hits<00:02:10.150> the<00:02:10.479> invader<00:02:12.180> shot<00:02:13.180> collides<00:02:13.720> with

shot hits the invader shot collides with

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.690 
shot hits the invader shot collides with
the<00:02:14.440> invader<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.720> will<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:17.700> destroyed

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
the invader and this will be destroyed

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.570 
the invader and this will be destroyed
the<00:02:18.910> shot<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.680> let's<00:02:20.680> create<00:02:20.980> an<00:02:21.370> explosion

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
the shot and let's create an explosion

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.750 
the shot and let's create an explosion
relative<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.060> invader<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:27.580> let's

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
relative to the invader and then let's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
our game see how we look okay this is

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.330 
our game see how we look okay this is
looking<00:02:46.780> pretty<00:02:46.960> good<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:49.950> couple<00:02:50.950> things<00:02:51.070> I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
looking pretty good a couple things I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.820 
looking pretty good a couple things I
don't<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.810> invaders<00:02:53.560> aren't

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
don't like is the invaders aren't

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.070 
don't like is the invaders aren't
shooting<00:02:54.010> back<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.540> shoot<00:02:55.720> as<00:02:55.870> many

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
shooting back and I can shoot as many

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.390 
shooting back and I can shoot as many
shots<00:02:56.440> as<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.800> want<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:58.660> by<00:02:59.100> pressing<00:03:00.100> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
shots as I want just by pressing the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.740 
shots as I want just by pressing the
space<00:03:00.670> key<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.210> let's<00:03:01.420> limit<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:06.750> compare

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
space key so let's limit this compare

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.840 
space key so let's limit this compare
the<00:03:07.840> number<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.170> shot<00:03:08.380> objects<00:03:09.300> lower<00:03:10.300> than

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
the number of shot objects lower than

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.100 
the number of shot objects lower than
three<00:03:17.820> now<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.880> reason<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.360> only<00:03:19.480> see<00:03:19.720> two<00:03:19.930> on

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
three now the reason you only see two on

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.840 
three now the reason you only see two on
the<00:03:20.230> screen<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.770> because<00:03:21.100> we<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.280> one

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
the screen is because we have one

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.550 
the screen is because we have one
off-screen<00:03:22.660> over<00:03:23.350> here<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:25.959> can<00:03:26.050> just<00:03:26.350> do<00:03:26.530> a

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
off-screen over here so I can just do a

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.510 
off-screen over here so I can just do a
start<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:27.010> frame<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.870> destroy<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.400> see<00:03:30.400> what

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
start a frame and destroy it see what

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.150 
start a frame and destroy it see what
happens<00:03:30.850> now<00:03:31.200> now<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.560> see<00:03:32.770> three<00:03:33.070> of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
happens now now you can see three of

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.670 
happens now now you can see three of
them<00:03:33.310> on<00:03:33.430> our<00:03:33.459> play<00:03:33.910> field<00:03:34.260> okay<00:03:35.260> let's<00:03:35.470> make

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
them on our play field okay let's make

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.180 
them on our play field okay let's make
our<00:03:35.860> invader<00:03:36.250> shoot<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.959> I'm<00:03:38.620> going<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:38.860> clone

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
our invader shoot and I'm going to clone

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.960 
our invader shoot and I'm going to clone
this<00:03:39.430> object<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.500> I'm<00:03:41.500> going<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:42.070> open<00:03:42.430> up<00:03:42.700> the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
this object and I'm going to open up the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.640 
this object and I'm going to open up the
editor<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.690> I'm<00:03:43.750> going<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.930> make<00:03:44.080> this<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.290> red

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
editor and I'm going to make this a red

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.729 
editor and I'm going to make this a red
bullet<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:46.270> it<00:03:46.390> matches<00:03:46.600> our<00:03:48.510> invaders<00:03:49.739> and

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
bullet so it matches our invaders and

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.930 
bullet so it matches our invaders and
they're<00:03:51.489> going<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.730> do<00:03:52.320> say<00:03:53.320> every<00:03:53.890> hips<00:03:55.590> every

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
they're going to do say every hips every

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.500 
they're going to do say every hips every
50th<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.300> second<00:03:59.130> and<00:04:00.130> then<00:04:01.090> we'll<00:04:01.239> pick<00:04:01.480> one

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
50th of a second and then we'll pick one

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.970 
50th of a second and then we'll pick one
of<00:04:01.810> these<00:04:01.900> at<00:04:02.110> random<00:04:04.410> they<00:04:05.410> are<00:04:05.560> going<00:04:05.830> to

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
of these at random they are going to

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.220 
of these at random they are going to
launch<00:04:06.850> an<00:04:07.060> object<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:07.780> that's<00:04:07.900> going<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.080> be

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
launch an object and that's going to be

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.229 
launch an object and that's going to be
shot<00:04:08.470> number<00:04:08.739> two<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.730> they're<00:04:10.060> going<00:04:10.180> to

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
shot number two and they're going to

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.640 
shot number two and they're going to
launch<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.800> downwards<00:04:13.380> okay<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.440> now<00:04:14.620> let's

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
launch it downwards okay so now let's

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.060 
launch it downwards okay so now let's
test<00:04:15.130> for<00:04:15.400> this<00:04:15.519> shot<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:16.630> collide<00:04:17.079> with

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
test for this shot to collide with

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.420 
test for this shot to collide with
the<00:04:18.130> player<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:19.860> let's<00:04:20.860> create<00:04:21.100> an<00:04:21.280> object

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
the player and let's create an object

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.170 
the player and let's create an object
the<00:04:21.940> explosion<00:04:23.730> relative<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.330> player<00:04:25.810> and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
the explosion relative to the player and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.470 
the explosion relative to the player and
let's<00:04:28.180> destroy<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.900> shot<00:04:29.170> and<00:04:30.210> then<00:04:31.210> let's

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
let's destroy the shot and then let's

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.200 
let's destroy the shot and then let's
just<00:04:31.720> destroy<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.170> player<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:33.070> now<00:04:33.210> let's

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
just destroy the player and now let's

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.280 
just destroy the player and now let's
test<00:04:34.690> for<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.290> shot<00:04:35.710> collides<00:04:36.370> with<00:04:36.790> the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
test for the shot collides with the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.660 
test for the shot collides with the
barricade<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:39.340> let's<00:04:40.330> destroy<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.930> shot<00:04:41.170> and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
barricade and let's destroy the shot and

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.540 
barricade and let's destroy the shot and
destroy<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:42.880> barricade<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:45.220> think<00:04:45.430> we're

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
barricade my shots are destroying them

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.520 
barricade my shots are destroying them
and<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:56.170> if<00:04:56.290> they<00:04:56.440> shoot<00:04:56.500> me<00:04:57.240> I'm<00:04:58.240> destroyed<00:04:58.780> so
