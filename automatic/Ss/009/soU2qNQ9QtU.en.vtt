 this is going to give you download now and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.130
 we're going to save this file and we're going 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 to execute as I had already told you 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.610
 we execute everything all right until it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 run and leave us a file in the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.040
 desk remember to verify the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 Doves since sometimes they have things 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
 that we do not want so 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.350
 please read it well after our 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.899
 hamachi has been downloaded and we have 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.660
 executed will be something like this 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.940
 where increase a little window like that and we 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 will follow an orange arrow that does not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.170
 we are going to have to give this button 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.980
 this after having replicated this 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.410
 button is going away 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.780
 we are seen to be verified and all this 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.909
 is not there all this synchronizing and 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.729
 after this we will open another 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.440
 window that is from the same hamachi and we 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.240
 going out there is going to ask us to 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.890
 let's enter the name that we 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.490
 We want in my case I have chosen Luis 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.369
 fz with a happy face because I like it 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.550
 and this is the ip of 4 and all this 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.050
 we're going to need now to create a 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.740
 server what we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.450
 network join create a new network let's 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.030

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.619
 put this can be any name 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.600

 we are going to give you create now as you can 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.610
 see ya are going to create the hamas network 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.560
 and now if you give two clicks it is removed 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.660
 disconnect from this today if you give another 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.280
 once two click is reconnected 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.320
 now when a friend wants to join 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.420
 your network what you are going to have to do is going to 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.210
 be join an existing network put the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.580
 name of your network that in case is the one of 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.920
 luisa visit here they are going to put it here 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.130
 and the password that in this case is 1 2 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.470
 3 4 5 after they are gone 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.380
 your name will appear from your network ever 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.569
 and here in green just like the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.840
 yours or in red if it is busy 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.970
 so good now after this I 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.310
 let's minimize already created the network we 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.790
 let's go to the Leon game 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.049
 we will give you start new game 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.030
 and remember here is to put the map or 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.150
 things that you want now 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.909
 remember to give it in the type of game that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.260
 you want that if you downloaded it from 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.230
 milan that is his own where the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.340
 sandbox the stop and they are demand and the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.250
 terrorist although in this case it will be 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.430
 but it's very good now to start the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.769
 we are going to have to start 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.389
 start new game and here we are going to choose the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.969
 map that we want or in which 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:58.810
 let's play I do not recommend that 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:01.060
 none of the proposals is the dt since 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.650
 these there is no way in which 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.120
 can convert the character in the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.909
 deep so I recommend that it is 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.060
 the map with like this one after this 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.919
 let's see the players that yesterday 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.599
 as a player two players four 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.099
 players here all the players that 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.930
 you want but I tell them not 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.900
 put it more than 16 since they are going 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.060
 life very much the server less than 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.230
 that computer is very good me in 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.120
 this case I'm going to put it two 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.040
 players so because nothing else is 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.850
 a test and we will give you start new 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.010
 game 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.170
 very well now we are going to create the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.580
 server or the world loading resources and 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.850
 all this so that the other players 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.650
 can enter remember that before 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.950
 players can enter their 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.010
 server already have to have the this 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:52.090
 hamas guys installed and the entry into 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:56.040
 his entrance forgiveness in his in his session 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.200
 good in his network of hamas and vale 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.969
 in this case, then you can not 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.489
 because I can not because I do not have 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:05.360
 with nobody right now so let's give 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.540
 In my case the junteros 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.370
 and so your friends and already good here already 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.650
 is the game is already well done 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.330
 and now for those friends can 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.450
 join this game what they will have to 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.060
 do is going to be enter in as well as 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.739
 this gives new game and put the map that 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.440
 they want but in a single player 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.230
 ok after this you are going to have to 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.760
 chop like that and they're going to have to put 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.800
 this code that I'm obviously going to 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.720
 leave in the description and they will have it 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.580
 what to put in after having omitted it 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.040
 they're going to hit 11 and we'll turn the 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.880
 console here they're going to have to give you in 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.350
 connect and they're going to have to open the 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.900
 hamchi and put the ip of 4 that will be 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.640
 here in the eastern name of the leader of the 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.919
 group that is obviously going to be going to 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.160
 open the server you are going to have to give 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.810
 two right click on your name and it appears 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.470
 an option that says copy address 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.210
 ipv4 tv4 true 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.520
 after this we 're going to hit him and 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.410
 we're going to have to accept now 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.529
 after this we are going to 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.769
 start charging your friend 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:14.619
 They will see that they will be let in if there 

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:17.379
 some little problem out there that 

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:19.779
 they fail or they can not enter you know 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.389
 leave the description my sky is the same 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:24.309
 downstairs inhabiting let me in because the 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.779
 server development when I 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:31.179
 I left and there is no server or when entering 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:33.909
 remember that the forces need 

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:37.569
 put the code when they write and when 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.639
 your friends enter a server or a 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.579
 enter a game they will only have 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.169
 that chop and agones have inside that the 

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:48.460
 code 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:51.759
 and then it is already and the code and already 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.159
 is after the code then 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.529
 we put the f 11 and we will open the 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.990
 console if by chance your computer 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:01.900
 do not grab the defense or open some other 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.469
 thing that is not the console then of the spf 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.080
 11 this makes the f 11 is work 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:10.840
 for this application it is worth with the chip 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.689
 efe 11 so they opened the console they put 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:20.169
 connect and the and the ipv4 of your leader 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.930
 of succession so well I hope that you 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:27.430
 have understood any question 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.960
 error comment put it down on the in 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.150
 the comments 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.770
 and also add is that there is in case 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.139
 have some other problem that then 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.560
 they can not fix that would be 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.710
 all 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.270
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.270
 in the next goodbye friends
