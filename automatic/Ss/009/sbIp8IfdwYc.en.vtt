00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.720
 came a group from Guadalajara here 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.180
 ferris program lively came to 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.970
 try to give an explanation of why 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.100
 why do we have so much crime in the 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.900
 country there have to be many 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.470
 explanations of an economic nature and 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.960
 I understand that but there is one in the order 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 socially worthwhile that the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.749
 let's understand, it's called parental alienation 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.079
 what does this mean 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:32.079
 alienation comes from eileen the link is 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.550
 a Martian- like species that 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.590
 presents even you have seen it in 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.829
 some movies when you talk about 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.739
 someone who comes from 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.920
 out of our planet and that is a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.710
 perfect weird not only weird 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.949
 but also enemy alienation 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 is generated between societies 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:57.930
 of man when breakdowns come 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.309
 marriages that force the couple to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.869
 separate and with that to that the dad 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:10.319
 could talk badly about mom or mom 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:15.149
 speak ill of the father before the children and 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:18.630
 this can bring a phenomenon that if the 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.649
 son product of this bad information 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.229
 that he receives from a father or a mother 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:28.950
 begins to produce in your little mind 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.649
 from small begins to produce a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.260
 phenomenon of rejection and lack of 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.410
 respect 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:41.150
 and then in his childhood that's when he 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.370
 gesta its character has a principle that 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.370
 for the rest of his life he will be 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.710
 repeating if he does not respect his father 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.220
 because his mother told him that his father did not 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.220
 was respectable or upside down this child or 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.230
 girl saying no to mom, what do you think? 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.990
 you're a messenger you do not even talk to me 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:05.150
 or there is a lack of minimum respect 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.110
 necessary in a coexistence that sometimes 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.190
 alienation is non-existent 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.060
 parental part of a childhood that when 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.020
 you are an adult that child is no longer 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.010
 will be able to respect anyone and the 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.920
 do not do it then comes the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.860
 criminality scams kidnappings 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.709
 because there is no appreciation for the life of a 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.959
 third if there was not for your father or for 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.210
 your mother as there will be for the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.540
 the rest 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.660
 how can this process be inhibited 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.470
 make your child see a parent or a 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.650
 mother as an alien as an alien or as 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.740
 an alien would be in Spanish 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.500
 simply by making parents 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.940
 make that when a break comes the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.910
 magic that does not come from one to 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.030
 the other of your partner a lack of 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.590
 Respect reflected in the children 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.430
 this principle can be the basis of the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:19.900
 correction of the tear rupture of the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.900
 social fabric in mexico in many places 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.650
 of the world this is a phenomenon in mexico 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.920
 it has multiplied 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.000
 it's worth thinking about many of you 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.000
 they are in that condition
