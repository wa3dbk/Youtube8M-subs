handling<00:05:30.700> like<00:05:30.820> hunter<00:05:31.210> does<00:05:31.419> that's<00:05:32.260> when

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
handling like hunter does that's when

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.250 
handling like hunter does that's when
you<00:05:32.590> go<00:05:32.740> to<00:05:33.120> right<00:05:34.120> here<00:05:34.360> and<00:05:34.539> disable<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.200> i

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
you go to right here and disable it i

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.140 
you go to right here and disable it i
would<00:05:38.260> disable<00:05:38.560> break<00:05:38.889> handling<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:39.610> just

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
would disable break handling and just

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.520 
would disable break handling and just
you<00:05:40.450> know<00:05:40.479> do<00:05:40.840> your<00:05:41.020> own<00:05:41.080> breaks<00:05:41.349> because

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
you know do your own breaks because

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.830 
you know do your own breaks because
usually<00:05:41.889> break<00:05:42.280> handlers<00:05:42.729> just<00:05:42.940> screw<00:05:43.270> up<00:05:43.419> but

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
usually break handlers just screw up but

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.800 
usually break handlers just screw up but
