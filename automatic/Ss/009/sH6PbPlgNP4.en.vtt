probably would have got cancelled shit

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.730 
probably would have got cancelled shit
she<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.930> didn't<00:01:37.200> grab<00:01:37.470> an

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
she not because it didn't grab an

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770
