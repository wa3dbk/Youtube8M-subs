stair climbing robot this you go through

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.310 
stair climbing robot this you go through
it<00:00:25.170> mace<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:26.130> actually<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.760> mini<00:00:27.090> DARPA<00:00:27.630> so

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it mace it's actually a mini DARPA so

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.510 
it mace it's actually a mini DARPA so
you<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> go<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.130> coupla<00:00:31.040> through<00:00:32.040> water

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you have to go to a coupla through water

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060 
you have to go to a coupla through water
sand<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.270> stuff<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.840> grass<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
sand and stuff like that grass and a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670 
sand and stuff like that grass and a
ramp<00:00:35.670> wrap<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.510> then<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> end<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.469> finally

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
ramp wrap and then at the end it finally

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.700 
ramp wrap and then at the end it finally
climbs<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.610> stairs<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.329> stops<00:00:39.780> yeah<00:00:40.410> about

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
climbs to stairs and stops yeah about

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
climbs to stairs and stops yeah about
all<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> other<00:00:41.250> robot<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.850> battle<00:00:42.180> other

all the other robot and battle other

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.529 
all the other robot and battle other
robots<00:00:42.750> yeah<00:00:42.930> by<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.800> letting<00:00:43.950> them<00:00:44.129> up

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
robots yeah by not letting them up

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.549 
robots yeah by not letting them up
underneath<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> lifting

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
underneath you can see the lifting

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
underneath you can see the lifting
motors<00:00:47.460> right<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.399> there's<00:00:51.180> another

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
motors right here and there's another

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.880 
motors right here and there's another
one<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> front<00:00:53.840> right<00:00:54.840> there<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.680> those

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
one in the front right there and those

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.490 
one in the front right there and those
are<00:00:55.920> control<00:00:56.520> these<00:00:56.730> these<00:00:57.660> arms<00:00:58.140> right<00:00:58.469> here

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
are control these these arms right here

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.400 
are control these these arms right here
and<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.760> front<00:01:00.090> arm<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.480> let's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and this front arm right here let's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.070 
and this front arm right here let's
actually<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> climbing<00:01:03.080> these

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
actually do this the climbing these

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.380 
actually do this the climbing these
tracks<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:07.140> controlled<00:01:08.100> by<00:01:08.280> these

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
tracks right here I controlled by these

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
tracks right here I controlled by these
these<00:01:09.390> two<00:01:09.689> motors<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.920> guess<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
these two motors right here I guess you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.280 
these two motors right here I guess you
can't<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> motors<00:01:12.900> too<00:01:13.049> well<00:01:13.170> but

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
can't really see the motors too well but

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.280 
can't really see the motors too well but
you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> gearbox<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:15.290> output

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you can see the gearbox and output

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.350 
you can see the gearbox and output
shafts<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.890> control<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.369> tracks<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.119> keep

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
shafts that control the tracks and keep

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
shafts that control the tracks and keep
them<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> same<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.189> really

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
them the same and then you like really

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
them the same and then you like really
sign<00:01:20.880> oh<00:01:22.610> here's<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.700> beige<00:01:23.880> bridge<00:01:24.240> okay<00:01:24.960> yeah

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
sign oh here's a beige bridge okay yeah

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
sign oh here's a beige bridge okay yeah
then<00:01:25.380> you'll<00:01:25.799> explain<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.369> about<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.759> H

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
then you'll explain a little about the H

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.990 
then you'll explain a little about the H
bridges<00:01:27.530> 14<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.710> h-bridge<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.880> the

bridges 14 up h-bridge the one in the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.890 
bridges 14 up h-bridge the one in the
green<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> 2<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.900> channel

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
green one then this is a 2 of channel

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.140 
green one then this is a 2 of channel
both<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.259> my<00:01:34.350> two<00:01:34.500> channels<00:01:34.890> channel<00:01:35.460> we

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
both of my two channels channel we

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
both of my two channels channel we
needed<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> fortune<00:01:36.900> m'sieu<00:01:37.560> lift<00:01:38.460> lifting

channel<00:01:41.790> down<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.750> stall<00:01:42.990> torque<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.439> higher

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
channel down the stall torque was higher

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.359 
channel down the stall torque was higher
than<00:01:44.369> these<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.090> ones<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.369> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
than these two ones that we have and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.920 
than these two ones that we have and
burned<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.790> few<00:01:47.939> motors<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.570> oh<00:01:48.720> yeah

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
burned up a few motors that way oh yeah

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.490 
burned up a few motors that way oh yeah
and<00:01:49.920> there's<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.759> hand<00:01:51.210> word<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.930> connect<00:01:52.290> we

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and there's the hand word we connect we

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
and there's the hand word we connect we
use<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> programming<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.670> everything

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
use all the programming and everything

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.810 
use all the programming and everything
we<00:01:54.360> programming<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.320> thing<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.159> then

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
we programming that thing and and then

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090 
we programming that thing and and then
it<00:01:57.000> has<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> lot<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> outputs<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.350> controlled

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it has a lot of outputs that controlled

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.560 
it has a lot of outputs that controlled
H<00:01:59.280> bridges<00:01:59.790> and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.120 
and emitters infrared that track a line
by<00:02:11.420> comparing<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> values<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.260> there's

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
by comparing the values and there's

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.620 
by comparing the values and there's
different<00:02:14.400> values<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.940> black<00:02:15.150> line<00:02:15.390> and

different values for a black line and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.530 
different values for a black line and
then<00:02:15.720> say<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.230> white<00:02:16.800> circle<00:02:17.070> serve<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:18.390> this

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
then say a white circle serve in this

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.780 
then say a white circle serve in this
case<00:02:18.750> 10<00:02:19.050> yeah<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.100> works<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.430> both<00:02:20.490> ways

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
case 10 yeah but it works for both ways

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.720 
case 10 yeah but it works for both ways
oh<00:02:21.120> yeah<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.140> switch<00:02:22.500> yeah<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.100> switch<00:02:23.430> is

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
oh yeah the switch yeah the switch is

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.280 
oh yeah the switch yeah the switch is
when<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.330> hits<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.580> wall<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
when it hits this this the wall it's the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.100 
when it hits this this the wall it's the
climbing<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> Tennyson<00:02:29.490> turns<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.570> then

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
climbing the Tennyson turns on and then

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.140 
climbing the Tennyson turns on and then
it's<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.070> hits<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> wall<00:02:32.490> like<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.670> and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
it's so it hits the wall like that and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.030 
it's so it hits the wall like that and
then<00:02:33.480> engages<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.140> switch<00:02:34.380> everything<00:02:34.800> goes

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
then engages the switch everything goes

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.530 
then engages the switch everything goes
on<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.820> climbing<00:02:36.150> mechanism

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
on and then the climbing mechanism

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.180 
on and then the climbing mechanism
starts<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.470> after<00:02:37.680> get<00:02:37.980> suitable

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
starts so this is after get suitable

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.300 
starts so this is after get suitable
course<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.940> guys<00:02:39.090> see<00:02:39.360> how<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.690> goes<00:02:39.870> okay

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
course and you guys see how it goes okay

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.729 
course and you guys see how it goes okay
well<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.850> will<00:02:42.150> start<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.630> new<00:02:42.780> video<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.350> show

well we will start a new video and show
you<00:02:43.800> how<00:02:43.890> actually<00:02:44.400> claims<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.630> momentarily
