body<00:01:37.860> check<00:01:38.159> video<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> be

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
body check video so I'm not going to be

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.410 
body check video so I'm not going to be
talking<00:01:41.400> about<00:01:41.579> how<00:01:41.729> many<00:01:41.909> pounds<00:01:42.090> I've<00:01:42.390> lost

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
talking about how many pounds I've lost

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.749 
talking about how many pounds I've lost
at<00:01:42.840> least<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.470> maybe<00:01:43.950> once<00:01:44.310> i<00:01:44.430> get

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
at least not right now maybe once i get

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.050 
at least not right now maybe once i get
like<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.979> significant<00:01:46.979> amount<00:01:47.159> i<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.759> weight

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
like to a significant amount i do weight

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.020 
like to a significant amount i do weight
training<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.950> scale<00:01:50.250> could<00:01:50.640> fluctuate

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
training so the scale could fluctuate

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.920 
training so the scale could fluctuate
because<00:01:51.780> muscle<00:01:52.680> weighs<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:53.070> than<00:01:53.430> fat<00:01:53.930> so

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
because muscle weighs more than fat so

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.990 
because muscle weighs more than fat so
anyways<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.920> turn<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> side<00:01:56.610> show<00:01:56.939> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
anyways we turn to the side show you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.740 
anyways we turn to the side show you
