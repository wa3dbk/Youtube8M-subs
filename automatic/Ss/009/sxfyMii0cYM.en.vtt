connecting the world you know like
sunsets<00:01:02.170> book<00:01:02.440> but<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.920> book<00:01:02.950> itself<00:01:03.219> hadn't

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
sunsets book but the book itself hadn't

been used and sunset was Celestia

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.080 
been used and sunset was Celestia
student<00:01:05.740> there's<00:01:06.040> really<00:01:06.280> no<00:01:06.490> evidence<00:01:06.850> for

student there's really no evidence for

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.490 
student there's really no evidence for
or<00:01:07.330> against<00:01:07.690> a<00:01:07.780> similar<00:01:08.110> method<00:01:08.410> of

communication<00:01:08.920> being<00:01:09.220> used<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:09.970> I'm<00:01:10.090> ruling

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
communication being used so I'm ruling

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.389 
communication being used so I'm ruling
out<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:10.720> possibility<00:01:11.140> altogether<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:12.009> find

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
out that possibility altogether I find

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.040 
out that possibility altogether I find
it<00:01:12.520> much<00:01:12.670> more<00:01:12.729> likely<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.539> mirror<00:01:13.930> was

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
it much more likely that the mirror was

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.719 
it much more likely that the mirror was
involved<00:01:14.410> maybe<00:01:15.009> she<00:01:15.250> had<00:01:15.340> been<00:01:15.460> through<00:01:15.640> the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
involved maybe she had been through the

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.219 
involved maybe she had been through the
portal<00:01:16.030> several<00:01:16.330> times<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.810> past<00:01:16.840> of

the mirrors location and distance from

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
Canterlot I don't think this is the case

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.719 
Canterlot I don't think this is the case
now<00:01:23.289> how<00:01:23.440> about<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.800> instead<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.399> someone

with events in Equestria for further

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.110 
with events in Equestria for further
evidence<00:01:51.920> let's<00:01:52.220> look<00:01:52.400> at<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.580> timeline

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
evidence let's look at the timeline

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.610 
evidence let's look at the timeline
according<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.570> Luna<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.990> mirror<00:01:54.200> used<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.500> be

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
according to Luna the mirror used to be

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.990 
according to Luna the mirror used to be
located<00:01:55.130> in<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.310> throne<00:01:55.580> room<00:01:55.730> of<00:01:55.880> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
located in the throne room of the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.910 
located in the throne room of the
Canterlot<00:01:56.330> castle<00:01:56.720> but<00:01:57.260> when<00:01:57.410> cadence<00:01:57.770> took

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
Canterlot castle but when cadence took

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.410 
Canterlot castle but when cadence took
over<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.250> crystal<00:01:58.580> Empire<00:01:58.700> they<00:01:59.060> moved<00:01:59.270> it

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
over the crystal Empire they moved it

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.580 
over the crystal Empire they moved it
there<00:01:59.630> for<00:01:59.870> safekeeping

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
there for safekeeping

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.290 
there for safekeeping
so<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.250> mirror<00:02:01.460> had<00:02:01.550> only<00:02:01.670> recently<00:02:02.150> been

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
so the mirror had only recently been

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.690 
so the mirror had only recently been
moved<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.810> its<00:02:02.930> current<00:02:02.990> location<00:02:03.430> okay<00:02:04.430> now

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
moved to its current location okay now

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.670 
moved to its current location okay now
let's<00:02:04.910> look<00:02:04.940> at<00:02:05.119> flash<00:02:05.300> century<00:02:05.780> his<00:02:06.170> present

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
let's look at flash century his present

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.499 
let's look at flash century his present
as<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.830> royal<00:02:07.160> guard<00:02:07.400> is<00:02:07.610> somewhat<00:02:08.000> contrived

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
as a royal guard is somewhat contrived

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.510 
as a royal guard is somewhat contrived
just<00:02:09.080> look<00:02:09.229> at<00:02:09.350> his<00:02:09.470> design<00:02:09.830> he's<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.340> only

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
just look at his design he's the only

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.160 
just look at his design he's the only
member<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> guard<00:02:11.270> who<00:02:11.450> doesn't<00:02:11.900> have<00:02:12.020> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
member of the guard who doesn't have the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.990 
member of the guard who doesn't have the
default<00:02:12.440> crystal<00:02:12.920> look<00:02:13.160> kind<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.850> suspicious

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
default crystal look kind of suspicious

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.910 
default crystal look kind of suspicious
especially<00:02:14.750> when<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.410> consider<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.890> fact

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
especially when you consider the fact

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.600 
especially when you consider the fact
that<00:02:16.190> he's<00:02:16.459> new<00:02:17.020> who<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.620> he's<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> new

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
that he's new who is that he's a new

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.910 
that he's new who is that he's a new
member<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> castle<00:02:20.300> guard<00:02:20.720> flash<00:02:21.620> sentry

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
member of the castle guard flash sentry

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.010 
member of the castle guard flash sentry
I<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.090> mirror<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.450> moved<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
I think so the mirror is moved to the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.810 
I think so the mirror is moved to the
crystal<00:02:24.380> castle<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.040> all<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> sudden<00:02:25.640> this

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
crystal castle and all the sudden this

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.940 
crystal castle and all the sudden this
new<00:02:25.880> recruit<00:02:26.450> shows<00:02:26.660> up<00:02:26.870> not<00:02:27.230> too<00:02:27.440> long<00:02:27.470> after

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
new recruit shows up not too long after

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.440 
new recruit shows up not too long after
sunset<00:02:28.220> shimmer<00:02:28.520> makes<00:02:28.760> her<00:02:28.970> well-planned

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
sunset shimmer makes her well-planned

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.990 
sunset shimmer makes her well-planned
move<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.200> timing<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.830> perfect<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.700> if<00:02:31.910> you

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
move the timing is perfect and if you

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.220 
move the timing is perfect and if you
watch<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.209> scene<00:02:32.600> again<00:02:32.630> you'll<00:02:33.080> notice

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
watch that scene again you'll notice

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.260 
watch that scene again you'll notice
sunset<00:02:33.680> knew<00:02:33.830> exactly<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.550> room<00:02:34.820> Twilight

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
sunset knew exactly what room Twilight

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.970 
sunset knew exactly what room Twilight
was<00:02:35.450> staying<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.140> she<00:02:36.320> also<00:02:36.470> knew<00:02:36.739> when

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
was staying in and she also knew when

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.920 
was staying in and she also knew when
Twilight<00:02:37.370> summit<00:02:37.700> was<00:02:37.820> taking<00:02:38.120> place<00:02:38.270> these

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
Twilight summit was taking place these

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.420 
Twilight summit was taking place these
are<00:02:39.110> all<00:02:39.260> things<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.709> crystal<00:02:40.100> Empire's

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
are all things the crystal Empire's

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.640 
are all things the crystal Empire's
Royal<00:02:40.790> Guard<00:02:41.030> would<00:02:41.209> need<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.690> know<00:02:41.900> when<00:02:42.380> and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
Royal Guard would need to know when and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.800 
Royal Guard would need to know when and
where<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.830> princess<00:02:43.220> would<00:02:43.400> be<00:02:43.580> someone<00:02:44.390> had<00:02:44.600> to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
where a princess would be someone had to

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.330 
where a princess would be someone had to
have<00:02:44.900> told<00:02:45.170> her<00:02:45.320> this<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.920> think<00:02:46.190> flash

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
have told her this and I think flash

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.640 
have told her this and I think flash
sentry<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.910> our<00:02:47.090> most<00:02:47.270> likely<00:02:47.660> candidate<00:02:48.110> so

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
sentry is our most likely candidate so

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.800 
sentry is our most likely candidate so
if<00:02:49.010> my<00:02:49.220> theory<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.610> true<00:02:49.910> does<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.420> make<00:02:50.600> him

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
if my theory is true does that make him

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.380 
if my theory is true does that make him
a<00:02:51.020> traitor<00:02:51.320> not<00:02:52.130> necessarily<00:02:52.880> maybe<00:02:53.180> he

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
a traitor not necessarily maybe he

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.699 
a traitor not necessarily maybe he
didn't<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.780> bad<00:02:53.989> intentions

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
didn't have bad intentions

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.259 
didn't have bad intentions
perhaps<00:02:55.160> sunset<00:02:55.549> shimmer<00:02:55.700> was<00:02:55.940> misleading

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
perhaps sunset shimmer was misleading

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.729 
perhaps sunset shimmer was misleading
him<00:02:56.540> into<00:02:56.750> thinking<00:02:56.900> he<00:02:57.200> was<00:02:57.380> actually

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
him into thinking he was actually

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.530 
him into thinking he was actually
helping<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.519> wouldn't<00:02:58.910> put<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.030> past<00:02:59.120> old

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
helping I wouldn't put it past old

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.330 
helping I wouldn't put it past old
sunset<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.049> use<00:03:00.170> someone<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.680> way<00:03:00.890> but

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
sunset to use someone in that way but

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.580 
sunset to use someone in that way but
intentionally<00:03:02.120> or<00:03:02.360> not<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.840> think<00:03:02.959> flash<00:03:03.410> was

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
intentionally or not I think flash was
