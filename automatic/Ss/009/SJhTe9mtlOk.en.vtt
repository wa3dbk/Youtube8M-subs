00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.780
 Michael you scoop me 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.790
 asked hello to everyone it's psycho arthur 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 the person who asked not to call 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.910
 his nickname but did not say not to call 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.519
 his name gave me a huge 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.029
 the number of Soviet tanks on which I 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.560
 in fact did not ride though he could and partly 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 should probably have gone for them 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.870
 because yes just duty well 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.809
 let's say such a tacit duty 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.360
 the player who started playing tanks and he 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.030
 as if from ru region to pump 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.550
 Soviet branch well at least to 6 there to 5 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.829
 at least apt-1 you should be yourself 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.510
 insert well here let's remember everyone 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.640
 famous water makers someone has a McQueen and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.699
 disadvantages of tax-tax-tax 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 but in my opinion everyone has yes oh maybe I 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.359
 Well of course mistaken I think you 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.170
 exactly to you one must be you understood yes 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.180
 they and the famous waterways 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 floor and all there psycho arthur and they 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.560
 never had these most 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.100
 famous Soviet tanks why because 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 I liked German tanks and Germans 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.720
 as if fighting with advice and all that and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.210
 In general, in a certain and I realized that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 Soviet tanks are so good 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.880
 that is, the region of them was rolling I would not 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.729
 felt the taste and would not feel 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.439
 buzz from all other nations that I 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.700
 afterwards 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.939
 protest and especially I would not have felt 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 Buzz Germans if immediately the first here 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.110
 a tank that I would swing it was 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.320
 some kind of apt-1 as he tries 485 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.659
 after the Soviet tanks any tank 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.250
 It seems bad because the Soviet 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.799
 tanks are among the best 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.380
 but always were, in principle, yes how would 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.659
 the end of the war it showed i'm not saying that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.719
 they are the most beautiful they really are not the most 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.479
 beautiful they don't possess sometimes some 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.460
 charisma of the German tanks here too that I 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.460
 I love German tanks here look at that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.960
 Ponty Rudakov's charisma some quality 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.959
 such a character 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.890
 what is worth only the name of the panther that is 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.840
 really tank which is well straight to that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.120
 is for example vodka in 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.560
 This is seriously the first thing I think about 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:28.000
 word to in this here calleja am calleja 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.870
 for whom here is just down imbic 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.410
 yes yes imbovo t-34 85 but this is a button accordion 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.660
 real well I honestly wine is not a cat to sleep 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.790
 even I wanted to be honest once I wanted to 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.670
 on it roll out thought open for a hundred 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.310
 ride all the same grandfathers fought on this 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.200
 tank he is so cool 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.430
 I must taste this crook, but no 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.120
 something stopped me 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.670
 and you know what stopped me is this 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.250
 just chuyka guys well, that's where I could 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.760
 know what will appear in the game tank which 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.830
 better in all respects pumped 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.989
 his brother that is, we are talking now 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.030
 just under this rudi because i 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.790
 They threw off the flash in which he was talking about 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.209
 I shot for what is real for some 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.220
 parameters one that is according to the review then 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.739
 turning dynamics this tank 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.980
 partly bypasses its competitors 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.989
 pumped branches t-34 85 plus know 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.410
 what he has such an unexpected 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.900
 bonus t-34 85 when shooting in the forehead 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.690
 periodically contusion radio operator because 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.000
 what the radio operator if I'm not mistaken is sitting behind 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.540
 a machine gun, that is, here as if in this 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.530
 Here is little tits sitting inside 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.360
 accordingly when he gets there 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.730
 the radio operator is highly likely to leave 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.489
 proper smoke down this noggin cast 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.739
 don't know but in certain patches in 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.360
 next ever there is a light bulb 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.090
 plans to transfer to radio operator 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.609
 feel up to the connection that is now 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.690
 light bulb on the commander and so you 3485 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.760
 knock out the commander 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.190
 you need to select a tower right 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.910
 here is the commander q somewhere to get there and 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.130
 land mines 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.140
 faith in the upper part the upper part 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.620
 less than the lower, respectively, but 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.240
 put it harder to get there and in general 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.850
 only so kontuzit 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.460
 commander and due to this light bulb 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.260
 will be removed accordingly now on here 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.070
 this hands t-34 85 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.050
 This is the radio operator perk 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.660
 radio operator performs the commander that is all 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.160
 as it should be here and this is all because of the dog 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.640
 so look what a joke 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.420
 when a light bulb will appear at the radio operator at 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.110
 contusions 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.320
 Well, in short, losing a light bulb in battle will 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.870
 easier on pumped tanks because 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.790
 what is there a radio operator than here because 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.500
 here is a dog like this 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.960
 This here I now you just said 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.270
 the main thing about this tank is seriously everything 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.590
 the rest I think it makes no sense about it 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.810
 to speak it is simply imbisce imba those people 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.470
 who tell me something there that wye 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.020
 Soviet tanks and I am not there especially 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.290
 really happy people who blame 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.270
 wargaming is that oh well wargaming 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.630
 bad they do that Soviet tanks 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.850
 bad on them is hard so play oh here 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.770
 another thing the Americans there are all sorts of Germans 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.080
 here it is yes it is dota imba 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.540
 her Soviet tanks are all so weak 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.910
 so weak that's so hard to play oh 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.560
 wargaming bad u seriously guys you 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.690
 no shot at all on other tanks 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.880
 played that is if of course you 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.650
 you meet in battle and they have you this 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.780
 does not mean that you have a bad tank 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.880
 Tuva's husband is doing a little wrong in battle 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.590
 think about it I now turn to 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.800
 Owners of Soviet tanks that they 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.010
 unhappy because you can't be here 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.120
 unhappy well than alpha there is a beat I'm on 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:48.520
 you stabilize up in order of armor on 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.950
 sixth level o and armor screed no worse 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.740
 some strands on the same level 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.350
 kv-85 remember and what the fuck is this thing you 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.400
 85 much better armor at the moment 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.130
 than this 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.200
 Do you have a weapon t-pumped 34 85 yes no 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.590
 guys like only here we 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.340
 and dpm Chekist and better angles and speed 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.580
 better well 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.260
 porridge to 85 on too dpm check there is it 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.330
 can not be attributed to just like that 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.450
 an advantage but still I consider this 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.250
 with a point because in fact at the moment 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.900
 and in the future if she ever and 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.280
 will be on sale in the opportunity 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.320
 appear all the same it is confined to 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.830
 the film they are to capture Berlin 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.080
 on here and she is from the British threesome 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.050
 Essentially, well, if so, just very 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.000
 objectively evaluate everything imba 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.160
 Well, because if you compare 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.440
 of you pumped and he himself is not so there 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.410
 completely different so what's this 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.000
 car the better side is slightly stronger up to 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.250
 the better side is steeper than yours 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.850
 we pump over and sometimes she also farms 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.770
 farm just ohrenet as I showed you 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.240
 fight with the master the very first master 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.160
 who fell on it on this car 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.730
 got it was just like that 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.920
 izichah 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.610
 I had fights with eights and where 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.530
 proud of charging and earning thousands 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.860
 2015 is if it is direct at all straight gold 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.380
 gold gold and periodically only bb 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.560
 if you really do exactly farm on 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.700
 this car, of course, at the expense of 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.470
 statistics yes if so to speak when 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.590
 you get to the eights still need 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:20.320
 there is an aldan for effective play then 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.580
 but this is just perfect Anton format up 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.980
 the sixth level that is right here 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.490
 budget budget option for ultra 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.870
 bend 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.070
 and in principle, I advise everyone to buy guys 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.020
 hashtags I did not sell out just say 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.150
 the truth is they know the type of a hashtag 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.070
 where is one whole word but its difficult 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.670
 read due to the fact that there are no gaps well, 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:41.680
 like this thanks for watching if 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.900
 you liked the video or it seemed 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.700
 something useful put the class and 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.370
 subscribe to my channel if not 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.640
 Want to miss new vidosiki all
