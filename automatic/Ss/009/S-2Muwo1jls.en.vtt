00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.700
 in this river it has an importance 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.189
 spiritual ancestral because it lives on 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.170
 female spirit from the worldview 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.630
 of the people language 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.250
 and we have always been taught what they are 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.400
 the girls who guard the rivers 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.300
 this river walker that serves for the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.120
 feeding that there are medicinal plants 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.850
 and of course all this water is good for 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:45.460
 much population downstream and I think that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.900
 means life after the military coup 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.530
 of 2009 the Honduran government granted 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.440
 concessions to build 47 dams 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.920
 in order to boost hundreds of 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.829
 new mining projects the giant of 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.399
 Chinese engineering sinohydro joined 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.070
 the sun a Honduran company for 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:13.630
 build a dam on the river walk ar 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.830
 that the zarca water dam would affect 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.160
 hundreds of Lenca people 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.520
 there was a violation from the beginning to 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.840
 Convention 169 and its duty regarding 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.650
 respect for the rights of peoples 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.360
 indigenous is a concession that did not have 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.510
 a free prior consultation process 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.910
 informed is not a crime to defend 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.890
 our own rights as peoples 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.320
 indigenous 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.490
 here we are where I am sitting here 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.040
 acquires a large bean 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.140
 the one from that sinohydro company and it's a 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.630
 disaster with the tractors because we 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.160
 we are infatuated and we are organized and 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.030
 we keep fighting because this fight 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.790
 from us copinh an organization 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.760
 of indigenous rights with founded by 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.970
 Berta Cáceres organized the Lenca village 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.330
 around your rights 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.840
 internationally recognized 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.180
 in two open councils and in more than 150 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.070
 indigenous assemblies this population 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.740
 decided that he did not want the project 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.170
 Hydroelectric did not want damage to the river 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.080
 he wanted privatization of a sacred river 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.320
 how is the walk are that berta presented 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.750
 denunciations before the government of Honduras and 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.220
 organized peaceful protests in the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.630
 capital of the country its visibility increased 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.420
 becoming a target for the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.600
 government despite having offered us 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.170
 jail murder us campaign 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.959
 discredit we made a complaint nobody has 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.910
 listened to this town then it was seen 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.400
 the obligation to act in a 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.260
 immediate putting here all your 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.989
 hopes your resistance 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.500
 for more than two years the Lenca 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.600
 they kept blocking the road 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.210
 enduring harassment and violent attacks 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.960
 tragically during a protest 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.270
 peaceful the Honduran military 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.930
 they shot tomás garcía leader lenca de 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.270
 the community of ríoblanco a huge 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.630
 indignation of the community 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.820
 but the murdered fellow shot this 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.300
 led to that in the community of emplazar 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.950
 to the sinohydro and asked him to come out 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.470
 mom like iniesta lost we have 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.610
 up for it really here river 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.790
 because here they will not pay 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.580
 thus was sinohydro de ríoblanco but 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.850
 that has been at the cost of blood of this 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.850
 village 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.400
 sinohydro rescinded his contract alleging 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:59.460
 the continuing resistance of the community 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.010
 the world bank- I later withdraw his 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.410
 financing due to concerns 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.410
 about human rights violations 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.320
 that could assault her that can kill her 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.740
 even as they have wanted to do it but their 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.959
 life goes further from this moment 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.019
 and we are willing 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.169
 part 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.819
 having stopped this project 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.400
 means an example of struggle that 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.470
 It illuminates and inspires all the people 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.870
 from Honduras and the world, I do not think 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.870
 we can be naive before that power 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.620
 when we started the struggle of ríoblanco 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.040
 I got into the river I could talk to the river 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.240
 I felt what the river was telling me and I knew 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.060
 how hard it was going to be 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.120
 but I knew we were going to you 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.540
 the river told me 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.520
 for the outstanding achievement 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.990
