opening<00:01:31.829> half<00:01:32.130> way<00:01:32.340> through<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.180> kind

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
opening half way through and then kind

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.490 
opening half way through and then kind
of<00:01:33.509> at<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> end<00:01:33.900> where<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> doesn't<00:01:34.350> really

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
of at the end where it doesn't really

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
of at the end where it doesn't really
matter<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.430> most<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:35.909> show<00:01:36.180> is

going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:37.020> i<00:01:37.140> think<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.409> should<00:01:37.560> has<00:01:37.650> been

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
going to this i think it should has been

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
going to this i think it should has been
different<00:01:38.130> team<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.939> way<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
different team up that way all the

to be him as the upgraded version and I
kind<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> thought<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.680> time<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> they

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
kind of thought at the time that they

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.730 
kind of thought at the time that they
possibly<00:01:54.000> wouldn't<00:01:54.509> touch<00:01:54.689> down<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.439> but

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
possibly wouldn't touch down on this but

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.069 
possibly wouldn't touch down on this but
he's<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.570> could<00:01:57.689> either<00:01:57.840> get<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
he's in there so we could either get a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.080 
he's in there so we could either get a
film<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.040> literally<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.700> cut<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
film or it could literally they cut the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.590 
film or it could literally they cut the
film<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> bad<00:02:01.860> guy<00:02:01.920> so

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
film up and have this as a bad guy so

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
film up and have this as a bad guy so
possibly<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.930> might<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.710> go<00:02:04.950> busters<00:02:05.490> I'm

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

I saw it I thought some was kind of

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.270 
I saw it I thought some was kind of
joking<00:03:50.750> when<00:03:51.049> they<00:03:51.140> put<00:03:51.320> this<00:03:51.410> up<00:03:51.620> but<00:03:51.769> this

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
joking when they put this up but this

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.400 
joking when they put this up but this

I thought they would have changed one or

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.880 
I thought they would have changed one or
two<00:04:11.239> things<00:04:11.269> made<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:12.049> look<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.590> bit<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.830> little

two things made it look a bit a little

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.680 
two things made it look a bit a little
bit<00:04:13.070> different<00:04:13.549> rather<00:04:13.760> than<00:04:14.120> just<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.480> same

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690

all<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.610> information<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.150> I've<00:04:35.360> read<00:04:35.630> there

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
all the information that I've read there

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.680 
all the information that I've read there
is<00:04:36.260> no<00:04:36.620> you've<00:04:36.950> done<00:04:36.980> nothing<00:04:37.480> they've<00:04:38.480> given

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690

their<00:04:38.930> name<00:04:39.110> I<00:04:39.320> don't<00:04:39.590> think<00:04:39.650> they've<00:04:39.920> got<00:04:40.100> a

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
their name I don't think they've got a

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.010 
their name I don't think they've got a
writer<00:04:40.400> or<00:04:40.820> think<00:04:41.150> no<00:04:41.240> think<00:04:41.540> they<00:04:41.630> have<00:04:41.810> got

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
writer or think no think they have got

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.230 
writer or think no think they have got
writer<00:04:42.460> but<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.520> don't<00:04:43.760> think<00:04:43.910> they've<00:04:44.090> got

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
writer but I don't think they've got

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.180 
writer but I don't think they've got
anyone<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.750> star<00:04:45.170> in<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.410> yet<00:04:45.680> so<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.040> think

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
anyone to star in it yet so I think

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.280 
anyone to star in it yet so I think
they're<00:04:46.400> still<00:04:46.580> possibly<00:04:47.360> writing<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:47.930> and

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
they're still possibly writing it and

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.050 
they're still possibly writing it and
you<00:04:48.440> kind<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.710> think<00:04:48.830> with<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.100> big<00:04:49.700> film<00:04:49.880> like

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.330 
you kind of think with a big film like
this<00:04:50.150> they<00:04:50.480> would<00:04:50.600> be<00:04:50.980> concentrating<00:04:51.980> on<00:04:51.980> like

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
this they would be concentrating on like

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.010 
this they would be concentrating on like
kind<00:04:52.580> of<00:04:52.610> getting<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.970> soul<00:04:53.180> whole<00:04:53.600> thing<00:04:53.900> out

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020
