the 2015 WRX looks too much like an EVO
in<00:03:00.900> pictures<00:03:01.349> but<00:03:01.590> honestly<00:03:02.010> when<00:03:02.129> you<00:03:02.190> see

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459

one in person not only does it look

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.210 
one in person not only does it look
genuinely<00:03:05.519> Subaru<00:03:06.230> but<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.379> just<00:03:07.560> looks<00:03:07.799> good

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
it looks like a nice advancement of the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.400 
it looks like a nice advancement of the
design<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.459> how<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.970> looks<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.329> me<00:03:12.359> anyway<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:12.900> i

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
design is how it looks to me anyway so i
