00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello everyone welcome everyone 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.200
 I sui thomas to skate and monitors 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.110
 today we will talk a little about 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.480
 vermont elements of skateboarding 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.830
 clothes the protections and it's this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 that I want to do first of all it's 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.130
 you explain to us a little bit for them for 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.930
 the shoes what I advise you 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 it's having vulcanized shoes 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.400
 I would say that the soleplate 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.199
 strengthen and special by a fund 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.689
 especially at least you 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.660
 would you like to skate? 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.520
 if you start trying to buy some 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.579
 aig shoes a week like 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.230
 this one you will be able to have more 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.559
 aveyron on the grip and it's to be avoided 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.570
 smooth soles like converses 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.480
 converse what everyone is going 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.969
 say and and cheap sneakers 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 even if it's salmon 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.660
 to run and that's where you go 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.250
 report more problem for me I 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.510
 really advise you look closely at the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.539
 sole to have a week like that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.329
 there and at least to start it will be this 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.439
 will be easier then at the level of 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.170
 tools what I have there is it's a 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.659
 really tool that I could always 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.040
 it's a foot ok so if you have 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.590
 broken a bearing for example of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.170
 able to use your feet and remove 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.939
 the bolt there I can do it but that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 takes time 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.560
 also if you have the vices could 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.170
 tighten the screws and the trucks and well one 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.420
 could do the stuff with this side 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.650
 hockey assassin's creed or 10 euros of which 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990
 we learn that the store me I you 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.210
 advise to let go like that 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.310
 time is at least that you that you 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.630
 is not also the protections this 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.070
 that I really advise you if you 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.789
 are young between 5 and 10 years old and 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.909
 to buy the helmet and 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:54.259
 then knee elbow pads and 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.539
 wrist protection ok we are after 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.000
 it really depends on your level 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.880
 and that's the helmet it may be the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.950
 most important 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.569
 thank you all for watching the videos so 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.819
 you have questions I remain 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.600
 available on the comments of 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.880
 youtube really has the idea it's these 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.260
 practices and is to be to be 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.989
 finally, what you do 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.790
 there are figures that go who you are you 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.959
 ask for pressure so it's so 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.630
 really everyday if you have the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.870
 and possibility and this continues to this 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.870
 criterion
