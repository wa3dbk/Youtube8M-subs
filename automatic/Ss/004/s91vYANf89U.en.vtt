00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.869
 Let's talk a little about raising sheep. 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.800
 to foster the development of the activity here in the state some 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.349
 entities have come together to offer training to producers of 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.630
 settlements that live near the big field 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.570
 in a day of hard work and housing they are ready to 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.570
 develop to live culture 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.720
 in the management center of the cutting embrapa and applied students 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.110
 attentive to each veterinary guidance on the management of ovine 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.990
 affected area 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.040
 she was dead but a mark on the wallet 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.540
 the apprentices are settled producers of properties near the field 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.130
 great as dona luci on the site she raise several animals and already has some 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.680
 sheep wants to guarantee income with her son only she has to learn to premier 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.890
 can work 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.240
 and have a good product to warn that I want to sell right? 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.870
 so I'll take good care of our style 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.180
 the intention of this theoretical and practical training is to stimulate sheep farming 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.480
 between small producers in a property 13 times for example is 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.250
 possible to create up to 250 animals with a good pace are 35 old adults 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.490
 portaria for a few years now or consumption has been increasing 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.810
 then the interest by the kg mainly costing kiesel what 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 is being demanded by the market has grown very 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.120
 and we who have a good this is import history 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.830
 and this import has been decreasing every time. 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.840
 diminished 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.170
 so we are seeing the need to serve this growing market 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.960
 with the national product 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.260
 of quality within the active wt of lamb which is what the market demands 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.609
 for the squad to succeed, planning is necessary 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.109
 the ideal is to start breeding in the rainy season the veterinary 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.229
 verônica shows the management of casqueamento of the animals the technique that 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.750
 helps to avoid ear diseases, the little lady is following the movements 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.630
 of the teacher and already faced the scissors is my dream to make a sales poster 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.949
 starts at the highest in almost a year waiting to pass through Dakar 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:22.960
 in research 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.990
 silence glazed eyes the instructor for those who do not have much experience and 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.240
 this is a delicate moment of sheep handling the scissors placed in place 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240
 wrong can hurt the animal. 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.060
 the producers learned lunch yet looked from buyer creator 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.520
 here they are doing the visual evaluation of the animals for when they are 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.440
 to get a little marquise for the audience, the producers learned how to 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.720
 check the health of the animal chosen to harbor 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:54.860
 I know well 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.849
 so the age 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.840
 of the IRPF and was staged the right way to see me focus on what though this encounter 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.269
 of today 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.349
 It's only one day. 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.920
 read more here tracy is her or glimpse of how to start in 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.159
 activity 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.289
 is hexa to promote this recognition 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.309
 levitating as little as possible of failures 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:24.599
 and with the accompaniment of the technicians of the esca and as our orientation in 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.119
 management question I believe they go forward 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:34.159
 goes away is ignored 2 the teacher sector that I saw in the culture 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.380
 pre-Inca are Francisco and the interim anaso rodríguez settlement 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.880
 to buy the breeding stock in October he wants to diversify the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.600
 production of the property already works with agriculture edgard dairy but 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.340
 we need not only now but continue in this training 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:56.329
 in this quest for knowledge so that we can also offer the market 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.540
 with ni 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.319
 quality
