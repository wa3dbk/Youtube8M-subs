00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.840
 after using our fireplace is not 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.180
 stove or our boiler we always 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.160
 the residue of the ash remains but this 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.430
 ash can be used in our 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.590
 garden for different uses 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.390
 you can use an ash solution with 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.920
 the purpose of nourishing the plant protect it 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.630
 from the physical point of view and also 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.000
 to regulate harmful insects like 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.560
 aphids or trip among others the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.870
 application must be done through 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.580
 foliar spray and it is convenient to remember 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.930
 that the ashes are salts and that if not 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.700
 we make the mixture with the proportions 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.430
 right we can get to harm the 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.809
 plant if we have a cord of ash 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.790
 around the crop lines 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.410
 we prevent access to the plants of 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.210
 snails and slugs and even from 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.460
 ants although with the latter is not 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.770
 so effective because the ashes 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.630
 they are basically salts to snails and 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.090
 slugs causes them burns so 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.250
 that they do not cross that barrier the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.170
 Ash cord should have about 10 or 15 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.970
 centimeters with the application of this 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.530
 waste we naturally compensate for 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.750
 nutrient imbalance in the soil 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.300
 the extraction made by the crops 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.649
 and moderate the acidity of that soil and 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.720
 that exception of nitrogen that 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.460
 contain all the necessary elements 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.930
 for the growth of vegetables by 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.550
 what could be considered as a 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.200
 Ecological Fertilizer 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.910
 physical-chemical characteristics of 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.310
 ashes depend to a large extent on the 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.409
 plant material from which it proceeds in my 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.390
 case the ash results from combustion 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.150
 of oak wood that is very similar to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.770
 of oak should choose a day with little 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.600
 wind to spread the ashes to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.920
 avoid drift losses although the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.210
 particles that are carried into the air are the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.190
 thinner and the lost is not so 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.659
 important as it may seem what I 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.790
 I do is spread the ash on the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.860
 bancal at a rate of about two kilos per 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.240
 square meter then performed 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.340
 a superficial work of cava for 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.990
 bury it and incorporate it into the ground and 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.369
 thus allowing it to become little 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.530
 little so that by the time you 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.000
 go develop the crop this has 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.130
 at your disposal the elements 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.619
 nutrients needed for its development 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.149
 also if we leave the ash on the 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.220
 ground can be lost by effects of the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.420
 wind the right time of application 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.850
 it would be in the preparation of the ground 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.289
 prior to planting 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.550
 better two or three weeks before to 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.470
 that this ash is transforming 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.450
 substances easily assimilated by 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.280
 the plants the fertilizing effect of 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.290
 the ashes is slower than those of 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.519
 commercial fertilizers but also 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.870
 they are more durable due to the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.180
 characteristics of the compounds that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.739
 they form them in general the ashes are 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.019
 a source of phosphorus intake and 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.080
 potassium being the ratio of the three 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.370
 fundamental elements of 0 2 10 already 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.750
 we have said that nitrogen is not 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.500
 present between the compounds of the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.000
 ash 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.440
 the ashes also have a marked 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.880
 alkaline character by 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.710
 can be used as a proofreader 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.020
 acid soils in addition and hence its 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.120
 alkaline character are sources of contribution 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.920
 of magnesium calcium and in addition very 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.420
 soluble and therefore easily 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.670
 assimilated by plants as 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.860
 general recommendation we could say 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.960
 that you can apply about two kilos per 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.520
 square meter of ash to get 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.500
 some good results we could 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.030
 increase those doses a bit but without 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.410
 happen to us because we can damage the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.210
 plants and even create problems of 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.190
 salinity in the soil to be a 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.900
 important fertilizer I bring you the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.120
 more demanding crops of my garden like 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.860
 peppers and tomatoes in the latter 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.930
 also it serves to combat 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.580
 problem of apical necrosis due to 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.569
 the high calcium contributions that 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.730
 made to the ground 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.159
 but this video where we have commented 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.889
 the different uses that the 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.480
 ash is becoming a residue 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.420
 without any other element to improve 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.440
 our 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.440
 until the next video
