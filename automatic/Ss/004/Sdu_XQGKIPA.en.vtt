00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.910
 very good friends of youtube this is a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.910
 ground guide and we started 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.570
 plus 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.810
 once the account is done and created 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.860
 we enter the game we find 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.449
 this and we have two types of good server 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.180
 there are two equal and one different pv 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.570
 What is it 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.850
 player versus environment or player 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.400
 against the environment we fight n 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.790
 fish etcetera and we have the world pvp 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.790
 player version 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.610
 we fight against the players and so 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.500
 we choose a server and enter once 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.900
 to choose the server and we have entered 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.090
 let's create the character to create the 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.280
 character must be taken into account only 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.610
 we have two characters available for 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.000
 create 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.130
 can be customized to the maximum and how 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.130
 you see here there are eight classes 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.180
 for example I'm going to choose this 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.690
 and let's be clear 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.070
 okay now is every character is 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.610
 divided by eight classes that as you see 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.190
 here the stars 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.190
 that's the handling difficulties 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.590
 if you have for example 5 stars 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.590
 it will be difficult to manage 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.549
 and once chosen the class we enter 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.830
 the custom section where we go 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.479
 to customize our character to 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.479
 maximum as we like 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.500
 once created our character to 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.090
 our taste 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.350
 we are going to put a name that we give 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.350
 here and disney 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.950
 for example I will fight with a shipment 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.469
 we have the name and we give it to finish 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.580
 when we are finished it will take us 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.370
 here where we have our characters 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.030
 and good if we did not like it we can not 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.440
 delete 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.200
 and create another one 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.590
 well then now to play we give to 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.760
 play 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.940
 or if we want we can do the tutorial 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.130
 and good to learn something 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.850
 or go directly to the world to play 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.430
 I will give him here because he already did the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.800
 cumbersome tutorial I will show you a little 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.800
 plus 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.530
 well we started with the controls as 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.070
 You see in the image that I have placed 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:26.069
 Pink and lilac keys are for the 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:30.420
 scripts he writes are spells and power 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:33.540
 the blue keys wh of my space are 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.530
 for the movement of the character run 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.700
 drop and so on 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.830
 and the yellow keys are for 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.510
 quick access for example 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:54.350
 the q serves to mark enemies the k 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.350
 for skis and if we look at the iss 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.769
 for inventory 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.290
 for example we give the snag to the 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.980
 menu here we can add things for the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.840
 character forgiveness for the character if you 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.840
 We open the map 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.459
 there it is and the inter to write in the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.889
 chat and a very important thing that does not 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.520
 I said at the beginning that it's to open the 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:30.250
 mouse we give to escape 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.250
 upward to open the mouse 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.810
 well let's talk a little about the 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.650
 interface to begin with we have here the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.250
 red bar that is life we ​​have the 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.310
 blue bar that is the manna and a bar 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.100
 here small that puts r that is the 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.510
 resistance if for example I put a 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.430
 shield 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:05:01.160
 you see how the bar lowers that the limit 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.160
 that's the resistance we have here chat 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 partition 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.240
 in general we have here the good bar 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.840
 which is more or less the same as the accesses 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.810
 direct that explain before we have here 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.720
 the map 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.010
 that tells us more or less where there is 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.010
 missions and cost 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.629
 that by the way to see the list of 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.629
 quest you give to the ele and it opens 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:37.479
 the missions we have here a bar 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:42.310
 the powers or spells or portions that 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:45.630
 they are used with the 10 735 for example 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.630
 and that one 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:54.790
 good healing or something like that 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.260
 and good here we have 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:02.940
 another bar that to store spells or 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.940
 powers how can you move 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.809
 well now you can not 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.579
 here you can with this button you can 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:12.579
 extend I erase it 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.750
 and well, everything can be moved, for example 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.050
 so let's see this 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.900
 We can see 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.259
 the east map can be moved 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.870
 everything can be customized and good 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.870
 basically that's the interface 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:42.139
 well we also have some commands in 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:43.790
 the chat for example if I put bar 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.840
 happy 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.560
 are actions that do 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.009
 for example 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.529
 where he started dancing 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.300
 and well there are many commands I'll leave it 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.300
 in the information below 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.550
 well very briefly this is what 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.460
 basic that we should know about the game and 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.850
 in the next video for being will teach more 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.729
 things like the sign exists 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.930
 to know when I upload a video and we 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.930
 we see until the next
