to be watching next step is going to be
to<00:00:28.410> remove<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.800> harmonic<00:00:29.220> balancer<00:00:29.570> it's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
to remove the harmonic balancer it's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.299 
to remove the harmonic balancer it's
these<00:00:30.809> four<00:00:31.140> bolts<00:00:31.590> here<00:00:31.829> that<00:00:32.040> hold<00:00:32.189> the

these bolt holes the Allen holes on the
bolts<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.180> clean<00:00:39.450> them<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.720> little<00:00:39.900> bit

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
bolts if we clean them out a little bit

bolts if we clean them out a little bit
first

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
first

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.770 
first
we<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:41.670> make<00:00:41.850> sure<00:00:41.880> that<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.390> socket

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
we can then make sure that the socket

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.170 
we can then make sure that the socket
goes<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.470> way<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.030> that'll<00:00:45.030> give<00:00:45.150> us

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
goes in all the way and that'll give us

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.700 
goes in all the way and that'll give us
less<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.720> chance<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.170> stripping<00:00:46.440> these

bolts now that the bolts are out we're

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.930 
bolts now that the bolts are out we're
going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> take<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.950> water<00:00:53.070> pump<00:00:53.430> off<00:00:53.610> usually

you can just grab the water pump wiggle
it<00:00:56.790> up<00:00:56.880> and<00:00:57.090> down<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.540> it'll<00:00:58.079> let<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.950> it

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
it up and down and it'll let go if it

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.310 
it up and down and it'll let go if it
sticks<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.850> they<00:01:00.120> sometimes<00:01:00.360> do<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.810> can<00:01:01.170> take

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
once everything's back together washer

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.750 
once everything's back together washer
first<00:01:26.720> then<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.290> nut<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.710> again<00:01:28.460> leave<00:01:28.640> it

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
first then the nut and again leave it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.850 
first then the nut and again leave it
loose<00:01:28.910> so<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.540> we<00:01:29.630> can<00:01:29.810> wiggle<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.110> around

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860

three<00:01:54.650> once<00:01:54.860> they're<00:01:55.040> all<00:01:55.160> three<00:01:55.400> in<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.670> can

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
three once they're all three in you can

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.640 
three once they're all three in you can
tighten<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.300> rest<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.630> way

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.710 

I'm<00:02:02.400> going<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> three<00:02:03.120> through<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
I'm going to do the three through the
