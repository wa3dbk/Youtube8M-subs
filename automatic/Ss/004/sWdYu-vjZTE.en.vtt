people that are maybe interested in
buying<00:00:08.820> 120<00:00:09.420> Hertz<00:00:09.570> monitor<00:00:10.260> now<00:00:10.950> there's<00:00:11.160> no

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
buying 120 Hertz monitor now there's no

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.249 
buying 120 Hertz monitor now there's no
real<00:00:11.490> way<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.730> show<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.360> difference<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.929> a

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
real way to show you the difference in a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.720 
real way to show you the difference in a
video<00:00:13.559> like<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.769> because<00:00:14.219> first<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.639> all

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
video like this because first of all

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.000 
video like this because first of all
YouTube<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.750> only<00:00:15.900> plays<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.350> 30<00:00:16.590> frames<00:00:16.770> per

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
YouTube you only plays at 30 frames per

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.109 
YouTube you only plays at 30 frames per
second<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.460> second<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:17.970> you're<00:00:18.090> not

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
second and second of all if you're not

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.810 
second and second of all if you're not
using<00:00:18.449> 120<00:00:18.900> Hertz<00:00:19.369> panel<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> won't<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.699> able

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
using 120 Hertz panel you won't be able

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.670 
using 120 Hertz panel you won't be able
to<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.390> difference<00:00:21.779> anyway<00:00:22.109> unless<00:00:22.350> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
to see the difference anyway unless you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.900 
to see the difference anyway unless you
you<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.039> had<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> two<00:00:23.640> monitors

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
you know had the two monitors

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.179 
you know had the two monitors
side-by-side<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.680> I've<00:00:25.800> done<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.070> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
side-by-side so what I've done in this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.620 
side-by-side so what I've done in this
video<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.760> thought<00:00:26.939> if<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.150> played<00:00:27.420> some

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
video of I thought if I played some

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.500 
video of I thought if I played some
battlefield<00:00:28.140> 3<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.680> canals<00:00:29.279> within<00:00:29.880> TDM<00:00:30.300> with

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
battlefield 3 on canals within TDM with

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.359 
battlefield 3 on canals within TDM with
a<00:00:30.539> sniper<00:00:30.900> rifle<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
a sniper rifle which I think is one of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.560 
a sniper rifle which I think is one of
the<00:00:32.430> more<00:00:32.579> difficult<00:00:32.669> things<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.450> in

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the more difficult things to do in

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.389 
the more difficult things to do in
battlefield<00:00:33.989> 3<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> requires<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:35.370> more

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
battlefield 3 it requires a bit more

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.540 
battlefield 3 it requires a bit more
accuracy<00:00:35.850> than<00:00:36.149> uses<00:00:36.420> only<00:00:36.630> an<00:00:36.690> m16<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> I'm

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
accuracy than uses only an m16 and I'm

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.729 
accuracy than uses only an m16 and I'm
playing<00:00:38.879> at<00:00:39.000> 120<00:00:39.510> Hertz<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.440> switch

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
playing at 120 Hertz and then I switch

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.660 
playing at 120 Hertz and then I switch
my<00:00:40.770> monitors<00:00:41.340> mode<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.420> 60<00:00:42.870> Hertz<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:44.520> can

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
my monitors mode to 60 Hertz and you can

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400 
my monitors mode to 60 Hertz and you can
do<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.879> via<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> Nvidia<00:00:45.600> control<00:00:45.750> panel<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
do that via the Nvidia control panel you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.959 
do that via the Nvidia control panel you
can<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.399> lot<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> games

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
can do that in a lot of the games

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.840 
can do that in a lot of the games
battlefield<00:00:48.870> 3<00:00:49.050> has<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> Hertz<00:00:49.770> setting<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
battlefield 3 has a Hertz setting or you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.160 
battlefield 3 has a Hertz setting or you
could<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> frame<00:00:51.420> rate<00:00:51.600> limiter<00:00:51.960> like

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
could use a frame rate limiter like

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
could use a frame rate limiter like
dxtory<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.129> set<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.640> max<00:00:53.910> frame<00:00:54.239> rate<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
dxtory and set your max frame rate to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.119 
dxtory and set your max frame rate to
260<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> actually<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.949> did

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
260 which is actually what I did

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.979 
260 which is actually what I did
so<00:00:56.879> essentially<00:00:57.360> you're<00:00:57.750> seeing<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so essentially you're seeing the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.720 
so essentially you're seeing the
difference<00:00:58.230> between<00:00:58.379> me<00:00:58.710> playing<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.190> 120

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
difference between me playing at 120

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
difference between me playing at 120
Hertz<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.149> me<00:01:00.270> playing<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.600> 60<00:01:01.050> Hertz<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
Hertz and me playing at 60 Hertz and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.429 
Hertz and me playing at 60 Hertz and
there's<00:01:01.590> quite<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> big<00:01:02.250> difference<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.600> first

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
there's quite a big difference and first

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.690 
there's quite a big difference and first
of<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.650> before<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.100> show<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.309> guys<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
of all before I show you guys the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.310 
of all before I show you guys the
testers<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> talk<00:01:06.600> about<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> basic

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
testers I want to talk about the basic

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
testers I want to talk about the basic
differences<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.920> advantages<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.400> having<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
differences in advantages of having a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.240 
differences in advantages of having a
hundred<00:01:08.970> twenty<00:01:09.270> Hertz<00:01:09.360> monitor<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.950> biggest

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
hundred twenty Hertz monitor the biggest

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.630 
hundred twenty Hertz monitor the biggest
one<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.820> me<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:13.070> smoothness<00:01:14.070> once<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> get

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
one for me is smoothness once you get

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
one for me is smoothness once you get
used<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.229> say<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.380> example<00:01:16.650> 60<00:01:17.009> frames<00:01:17.220> per

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
used to say for example 60 frames per

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.820 
used to say for example 60 frames per
second<00:01:17.759> maybe<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> came<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.320> console

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
second maybe if you came from a console

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.109 
second maybe if you came from a console
playing<00:01:20.040> battlefield<00:01:20.490> 3<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:20.970> you're

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
playing battlefield 3 and now you're

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.609 
playing battlefield 3 and now you're
playing<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.450> PC<00:01:21.659> you'll<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
playing on the PC you'll know that the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.640 
playing on the PC you'll know that the
difference<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> fairly<00:01:23.790> large<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:25.170> looks<00:01:25.409> way

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
difference is fairly large it looks way

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
difference is fairly large it looks way
smoother<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.790> looks<00:01:26.820> way<00:01:27.090> better<00:01:27.240> especially

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
smoother it looks way better especially

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960 
smoother it looks way better especially
in<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.409> first-person<00:01:28.829> shooter<00:01:29.070> an<00:01:29.430> action<00:01:29.790> game

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
in a first-person shooter an action game

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
in a first-person shooter an action game
like<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.390> obviously<00:01:31.380> watching<00:01:31.680> movies<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
like this obviously watching movies and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.200 
like this obviously watching movies and
stuff<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.579> really<00:01:32.670> need<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> really

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
stuff you don't really need a really

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.460 
stuff you don't really need a really
high<00:01:33.360> frame<00:01:33.659> rate<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.990> actually<00:01:34.259> kind<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
high frame rate it actually kind of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
high frame rate it actually kind of
looks<00:01:34.619> weird<00:01:34.799> when<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.579> high<00:01:36.090> frame

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
looks weird when you see a high frame

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999 
looks weird when you see a high frame
rate<00:01:36.540> movie<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.350> example<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.770> saw

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
rate movie and like for example I saw

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.590 
rate movie and like for example I saw
the<00:01:38.159> Hobbit<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.700> 48<00:01:39.060> frames<00:01:39.180> per<00:01:39.329> second<00:01:39.509> just

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the Hobbit and 48 frames per second just

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.660 
the Hobbit and 48 frames per second just
look<00:01:39.810> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.110> weird<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:41.250> cuz<00:01:41.430> your<00:01:41.549> eyes

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
look kind of weird just cuz your eyes

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.340 
look kind of weird just cuz your eyes
are<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.060> trained<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.659> 24<00:01:43.079> frames

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
are kind of trained to look at 24 frames

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.870 
are kind of trained to look at 24 frames
per<00:01:43.439> second<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> cinematic<00:01:44.280> movie<00:01:44.700> but

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
per second in the cinematic movie but

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.749 
per second in the cinematic movie but
for<00:01:45.810> video<00:01:46.020> games<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.560> sports<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.340> motion

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
for video games and sports and motion

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.830 
for video games and sports and motion
you<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.409> intensive<00:01:49.460> moving<00:01:50.460> images<00:01:50.939> higher

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you know intensive moving images higher

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.620 
you know intensive moving images higher
frame<00:01:52.200> rate<00:01:52.380> always<00:01:52.680> looks<00:01:53.040> better<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
frame rate always looks better and I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.749 
frame rate always looks better and I
think<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> having<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> higher<00:01:55.619> frame<00:01:56.340> rate<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
think it having a higher frame rate and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.969 
think it having a higher frame rate and
having<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.509> fluidity<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.290> smoother<00:01:58.590> motion

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
having that fluidity and smoother motion

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.709 
having that fluidity and smoother motion
also<00:01:59.159> allows<00:01:59.490> me<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> track<00:02:00.030> targets<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> little

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
also allows me to track targets a little

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.539 
also allows me to track targets a little
bit<00:02:00.810> easier<00:02:01.079> say<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.040> example<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> was

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
bit easier say for example when I was

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.520 
bit easier say for example when I was
typing<00:02:02.670> battlefield<00:02:03.329> 3<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.689> allows<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.049> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
typing battlefield 3 it allows me to I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.749 
typing battlefield 3 it allows me to I
think<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.189> bit<00:02:05.280> more<00:02:05.369> accurate

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
think be a little bit more accurate

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.130 
think be a little bit more accurate
actually<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.090> quite<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> bit<00:02:06.600> more<00:02:06.719> accurate

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
actually be quite a bit more accurate

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.919 
actually be quite a bit more accurate
than<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.680> playing<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.330> 60<00:02:09.330> Hertz

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
than if I was playing at 60 Hertz

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.720 
than if I was playing at 60 Hertz
slush<00:02:10.259> frames<00:02:10.800> per<00:02:10.950> second

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
targets a little faster you're also you

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.860 
targets a little faster you're also you
typically<00:02:18.220> going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.489> have<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.730> lot<00:02:19.090> less<00:02:19.120> input

counter-strike and what they do is

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.770 
counter-strike and what they do is
they'll<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:46.060> very<00:02:46.330> little<00:02:46.510> image

type of input lag that they can because

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.600 
type of input lag that they can because
you<00:02:50.829> know<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.160> get<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.310> really<00:02:51.519> really

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.370 
you know you can get a really really
good<00:02:51.819> looking<00:02:52.329> panel<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.810> an<00:02:52.900> IPS<00:02:53.349> panel

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
about input light there's so many things

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.289 
that come in to come into play
especially<00:03:24.819> when<00:03:24.910> you're<00:03:25.000> talking<00:03:25.060> about<00:03:25.209> a

processing<00:03:45.340> lag<00:03:45.910> there's<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:46.420> many<00:03:46.510> things

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750

typically<00:03:50.769> that's<00:03:51.040> measured<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.519> like<00:03:51.700> graded

typically that's measured in like graded
grade<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.510> it's<00:03:52.600> usually<00:03:52.720> like<00:03:52.900> two

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170

milliseconds<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.859> five<00:03:54.040> milliseconds<00:03:54.489> so

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
milliseconds to five milliseconds so

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.099 
milliseconds to five milliseconds so
there's<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:54.880> many<00:03:54.940> different<00:03:55.060> factors<00:03:55.389> and<00:03:55.750> I

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
there's so many different factors and I

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.800 
there's so many different factors and I
think<00:03:56.349> limiting<00:03:57.060> those<00:03:58.060> factors<00:03:58.480> as<00:03:58.599> much<00:03:58.720> as

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
think limiting those factors as much as

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.120 
think limiting those factors as much as
possible<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.319> obviously<00:03:59.620> going<00:03:59.799> to<00:03:59.859> give<00:03:59.980> you

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
possible is obviously going to give you

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.920 
possible is obviously going to give you
a<00:04:00.340> little<00:04:00.760> bit<00:04:00.910> more<00:04:01.030> fluid<00:04:01.239> II<00:04:01.450> allow<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:01.780> to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
a little bit more fluid II allow you to

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.750 
a little bit more fluid II allow you to
be<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.079> little<00:04:02.170> more<00:04:02.319> responsive<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.099> in

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
be a little more responsive and in

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.009 
be a little more responsive and in
first-person<00:04:04.239> shooters<00:04:04.480> that's<00:04:04.630> incredibly

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.170

TN<00:04:40.650> panels<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.010> mean<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.250> can<00:04:41.370> get<00:04:41.430> an<00:04:41.550> ASIS<00:04:41.940> 60

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420

about<00:04:48.080> $450<00:04:49.080> when<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.230> bought<00:04:49.440> it

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
about $450 when I bought it

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.230 
about $450 when I bought it
now<00:04:50.100> monitors<00:04:50.460> can<00:04:50.610> be<00:04:50.790> very<00:04:51.030> expensive

I'm not going to count all my desperate

I'm not going to count all my desperate
and<00:05:27.000> kills<00:05:27.390> but<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:28.350> end<00:05:28.830> up<00:05:28.860> with<00:05:28.980> a<00:05:29.010> score<00:05:29.280> of

around<00:05:29.520> 40<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.240> 10<00:05:30.600> so<00:05:31.320> about<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.710> 4<00:05:32.280> kill<00:05:32.520> death

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
around 40 and 10 so about a 4 kill death

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.910 
around 40 and 10 so about a 4 kill death
ratio<00:05:32.760> with<00:05:33.120> 40<00:05:33.450> kills<00:05:33.720> whereas<00:05:34.470> I<00:05:34.590> switched

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
ratio with 40 kills whereas I switched

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.860 
ratio with 40 kills whereas I switched
to<00:05:35.220> and<00:05:35.640> this<00:05:35.730> is<00:05:35.850> directly<00:05:36.270> after<00:05:36.660> right

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
to and this is directly after right

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.210 
to and this is directly after right
after<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.140> finished<00:05:37.380> playing<00:05:37.440> 120<00:05:37.980> Hertz<00:05:38.160> I

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
after I finished playing 120 Hertz I

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.470 
after I finished playing 120 Hertz I
switched<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:38.580> 60<00:05:38.850> yards<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.120> played<00:05:39.270> tomorrow

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
switched to 60 yards and played tomorrow

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.310 
switched to 60 yards and played tomorrow
I<00:05:39.810> ended<00:05:40.410> with<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.560> score<00:05:40.770> of<00:05:40.950> about<00:05:41.250> 20<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.360> 24

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
I ended with a score of about 20 and 24

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.290 
I ended with a score of about 20 and 24
so<00:05:43.980> as<00:05:44.130> you<00:05:44.250> can<00:05:44.370> see<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.610> actually<00:05:44.880> went<00:05:45.210> from

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
so as you can see I actually went from

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.180 
so as you can see I actually went from
having<00:05:45.480> a<00:05:45.630> 4<00:05:45.930> kill<00:05:46.170> death<00:05:46.440> ratio<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.920> having<00:05:47.130> a

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
having a 4 kill death ratio to having a

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.970 
having a 4 kill death ratio to having a
negative<00:05:47.430> kill<00:05:47.910> death<00:05:48.030> ratio<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:49.680> only

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
negative kill death ratio and only

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.100 
negative kill death ratio and only
having<00:05:50.220> you<00:05:50.610> know<00:05:50.700> 20<00:05:51.060> kills<00:05:51.300> I<00:05:51.540> think<00:05:51.930> it<00:05:51.990> was

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
having you know 20 kills I think it was

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.810 
having you know 20 kills I think it was
either<00:05:52.200> 20<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.860> yeah<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.490> think<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:53.670> was<00:05:53.730> around

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
either 20 and yeah I think I was around

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.110 
either 20 and yeah I think I was around
20<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.240> 25<00:05:54.660> deaths<00:05:54.870> just<00:05:55.140> like<00:05:55.380> that<00:05:55.880> so<00:05:56.880> it's

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
20 and 25 deaths just like that so it's

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.030 
20 and 25 deaths just like that so it's
a<00:05:57.180> huge<00:05:57.450> difference<00:05:57.870> now<00:05:58.080> this<00:05:58.710> isn't<00:05:59.010> a

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
a huge difference now this isn't a

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.190 
a huge difference now this isn't a
perfect<00:05:59.220> test<00:05:59.580> because<00:05:59.970> I<00:06:00.000> think<00:06:00.210> if<00:06:00.600> my<00:06:01.020> eyes

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
perfect test because I think if my eyes

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.830 
perfect test because I think if my eyes
were<00:06:01.230> you<00:06:02.160> know<00:06:02.280> if<00:06:02.550> I<00:06:02.670> was<00:06:02.790> playing<00:06:03.030> on<00:06:03.180> 60

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
were you know if I was playing on 60

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.960 
were you know if I was playing on 60
Hertz<00:06:04.230> for<00:06:04.590> a<00:06:04.620> longer<00:06:05.040> period<00:06:05.190> of<00:06:05.370> time<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.850> my

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
Hertz for a longer period of time and my

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.610 
Hertz for a longer period of time and my
eyes<00:06:06.090> got<00:06:06.300> more<00:06:06.510> used<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.810> that

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
eyes got more used to that

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.860 
eyes got more used to that
slightly<00:06:08.100> choppier<00:06:08.730> motion<00:06:09.240> I<00:06:09.390> think<00:06:09.630> I

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
slightly choppier motion I think I

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.940 
slightly choppier motion I think I
probably<00:06:09.960> would<00:06:10.140> have<00:06:10.290> gotten<00:06:10.470> more<00:06:10.650> used<00:06:10.710> to

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
probably would have gotten more used to

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.920 
probably would have gotten more used to
it<00:06:11.040> and<00:06:11.310> I<00:06:11.340> would<00:06:11.430> have<00:06:11.580> kind<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.330> compensated

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
it and I would have kind of compensated

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.730 
it and I would have kind of compensated
and<00:06:13.020> maybe<00:06:13.170> played<00:06:13.440> a<00:06:13.470> little<00:06:13.590> bit

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
and maybe played a little bit

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.020 
and maybe played a little bit
differently<00:06:14.070> and<00:06:14.130> I<00:06:14.370> also<00:06:14.520> think<00:06:14.730> when<00:06:14.910> I<00:06:14.940> was

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
differently and I also think when I was

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.210 
differently and I also think when I was
when<00:06:15.390> I<00:06:15.450> swear<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:16.140> second<00:06:16.500> round<00:06:16.650> of<00:06:16.800> team

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
when I swear the second round of team

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.850 
when I swear the second round of team
deathmatch<00:06:17.400> that<00:06:17.670> I<00:06:17.730> played<00:06:18.000> on<00:06:18.840> canals<00:06:19.650> it

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
deathmatch that I played on canals it

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.470 
deathmatch that I played on canals it
seemed<00:06:20.010> like<00:06:20.190> almost<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.700> entire<00:06:21.030> team<00:06:21.300> was

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
seemed like almost the entire team was

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.810 
seemed like almost the entire team was
using

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
using

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.050 
using
it<00:06:22.940> was<00:06:23.120> was<00:06:23.390> you<00:06:23.840> know<00:06:23.900> being<00:06:24.260> I'm<00:06:24.850> 16<00:06:25.850> Pro

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
it was was you know being I'm 16 Pro

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.830 
it was was you know being I'm 16 Pro
bunnyhop<00:06:26.510> bunny-hopping<00:06:27.140> pros<00:06:27.740> so<00:06:28.130> I<00:06:28.940> don't

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
bunnyhop bunny-hopping pros so I don't

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.030 
bunnyhop bunny-hopping pros so I don't
know<00:06:29.900> if<00:06:29.960> that<00:06:30.110> that<00:06:30.350> probably<00:06:30.650> changed<00:06:30.740> its

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
know if that that probably changed its

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.850 
know if that that probably changed its
core<00:06:31.190> quite<00:06:31.430> a<00:06:31.460> bit<00:06:31.670> but<00:06:31.970> regardless<00:06:32.860> this

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
core quite a bit but regardless this

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.320 
core quite a bit but regardless this
isn't<00:06:34.130> a<00:06:34.160> perfect<00:06:34.460> test<00:06:34.610> but<00:06:34.910> I<00:06:34.940> think<00:06:35.180> it's

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
isn't a perfect test but I think it's

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.410 
isn't a perfect test but I think it's
fairly<00:06:36.110> obvious<00:06:36.230> that<00:06:36.860> at<00:06:37.070> least<00:06:37.400> for<00:06:37.820> me<00:06:38.180> and

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
fairly obvious that at least for me and

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.020 
fairly obvious that at least for me and
I<00:06:38.990> think<00:06:39.350> I<00:06:39.530> say<00:06:40.160> at<00:06:40.280> least<00:06:40.430> for<00:06:40.580> me<00:06:40.670> just<00:06:40.880> so

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
I think I say at least for me just so

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.360 
I think I say at least for me just so
that<00:06:41.180> people<00:06:41.210> don't<00:06:42.160> you<00:06:43.160> know<00:06:43.190> get

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
that people don't you know get

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.820 
that people don't you know get
frustrated<00:06:44.000> but<00:06:44.180> I<00:06:44.420> think<00:06:44.900> for<00:06:45.080> everybody<00:06:45.620> if

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
frustrated but I think for everybody if

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.980 
frustrated but I think for everybody if
you<00:06:45.950> played<00:06:46.310> at<00:06:46.610> 120<00:06:47.240> frames<00:06:47.270> per<00:06:47.540> second

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
you played at 120 frames per second

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.660 
you played at 120 frames per second
versus<00:06:48.380> 60<00:06:48.740> frames<00:06:48.980> per<00:06:49.040> second<00:06:49.400> you<00:06:49.430> be

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
versus 60 frames per second you be

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.690 
versus 60 frames per second you be
become<00:06:50.150> a<00:06:50.180> better<00:06:50.390> player<00:06:50.630> and<00:06:51.220> now<00:06:52.220> is<00:06:52.490> that

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700 
become a better player and now is that

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.480 
become a better player and now is that
necessarily<00:06:53.180> worth<00:06:53.510> spending<00:06:53.870> $300<00:06:54.800> extra<00:06:55.310> on

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
necessarily worth spending $300 extra on

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.340 
necessarily worth spending $300 extra on
a<00:06:55.520> monitor<00:06:55.910> that's<00:06:56.540> up<00:06:56.750> to<00:06:56.870> you<00:06:56.960> that's<00:06:57.050> up<00:06:57.230> to

a monitor that's up to you that's up to

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.810 
a monitor that's up to you that's up to
your<00:06:57.470> financial<00:06:57.800> situation<00:06:58.040> how<00:06:58.460> much<00:06:58.610> money

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
your financial situation how much money

you're<00:06:58.970> willing<00:06:59.180> to<00:06:59.210> spend<00:06:59.360> on<00:06:59.780> gaming<00:07:00.760> but<00:07:01.760> I

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
you're willing to spend on gaming but I

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.190 
you're willing to spend on gaming but I
just<00:07:02.000> wanted<00:07:02.180> to<00:07:02.270> throw<00:07:02.420> it<00:07:02.480> out<00:07:02.540> there<00:07:02.720> that<00:07:02.930> I

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
just wanted to throw it out there that I

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.590 
just wanted to throw it out there that I
think<00:07:03.620> from<00:07:04.400> for<00:07:04.820> the<00:07:04.880> majority<00:07:05.210> of<00:07:05.420> players

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600 
think from for the majority of players

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.010 
think from for the majority of players
if<00:07:05.990> you<00:07:06.140> can<00:07:06.350> you<00:07:06.680> know<00:07:06.740> spend<00:07:07.580> 100<00:07:07.970> 400<00:07:08.480> or<00:07:08.570> 450

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
if you can you know spend 100 400 or 450

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.530 
if you can you know spend 100 400 or 450
dollars<00:07:09.260> on<00:07:09.620> a<00:07:09.650> higher<00:07:10.460> refresh<00:07:10.880> rate<00:07:11.120> panel

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
dollars on a higher refresh rate panel

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.060 
dollars on a higher refresh rate panel
you're<00:07:12.110> probably<00:07:12.350> gonna<00:07:12.530> end<00:07:12.590> up<00:07:12.710> being<00:07:13.010> a

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
you're probably gonna end up being a

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.620 
you're probably gonna end up being a
better<00:07:13.190> player<00:07:13.490> not<00:07:13.670> overnight<00:07:14.030> it's<00:07:14.480> not

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
better player not overnight it's not

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.270 
better player not overnight it's not
like<00:07:14.840> you<00:07:15.140> plug<00:07:15.410> it<00:07:15.560> in<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:15.890> now<00:07:16.040> you're

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
like you plug it in and now you're

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.880 
like you plug it in and now you're
perfectly<00:07:16.700> accurate<00:07:16.910> but<00:07:17.330> I<00:07:17.510> think<00:07:18.050> it's<00:07:18.740> just

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:18.890 
perfectly accurate but I think it's just

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.230 
perfectly accurate but I think it's just
a<00:07:19.010> general<00:07:19.370> thumb<00:07:19.670> you'll<00:07:19.820> you'll<00:07:20.060> end<00:07:20.180> up

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
a general thumb you'll you'll end up

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.430 
a general thumb you'll you'll end up
being<00:07:20.390> a<00:07:20.480> better<00:07:20.630> player<00:07:20.900> especially<00:07:21.140> once

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
being a better player especially once

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.320 
being a better player especially once
you<00:07:21.470> get<00:07:21.620> used<00:07:21.800> to<00:07:21.830> it<00:07:21.920> so<00:07:22.100> anyway<00:07:22.400> thanks<00:07:23.240> for

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 
with these panels are I know there's

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.060 
with these panels are I know there's
probably<00:07:30.230> a<00:07:30.440> lot<00:07:30.530> of<00:07:30.590> people<00:07:30.680> are<00:07:30.830> going<00:07:30.920> to

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.070 
probably a lot of people are going to

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.310 
probably a lot of people are going to
say<00:07:31.190> that<00:07:31.730> eyes<00:07:31.940> can't<00:07:32.390> see<00:07:32.630> more<00:07:32.840> than<00:07:32.900> 30

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.320 
say that eyes can't see more than 30

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.990 
say that eyes can't see more than 30
frames<00:07:33.650> or<00:07:33.890> eyes<00:07:34.010> can't<00:07:34.280> see<00:07:34.460> more<00:07:34.580> than<00:07:34.640> 60

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.850 
frames or eyes can't see more than 60
frames<00:07:35.270> and<00:07:35.480> my<00:07:35.900> response<00:07:36.200> to<00:07:36.230> that<00:07:36.350> is<00:07:36.470> your

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 
frames and my response to that is your

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.440 
frames and my response to that is your
eyeballs<00:07:37.280> do<00:07:37.460> not<00:07:37.610> have<00:07:37.820> a<00:07:37.850> shutter<00:07:38.210> and

therefore you are not a computer you

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.930 
therefore you are not a computer you
don't<00:07:41.240> do<00:07:41.510> not<00:07:41.660> see<00:07:41.900> in<00:07:42.050> any<00:07:42.200> form<00:07:42.680> of<00:07:42.950> a<00:07:43.580> frame

rate a frame rate is just a way that a
