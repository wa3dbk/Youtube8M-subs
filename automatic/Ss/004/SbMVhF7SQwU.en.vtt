00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.179
 hello friends my name is denis 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.070
 fights you are on channel happy 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.500
 life point ru and now we will 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.350
 consider an exercise that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.050
 train back delta exercise 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.689
 called mahi dumbbells in the slope 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.849
 sometimes they are called dumbbell layouts in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.130
 tilt but i'm a supporter 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.250
 old traditional school so i am more often 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.640
 this exercise is called mahi dumbbells in 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:44.309
 tilting exercise looks about 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:47.190
 so you remember that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 In general, our hotel you do two 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.350
 The main function is the first function 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.449
 when we weigh ourselves we push it away 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.579
 various press options 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.620
 options march of in front of you and the second 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.620
 function when we pull weight to ourselves 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.420
 various options for dumbbells with 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.939
 barbell and accordingly various 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.580
 swings as swings through the side 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.360
 so the moves in the slope now we just 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.080
 consider the option of moves in the slope 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.259
 because this option is more 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.840
 focused stress 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.650
 exactly on the back of our 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.950
 delta delta delta most often difficult 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.030
 develop because very little 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.530
 exercises accented load here 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.210
 what feature of this exercise 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.979
 the main feature of this exercise 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.939
 is that it is isolated and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.710
 that is, our joints are fixed 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.840
 elbows and movement only happens in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 shoulder joints 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.479
 this way focused 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.170
 loading exactly the rear deltas further 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.880
 the nuances begin 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.920
 the fact is you can swing 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.189
 in tilt with various muscular 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.710
 groups particular if you will be shoulders 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.290
 start back then you will turn on 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.709
 top back and trapeze as it looks 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.569
 that's when we make a similar move you 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.640
 see my shoulders rise up one 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.220
 matter if i 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.300
 shoulders lowering down smearing trapezoid 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.489
 fall on the back 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.370
 so i can more isolated 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.690
 working rear deltas 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.000
 because all the rest we walked I 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.519
 forcibly shut down for other work 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.310
 matter if i don't think about it then i 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.260
 starting to lift my shoulders up as soon as 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.299
 I'm starting to raise my shoulders to see 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.730
 my back is shrinking my back 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.549
 trapezoid since I train not nitrite 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.970
 trapezoid adele you my task as you can 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.840
 lower shoulders when i shoulders 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.170
 drop down 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.310
 trapezium spread over the back 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.730
 respectively, the movement is performed for 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.260
 due to their affairs and not due to the trapezoid here 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.450
 and as you see with this form 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.180
 doing an exercise I basically do not 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.910
 I can raise my hands very high because 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.769
 what if i start raising my arms higher 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.359
 then my shoulders will rise 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.780
 accordingly do not get involved in the work 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:13.230
 trapezoid trapezoid 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.250
 should be spread over the shoulders below 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.200
 accordingly, I will be very 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.260
 short amplitude is not worth it 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.269
 fear is our anatomy 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.190
 if we want to work for us 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.609
 what do you need with this with this have 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.590
 put up the next nuance which is important 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.430
 understand when training rear deltas 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.670
 not necessarily 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.079
 bend as low as possible classic 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.510
 the school says that the body is generally 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.890
 should be parallel to the floor there are you 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.250
 should generally lean over like this 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.819
 manner and in general do the mahi often 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.310
 people are pushing and bombs in some 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.109
 something there is a bench for this purpose 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.450
 to make it even easier to move 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.690
 in general, it is in my opinion not so 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.640
 important because in order to back 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.450
 the delta began to shrink at all 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.799
 be sure to lean forward so low 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.010
 because even if you have a slope 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.720
 45 degrees but you will do all those 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.209
 the requirements that I spoke about 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.239
 lower your shoulders will raise 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.599
 elbows unfold your wrists then 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.549
 what you need will work very much 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.500
 important in this exercise before you 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.720
 don't learn the right technique not 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.970
 throw big weights at all in this 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.430
 exercise never chase weights 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.030
 because if you do it at 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.300
 you will often be disturbed by a technician 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.490
 work great 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.940
 they themselves naturally do not work deltas 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.250
 Naturally the back deltas are lagging your 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.759
 the task is to constantly control your 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.069
 shoulders 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.440
 constantly monitor so that the elbow is not 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.690
 rose to a level above shoulder level 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.490
 because if the elbow is above the level 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.710
 shoulders will be what's going to happen 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.210
 turn on the keystone will turn off 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.150
 delta so we start to learn the technique 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.409
 with very light scales 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.000
 constantly trying to think about 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:11.120
 the shoulders were below the trapeze smeared and 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.440
 here is our movement here is our max finger 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.740
 slightly raise up to 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.520
 there was a better isolation of our del but 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.469
 and such a nuance is important 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.960
 considering what you see is amplitude 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:30.250
 our movements are very short that is not 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.020
 such a huge max and very short 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.729
 considering this you must understand that you 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.090
 will have to do more reps in 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:41.360
 exercise there is not 612 traditional but 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.639
 somewhere around 10 20 just due to the fact that 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.430
 load time 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.710
 will decrease by half if you will 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.020
 cut the motion path twice 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.909
 how can we compensate for this only 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.419
 by increasing the number of repetitions 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:06:00.050
 approach accordingly we take and in 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:03.289
 partial amplitude make a big 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.320
 the number of repetitions is usually somewhere 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.770
 between 1020 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.430
 before I felt a burning sensation in the bottom 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.000
 the point is not desirable to touch the dumbbells 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.300
 each other 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.330
 because then the load goes back 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.870
 the delta is better to stop a little bit 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:26.080
 energized to load 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:31.980
 persisted all the way this trajectory 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.980
 mahi tilts on the back delta babe
