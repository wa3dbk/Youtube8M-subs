00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.730
 people new round new patch and 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:11.240
 this time it's the 8.11 I'm sitting up 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.830
 the testserver after relatively early 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.180
 surname that and 11,000 people on it like that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.920
 They just went to look like it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.140
 Looks like it's tonight and me 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.560
 I would like to log in then 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.699
 probably the queue is quite big 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.949
 what is this 8 points about ? 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 we already have a lot in the news the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.940
 Patenotes read that means I will 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.440
 not everything just repeat that thing 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.430
 it's a bit obvious and that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 is a lot 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 next to the whole card changes the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.680
 a new one in addition to a few 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.660
 things in the garage so did not until completely 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.700
 interesting there we can chat 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.079
 deactivate 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.309
 I do not know why it is 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.050
 maybe wants to do all this 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.239
 ubs stay no longer read 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.620
 But just that is entertaining throughout 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.820
 important if I further the train 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.409
 want to write it anyway 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 Actively accordingly I can about it 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 Write if someone on the mini-map 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.330
 rusbend 5 klink and so on then 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.770
 of course to see that too 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.930
 regardless of whether this is activated or 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.760
 not and of course I can do it myself 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.040
 Give commands and binge and read 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.210
 of it in the chat just that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.310
 written by the others 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.240
 disabled 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.770
 at the same time I can chat noir 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.180
 now down also scroll up talk 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.000
 seen down in the corner for the chat 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.470
 place has written something 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.909
 that a construction seconds hidden 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.430
 So there are small arrow keys where 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.369
 I can scroll down the high one 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.270
 take your time 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.820
 somehow that's pretty jerky 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.509
 Squad The fan does not look that way 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.340
 as if good frames for recording 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.740
 enough 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.320
 furthermore very important finally 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.000
 Three million years there are options 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.399
 the crew to train 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.140
 with that with a click so I can 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.830
 they are doing a bit of a fuss now 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.510
 had to be promo for example 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.010
 I can put them all in the barracks 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.040
 Send but not what I do I 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.830
 bring back completely 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.840
 yes I do not have a button for selection 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.370
 that means I have to be really fed up with it 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.310
 There is no right-click option there 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.860
 not I can not right click 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.860
 must use each one again 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.770
 that, of course, a bit the middle one 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.570
 Punkt actually says that 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.580
 the doors of the croisette if these 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.350
 birds in the last battle so 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.970
 actually the last one is in there 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.810
 but sat from the last fight 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.150
 it probably with the partners 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.760
 Interesting in front of premium tank 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.500
 where I just choreograph the choral movements 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.190
 to train once and then the old one 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.190
 or use 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.060
 yes and all retrain is very 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:07.000
 very interesting otherwise I would have to 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:10.260
 every single change we do that 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.260
 same time with a party 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.510
 that is, if I here any now 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.680
 strangers take our japan 200 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.830
 At that time you had four people always 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.620
 four times the deputies and then the 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.930
 learning the mystery is now fortunate 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.750
 no longer necessary because then emerged as 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.120
 to debate on light can train 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.970
 and then, of course, everyone will 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.160
 retrained in the trap of one in there though 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.110
 I can then all at once to 80 or 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.720
 100 percent and accordingly 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.019
 that adds up very much down there 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.070
 nice fast solution 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:50.049
 next there are the tanks 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:54.549
 sets oracle quite extreme 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.930
 Panzer Canal as an example of French 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.560
 Right click dealer for hedgehog details 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.860
 because we in it but this can had 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.230
 but point number two displays no 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.209
 direct this list have in here 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.120
 three times it is something very fast 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.690
 Whatever you can understand why 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 it takes 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.079
 I have never needed it when there 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.900
 I'm over the way up 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.880
 but gone one or the other 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:26.180
 maybe interesting this fast 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:29.770
 to take away and last point all the way 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:35.710
 important is that gold camouflage 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.710
 It was so far I have once bought 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.780
 put the hook of your place in it 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:48.199
 that means I can do something else 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:52.669
 Buy the 0 looks different 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.479
 I thought that was green iguana, though 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.000
 changed again 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.960
 the strong out of it for the same 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.910
 of that here and I, I did not 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:09.470
 seen and it comes to us weird 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:11.150
 high egger that's okay, we test 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.530
 Just because I think I have it 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.940
 just listen to it now and the credits 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:20.840
 do not apply exactly to or below 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.539
 but now I have one for gold 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:30.740
 bought that is called buy then stand 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:32.710
 it really should not but the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.699
 will be deleted 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.710
 and if I have for gold now have 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.349
 me up there and those down there 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.949
 The hook says then is green hook 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.460
 the active disabled trim and yellow 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.030
 I have that I could then use 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.080
 accordingly cost me that here 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.039
 below nothing 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.120
 very nice solution does not make much sense 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:06:00.050
 Since not so many buy then I am poor 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.340
 ok let me say so the most important 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.840
 things that are interesting to me like 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.599
 he said the rest he was able to 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.490
 read patches or any 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.530
 look at other videos 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.439
 well then we come to the cards 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.360
 oh yes yet forgotten are indeed 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:19.069
 this new mode national battles the 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.650
 one is not about battles but 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:22.900
 directly in the menu you can adjust if 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.190
 I am here now 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.159
 this site battle and so on 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.699
 it was possible to select the hook 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.370
 confrontations with it 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.110
 the international source means that 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.690
 then we come by chance 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.930
 apparently then in roses against 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.580
 shout ami and then have 15 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.190
 same armor so not the same now 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.469
 Tanks sinks by 15 children throwers against 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:50.060
 no idea wde 100 but all 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:53.060
 research branches of course medium scout 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.830
 and so on I'm curious how that 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.750
 will probably be pretty much in the beginning 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.580
 The same applies to all the texts last 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.449
 want to take armor but also applies 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.860
 every animal level is at every level 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.650
 tractor seats or the 14th 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.539
 the matter just the same all 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.719
 I think nation is very nice 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:14.680
 hopefully that will work out that way 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:14.680
 but now for the cards
