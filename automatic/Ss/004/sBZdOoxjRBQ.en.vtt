 so he also said it was kind of a pose but if the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.879
 this is the fipeq-csq 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.179
 now if the first volume 1 year 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.630
 Well it will enlighten us alone so it's very realistic since low 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.779
 it's true we do not know it 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:52.739
 if you are in a dark place and you take a flashlight at the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.590
 right hand 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.589
 marcel clermont 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:03:00.259
 you have to know that it's clear here if I never know any more ck objects and 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.159
 it is that if you let go 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.170
 ms is clear flight to where he had dropped the bar no longer enough 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.169

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.959

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 so we want to throw you small rocks and you look 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.370
 so here I have all presented to you just three years a little tool 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:25.230
 is that it works with the bright objects that is to say the 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.549
 recent walk 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.579

 only month lightning now and also seems to let go of his 40 so that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.159
 walk with all the bright objects 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.909
 even but it seems to me that these deviations more with a normal torch 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.539
 Well yes we can converge more 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.689
