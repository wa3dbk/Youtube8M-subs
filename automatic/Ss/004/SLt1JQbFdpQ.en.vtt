displays<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.590> extremely<00:00:43.590> high-end<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
displays are extremely high-end you can

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700 
displays are extremely high-end you can
zoom<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:46.680> are

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
zoom in as you can see they are

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.670 
zoom in as you can see they are
extremely<00:00:47.340> high-end<00:00:47.969> displays<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.690> also

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
extremely high-end displays and also

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.049 
extremely high-end displays and also
both<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.420> ball<00:00:51.420> PPI<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.469> 435<00:00:53.250> PPI<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.940> we

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
both have ball PPI have 435 PPI here we

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.959 
both have ball PPI have 435 PPI here we
have<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> 441<00:00:54.870> PPI<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.460> players<00:00:56.640> are

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
have a 441 PPI so I just players are

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.779 
have a 441 PPI so I just players are
kind<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.660> equal<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.710> Samsung<00:00:59.399> does<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.699> an

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
kind of equal but Samsung does have an

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.670 
kind of equal but Samsung does have an
edge<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> Samsung<00:01:01.170> uses<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
edge here because the Samsung uses the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.799 
edge here because the Samsung uses the
Super<00:01:02.250> AMOLED<00:01:02.550> technology<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.239> good

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
Super AMOLED technology we have good

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
Super AMOLED technology we have good
color<00:01:04.170> reproduction<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.250> display<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
color reproduction then this display and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.109 
color reproduction then this display and
I'm<00:01:06.810> not<00:01:06.990> sure<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.640> pretty<00:01:08.909> sure

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
I'm not sure what it is I'm pretty sure

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.510 
I'm not sure what it is I'm pretty sure
I<00:01:09.979> assume<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.630> IIPs<00:01:12.630> LCD<00:01:13.170> display<00:01:13.520> I'm

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
I assume it has a IIPs LCD display I'm

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.690 
I assume it has a IIPs LCD display I'm
pretty<00:01:14.820> sure<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.180> Super<00:01:15.600> AMOLED

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
pretty sure it's not Super AMOLED

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.149 
pretty sure it's not Super AMOLED
so<00:01:17.840> let's<00:01:20.000> compare<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.360> size<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.259> weight<00:01:22.560> now

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so let's compare the size and weight now

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
so let's compare the size and weight now

compare this phone to Galaxy spot and

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.590 
compare this phone to Galaxy spot and
that's<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.520> fact<00:05:56.790> that<00:05:56.880> you<00:05:57.090> have<00:05:57.180> accepted

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
that's the fact that you have accepted

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.530 
that's the fact that you have accepted
and<00:05:57.960> you<00:05:58.380> cannot<00:05:58.710> even<00:05:59.040> compare<00:05:59.550> it<00:06:00.060> with<00:06:00.090> the

and you cannot even compare it with the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.909 
and you cannot even compare it with the
galaxy<00:06:00.990> s4<00:06:01.550> you<00:06:02.550> know<00:06:03.140> they<00:06:04.140> have<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.500> do<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.650> lot

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
galaxy s4 you know they have to do a lot

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.500 
galaxy s4 you know they have to do a lot
of<00:06:04.950> effort<00:06:05.490> before<00:06:05.910> they<00:06:06.210> can<00:06:06.330> actually

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
of effort before they can actually

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.750 
of effort before they can actually
compare<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.140> devices<00:06:07.560> to<00:06:07.770> Samsung<00:06:08.220> Galaxy

so<00:06:10.280> yes<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:11.610> a<00:06:11.850> quick<00:06:12.060> little<00:06:12.300> comparison

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
so yes it's a quick little comparison

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.980 
so yes it's a quick little comparison
here<00:06:12.900> so<00:06:13.410> I<00:06:13.650> can't<00:06:14.340> really<00:06:14.520> compare<00:06:15.120> you<00:06:15.870> know

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
here so I can't really compare you know

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.600 
here so I can't really compare you know
like<00:06:16.140> benchmark<00:06:16.650> stuff<00:06:16.919> over<00:06:17.160> here<00:06:17.190> because

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
like benchmark stuff over here because

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.770 
like benchmark stuff over here because
there's<00:06:17.820> kind<00:06:17.940> of<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:18.120> lot<00:06:18.240> of<00:06:18.360> difference

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
there's kind of a lot of difference

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.230 
there's kind of a lot of difference
between<00:06:18.870> Cuba<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:19.560> Galaxy<00:06:20.190> phones<00:06:20.430> and<00:06:20.970> I<00:06:21.030> can

between Cuba and Galaxy phones and I can
tell<00:06:21.419> you<00:06:21.570> that<00:06:21.720> this<00:06:22.290> device<00:06:22.530> scores<00:06:22.890> almost

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900
