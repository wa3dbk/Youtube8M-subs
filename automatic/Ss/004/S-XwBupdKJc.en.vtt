average<00:01:24.570> drivers<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.380> mean<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.799> example<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
average drivers I mean for example the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.300 
average drivers I mean for example the
power<00:01:27.150> delivery<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.900> linear<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:29.040> engine

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
power delivery is very linear the engine

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.859

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
is very silent and I love the movement

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.920

of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> slick<00:01:31.560> gearbox<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.250> gearbox<00:01:32.640> is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
of the slick gearbox the gearbox is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
of the slick gearbox the gearbox is
fantastic<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> best

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
fantastic I think it is one of the best

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
fantastic I think it is one of the best
gearboxes<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.329> I've<00:01:36.479> seen<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.869> small<00:01:37.140> cars

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
gearboxes that I've seen on small cars

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.550 
gearboxes that I've seen on small cars
today<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> very<00:01:39.689> good<00:01:39.960> idea<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> use

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
today and it is a very good idea to use

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.990 
today and it is a very good idea to use
the<00:01:40.740> lifter<00:01:41.070> ring<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> reverse<00:01:41.790> gear

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the lifter ring and the reverse gear

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.389 
the lifter ring and the reverse gear
next<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> first<00:01:42.780> gear<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
next to the first gear I think the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.880 
next to the first gear I think the
overall<00:01:45.299> transmission<00:01:45.899> shifts<00:01:46.409> very<00:01:46.500> well

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
overall transmission shifts very well

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
overall transmission shifts very well
the<00:01:47.850> engine<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:49.229> tractable<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> very

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the engine is very tractable it is very

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.999 
the engine is very tractable it is very
good<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.020> would<00:01:52.229> obviously<00:01:52.590> give<00:01:52.860> very

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
good and it would obviously give very

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.710 
good and it would obviously give very
good<00:01:53.070> fuel<00:01:53.399> economy<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> seems<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.689> be

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
good fuel economy because it seems to be

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.200 
good fuel economy because it seems to be
tuned<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.290> economy<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.950> overall<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> noise

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
tuned for economy and overall the noise

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.620 
tuned for economy and overall the noise
levels<00:01:57.689> inside<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> car<00:01:58.409> was<00:01:58.729> very<00:01:59.729> low<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.299> I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
levels inside the car was very low and I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.120 
levels inside the car was very low and I
was<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:01.020> impressed<00:02:01.200> by<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.950> gave

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
was really impressed by this and it gave

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.459 
was really impressed by this and it gave
a<00:02:02.159> good<00:02:02.399> ride<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.240> suspension<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
a good ride the suspension and the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.280 
a good ride the suspension and the
handling<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.070> also<00:02:05.369> very<00:02:05.579> nice<00:02:05.930> firm<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.259> not

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
handling was also very nice firm but not

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.770 
handling was also very nice firm but not
too<00:02:07.469> soft<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.030> firm<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.599> would

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
too soft but not so firm that it would

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.780 
too soft but not so firm that it would
be<00:02:09.959> bone<00:02:10.319> jarring<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.860> any<00:02:11.009> which<00:02:11.250> way<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.580> think

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
be bone jarring in any which way I think

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.500 
be bone jarring in any which way I think
I<00:02:11.849> really<00:02:12.090> enjoyed

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
I really enjoyed

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.650 
I really enjoyed
right<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> suspension<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> car
