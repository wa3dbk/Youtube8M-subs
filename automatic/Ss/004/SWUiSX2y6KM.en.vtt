00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.720 
a series of decreases all up to form my

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.140 
a series of decreases all up to form my
toe<00:00:11.780> and<00:00:12.320> while<00:00:12.920> this<00:00:13.130> is<00:00:13.370> smaller<00:00:13.700> than<00:00:14.030> a

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
toe and while this is smaller than a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.260 
toe and while this is smaller than a
regular<00:00:14.390> sock<00:00:14.960> this<00:00:15.800> is<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:16.189> topside<00:00:16.880> of<00:00:16.910> the

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
regular sock this is the topside of the

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.720 
regular sock this is the topside of the
toe<00:00:17.660> with<00:00:18.080> my<00:00:18.260> provisional<00:00:18.830> cast<00:00:19.160> on<00:00:19.460> down

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
toe with my provisional cast on down

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.640 
toe with my provisional cast on down
here<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:20.270> I've<00:00:20.840> worked<00:00:21.020> a<00:00:21.230> series<00:00:21.619> of

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
here and I've worked a series of

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.280 
here and I've worked a series of
decreases<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:22.490> shape<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:23.180> toe<00:00:23.390> now<00:00:24.079> you're

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
decreases to shape the toe now you're

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.800 
decreases to shape the toe now you're
probably<00:00:24.529> thinking<00:00:24.919> that<00:00:25.369> this<00:00:26.180> toe<00:00:26.509> needs

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
probably thinking that this toe needs

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.100 
probably thinking that this toe needs
another<00:00:27.169> side<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.919> and<00:00:28.220> yes<00:00:28.579> it<00:00:28.849> does<00:00:29.210> but

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
another side to it and yes it does but

my<00:02:05.780> needle<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.380> if<00:02:06.620> we<00:02:06.770> can<00:02:06.980> zoom<00:02:07.220> in<00:02:07.490> on<00:02:07.640> that

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
my needle and if we can zoom in on that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.400 
my needle and if we can zoom in on that
you<00:02:08.360> can<00:02:08.390> see<00:02:08.629> even

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
you can see even

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.190 
you can see even
better<00:02:09.560> now<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.160> each<00:02:10.790> one<00:02:11.150> has<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.540> bead<00:02:11.990> of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
better now that each one has a bead of

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.860 
better now that each one has a bead of
the<00:02:12.290> provisional<00:02:13.250> yarn<00:02:13.550> above<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.180> two

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
the provisional yarn above it and two

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.530 
the provisional yarn above it and two
stitches<00:02:15.320> under<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:16.100> now<00:02:16.670> all<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.240> do

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
stitches under it now all I have to do

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.020 
stitches under it now all I have to do
is<00:02:17.720> pull<00:02:17.990> out<00:02:18.020> my<00:02:18.380> provisional<00:02:18.980> yarn<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.610> in

is pull out my provisional yarn and in
this<00:02:20.210> case<00:02:20.570> this<00:02:21.350> kind<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.010> cast<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.580> you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
this case this kind of cast and you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.490 
this case this kind of cast and you
can't<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.270> pull<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.660> yarn<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.110> it'll<00:02:24.380> all

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
can't just pull the yarn and it'll all

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.920 
can't just pull the yarn and it'll all
unzip<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.160> actually<00:02:25.700> have<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.090> pick<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.750> out

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
unzip you actually have to pick it out

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.170 
unzip you actually have to pick it out
so<00:02:27.530> what<00:02:27.710> I'm<00:02:27.830> first<00:02:28.130> going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.550> do<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.910> get<00:02:29.120> rid

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
so what I'm first going to do is get rid

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.500 
so what I'm first going to do is get rid
of<00:02:29.360> my<00:02:29.600> long<00:02:29.840> tail<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.850> use<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> seam

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
of my long tail and I like to use a seam

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.900 
of my long tail and I like to use a seam
ripper<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:33.110> instead<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:33.980> going<00:02:34.460> through<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
ripper and instead of going through the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.480 
ripper and instead of going through the
bead<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.330> yarn<00:02:35.630> which<00:02:35.990> might<00:02:36.320> cut<00:02:36.740> my<00:02:36.950> stitches

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
bead of yarn which might cut my stitches

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.150 
bead of yarn which might cut my stitches
accidentally<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.540> go<00:02:39.080> in<00:02:39.380> between<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
accidentally I go in between the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.030 
accidentally I go in between the
stitches<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:41.840> go<00:02:42.050> in<00:02:42.290> between<00:02:42.500> each

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
stitches and I just go in between each

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.490 
stitches and I just go in between each
one<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> seam<00:02:44.090> ripper<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.630> give<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.290> a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
one with a seam ripper and give it a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.920 
one with a seam ripper and give it a
clip<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.040> already<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.790> can<00:02:46.850> see<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.480> this

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
clip and already you can see that this

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.310 
clip and already you can see that this
yarn<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.440> coming<00:02:48.530> out<00:02:48.980> very<00:02:49.250> easily<00:02:50.290> go<00:02:51.290> back

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
yarn is coming out very easily go back

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.360 
yarn is coming out very easily go back
to<00:02:51.830> here<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.400> one<00:02:53.300> more<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.960> now<00:02:54.620> all<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.950> do<00:02:55.160> is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
to here and one more and now all I do is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.270 
to here and one more and now all I do is
carefully<00:02:55.850> just<00:02:56.390> pull<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.960> out<00:02:57.280> sometimes

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
carefully just pull this out sometimes

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.580 
carefully just pull this out sometimes
it<00:02:58.520> hasn't<00:02:58.880> gone<00:02:59.090> through<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.600> whole<00:02:59.630> thread

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.640 

and<00:03:04.210> there<00:03:05.210> you<00:03:05.390> see<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.900> live<00:03:06.230> stitches

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
and there you see this live stitches

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.980 
and there you see this live stitches
right<00:03:07.070> on<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.460> needle<00:03:07.820> just<00:03:08.360> lined<00:03:08.750> up

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
right on the needle just lined up

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.730 
right on the needle just lined up
perfectly<00:03:09.860> in<00:03:10.160> order<00:03:11.320> now<00:03:12.320> there<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.710> one

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
perfectly in order now there is one

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.190 
perfectly in order now there is one
thing<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.520> I<00:03:13.760> have<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.240> tell<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.600> about<00:03:14.900> this

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
cast done and there they all are the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.890 
cast done and there they all are the
first<00:03:21.800> two<00:03:22.130> stitches<00:03:22.459> if<00:03:22.880> we<00:03:23.030> can<00:03:23.240> zoom<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.750> on

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
first two stitches if we can zoom in on

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.800 
first two stitches if we can zoom in on
these<00:03:24.050> first<00:03:24.440> two<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:25.490> first<00:03:25.820> two<00:03:26.150> sometimes

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
these first two the first two sometimes

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.990 
these first two the first two sometimes
are<00:03:27.080> twisted<00:03:27.680> around<00:03:27.800> each<00:03:28.280> other<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:28.880> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
are twisted around each other in the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.300 
are twisted around each other in the
back<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.990> what<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.290> have<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.650> do<00:03:30.800> is<00:03:30.980> carefully

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
back so what you have to do is carefully

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.670 
back so what you have to do is carefully
separate<00:03:32.180> them<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:33.140> other<00:03:33.290> thing<00:03:33.650> you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
separate them and the other thing you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.340 
separate them and the other thing you
have<00:03:33.830> to<00:03:34.040> do<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.640> check<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.180> make<00:03:35.360> sure<00:03:35.420> that

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
have to do is check to make sure that

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.920 
have to do is check to make sure that
they're<00:03:36.620> mounted<00:03:37.130> in<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.400> correct<00:03:37.790> direction

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
they're mounted in the correct direction

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.260 
they're mounted in the correct direction
so<00:03:38.930> some<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.290> them<00:03:39.590> have<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.980> left<00:03:40.250> leg<00:03:40.550> facing

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
so some of them have the left leg facing

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.570 
so some of them have the left leg facing
which<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.870> first<00:03:42.110> one<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:43.070> in<00:03:43.250> order<00:03:43.400> to

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
which is the first one so in order to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.699 
which is the first one so in order to
flip<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.270> one<00:03:44.510> around<00:03:44.780> all<00:03:45.080> you<00:03:45.260> have<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.560> do

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
flip that one around all you have to do

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.110 
flip that one around all you have to do
is<00:03:45.890> knit<00:03:46.070> through<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.400> back<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.970> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
is knit through the back of it and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.810 
is knit through the back of it and
thereafter<00:03:47.870> they'll<00:03:48.530> be<00:03:48.680> alternated<00:03:49.550> right

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
thereafter they'll be alternated right

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.630 
thereafter they'll be alternated right
leg<00:03:50.090> facing<00:03:50.630> ref<00:03:50.900> left<00:03:51.410> leg<00:03:51.650> facing<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.400> so

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
leg facing ref left leg facing and so

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.910 
leg facing ref left leg facing and so
you<00:03:52.700> just<00:03:53.000> knit<00:03:53.270> through<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.630> back<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:54.320> the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
you just knit through the back of the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.310 
you just knit through the back of the
left<00:03:55.130> leg<00:03:55.310> facing<00:03:55.970> ones<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.810> here<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.290> are

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
left leg facing ones so here you are

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.440 
left leg facing ones so here you are
with<00:03:58.040> your<00:03:58.220> beautiful<00:03:58.640> toe<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.390> your
