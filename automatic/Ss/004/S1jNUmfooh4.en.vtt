00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.180
 national team of the soviet union here on there 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.489
 remember one of the best players there 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.940
 the most technical possible player of those 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.000
 From time to time what predictions is the world team from 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.690
 soviet union who in goose games 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.730
 such matches 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.890
 the result for the role is absolutely not at all 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.960
 plays judging by those players who 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.240
 come there team 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.940

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.990
 everything is there younger than us there is not me 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.020
 sense and there we have something more mature so 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 let's say 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.549
 football players are veterans therefore understandable 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.039
 what if the world team wants to beat 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.740
