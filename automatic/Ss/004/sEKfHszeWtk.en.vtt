kettle<00:00:07.859> daddy's<00:00:08.269> now<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.630> showed<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.290> touch

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
kettle daddy's now I showed you touch

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.490 
kettle daddy's now I showed you touch
the<00:00:10.620> thermostat<00:00:10.650> which<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> black<00:00:12.500> module

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
the thermostat which is a black module

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
the thermostat which is a black module
will<00:00:13.650> let<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.860> Sadia<00:00:14.370> lecture<00:00:15.059> module<00:00:15.269> eyes

connected<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.970> an<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> pilot<00:00:18.449> lamp<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.869> think

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
connected to an the pilot lamp I think

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.160 
connected to an the pilot lamp I think
the<00:00:19.439> pilot<00:00:19.590> left<00:00:19.920> me<00:00:20.220> be<00:00:20.699> bad<00:00:21.560> so<00:00:24.050> because<00:00:25.050> it

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the pilot left me be bad so because it

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.380 
the pilot left me be bad so because it
has<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> very<00:00:25.769> high<00:00:26.250> rather<00:00:26.670> higher<00:00:27.210> than

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
has a very high rather higher than

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
has a very high rather higher than
normal<00:00:27.539> resistance<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.500> when<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> tested<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
normal resistance and when I tested it I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970 
normal resistance and when I tested it I
saw<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:29.939> came<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:31.830> actually

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
saw it came on and then it's actually

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.420 
saw it came on and then it's actually
like<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.940> bloom<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> pirate<00:00:34.590> ramp<00:00:34.800> may<00:00:35.250> not

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
like it bloom so the pirate ramp may not

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.920 
like it bloom so the pirate ramp may not
be<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> circuit<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> might<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
be the circuit so you might not see this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
be the circuit so you might not see this
lighting<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:38.390> but<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.719> got<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> element<00:00:41.120> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
lighting up but I got the element the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.450 
lighting up but I got the element the
electricity<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.809> act<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.710> electricity

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
electricity to act the electricity

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.279 
electricity to act the electricity
actually<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.629> element<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.170> it's

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
actually get to the element so it's

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
actually get to the element so it's
hidden<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.280> show<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
hidden so I'm gonna show you that in a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.170 
hidden so I'm gonna show you that in a
moment

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
moment

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.389 
moment
so<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> actually<00:00:48.989> happened<00:00:49.590> there's<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
so what I actually happened there's a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.740 
so what I actually happened there's a
little<00:00:50.610> white<00:00:50.730> stuff<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> should<00:00:51.539> at<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
little white stuff that I should at the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.010 
little white stuff that I should at the
bimetallic<00:00:52.170> disc<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.370> blade<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.210> flexes<00:00:54.780> when

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
bimetallic disc a blade that flexes when

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.990 
bimetallic disc a blade that flexes when
water<00:00:55.620> reaches<00:00:55.980> boiling<00:00:56.160> temperature<00:00:56.760> which

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
water reaches boiling temperature which

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.910 
water reaches boiling temperature which
is<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> hundred<00:00:57.510> degrees<00:00:57.660> C<00:00:58.050> an<00:00:58.230> atmospheric

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
is a hundred degrees C an atmospheric

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.150 
is a hundred degrees C an atmospheric
pressure<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.370> sea<00:00:59.430> level<00:01:00.620> flexes<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
pressure at sea level flexes and that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
pressure at sea level flexes and that
pushes<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:02.910> stub<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.480> stop<00:01:04.080> do

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
pushes on that little stub that stop do

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
pushes on that little stub that stop do
looks<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.280> bit<00:01:05.489> wound<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.119> broken

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
looks a little bit wound or broken

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.070 
looks a little bit wound or broken
inside<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> disc<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.000> room<00:01:09.180> so

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
inside well it disc at is a very room so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
inside well it disc at is a very room so
it<00:01:10.290> wasn't<00:01:10.770> actually<00:01:10.920> long<00:01:11.549> enough<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it wasn't actually long enough for the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.090 
it wasn't actually long enough for the
blade<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:14.610> push<00:01:15.000> against<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.770> wasn't

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
blade to push against it so it wasn't

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.950 
blade to push against it so it wasn't
region<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:18.000> push<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> contacts

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
region to actually push the contacts

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.030 
region to actually push the contacts
open<00:01:19.619> apart<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:21.240> tomb<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.200> street

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
open apart that tomb and the street

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.440 
open apart that tomb and the street
little<00:01:23.220> tiny<00:01:23.369> roaches<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:23.909> got<00:01:24.060> between<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
little tiny roaches they got between the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.179 
little tiny roaches they got between the
contacts<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.140> were<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.439> causing<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
contacts so they were actually causing a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.030 
contacts so they were actually causing a
sort<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.970> being<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> sack<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> insulator<00:01:28.530> our

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
sort of it being a sack of insulator our

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.249 
sort of it being a sack of insulator our
resistance<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> electricity<00:01:30.630> wasn't

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
resistance so the electricity wasn't

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530 
resistance so the electricity wasn't
actually<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.799> into<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> element<00:01:32.939> no<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
actually get into the element no if you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.690 
actually get into the element no if you
could<00:01:33.689> remember<00:01:33.930> forward<00:01:34.439> element<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.189> quite

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
could remember forward element was quite

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.539 
could remember forward element was quite
corrode<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:36.990> looking<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.409> nasty<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.340> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
corrode it was looking very nasty so I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.719 
corrode it was looking very nasty so I
took<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.659> i<00:01:39.720> sat<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> although<00:01:40.490> try<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> get

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
took it out i sat it although try to get

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
took it out i sat it although try to get
it<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:41.909> shiny<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.299> possible<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> how

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it as shiny as possible and this is how

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.710 
it as shiny as possible and this is how
it<00:01:43.649> looks

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
it looks

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.870 
it looks
I'm<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> show<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:46.590> now

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
I'm going to show you that right now

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.630 
I'm going to show you that right now
okay<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> tried<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.170> best<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.430> it's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
okay so I tried to do my best on it it's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.560 
okay so I tried to do my best on it it's
not<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.850> hundred<00:01:51.030> percent<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:52.049> will<00:01:52.229> work

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
not a hundred percent but it will work

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.760 
not a hundred percent but it will work
much<00:01:54.570> better<00:01:54.630> than<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.200> before

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
much better than was before

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
pour some water in this now it may not

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.660 
pour some water in this now it may not
turn<00:02:00.899> off<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.320> itself<00:02:01.710> because<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.430> told

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
turn off for itself because I like told

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.200 
turn off for itself because I like told
you<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.149> white<00:02:03.299> stuff<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.630> assure<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
you that little white stuff I assure you

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.449 
you that little white stuff I assure you
it's<00:02:06.210> worn<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.780> broken<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:08.129> could<00:02:08.280> see

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it's worn it's broken and you could see

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.130 
it's worn it's broken and you could see
it's<00:02:08.580> wrong<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.450> lining<00:02:09.720> up<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.020> we

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
it's wrong so it's not lining up to we

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.750 
it's wrong so it's not lining up to we
should<00:02:10.349> push<00:02:10.500> against<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> contacts<00:02:11.340> wallet

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
should push against the contacts wallet

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.849 
should push against the contacts wallet
the<00:02:12.690> user

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:13.859 
the user

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.410 
the user
one<00:02:14.859> of<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.129> will<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.700> actually<00:02:15.969> do

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
one of this will have to actually do

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.929 
one of this will have to actually do
while<00:02:16.659> using<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:18.159> you'll<00:02:18.609> have<00:02:18.639> to

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
while using this is you'll have to

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:19.709 
while using this is you'll have to
monitor<00:02:19.420> it

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
monitor it

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.569 
monitor it
what<00:02:20.290> do<00:02:20.379> you<00:02:20.439> not<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.799> tip<00:02:21.129> before<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.459> actually

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
what do you not I tip before I actually

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.699 
what do you not I tip before I actually
give<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.209> back<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.569> person<00:02:22.780> I'm<00:02:23.469> just

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.989 
give it back to the person I'm just
doing<00:02:23.889> this<00:02:23.980> for<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.189> second<00:02:24.489> video<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.849> show

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:24.999 
doing this for a second video to show

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.309 
doing this for a second video to show
you<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.239> can<00:02:25.480> take<00:02:25.510> care<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.019> actually

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
you that I can take care to actually

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.970 
you that I can take care to actually
boil<00:02:27.060> but<00:02:28.060> whatever<00:02:28.480> what<00:02:29.079> I<00:02:29.109> think<00:02:29.590> I'll<00:02:29.739> do<00:02:29.920> I

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
boil but whatever what I think I'll do I

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.740 
boil but whatever what I think I'll do I
think<00:02:30.099> I'll<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.939> think<00:02:30.969> I<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.569> get<00:02:31.719> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
think I'll I think I can get a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.699 
think I'll I think I can get a
replacement<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.620> you'll<00:02:32.769> stop<00:02:34.409> that<00:02:35.409> I<00:02:35.439> can

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
replacement and you'll stop that I can

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.270 
replacement and you'll stop that I can
put<00:02:36.010> inside<00:02:36.219> to<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.239> place<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:38.129> little<00:02:39.129> white

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
put inside to a place that little white

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.759 
put inside to a place that little white
stuff<00:02:39.639> that<00:02:39.939> pushes<00:02:40.299> against<00:02:41.169> a<00:02:41.379> little<00:02:41.620> rod

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
stuff that pushes against a little rod

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.679 
stuff that pushes against a little rod
that<00:02:41.950> pushes<00:02:42.310> against<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.879> contacts<00:02:43.419> to<00:02:43.569> get

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
that pushes against the contacts to get

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.780 
that pushes against the contacts to get
moving<00:02:44.079> but<00:02:44.319> anyhow<00:02:47.159> let's<00:02:48.159> test<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.579> scale

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
moving but anyhow let's test the scale

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.750 
moving but anyhow let's test the scale
and<00:02:49.000> see<00:02:49.150> if<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.299> actually<00:02:49.329> waters<00:02:50.669> so<00:02:51.669> I'm

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
and see if it actually waters so I'm

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.550 
and see if it actually waters so I'm
going<00:02:51.909> to<00:02:51.939> pour<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> glass<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.599> water<00:02:52.780> inside

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.740 

okay<00:02:59.790> I'm<00:03:00.790> going<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.090> plug<00:03:01.299> it<00:03:01.419> into<00:03:01.599> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
okay I'm going to plug it into the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.039 
okay I'm going to plug it into the
electrical<00:03:02.230> source

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
electrical source

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:11.759 
electrical source
I'm<00:03:05.049> right<00:03:05.439> here<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.219> our<00:03:06.370> position<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:11.709> I

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
I'm right here it's in our position so I

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:21.089 
I'm right here it's in our position so I
plug<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.099> in<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:16.299> I'm<00:03:16.419> going<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:16.689> do<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:20.099> know

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
plug it in and I'm going to do this know

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.780 
plug it in and I'm going to do this know
if<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:21.790> look<00:03:21.970> very<00:03:22.000> closely<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:24.400> can<00:03:24.519> see<00:03:24.669> our

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
if you look very closely you can see our

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.039 
if you look very closely you can see our
light<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.239> yeah<00:03:26.790> yeah<00:03:27.819> Oh<00:03:27.970> pilot<00:03:28.419> lamb<00:03:28.750> is

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
light is on yeah yeah Oh pilot lamb is

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.960 
light is on yeah yeah Oh pilot lamb is
hard<00:03:29.290> it's<00:03:29.500> not<00:03:29.590> blown<00:03:30.009> so<00:03:30.639> I<00:03:30.699> was<00:03:30.790> mistaken

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
hard it's not blown so I was mistaken

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.569 
hard it's not blown so I was mistaken
and<00:03:31.479> if<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.620> look<00:03:32.799> very<00:03:32.829> carefully<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:35.459> mean<00:03:36.459> if

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
and if you look very carefully I mean if

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:43.960 
and if you look very carefully I mean if
you<00:03:36.639> could<00:03:36.790> hear<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.000> here<00:03:37.329> soon

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.120 

and<00:03:44.480> if<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.660> look<00:03:44.900> very<00:03:44.930> closely<00:03:45.380> you<00:03:45.890> can<00:03:45.980> see

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
and if you look very closely you can see

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.810 
and if you look very closely you can see
our<00:03:46.220> water<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.520> beginning<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.880> boil<00:03:48.760> so<00:03:49.760> you

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
our water is beginning to boil so you

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.520 
our water is beginning to boil so you
could<00:03:50.120> say<00:03:50.270> we<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.570> work<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:51.020> Kevlar<00:03:51.380> right

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
could say we have a work in Kevlar right

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.670 
could say we have a work in Kevlar right
here<00:03:51.770> the<00:03:52.580> only<00:03:52.790> thing<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.300> have<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.930> now<00:03:54.080> is

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
here the only thing I have to do now is

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.830 
here the only thing I have to do now is
to<00:03:54.890> replace<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.430> stub<00:03:55.850> which<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.540> think<00:03:56.750> I'll

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
to replace that stub which I think I'll

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.330 
to replace that stub which I think I'll
go<00:03:56.960> up<00:03:57.110> with<00:03:57.140> this<00:03:57.530> video<00:03:57.740> I<00:03:57.980> think<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.190> have

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
go up with this video I think I have

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.030 
go up with this video I think I have
something<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.850> actually<00:03:59.000> place<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.950> as<00:04:01.010> you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
something to actually place it so as you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.270 
something to actually place it so as you
can<00:04:01.190> see<00:04:01.750> our<00:04:02.750> kettle<00:04:05.200> it's<00:04:06.200> boiling<00:04:06.620> away<00:04:06.950> as

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
can see our kettle it's boiling away as

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.340 
can see our kettle it's boiling away as
you<00:04:07.700> can<00:04:07.880> see<00:04:08.140> so<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.200> can<00:04:09.350> call<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:09.710> a<00:04:09.770> fix

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
you can see so you can call this a fix

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.880 
you can see so you can call this a fix
so<00:04:13.360> you<00:04:14.360> actually<00:04:14.570> have<00:04:14.960> to<00:04:15.110> manually<00:04:15.470> as<00:04:15.800> I

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
so you actually have to manually as I

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.330 
so you actually have to manually as I
just<00:04:16.400> turn<00:04:16.580> it<00:04:16.670> off<00:04:16.760> manually<00:04:17.500> on<00:04:18.500> light<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.549> on

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
just turn it off manually on light is on

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.930 
just turn it off manually on light is on
manually<00:04:22.340> turn<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.670> off<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.990> control<00:04:24.380> it<00:04:24.670> so<00:04:25.670> I

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
manually turn it off to control it so I

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.520 
manually turn it off to control it so I
think<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.540> can<00:04:31.060> unplug<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.450> think<00:04:33.230> I<00:04:33.320> can

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
think I can unplug it I think I can

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.450 
think I can unplug it I think I can
actually<00:04:34.100> replace<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.700> stop<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.300> get<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:35.930> to

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
actually replace a stop and get this to

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.990 
actually replace a stop and get this to
do<00:04:37.460> what<00:04:37.640> it's<00:04:37.940> made<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.450> do<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.260> is<00:04:40.000> boil

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
do what it's made to do and that is boil

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.760 
do what it's made to do and that is boil
the<00:04:41.180> water<00:04:41.360> when<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.140> gets<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:42.440> boiling

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
the water when it gets the boiling

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.980 
the water when it gets the boiling
temperature<00:04:42.920> and<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.340> begins<00:04:43.640> to<00:04:43.880> boil<00:04:44.090> 100

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
temperature and it begins to boil 100

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.560 
temperature and it begins to boil 100
degrees<00:04:45.260> C<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:46.190> bimetallic<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:47.000> will<00:04:47.270> flex

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
degrees C the bimetallic this will flex

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.260 
degrees C the bimetallic this will flex
push<00:04:48.320> against<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.860> rod<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.370> tiny<00:04:49.910> little<00:04:50.060> rod

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
push against the rod a tiny little rod

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.840 
push against the rod a tiny little rod
that<00:04:50.450> I<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:50.900> will<00:04:51.590> be<00:04:51.740> replacing<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.460> think<00:04:52.790> you

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
that I I will be replacing I think you

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.540 
that I I will be replacing I think you
can<00:04:53.000> do<00:04:53.090> it<00:04:53.440> pushing<00:04:54.440> into<00:04:54.650> contacts<00:04:55.040> open<00:04:55.280> the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
can do it pushing into contacts open the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.610 
can do it pushing into contacts open the
circuit<00:04:55.910> BAM<00:04:56.630> shutting<00:04:57.350> it<00:04:57.440> off

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
circuit BAM shutting it off

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.220 
circuit BAM shutting it off
automatically<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.360> think<00:04:59.600> I'm<00:04:59.750> gonna<00:04:59.960> I

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230
