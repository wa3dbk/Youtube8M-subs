she would tell me is the truth and i
have<00:05:35.770> found<00:05:36.010> everything<00:05:36.790> that<00:05:37.120> she<00:05:37.300> has

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
have found everything that she has

always told me to be absolutely the
truth<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.910> probably<00:05:41.070> her<00:05:42.070> statements<00:05:42.640> seem

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
truth and probably her statements seem

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.540 
truth and probably her statements seem
very<00:05:43.060> simple<00:05:43.480> but<00:05:43.660> she<00:05:43.870> goes<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.890> extra<00:05:45.010> mile

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
very simple but she goes the extra mile
