00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.580
 hello tankers with you night 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.099
 sniper and i'm glad to introduce you to pilot 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.660
 the release of the transfer view of the noob in this 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.060
 transfer I will talk about the pros and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.369
 cons of a tank tactics 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.420
 combat and what modules to choose 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.570
 for a comfortable game 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.570
 Well, let's not pull the cat for the messengers drove 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.399
 pilot release we talk about 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.059
 premiums trying to level seven in su 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.239
 122 44 cars at their level as 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.160
 German Fri-25 is quite interesting and with 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.019
 the conviction that premium tanks are weaker 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.909
 its pumped counterparts can 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.800
 argue and make sure of it 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.800
 let's look at its characteristics 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.300
 armor for the seventh level is very suitable 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.510
 but the boom has 90 millimeters of armor under 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.860
 60 degree angle as well 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.510
 120-millimeter guns which mask 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.170
 most cases absorb shells 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.410
 adversary 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.910
 bead the same shrinkage 75 millimeters and at 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.380
 direct hit can be damaged 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.940
 ammunition aft 45 millimeters of armor 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.070
 such armor can easily attack 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.200
 opponents of the sixth and seventh level and 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.450
 if you try to put a diamond tank 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.570
 then the steel wall medal you assure 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.400
 battles with tanks 8 and 9 level things are 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.500
 not so rosy beat and at these levels 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.510
 enough to sew drying in all projections 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.640
 but sometimes I still meet Sasha 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.880
 bounce and no penetration but is this 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.880
 rare 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.000
 on soo 122 44 installed a typical 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.609
 soviet 122mm log 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.039
 d25 with an average alpha of 390 units 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.679
 breaking in the head 175 millimeters and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.439
 by the caliper 217 then for the seventh level 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.130
 quite normal reloading guns with 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.110
 martial brotherhood 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 and the rammer will make less than 7 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.979
 seconds it follows just wildest 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.000
 dpm which is 2900 25 units 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.129
 down here like all Soviet 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.610
 guns of this caliber are quite long and 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.680
 takes almost three seconds the corners of pickup 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.780
 there is but a small horizontal 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.500
 planes of 8 degrees in one and another 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.390
 the side 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.640
 the declination angle here is only 4 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.310
 degrees it means that you are not a lion 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.650
 play and seemingly quite a gun 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.310
 not bad for yourself but as they say in the family 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.650
 not without a freak 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.420
 so in our case the role of a freak is here 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.980
 plays a scatter which is zero 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.349
 point forty one hundredths per 100 meters 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.480
 if with the breaking of the boss and information 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.230
 you can come to terms with the scatter 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.230
 from will be extremely problematic 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.770
 if we talk about speed characteristics 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.170
 then everything is in order engine power 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.660
 500 horsepower to accelerate our pt to 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.130
 47 kilometers per hour which allows you to 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.500
 the first minutes of the battle take advantageous 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.360
 position can also be distinguished excellent 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.060
 running speed indicator 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.620
 42 degrees per second allowing 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.970
 fight enemy light tanks 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.970
 visiting us in the rear 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.860
 personal preferred not to get involved in 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.840
 close combat 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.880
 make a safety margin like a game style 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.650
 bit risky and so melee 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.870
 we have to be very careful with 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.110
 the other side it gives them three funky 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.860
 and 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.860
 action fights 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.750
 since the tactic at the given signed 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.880
 implies active action in 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.950
 melee first disguise 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.930
 no longer the first perk of all members 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.060
 crew besides the commander is worth exploring 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.340
 repair commander sixth sense 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.709
 after skills and skill is chosen in 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.590
 depending on the preferences of the player personally 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.060
 I usually have 1 in this order 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.600
 the commander's first perk is the sixth 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.410
 feeling 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.030
 my hot gunner and charging repair 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.670
 second perk commander repair at 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.400
 gunner masking at mechvod smooth 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.680
 contact loader stroke 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.970
 third perk for all members later I 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.360
 would choose your brother 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.610
 no more useful for sou 122 44 but 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.800
 rammer reinforced aiming drives and 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.810
 stereo tube though equipment selection 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.959
 comes from personal preference and style 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.959
 games 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.780
 from to 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.389
 but 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.120
 So the advantage of this ptshke can be attributed 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.620
 high mobility and large one-time 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.720
 damage 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.880
 rational armor angle high 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.919
 damage per minute thick mask guns 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.810
 which eats almost all shells 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.200
 classmates and a low silhouette 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.110
 Well, the cons of long low information 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.910
 accuracy bad review full balanced 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.800
 weight of the consequence of frequent hits by 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:53.740
 tanks 8 and 9 level well, and summing up 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.720
 wants to say that su 122 44 deserves 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.760
 your attention is one of those rare 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.800
 tanks on which you get a lot of fun 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.870
 and positive from the game, I categorically 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.890
 I recommend to purchase this unit of them 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.450
 yourself in the hangar subscribe to the channel 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.800
 if you like this video put 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.690
 like write comments 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.690
 well see you next video bye 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.590
 but
