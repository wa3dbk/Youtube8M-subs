00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 windows 8 allows us to anchor the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.560
 desktop programs that we use in the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.120
 start menu screen however the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.190
 most of the shortcuts of these 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.320
 applications do not have icons for the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.490
 new windows 8 interface the way 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.590
 get these icons 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
 custom for programs or folders 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 web pages can be customized and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.220
 change is through an application 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 that in addition to that allows us 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.150
 customize the color and some 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.859
 functions that I will describe to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.920
 below and that I'm going to teach you 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.739
 handle the program additionally let's 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.989
 to find I'm going to leave you a pack 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.180
 of icons in different categories that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 You can use them for different 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 applications that you use are going to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.170
 find here of different adobe 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.719
 types of programs as well as for 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.030
 drivers for folders and systems 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.879
 operational shortcuts to the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 different websites that you more 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.050
 visit 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.750

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.130
 that you will find here 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.140
 they are 256 in size with 256 pixels 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.750
 so they will not have problems with the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.289
 resolution let's see then the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.939
 procedure in the description of 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.530
 video I could leave the link so that 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.860
 can download the program is 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.689
 completely portable simply 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.259
 when they finish downloading it 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.259
 run 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.000
 and let's basically see what it is that 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.590
 First, let's give the name to 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.830
 program or direct access that 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.160
 we want to create or change in this example 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 I will place to sing next 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.270
 we select 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.490
 the link 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.109
 the path where the file is located 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.140
 executable program can be 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.740
 also a folder or a link of a 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.670
 web site 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.430
 then I will select for um 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.619
 for a program we go to archives of 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.619
 program and we seek to execute it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.069
 The next step is to select the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:15.120
 icon that we are going to use the image 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.750
 as such it supports png jpg and others 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.370
 formats then they will use those that 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.580
 I'll leave you in the description of 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.900
 video 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.030
 I'm going to use this 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.970
 here you can optionally select a 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.129
 small image this is for the color of 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.989
 background and text color when already 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.260
 we have everything ready we press in this 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.260
 button 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.030
 to give us a preview of how 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.220
 is staying here by pressing the these 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.709
 colors are changing and here we can 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.520
 find much more colors finally 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.020
 when we have our icon ready 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:59.370
 click on create 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.210
 and ready then let's go to the start menu 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.540
 to the screen sorry 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.580
 here we have the icon we can move it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.920
 or change where we want 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.200
 now how do we change these 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.140
 icons that we already have within the 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.480
 start screen for this let's go 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.480
 to the same program to that section 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.080
 and here we will find all the list 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.330
 of programs that we have anchored in the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.610
 Home screen come by category 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.520
 those who normally use 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.890
 windows functions the programs 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.590
 pre-installed for example if one of the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.180
 Customized functions we want 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.340
 customize is the shutdown of 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.770
 computer we can solve this 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.370
 Here we can change the name 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.470
 the route and this argument we leave it such 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.660
 as it is we can change the icon if 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.770
 we want and if not we simply press 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.770
 in creating 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.980
 and ready we go again 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.200
 and as you can see we have access 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.569
 direct to withstand the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.340
 computer is much easier 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.549
 like this you can customize and 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.410
 create your own icons up here this 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.209
 video and do not forget to subscribe to the channel
