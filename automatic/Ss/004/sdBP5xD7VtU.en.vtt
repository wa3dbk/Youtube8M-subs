00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.460 
humor
I<00:03:14.440> think<00:03:15.040> for<00:03:15.250> us<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.550> key<00:03:15.700> piece<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.260> it's<00:03:17.260> got

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
I think for us the key piece is it's got

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.780 
I think for us the key piece is it's got
to<00:03:17.500> be<00:03:17.680> about<00:03:17.860> student<00:03:18.310> learning<00:03:18.430> in<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
to be about student learning in the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.790 
to be about student learning in the
classroom<00:03:19.770> it's<00:03:21.930> about<00:03:22.930> how<00:03:23.620> they<00:03:23.770> interact

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
classroom it's about how they interact

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.530 
classroom it's about how they interact
with<00:03:24.280> students<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:24.910> on<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.150> day<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.390> day

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
with students on it on a day to day

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.110 
with students on it on a day to day
basis<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:26.830> not<00:03:27.010> about<00:03:27.400> standing<00:03:27.760> at<00:03:28.060> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
basis it's not about standing at the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.150 
basis it's not about standing at the
front<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:28.510> performing<00:03:29.050> we<00:03:29.470> don't<00:03:29.710> look<00:03:29.980> at

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
front and performing we don't look at

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.430 
front and performing we don't look at
teaching<00:03:30.370> we<00:03:30.730> look<00:03:30.940> at<00:03:31.060> learning<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:32.260> our

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
teaching we look at learning so our

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.470 
teaching we look at learning so our
focus<00:03:32.890> as<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.070> school<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.580> about<00:03:33.700> students

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
focus as a school is about students

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.320 
focus as a school is about students
learning<00:03:34.720> not<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:36.100> think<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.790> most<00:03:36.940> important

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
learning not I think the most important

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.120 
learning not I think the most important
thing<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.630> they<00:03:37.840> can<00:03:37.960> consider<00:03:38.320> why<00:03:39.070> do

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
thing is that they can consider why do

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.670 
thing is that they can consider why do
you<00:03:39.370> want<00:03:39.610> to<00:03:39.730> work<00:03:39.850> abroad<00:03:40.170> why<00:03:41.170> what

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
you want to work abroad why what

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.040 
you want to work abroad why what
motivates<00:03:42.160> you<00:03:42.340> was<00:03:42.520> taken<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:42.940> overseas<00:03:43.360> and

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
motivates you was taken to overseas and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.830 
motivates you was taken to overseas and
I<00:03:44.140> think<00:03:44.320> it<00:03:44.410> could<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.620> several<00:03:44.920> things<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:46.300> a

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
I think it could be several things in a

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.140 
I think it could be several things in a
spectrum<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:47.560> things<00:03:47.800> I'm<00:03:48.790> looking<00:03:48.970> for

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
spectrum of things I'm looking for

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.600 
spectrum of things I'm looking for
careers<00:03:49.990> I'm<00:03:50.710> looking<00:03:51.160> for<00:03:51.280> someone<00:03:51.490> whose

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
careers I'm looking for someone whose

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.160 
careers I'm looking for someone whose
career<00:03:51.790> mine<00:03:52.150> didn't<00:03:52.480> not<00:03:52.630> just<00:03:52.840> wanted<00:03:53.110> to

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
career mine didn't not just wanted to

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.630 
career mine didn't not just wanted to
travel<00:03:53.410> but<00:03:53.680> I'm<00:03:53.800> also<00:03:53.950> looking<00:03:54.220> for<00:03:54.460> someone

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640

and wants to experience different
cultures<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:56.200> think<00:03:56.920> about<00:03:57.190> why<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:58.030> want<00:03:58.300> to
