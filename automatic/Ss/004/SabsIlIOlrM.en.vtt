00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.230
 first knit no is not true 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.849
 Last year ever an ice they 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 link there was also very delicious that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.789
 problem is but if so drive 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.699
 I always had the feeling I have to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.560
 to drink something fizzy 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 so have delicious recipes inside 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.400
 searched and found and indeed a limo 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 and my god i have never had one 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.460
 limo made myself so I'm real 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.380
 curious or tastes I still have it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.480
 do not try times I look and do 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.820
 again at the end of videos that is to say 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.210
 we just start off with it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.950
 you need 300 milliliter great foot from 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.039
 that's about three to four degrees 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.660
 plus 75 milliliters of lemon juice and so on 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.199
 two lemons 35 grams of sugar 370 liters 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.969
 mineral water and limes in the first 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.910
 of course he does it the device 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.210
 Wash well and put the lemons on whole 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.760
 clearly for the grapefruit halved and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.689
 squeezed or leaking after which like 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.689
 you see 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.190
 then you have 300 milliliter netbackup 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.190
 and the same with the throne 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.320
 Add sugar and stir 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.850
 you can also have two to sugar instead of two 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.030
 three tablespoons sugar jÃ¼rgen schmidt 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.920
 I think a little better though 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.790
 more intense and now the brands 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.790
 cut and add 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.270
 cold mineral water and ready 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.270
 already our lemonade 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.190
 so and I will now 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:12.840
 try and I hope it tastes good 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:15.150
 So that has the expected tastes 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 very fruity but not at all sour or 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.570
 so I think in any case mega 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.370
 delicious and I will definitely 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.990
 Do it often in the summer and I recommend 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.430
 you guys really face you 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.710
 fridge is still ready 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750
 and you have the perfect summer drink 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.340
 I hope the recipe again 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.980
 If yes, there is definitely 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.540
 a thumb up and subscribed 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.150

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.820
 what the stuff keeps what you recipes 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.080
 Definitely wanted to see low carb 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.910
 But I always think with that 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.620
 warm temperatures I tend to ice 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.420
 and drinks and do something 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.400
 otherwise I would say otherwise see 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.290

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.840
