00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
have two Priuses the neat thing about

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.980 
have two Priuses the neat thing about
the<00:00:04.440> Prius<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:04.980> that<00:00:05.220> it's<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.640> hybrid<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:06.359> when

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.110 
you're in the idle position or going
slow<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.260> engine<00:00:10.679> itself<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.700> internal

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
slow the engine itself the internal

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.360 
slow the engine itself the internal
combustion<00:00:12.570> engine<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.290> running<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:14.190> can

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
combustion engine is not running you can

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.490 
combustion engine is not running you can
run<00:00:14.610> off<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> big<00:00:15.240> battery<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> back<00:00:16.139> here

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
run off a big battery in the back here

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.670 
run off a big battery in the back here

axe it's a great emergency backup
generator<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.460> very<00:00:56.850> quiet<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.960> because

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
generator it's very quiet and because

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080 
generator it's very quiet and because
you've<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> muffler<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.670> doesn't<00:00:59.969> use

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you've got a muffler and it doesn't use

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.389 
you've got a muffler and it doesn't use
much<00:01:00.359> fuel<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> 30<00:01:01.530> hours<00:01:01.980> we

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
much fuel I think for the 30 hours we

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
much fuel I think for the 30 hours we
used<00:01:02.579> about<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.879> gallon<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.449> gas<00:01:03.949> when<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
used about a gallon of gas when the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.770 
used about a gallon of gas when the
engine<00:01:05.339> would<00:01:05.519> turn<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.150> recharge<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
engine would turn on to recharge the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.210 
engine would turn on to recharge the
battery<00:01:07.110> at<00:01:07.290> certain<00:01:07.590> points<00:01:07.950> during<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
battery at certain points during the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.690 
battery at certain points during the
night

electricity purposes what you're
basically<00:01:53.579> doing<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.149> running<00:01:54.509> off<00:01:54.689> that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
basically doing is running off that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.230 
basically doing is running off that
large<00:01:55.229> battery<00:01:55.680> yeah<00:01:56.250> until<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.790> runs<00:01:56.969> down<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
large battery yeah until it runs down to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090 
large battery yeah until it runs down to
a<00:01:57.390> certain<00:01:57.719> point<00:01:57.960> right<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.860> it

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
a certain point right so it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.550 
a certain point right so it
automatically<00:01:59.700> kicks<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.329> yeah<00:02:00.990> baby<00:02:01.259> gas

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
automatically kicks on yeah baby gas

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.620 
automatically kicks on yeah baby gas
engine<00:02:01.950> automatic<00:02:02.430> kicks<00:02:02.790> excess<00:02:03.180> charges

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
engine automatic kicks excess charges

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.319 
engine automatic kicks excess charges
and<00:02:04.290> gives<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.640> gives<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.700> power<00:02:05.969> right

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
and gives you gives you power right

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.249 
and gives you gives you power right

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.250 
yep excellent now how did you come up
with<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.020> people<00:02:13.020> with

with this you know it's people with

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
with this you know it's people with
Prius

Prius
I<00:02:13.890> mean<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.370> something<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.210> know

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
places actually a friend of mine Dave

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580 
places actually a friend of mine Dave
Roscoe<00:02:20.700> who<00:02:21.030> was<00:02:21.150> an<00:02:21.270> engineer<00:02:21.450> had<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.500> know

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
Roscoe who was an engineer had you know

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.380 
Roscoe who was an engineer had you know
talked<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.040> me<00:02:23.160> about<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.430> when<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> gotten<00:02:24.120> when

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
talked to me about it when I gotten when

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.850 
talked to me about it when I gotten when
we<00:02:24.510> got<00:02:24.690> our<00:02:24.810> first<00:02:24.990> piece<00:02:25.260> back<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.740> 2005<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
we got our first piece back in 2005 and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.250 
we got our first piece back in 2005 and
you<00:02:28.860> know<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.070> can<00:02:29.690> take<00:02:30.690> these<00:02:30.840> converters

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
you know you can take these converters

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.870 
you know you can take these converters
and<00:02:31.500> plug<00:02:31.680> them<00:02:31.800> into<00:02:31.950> every<00:02:32.250> battery<00:02:32.670> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
and plug them into every battery and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.340 
and plug them into every battery and
stuff<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.330> with<00:02:33.480> most<00:02:33.690> cars<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.110> would<00:02:34.230> have

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
stuff but with most cars you would have

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.720 
stuff but with most cars you would have
to<00:02:34.470> keep<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.770> engine<00:02:35.040> running<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.460> night

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
to keep the engine running all night

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.130 
to keep the engine running all night
which<00:02:35.970> would<00:02:36.120> not<00:02:36.300> be<00:02:36.450> efficient<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:37.020> all

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
which would not be efficient at all

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.840 
which would not be efficient at all
which<00:02:37.410> would<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.740> hard<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.190> engine<00:02:38.550> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
which would be hard on the engine the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.370 
which would be hard on the engine the
neat<00:02:39.030> thing<00:02:39.210> about<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.540> Prius<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.230> it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
neat thing about the Prius is that it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.520 
neat thing about the Prius is that it
stays<00:02:40.590> off<00:02:40.830> most<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> time<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:43.410> know

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
stays off most of the time and you know

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.160 
stays off most of the time and you know
you<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.709> take<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.400> DC<00:02:44.610> current

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
you just take in the DC current

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
you just take in the DC current
converting<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.320> AC<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:49.709> know<00:02:49.830> works

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
converting it to AC and you know works

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.820 
converting it to AC and you know works
great<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.790> very<00:02:51.270> efficient<00:02:51.780> very<00:02:51.930> cheap<00:02:52.230> you

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
great and very efficient very cheap you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.470 
great and very efficient very cheap you
know<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.070> any<00:02:53.190> other<00:02:53.370> vehicles<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.239> you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
know of any other vehicles that you

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.120 
know of any other vehicles that you
could<00:02:54.630> actually<00:02:54.780> do<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.080> well<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.830> think<00:02:55.950> you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
could actually do that well I think you

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.820 
could actually do that well I think you
could<00:02:56.250> do<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.459> with<00:02:56.550> any<00:02:56.670> hybrid<00:02:57.239> okay<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.200> if

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
could do it with any hybrid okay so if

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.690 
could do it with any hybrid okay so if
you<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> Honda<00:02:59.790> Hybrid<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:02.100> Ford

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
you have the Honda Hybrid and the Ford

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.140 
you have the Honda Hybrid and the Ford
Focus<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.239> stuff<00:03:04.280> yeah<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.030> know

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
Focus and stuff yeah I think you know

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.540 
Focus and stuff yeah I think you know
most<00:03:06.300> any<00:03:06.540> hybrid<00:03:07.020> works<00:03:07.320> basically<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.400> same

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
most any hybrid works basically the same

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.910 
most any hybrid works basically the same
way
