00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
thought that it was actually it was also

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.179 
thought that it was actually it was also
a<00:01:22.530> good<00:01:22.890> dupe<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.549> Mac<00:01:24.030> lovelorn<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.189> I'm

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
a good dupe for Mac lovelorn and I'm

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.890 
a good dupe for Mac lovelorn and I'm
putting<00:01:26.460> level<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.150> right<00:01:27.330> next<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
putting level or and right next to it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.719 
putting level or and right next to it
there<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.220> see<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.549> pretty

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
there and as you can see it's pretty

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.910 
there and as you can see it's pretty
similar<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> thought<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.540> was

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
similar so I thought that was

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.539 
similar so I thought that was
interesting<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.909> close<00:01:36.119> actually

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
interesting it's really close actually

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
interesting it's really close actually
anyway<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> brought<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.079> my

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
anyway and then I brought out all my

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.899 
anyway and then I brought out all my
other<00:01:40.320> Pink's<00:01:40.770> because<00:01:40.950> i<00:01:41.040> thought<00:01:41.250> i'd<00:01:41.640> show

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
other Pink's because i thought i'd show

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.429 
other Pink's because i thought i'd show
you<00:01:41.939> some<00:01:42.240> swatches<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.720> case<00:01:42.960> there's<00:01:43.200> some

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
you some swatches in case there's some

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.109

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
that and that is per vet and I really

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.539 
that and that is per vet and I really
like<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:54.770> I<00:01:55.770> don't<00:01:56.130> want<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.340> whole

not have to mess with liner and then

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.509 
not have to mess with liner and then
probably<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.140> craziest<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.890> all<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.340> won't

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220
