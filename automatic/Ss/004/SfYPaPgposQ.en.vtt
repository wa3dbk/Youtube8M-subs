00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello I am your shadow amen and today I am going to 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.369
 show how to cut a handle when 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.949
 you go to the store check the color but 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.960
 he does not trust that completely because 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.359
 Sometimes the reds are not very mature and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.789
 the greens yes so what really 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.970
 wants to do is press with the thumb 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.499
 and you should know a little bit because you know 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.689
 that these are the fruits that most 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:33.600
 consume in the world and that's why you should 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.060
 know how to choose them look at the handle 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 it's a bit flat and on the side there's a 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.440
 seed that extends through the center 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.750
 of mango in this way and the seed is 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.270
 quite big and flat and tends to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.580
 stick to the fruit so what is going to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.010
 to do is to turn your handle on its side 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.160
 since he's going to try to cut around 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.170
 from her so what I'm going to do is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.300
 I'm going to stop it and I'm going to assume that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.540
 Seed occupies about an inch or 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.210
 less in the middle here and I'm going to cut to 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.030
 both sides of the seed of the turn and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.450
 cut right here on the other side 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.250
 and I have two very good records here and what 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 What can I do with a knife? 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.509
 small is to cut around the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.750
 seed and put the extra pieces 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.250
 on the one hand when you already have what 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.369
 you're going to do is take a small knife 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.350
 and you're going to grate what I'm going to do 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.259
 cubes and I'm going to put these cubes in my 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.049
 herbalife f1 shake are also 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.090
 good of salads and rice but not 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.600
 I'm going to cut everything completely to the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.420
 shell I'm going to grate it like that because here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.520
 is where the magic happens if you do it in 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.039
 front of a 4 year old child will think 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.009
 that you are a magician you are going to take this mango 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.619
 and very gently flip it upside down and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.899
 there are instant mango cubes now 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.380
 are ready and you can cut in the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.360
 shell and add them to your herbalife f1 what 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.429
 good of the mangoes is that they are full 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.860
 of nutrition so if you have a 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.869
 Mango cup are only around 100 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.300
 calories that gives you all your vitamin c 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.000
 by day and about a third of the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.370
 vitamin a for the day so enjoy 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.870
 of them turns them into hedgehogs and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.700
 Put them in your smoothies 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.700
 and their salads there is
