King<00:00:00.630> kinetics<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.469> basically<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.879> just<00:00:03.540> named

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
King kinetics is basically I just named

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.010 
King kinetics is basically I just named
my<00:00:03.990> company<00:00:04.460> that<00:00:05.460> because<00:00:05.910> kinetics<00:00:06.870> is

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
my company that because kinetics is

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.589 
my company that because kinetics is
range<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.410> motion<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.910> King<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.030> my<00:00:09.150> last<00:00:09.389> name

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
range of motion and King is my last name

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.900 
range of motion and King is my last name
so<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.870> call<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.290> king<00:00:10.469> kinetics<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.099> basically

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
so I call it king kinetics I basically

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.690 
so I call it king kinetics I basically
work<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.110> horses<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.769> I'm<00:00:14.250> trying<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.549> get

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
work on the horses and I'm trying to get

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.160 
work on the horses and I'm trying to get
full<00:00:14.910> range<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.210> motion<00:00:15.360> out<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.809> them<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.139> I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
full range of motion out of them so I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.380 
full range of motion out of them so I
might<00:00:16.470> massage<00:00:17.070> them<00:00:17.400> might<00:00:17.699> stretch<00:00:18.060> them

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
might massage them might stretch them

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.609 
might massage them might stretch them
might<00:00:18.630> even<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:19.140> know<00:00:19.230> put<00:00:19.410> them<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
might even you know put them in a

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.050 
might even you know put them in a
position<00:00:19.740> where<00:00:20.100> they<00:00:20.220> adjust<00:00:20.520> themselves

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
position where they adjust themselves

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.240 
position where they adjust themselves
I'm<00:00:21.240> not<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.529> quote-unquote<00:00:22.529> chiropractor

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
more of a positional list I set the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.070 
more of a positional list I set the
horse<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> spot<00:00:26.970> where<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.750> move

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
horse up in a spot where they can move

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.470 
horse up in a spot where they can move
and<00:00:28.320> they<00:00:28.439> actually<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.340> their<00:00:29.609> own<00:00:29.760> sort

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and they actually they do their own sort

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.600 
and they actually they do their own sort
of<00:00:30.570> adjustments<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:31.500> horses<00:00:31.920> get<00:00:32.099> sore<00:00:32.399> they

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
of adjustments but horses get sore they

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450 
of adjustments but horses get sore they
start<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> cheat<00:00:33.320> they<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.649> things<00:00:34.920> they<00:00:35.100> don't

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
start to cheat they do things they don't

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220 
start to cheat they do things they don't
normally<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.210> wouldn't<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.989> when<00:00:37.140> they

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
normally they wouldn't do so when they

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.049 
normally they wouldn't do so when they
start<00:00:37.469> doing<00:00:37.710> things<00:00:37.829> they<00:00:38.010> don't<00:00:38.129> normally

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
start doing things they don't normally

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.229 
start doing things they don't normally
do<00:00:39.989> onion<00:00:40.500> they're<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.430> enjoying<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> well

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
do onion they're not enjoying it well

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
do onion they're not enjoying it well
then<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.780> better<00:00:43.020> find<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.469> what's<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.890> on

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
then you better find out what's going on

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.549 
then you better find out what's going on
you<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.629> help<00:00:45.809> them<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.289> try<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you know so you can help them we try to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.139 
you know so you can help them we try to
get<00:00:46.710> down<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> base<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> problem<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
get down on the base of the problem and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
get down on the base of the problem and
get<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> horse<00:00:48.899> moving<00:00:49.320> freely<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.920> way

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
get the horse moving freely that way

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
get the horse moving freely that way
usually<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.940> takes<00:00:51.270> about<00:00:51.660> 15<00:00:52.050> minutes<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
usually it takes about 15 minutes to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.000 
usually it takes about 15 minutes to
really<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.340> through<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.770> setting<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.860> up

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
really go through the setting them up

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
really go through the setting them up
and<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:56.520> opening<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.329> work<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.660> all

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and really opening them up I work on all

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.260 
and really opening them up I work on all
kinds<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.230> horses<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> highest<00:00:59.039> levels<00:00:59.550> as

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
kinds of horses at the highest levels as

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.959 
kinds of horses at the highest levels as
possible<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.949> me<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.489> enjoyed<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
possible but for me I really enjoyed the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.149 
possible but for me I really enjoyed the
thoroughbreds<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.769> got<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.040> much

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
thoroughbreds they just got so much

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.469 
thoroughbreds they just got so much
spirit<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.670> there's<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.880> much<00:01:06.000> fun<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> be
