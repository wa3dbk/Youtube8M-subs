00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:08.220
 well this video will be the video of batman 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.220
 arkham city lowdown 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:26.439
 [Music] 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.539
 batman arkham city lock down is a 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.849
 prequel to the popular console game 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.070
 batman arkham city ​​' although in reality 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.620
 the story of this game for it is 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.440
 is nothing transcendent for the saga of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.629
 batman video games as I mentioned 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.089
 before this game is technically a 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.220
 prequel but in reality this does not add 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.440
 nothing to the story of the game since the 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.600
 relationship of stories between this title 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.340
 and the console version is practically 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.230
 null 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.570
 the graphics of the game are 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.390
 impressive probably from the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.760
 best I've seen on the iphone 4s and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.710
 the controls are extremely simple and 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.050
 very similar to those of infinity blade 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.660
 to hit, we slide our finger 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.660
 to the left or right up 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.940
 and to dodge attacks we can slide 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.370
 our finger down or just 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.590
 touch the screen 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.110
 the theme of the game in general 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.090
 try to fight from villain in villain what 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.580
 which can be a bit repetitive 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.860
 the only parts in which the game 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.960
 change the basic theme is when 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.940
 we face characters like two faces 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.550
 or the joker 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.500
 the game is divided into missions and each 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.360
 once we finish one of them if we 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.130
 grant points with which we can 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.970
 buy gadgets or improve 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 batman combat skills 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.980
 the game also has a good 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.050
 amount of extra material starting with 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.780
 be able to select between different types 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.460
 of suits for batman the only bad thing is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.220
 that some of them have to be 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.780
 purchased separately and the cost is 99 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.760
 cents for each dollar 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.770
 inside the extra material also 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.330
 we found biographies of the characters 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.220
 of the game 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.470
 some wallpapers and what else I 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.170
 pleased is that we can observe some 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.700
 of the original Batman comics something 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.310
 that the fans of this superhero 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.130
 will appreciate quite 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.319
 batman arkham gave the down is a game 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.790
 that has some graphics 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.500
 impressive that manage to get us into the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.140
 atmosphere of a batman game of 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.390
 excellent way unfortunately the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.849
 story of the game is very short and little 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.430
 transcendent and added to this the game 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.920
 it may be repetitive 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.290
 for a price of $ 5 with 99 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.150
 cents it seems to me that the best option 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.760
 will be that they acquire this game when 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.829
 is on sale or if they really are 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.170
 crazed batman fans can 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.090
 acquire it at a normal price although 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.980
 I consider it a bit excessive, so the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.440
 game is really 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.209
 do not forget to leave me your opinions and doubts 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.209
