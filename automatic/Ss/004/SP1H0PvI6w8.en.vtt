00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
vehicle Rex you can see how deep this

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.950 
vehicle Rex you can see how deep this
case<00:05:05.770> is<00:05:07.199> let<00:05:08.199> me<00:05:08.289> grab<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.770> tape<00:05:09.190> measure<00:05:09.960> real

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
quick and you can see here that you have

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.070 
quick and you can see here that you have
12<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.550> half<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:24.970> top<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.240> that<00:05:25.479> and<00:05:25.930> a

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
12 and a half to the top of that and a

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.379 
12 and a half to the top of that and a
little<00:05:26.229> bit<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.470> space<00:05:26.800> up<00:05:27.099> here<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.639> think<00:05:28.300> they

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
little bit of space up here I think they

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.879 
little bit of space up here I think they
tell<00:05:28.599> you<00:05:28.690> that<00:05:28.720> you<00:05:28.840> get<00:05:29.020> like<00:05:29.139> 13<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:29.860> half

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
tell you that you get like 13 and a half

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.140 
tell you that you get like 13 and a half
inches<00:05:30.460> or<00:05:30.699> or<00:05:31.539> something<00:05:32.110> to<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:32.229> effect

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
inches or or something to that effect

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.420 
inches or or something to that effect
definitely<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.180> deep<00:05:34.479> case<00:05:37.800> but<00:05:38.800> anyhow<00:05:39.130> that's

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
definitely a deep case but anyhow that's

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.920 
definitely a deep case but anyhow that's
pretty<00:05:39.849> much<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.060> I<00:05:41.520> like<00:05:42.520> it<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:42.909> as<00:05:43.120> i<00:05:43.300> use<00:05:43.720> it

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
pretty much it I like it and as i use it

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.140 
pretty much it I like it and as i use it
i<00:05:44.110> will<00:05:44.500> definitely<00:05:44.530> be<00:05:45.430> talking<00:05:45.849> about<00:05:45.940> it

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
i will definitely be talking about it

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.300 
i will definitely be talking about it
more<00:05:48.840> this<00:05:49.840> is<00:05:49.990> a<00:05:50.020> good<00:05:50.289> first<00:05:50.590> look<00:05:50.860> at<00:05:51.070> it<00:05:51.099> and

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
more this is a good first look at it and

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.879 
more this is a good first look at it and
i<00:05:51.940> imagine<00:05:52.150> once<00:05:52.599> i<00:05:52.720> get<00:05:52.870> all<00:05:53.050> my<00:05:53.080> models<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:53.770> it

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
i imagine once i get all my models in it

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.810 
i imagine once i get all my models in it
i<00:05:54.070> will<00:05:54.729> show<00:05:55.539> kind<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:55.900> what<00:05:56.050> can<00:05:56.199> fit<00:05:56.409> in<00:05:56.500> them

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
i will show kind of what can fit in them

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.920 
i will show kind of what can fit in them
but<00:05:58.770> that's<00:05:59.770> pretty<00:06:00.099> much<00:06:00.220> it<00:06:00.310> this<00:06:00.639> is<00:06:00.930> Nazca

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
but that's pretty much it this is Nazca

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.470 
but that's pretty much it this is Nazca
at<00:06:02.260> they<00:06:02.560> 212<00:06:04.260> have<00:06:05.260> a<00:06:05.289> good
