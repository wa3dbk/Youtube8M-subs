more of a safer game with a 15 pool or
earlier<00:01:24.310> while<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.430> probe<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.760> going<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.090> get

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
earlier while the probe is going to get

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.910 
earlier while the probe is going to get
the<00:01:26.330> Scout<00:01:26.690> here<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.290> he's<00:01:27.440> gonna<00:01:27.650> know

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
the Scout here so he's gonna know

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.160 
the Scout here so he's gonna know
exactly<00:01:28.040> where<00:01:28.580> life<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.600> map<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:30.020> do

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
exactly where life is on the map we do

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.160 
exactly where life is on the map we do
see<00:01:30.940> no<00:01:31.940> further<00:01:32.150> probes<00:01:32.540> go<00:01:32.720> down<00:01:32.870> to<00:01:33.050> make

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
see no further probes go down to make

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.730 
see no further probes go down to make
affords<00:01:33.650> just<00:01:33.890> yet<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.370> it<00:01:35.180> is<00:01:35.330> at<00:01:35.660> 13<00:01:36.380> supply

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
affords just yet and it is at 13 supply

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.810 
affords just yet and it is at 13 supply
so<00:01:36.980> it<00:01:37.040> looks<00:01:37.160> like<00:01:37.220> it's<00:01:37.400> just<00:01:37.520> going<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.700> be<00:01:37.760> a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
so it looks like it's just going to be a

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.650 
so it looks like it's just going to be a
nexus<00:01:38.150> first<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:39.430> in<00:01:40.430> early<00:01:40.820> Scout<00:01:41.180> with<00:01:41.450> that

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
nexus first and in early Scout with that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.590 
nexus first and in early Scout with that
Nexus<00:01:41.990> first<00:01:42.230> yeah<00:01:43.190> life<00:01:43.640> can<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:44.390> be<00:01:44.420> going

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
Nexus first yeah life can it be going

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.840 
Nexus first yeah life can it be going
for<00:01:44.720> that<00:01:44.750> hatchery<00:01:45.230> first<00:01:45.470> again<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:46.010> think<00:01:46.730> he

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
for that hatchery first again I think he

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.960 
for that hatchery first again I think he
definitely<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.660> right<00:01:47.780> choice<00:01:47.840> here<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:49.760> goes

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
definitely the right choice here it goes

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.900 
definitely the right choice here it goes
and<00:01:50.360> nice<00:01:51.350> greedy<00:01:51.800> opening<00:01:52.430> for<00:01:52.640> both<00:01:52.760> players

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
and nice greedy opening for both players

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.500 
and nice greedy opening for both players
once<00:01:53.570> again<00:01:54.040> yeah<00:01:55.040> you're<00:01:56.000> not<00:01:56.150> even<00:01:56.390> gonna

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
once again yeah you're not even gonna

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.510 
once again yeah you're not even gonna
try<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:56.990> put<00:01:57.200> down<00:01:57.350> any<00:01:57.500> pylons<00:01:57.980> or<00:01:58.130> fake<00:01:58.280> any

at that close patch gonna make it very

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.869 
at that close patch gonna make it very
inefficient<00:02:08.659> for<00:02:08.840> life<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.950> mining<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.729> be

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
inefficient for life to mining to be

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.759 
inefficient for life to mining to be
mining<00:02:11.209> there<00:02:11.360> for<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.569> little<00:02:11.690> bit<00:02:11.870> do<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.680> see

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
mining there for a little bit do you see

the normal style getting those feelings
on<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.480> map<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.900> lot<00:02:39.440> quicker<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:40.010> mind<00:02:40.430> you

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
on the map a lot quicker and mind you

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.370 
on the map a lot quicker and mind you
these<00:02:40.700> positions<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.240> fantastics<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.050> course

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
these positions of fantastics of course

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.470 
these positions of fantastics of course
warm<00:02:42.590> hosts<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.640> life<00:02:43.850> can<00:02:44.030> definitely

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
warm hosts to life can definitely

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.030 
warm hosts to life can definitely
transitions<00:02:45.050> into<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.380> into<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.710> mid<00:02:45.830> game

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
transitions into that into the mid game

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.220 
transitions into that into the mid game
not<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> bad<00:02:47.090> choice<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.600> mean<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:47.990> got<00:02:48.140> that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
not a bad choice I mean you got that

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.870 
not a bad choice I mean you got that
direct<00:02:48.620> path<00:02:48.860> down<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.520> long<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.790> get

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
direct path down so as long as you get

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.390 
direct path down so as long as you get
the<00:02:49.940> decent<00:02:50.450> creep<00:02:50.690> spread<00:02:50.990> this<00:02:51.890> map<00:02:52.160> that

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
the decent creep spread this map that

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.510 
the decent creep spread this map that
can<00:02:52.760> be<00:02:52.940> very<00:02:53.120> good<00:02:53.270> for<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.770> well<00:02:54.770> compared<00:02:55.400> to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
can be very good for it well compared to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.350 
can be very good for it well compared to
cross<00:02:56.030> map<00:02:56.270> which<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.140> nightmare<00:02:57.590> yeah<00:02:58.360> for

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
cross map which is a nightmare yeah for

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.070 
cross map which is a nightmare yeah for
sure<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:00.700> if<00:03:01.700> life<00:03:02.090> does<00:03:02.390> want<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.720> go<00:03:02.870> for

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
sure and if life does want to go for

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.380 
sure and if life does want to go for
that<00:03:03.200> kind<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.500> style<00:03:03.860> he's<00:03:04.160> probably<00:03:04.910> happy

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
that kind of style he's probably happy

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.290 
that kind of style he's probably happy
with<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.720> positions<00:03:06.140> here<00:03:06.610> but<00:03:07.610> i<00:03:07.940> wonder<00:03:08.150> if

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
with the positions here but i wonder if

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.540 
with the positions here but i wonder if
dere<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:08.720> just<00:03:09.050> gonna<00:03:09.140> let<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.680> get<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.310> lead

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
dere is just gonna let it get that lead

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.670 
dere is just gonna let it get that lead
once<00:03:10.850> again<00:03:11.180> i<00:03:11.209> mean<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.870> aggression<00:03:12.380> worked

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
once again i mean the aggression worked

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.590 
once again i mean the aggression worked
last<00:03:13.010> time<00:03:13.220> this<00:03:13.550> is<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.760> bit<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.180> bigger<00:03:14.360> map

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
last time this is a bit of a bigger map

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.410 
last time this is a bit of a bigger map
of<00:03:14.840> course<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:15.740> vertical<00:03:16.580> spawns<00:03:16.910> makes<00:03:17.240> it

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
of course but vertical spawns makes it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.600 
of course but vertical spawns makes it
not<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:17.720> long<00:03:18.560> i<00:03:18.830> mean<00:03:18.950> i<00:03:19.040> guess<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.370> could<00:03:19.580> put

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
not so long i mean i guess you could put

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.360 
not so long i mean i guess you could put
down<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> Stargate<00:03:20.510> again<00:03:21.070> although<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.190> hasn't

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
down a Stargate again although it hasn't

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.760 
down a Stargate again although it hasn't
been<00:03:22.640> too<00:03:23.420> successful<00:03:23.600> for<00:03:24.230> him<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.560> past

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
been too successful for him in the past

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.400 
been too successful for him in the past
this<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.100> also<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.640> decent<00:03:26.510> map<00:03:26.660> for<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.140> making

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
this is also a decent map for you making

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.780 
this is also a decent map for you making
the<00:03:27.530> main<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.830> goes<00:03:27.980> straight<00:03:28.100> to<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.459> main<00:03:28.640> of

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
the main it goes straight to the main of

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.820 
the main it goes straight to the main of
your<00:03:28.940> opponent<00:03:29.330> he<00:03:29.900> had<00:03:29.990> some<00:03:30.200> damage<00:03:30.470> done<00:03:30.680> he

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
your opponent he had some damage done he

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.490 
your opponent he had some damage done he
did<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.160> show<00:03:31.940> some<00:03:31.970> great<00:03:32.450> micro<00:03:32.930> with<00:03:33.380> his

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
did so show some great micro with his

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.920 
did so show some great micro with his
Oracle's<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.100> past<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.750> it's<00:03:35.750> always

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
Oracle's in the past so it's always

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.020 
Oracle's in the past so it's always
enjoyable<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:37.040> good<00:03:37.280> for<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.489> Protoss<00:03:37.790> if

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
enjoyable and good for the Protoss if

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.370 
enjoyable and good for the Protoss if
you<00:03:38.150> can<00:03:38.300> get<00:03:38.450> some<00:03:38.600> damage<00:03:38.900> done<00:03:39.110> with<00:03:39.260> those

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
you can get some damage done with those

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.009 
you can get some damage done with those
Oracle's<00:03:39.800> always<00:03:40.580> good<00:03:40.910> Valdez<00:03:41.390> always<00:03:41.989> a

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
Oracle's always good Valdez always a

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.259 
Oracle's always good Valdez always a
great<00:03:42.320> sort<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.739> thing<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.100> get<00:03:43.700> damage<00:03:44.060> done

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
so very Truman like that but I I mean it

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.440 
so very Truman like that but I I mean it
does<00:03:50.810> seem<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.200> style<00:03:51.500> of<00:03:51.650> deer<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.940> go<00:03:53.300> for

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
does seem the style of deer to go for

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.180 
does seem the style of deer to go for
that<00:03:53.540> article<00:03:53.720> if<00:03:54.110> he<00:03:54.200> gets<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.440> chance<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.830> and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
that article if he gets a chance to and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.490 
that article if he gets a chance to and
he's<00:03:55.519> made<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.820> work<00:03:55.940> both<00:03:56.120> times<00:03:56.500> essentially

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
he's made it work both times essentially

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
these Viper Hydra timing attacks maybe

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.689 
these Viper Hydra timing attacks maybe
this<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.849> game<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.180> do<00:04:53.300> it<00:04:53.389> in<00:04:54.190> he<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.430> think

this is the game to do it in he I think
it<00:04:56.030> would<00:04:56.629> be<00:04:56.659> a<00:04:56.780> better<00:04:56.960> time<00:04:57.259> to<00:04:57.319> do<00:04:57.560> it

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
it would be a better time to do it

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.010 
it would be a better time to do it

bunch<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.300> pylons<00:05:41.629> I<00:05:41.750> guess<00:05:41.900> make<00:05:42.259> sure<00:05:42.289> I

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
bunch of pylons I guess make sure I

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.159 
bunch of pylons I guess make sure I
think<00:05:43.250> and<00:05:43.400> get<00:05:43.520> down<00:05:43.729> here<00:05:43.759> nice<00:05:44.509> could<00:05:44.990> just

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
think and get down here nice could just

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.350 
think and get down here nice could just
be<00:05:45.349> for<00:05:45.650> mobility<00:05:46.069> you<00:05:46.729> know<00:05:46.849> put<00:05:47.060> it<00:05:47.150> at<00:05:47.270> my

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
be for mobility you know put it at my

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.779 
be for mobility you know put it at my
front<00:05:47.599> yeah<00:05:48.139> make<00:05:48.349> a<00:05:48.379> bunch<00:05:48.620> of<00:05:48.710> hydrous<00:05:49.039> he

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
front yeah make a bunch of hydrous he

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.839 
front yeah make a bunch of hydrous he
could<00:05:50.240> be<00:05:50.389> a<00:05:50.419> media<00:05:51.319> put<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:51.889> at<00:05:51.979> the<00:05:52.009> front<00:05:52.219> so

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
could be a media put it at the front so

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.339 
could be a media put it at the front so
he's<00:05:53.000> Quintin<00:05:53.360> go<00:05:53.479> in<00:05:53.599> as<00:05:53.719> well<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:54.139> Queen

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
Hydra sort of attack to be the next step

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.240 
Hydra sort of attack to be the next step
to<00:05:56.930> this<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.289> not<00:05:57.409> a<00:05:57.469> bad<00:05:57.650> choice<00:05:57.919> to<00:05:58.159> be

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
even in Phoenix's maybe this is a

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.439 
even in Phoenix's maybe this is a
response<00:06:04.039> out<00:06:04.310> of<00:06:04.370> life<00:06:04.639> he's<00:06:04.969> like<00:06:05.150> oh<00:06:05.270> you're

third base where he can hear has just

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.629 
third base where he can hear has just
barely<00:06:16.759> no<00:06:17.229> vision<00:06:18.229> and<00:06:19.159> he<00:06:19.250> still<00:06:19.520> doesn't

immediately the third base gets

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.379 
immediately the third base gets
cancelled<00:06:27.529> and<00:06:27.710> five<00:06:28.520> queens<00:06:28.969> are<00:06:29.090> coming<00:06:29.300> out

maybe<00:06:48.830> get<00:06:49.009> a<00:06:49.039> few<00:06:49.099> hydras<00:06:49.729> from<00:06:49.909> this<00:06:50.090> it's

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:50.629 
maybe get a few hydras from this it's

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:52.540 
maybe get a few hydras from this it's
not<00:06:50.659> going<00:06:50.779> to<00:06:50.930> be<00:06:51.020> enough<00:06:51.229> he's<00:06:52.129> gonna<00:06:52.219> try

not going to be enough he's gonna try
and<00:06:52.669> get<00:06:52.729> it<00:06:52.849> closer<00:06:53.089> to<00:06:53.300> a<00:06:53.330> time<00:06:53.659> I<00:06:53.690> think

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
and get it closer to a time I think

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.030 
and get it closer to a time I think
that's<00:06:54.110> maybe<00:06:54.229> the<00:06:54.380> one<00:06:54.710> thing

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
that's maybe the one thing

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.560 
that's maybe the one thing
