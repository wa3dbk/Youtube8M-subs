what I'd like to do today is show you
how<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.130> write<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> verbal<00:00:11.759> expression<00:00:12.240> from<00:00:12.450> an

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
how to write a verbal expression from an

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.379 
how to write a verbal expression from an
algebraic<00:00:13.170> expression<00:00:13.549> over<00:00:14.549> here<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:15.269> have

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
algebraic expression over here we have

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.330 
algebraic expression over here we have
this<00:00:15.540> algebraic<00:00:15.990> expression<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.770> what<00:00:17.220> we

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
this algebraic expression and what we

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849 
this algebraic expression and what we
want<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> practice<00:00:18.090> today<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:19.590> about<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
want to practice today is think about to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.040 
want to practice today is think about to
see<00:00:19.980> how<00:00:20.130> would<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.369> say<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.779> somebody

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
see how would you say this to somebody

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.420 
see how would you say this to somebody
that<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.560> know<00:00:22.650> could<00:00:22.800> succeed<00:00:23.100> how<00:00:23.279> would

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
that you know could succeed how would

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.460 
that you know could succeed how would
you<00:00:23.580> explain<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.170> problem

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you explain what to do on this problem

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.109 
you explain what to do on this problem
and<00:00:25.859> there's<00:00:26.039> actually<00:00:26.369> multiple<00:00:26.640> ways<00:00:27.090> you

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and there's actually multiple ways you

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.080 
and there's actually multiple ways you
can<00:00:27.480> say<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.369> problem<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.640> would<00:00:29.730> describe

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
can say this problem that would describe

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.810 
can say this problem that would describe
to<00:00:30.480> actually<00:00:30.810> don't<00:00:30.960> receive<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.820> operation

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
to actually don't receive the operation

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.490 
to actually don't receive the operation
that's<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.960> first<00:00:34.200> part<00:00:34.410> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that's going on here the first part is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
that's going on here the first part is
you<00:00:34.530> notice<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.570> term<00:00:36.570> 2/3<00:00:38.390> so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you notice we have a a term 2/3 so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.940 
you notice we have a a term 2/3 so
that's<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> fraction<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.469> way<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.770> could

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
that's a fraction so one way we could

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.630 
that's a fraction so one way we could
say<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:42.000> say<00:00:42.180> 2/3

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.490 

multiplied

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:12.490 

by<00:00:54.130> a<00:00:55.440> number<00:00:56.440> raised<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.850> fourth<00:00:58.090> power

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.060 

and<00:01:12.710> or<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.760> could<00:01:13.940> also<00:01:14.060> say<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.690> number<00:01:15.320> to

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
and or you could also say a number to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.700 
and or you could also say a number to
the<00:01:16.250> race<00:01:16.760> -<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.240> know<00:01:17.330> I<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.660> number<00:01:18.320> with<00:01:18.590> an

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
the race - you know I a number with an

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.860 
the race - you know I a number with an
exponent<00:01:19.010> of<00:01:19.280> 4<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.760> number<00:01:20.360> multiplied<00:01:20.840> by

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
exponent of 4 a number multiplied by

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.590 
exponent of 4 a number multiplied by
itself<00:01:21.440> four<00:01:22.130> times<00:01:22.160> those<00:01:22.940> all<00:01:23.210> kind<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.510> mean

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
itself four times those all kind of mean

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.690 
itself four times those all kind of mean
the<00:01:23.660> same<00:01:23.750> thing<00:01:24.140> as<00:01:24.380> X<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.280> fourth<00:01:25.520> power

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the same thing as X to the fourth power

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.210 
the same thing as X to the fourth power
you<00:01:26.630> can<00:01:26.810> also<00:01:27.050> look<00:01:27.350> at<00:01:27.470> this<00:01:27.650> though<00:01:27.830> guys<00:01:28.010> in

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
you can also look at this though guys in

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.720 
you can also look at this though guys in
a<00:01:28.280> different<00:01:28.670> way<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.470> don't<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:31.280> show<00:01:31.700> you

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
a different way and I I don't I show you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.090 
a different way and I I don't I show you
this<00:01:31.880> way<00:01:32.060> not<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.330> confuse<00:01:33.050> you<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.950> also

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
this way not to confuse you but to also

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.160 
this way not to confuse you but to also
show<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.760> this<00:01:35.150> can<00:01:35.450> be<00:01:35.540> represented<00:01:36.080> in

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
show you that this can be represented in

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.960 
show you that this can be represented in
a<00:01:36.260> different<00:01:36.290> way<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.980> can<00:01:37.280> also<00:01:37.490> represent

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
a different way you can also represent

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.470 
a different way you can also represent
2/3<00:01:38.660> X<00:01:38.960> as<00:01:39.490> 2<00:01:40.490> times<00:01:41.060> X<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.690> 4<00:01:42.760> all<00:01:43.760> divided

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
2/3 X as 2 times X to the 4 all divided

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.310 
2/3 X as 2 times X to the 4 all divided
by<00:01:44.630> 3<00:01:44.930> these<00:01:45.590> are<00:01:45.830> equivalent<00:01:47.320> equivalent

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
by 3 these are equivalent equivalent

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.740 
by 3 these are equivalent equivalent
ways<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.920> represent<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:49.700> term<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:50.570> can

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
ways to represent this term so you can

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:01.070 
ways to represent this term so you can
also<00:01:50.900> say<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:54.220> multiply

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.210 

by<00:02:01.650> number

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:15.930 

raised<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.480> fourth<00:02:07.810> power

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.000 

and<00:02:16.030> then<00:02:16.720> divided<00:02:17.380> by<00:02:17.470> three

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.320 

and<00:02:24.310> there's<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> important<00:02:25.120> thing<00:02:25.239> to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
and there's the important thing to

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330 
and there's the important thing to
remember<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.110> 2/3<00:02:26.530> subset<00:02:26.920> threes<00:02:27.190> on

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
remember is that 2/3 subset threes on

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.920 
remember is that 2/3 subset threes on
the<00:02:27.370> bottom<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.180> got<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.420> remember<00:02:28.569> that's<00:02:28.780> a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
the bottom you got to remember that's a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.570 
the bottom you got to remember that's a
whole<00:02:29.110> number<00:02:29.319> so<00:02:29.620> really<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.159> actually<00:02:30.430> has<00:02:30.549> a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
whole number so really it actually has a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.490 
whole number so really it actually has a
1<00:02:30.819> on<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> bottom<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.629> multiply<00:02:32.110> that

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
1 on the bottom so you can multiply that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.320 
1 on the bottom so you can multiply that
at<00:02:32.980> 3<00:02:33.190> actually<00:02:33.370> under<00:02:33.700> there<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:33.909> that<00:02:34.030> 3<00:02:34.239> is

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
at 3 actually under there and that 3 is

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.869 
at 3 actually under there and that 3 is
actually<00:02:34.450> divided<00:02:34.900> by<00:02:35.080> all<00:02:35.379> of<00:02:35.560> these<00:02:35.680> ok<00:02:36.280> so

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
actually divided by all of these ok so

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.759 
actually divided by all of these ok so
both<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.480> these<00:02:37.540> ways<00:02:37.780> would<00:02:38.110> be<00:02:38.170> correct<00:02:38.560> so

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
both of these ways would be correct so

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:39.630 
both of these ways would be correct so
that<00:02:38.799> is<00:02:38.980> how<00:02:39.069> you<00:02:39.129> write<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> verbal

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
that is how you write a verbal

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.830 
that is how you write a verbal
expression<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.959> an<00:02:41.019> algebraic<00:02:41.620> expression
