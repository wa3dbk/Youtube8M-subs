00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.400
 or the people that you are 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.799
 welcome to the top explosion is a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.629
 Weekly matsui room and week number 12 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.880
 and good first of all explain you a 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.860
 thing two weeks ago I got sick 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.540
 sick of not being able to get up from the 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.950
 bed and just next week 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.360
 I worked here means this because 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.550
 I'm a wretch and I get bad 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.860
 on vacation does not mean that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.390
 means that the clips that you have me 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.369
 sent last week and the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.050
 previous in I have them saved and not yet 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.910
 I've taken them out in case one of them did 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 that my clip did not come out and it's great 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.780
 that's the reason and we do not roll up anymore 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.100
 if we leave already with the top number 5 we 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.539
 let's modern warfare 3 with the streak 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.239
 most disgusting of the whole game 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.710
 stealth bomber exactly one 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.359
 streak that you end up that was helpful 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 just killing people is not going to come 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.320
 streak or nothing and what did this do 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.089
 it can not be said that they will continue more 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.859
 that I lick to own we kill all the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.469
 enemy team and you have enough here 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.120
 And if my God, seriously, are you going to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.640
 make comment with this background music 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.989
 but it does look like it's a varnish it's going 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.510
 I can not really I can not come 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.070
 change it please come happy we take 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.930
 with the top number 4 and we go to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.270
 2 white to another streak that gives quite 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.680
 disgusting we go with the lightning attack and what 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.820
 is what you are going to do then exactly 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.220
 that the stealth bomber 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.860
 it's like the little brother but it's the same 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.080
 of devastating takes a last 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.180
 yesterday easier but good and we are not going to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 deal with the top number 3 and attentive that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.600
 let's see a troll fought but with 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.820
 an explosion in between here we see 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.590
 how a guy loads a failure well 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.820
 with the bike full of faith 4 is that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.290
 surely that would export word 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.180
 prospect our theater I go 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.770
 with the top number 2 and we're leaving now 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.080
 same to white we are all on the map 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.330
 of appling seek and destroy attentive that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.979
 are going to aznar l rcx of what I'm going to cut 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.509

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.729
 fuck but what the hell is the last 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.289
 it is not if the future is made but five 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.360
 low of an explosion of a rx of 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.100
 decades we 're going to go with the top number 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 one and this is too much I'm going to for 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.119
 your eyes are in warfare mode 3 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.190
 in the mission map and just do it is a 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.410
 low multiple and does not know how not to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.000
 this guy is going to throw a blinding was going to 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.380
 kill four with a mower that 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.660

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.060
 two weeks without looking for clicks on a tray 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.860

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.330
