00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 from an early hour about 150 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.730
 undergraduate students in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.380
 dentistry of the university 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.150
 Veracruz decided to close the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 facilities of the science area of the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.260
 health also affecting the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.240
 Bachelor of Medicine, Nursing and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.750
 nutrition who could not access 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.750
 his classrooms 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.470
 and they claim that the closure is because 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.540
 the authorities of the maximum house of 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.670
 studies have in abandonment to the area 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.870
 of dentistry because they still do not conclude with 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.460
 the building that will house the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.890
 students in addition to a series of 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.430
 points such as the lack of materials and 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.370
 I apologize team requests 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.640
 both my companions as I loved to 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.809
 teachers because we know that this affects 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.140
 definitely also affects us 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.879
 us but sometimes they are circumstances 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.350
 that we have to carry out so that 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.680
 personalities like those that inhabit 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.110
 they are here come because they really say 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.880
 if we listen to them if we are there but you 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.290
 you go if you're not home then 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.270
 fortunately, sometimes we have to 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.010
 get to these situations so that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.490
 really the people who are here 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.250
 back we ignore the first as already 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.520
 I mentioned it discrediting is this 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.380
 ask that the units that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.600
 yes it is true every semester they ask 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.130
 materials and all that but because I do not know 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.750
 makes a correct planning so that 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.570
 when we are going to enter the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.870
 clinics are the most 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.540
 arranged 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.660
 there is also a request about equipment 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.210
 of x-rays that although there are sometimes 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.890
 we are limited to only one and there is no 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.260
 who is checking who is 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.630
 Checking what can be used two or 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.700
 three x- ray equipment then all 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.490
 this decreases our work time 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.120
 the patient's waiting time and that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.580
 costs and hinders a bit the acting of 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.410
 the clinic during the manifestation a 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.850
 percentage of students manifested in 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.560
 against the decision they will take 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.570
 some comrades because it is an action 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.429
 that affects the total faculty and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.580
 student 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.650
 with better facilities 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.300
 the accreditation of the school but what 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.590
 that they do not get to see is that everything 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.319
 that has already been working with the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.840
 authorities of the direct 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.379
 the faculty 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.019
 we already saw has a previous meeting with 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.690
 student issues and did not reach the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.090
 agreement did not respect the agreement that the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.819
 director was going to give the ruling that he was going to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.319
 go through with the school then he does not 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.629
 is respecting what has already been agreed 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.549
 now many demands of truth do not 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.660
 they have fundamentals and we are not all 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.790
 dentistry students those who 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.410
 we are supporting them informed that up 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.390
 not have a resolution on the part 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.890
 of the rectorial authorities the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.349
 health sciences facilities 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.400
 dones and suÃ¡rez will remain closed
