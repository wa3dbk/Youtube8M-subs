 gay no and your boyfriend in a few hours 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.480

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.640
 open I said you see me if there's room 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.290

 watch the horns on like heels 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.940
 they soar that maybe you're losing a little 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
