I'm going to put them on the needle
starting<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.590> right<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.369> start<00:01:35.700> either

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
starting with the right you start either

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.540 
starting with the right you start either
side<00:01:36.300> keep<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.470> mind<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.070> you're<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
side keep in mind that you're going to

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.290 
side keep in mind that you're going to
end<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:39.050> with<00:01:40.050> one<00:01:40.350> loop<00:01:40.800> too<00:01:41.220> few<00:01:41.550> for<00:01:42.149> your

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
end up with one loop too few for your

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.380 
end up with one loop too few for your
hem<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:43.080> there's<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.070> less<00:01:44.399> loop<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.330> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
hem because there's one less loop at the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.710 
hem because there's one less loop at the
bottom<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.460> top<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.060> if

bottom then there is at the top and if

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.779 
bottom then there is at the top and if
you<00:01:48.840> look<00:01:49.050> at<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.320> contrasting<00:01:50.250> thread<00:01:50.490> in

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
you look at this contrasting thread in

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.230 
you look at this contrasting thread in
between<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.990> loop<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.470> I'm<00:01:52.560> getting<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.250> a

little<00:02:46.190> awkward<00:02:46.430> here<00:02:46.910> because<00:02:47.180> I'm<00:02:47.300> trying

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
little awkward here because I'm trying

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.960 
little awkward here because I'm trying
to<00:02:47.690> stay<00:02:47.960> out<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.640> way<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.750> camera

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
to stay out of the way of the camera

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.330 
to stay out of the way of the camera
I<00:02:53.030> get<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.140> place<00:02:54.440> where<00:02:54.710> it's<00:02:54.830> hard<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.160> see

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
I get to a place where it's hard to see

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.950 
I get to a place where it's hard to see
what<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.610> pick<00:02:55.730> up<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.330> kind<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.660> stretched

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
what to pick up I just kind of stretched

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.250 
what to pick up I just kind of stretched
all<00:02:57.200> downward<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.760> look<00:02:59.000> at<00:02:59.240> where<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.020> loops

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
all downward and look at where the loops

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.610 
all downward and look at where the loops
are<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.670> last<00:03:01.910> loop<00:03:02.270> right<00:03:02.600> here

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
are this is the last loop right here

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.580 
are this is the last loop right here
and<00:03:04.890> I'm<00:03:05.069> just<00:03:05.250> going<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.550> pick<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.970> up

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.120 

and<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.190> good<00:03:09.340> idea<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:10.860> put<00:03:11.860> everything

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
and it's a good idea to put everything

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.940 
and it's a good idea to put everything
in<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.580> position<00:03:12.970> before<00:03:13.569> going<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.319> closing

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
in a position before going and closing

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.020 
in a position before going and closing
