multicopter flash tool this is a 0.72 I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.210 
multicopter flash tool this is a 0.72 I
think<00:00:33.870> point<00:00:34.110> 7<00:00:34.379> 4<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.650> actually<00:00:34.949> available

you<00:00:41.220> don't<00:00:41.460> fall<00:00:41.640> into<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> same<00:00:42.150> trap<00:00:42.860> when<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
you don't fall into the same trap when I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.710 
you don't fall into the same trap when I
flashed<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> ESC<00:00:44.850> s<00:00:44.909> and<00:00:45.120> you'll<00:00:45.210> notice<00:00:45.600> in

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
flashed the ESC s and you'll notice in

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.560 
flashed the ESC s and you'll notice in
the<00:00:45.809> other<00:00:45.930> video<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.409> actually<00:00:46.920> used<00:00:47.729> this

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.680 
dated the 20th of the 9th 2013 now I
have<00:00:55.710> had<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> lot<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.489> problems<00:00:56.970> with<00:00:57.420> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
have had a lot of problems with this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.350 
have had a lot of problems with this
version<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.229> firmware<00:00:58.440> my<00:00:59.339> model<00:01:00.180> would

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
version of the firmware my model would

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.060 
version of the firmware my model would
take<00:01:00.600> off<00:01:00.869> and<00:01:01.080> then<00:01:01.290> one<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.619> the<00:01:01.710> motors

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
take off and then one of the motors

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.009 
take off and then one of the motors
would<00:01:02.250> start<00:01:02.519> pulsing<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.600> side<00:01:03.839> of<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
would start pulsing and that side of the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.230 
would start pulsing and that side of the
motor<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.440> fall<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> whole<00:01:06.000> model

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
motor would fall and the the whole model

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000 
motor would fall and the the whole model
would<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.960> essentially<00:01:07.350> tip<00:01:07.590> over<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
would then just essentially tip over in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.910 
would then just essentially tip over in
the<00:01:08.100> sky<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.729> fall<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.359> the<00:01:09.420> ground<00:01:09.509> now<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the sky and fall to the ground now to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
the sky and fall to the ground now to
try<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.219> fix<00:01:11.399> this<00:01:11.609> I<00:01:11.820> tried<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.299> couple<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
try and fix this I tried to a couple of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.469 
try and fix this I tried to a couple of
things<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.490> thought<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.549> must<00:01:15.149> have<00:01:15.210> made<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
things I thought I must have made a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.990 
things I thought I must have made a
problem<00:01:15.899> when<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> flushed<00:01:17.039> the<00:01:17.130> ESC<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.759> read

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
problem when I flushed the ESC so I read

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.029 
problem when I flushed the ESC so I read
flush<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.359> ESC<00:01:18.750> s<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.079> checked<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.770> wiring

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
flush the ESC s I checked all the wiring

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.190 
flush the ESC s I checked all the wiring
to<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.340> motors<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> ESC<00:01:21.539> themselves<00:01:22.079> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
to the motors in the ESC themselves I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.749 
to the motors in the ESC themselves I
checked<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> wiring<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> serious<00:01:23.520> board

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
checked the wiring on the serious board

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.039 
checked the wiring on the serious board
cuz<00:01:23.969> I<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.149> actually<00:01:24.299> using<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:24.750> Cirrus

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
cuz I was actually using the Cirrus

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.529 
cuz I was actually using the Cirrus
multi<00:01:25.469> we<00:01:25.649> se<00:01:26.429> version<00:01:26.820> 2<00:01:27.000> board<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.420> that

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
multi we se version 2 board at that

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.599 
multi we se version 2 board at that
point<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> resold<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.310> bullets

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
point then I resold it all the bullets

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.580 
point then I resold it all the bullets
to<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.759> ESC<00:01:30.270> s<00:01:30.329> balance<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> props<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to the ESC s balance the props and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.169 
to the ESC s balance the props and

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
go through this whole list this is

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.590 
go through this whole list this is
probably<00:01:35.310> about<00:01:35.429> 10<00:01:35.969> days<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
probably about 10 days of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.139 
probably about 10 days of
troubleshooting<00:01:37.140> where<00:01:38.039> I<00:01:38.070> replaced<00:01:38.700> pretty

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
troubleshooting where I replaced pretty

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.840 
troubleshooting where I replaced pretty
much<00:01:39.420> every<00:01:39.899> component<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.429> entire

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
much every component on the entire

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.359 
much every component on the entire
quadcopter<00:01:42.689> I've<00:01:43.229> starting<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
quadcopter I've starting to think that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
quadcopter I've starting to think that
it<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.899> cursed<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:48.109> the<00:01:49.109> last

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it was just cursed and then the last

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
it was just cursed and then the last
almost<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.189> last<00:01:50.340> thing<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.579> did<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.819> ordered

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
almost the last thing I did I ordered

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.230 
almost the last thing I did I ordered
four<00:01:51.630> new<00:01:52.049> Afro<00:01:52.890> pscs<00:01:53.460> from<00:01:53.640> hobbyking<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
four new Afro pscs from hobbyking to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.899 
four new Afro pscs from hobbyking to
replace<00:01:54.569> these<00:01:54.749> four<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.140> I've<00:01:55.259> been<00:01:55.409> using

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
replace these four that I've been using

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.359 
replace these four that I've been using
because<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.619> couldn't<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.740> over<00:01:59.069> the<00:01:59.189> feeling

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
because I couldn't get over the feeling

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.219 
because I couldn't get over the feeling
that<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> ESDS<00:02:00.450> themselves<00:02:01.079> that

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that it was the ESDS themselves that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.010 
that it was the ESDS themselves that
were<00:02:01.319> having<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> problem<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.899> then<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
were having the problem and then it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.809 
were having the problem and then it
dawned<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.469> me<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.679> I<00:02:05.159> hadn't<00:02:05.639> made<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
dawned on me that I hadn't made a

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.730 
dawned on me that I hadn't made a
quadcopter<00:02:07.670> for<00:02:08.670> about<00:02:09.390> six<00:02:09.780> eight<00:02:09.960> weeks<00:02:09.990> so

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
quadcopter for about six eight weeks so

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.410 
quadcopter for about six eight weeks so
the<00:02:10.860> last<00:02:11.190> time<00:02:11.700> I'd<00:02:12.390> updated<00:02:13.129> an<00:02:14.129> ESC<00:02:14.580> hadn't

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the last time I'd updated an ESC hadn't

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.760 
the last time I'd updated an ESC hadn't
used<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.930> version<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
used this version of the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
used this version of the
to<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.190> 9th<00:02:20.610> 2013<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.750> actually<00:02:23.200> used<00:02:23.790> this

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
to the 9th 2013 and actually used this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.760 
to the 9th 2013 and actually used this
one<00:02:25.120> which<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.260> version<00:02:27.070> v<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.750> 15<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
one which is version v that 15 of the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.180 
one which is version v that 15 of the
5th<00:02:30.060> 2013<00:02:31.080> because<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.320> last<00:02:32.530> one<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.950> actually

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
5th 2013 because the last one I actually

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.410 
5th 2013 because the last one I actually
made<00:02:33.610> was<00:02:34.150> August<00:02:35.110> time<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.180> was<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
made was August time and so this was the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.570 
made was August time and so this was the
version<00:02:37.570> I've<00:02:37.810> used<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.920> what<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.130> did<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.490> I

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
version I've used so what I did is I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.440 
version I've used so what I did is I
then<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.850> reflashed<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:41.560> four<00:02:41.950> es<00:02:42.400> CS<00:02:42.700> with

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
then I reflashed the four es CS with

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.960 
then I reflashed the four es CS with
this<00:02:43.660> version<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.560> firmware<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.280> they

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
this version of the firmware and they

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.200 
this version of the firmware and they
have<00:02:46.210> performed<00:02:46.870> fantastically<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.910> want
