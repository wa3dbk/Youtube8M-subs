00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
the fuck's going on but it's making the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.920 
the fuck's going on but it's making the
editing<00:02:32.980> process<00:02:33.160> ridiculously<00:02:34.090> hard<00:02:34.450> for<00:02:34.810> me

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
editing process ridiculously hard for me

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.990 
editing process ridiculously hard for me
it<00:02:35.140> seems<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.470> every<00:02:36.070> single<00:02:36.250> 10<00:02:36.610> minutes

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
it seems like every single 10 minutes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.240 
it seems like every single 10 minutes
the<00:02:37.120> audio<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.660> off<00:02:37.900> by<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.410> 2<00:02:38.620> or<00:02:38.650> 3<00:02:38.800> full

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the audio is off by like 2 or 3 full

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.280 
the audio is off by like 2 or 3 full
seconds<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.270> have<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.570> actually<00:02:40.870> take<00:02:41.080> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
seconds so I have to actually take the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.710 
seconds so I have to actually take the
audio<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.920> drag<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.520> back<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.120> match<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.690> with

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
audio and drag it back to match it with

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.449 
audio and drag it back to match it with
the<00:02:44.080> gameplay<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.890> doesn't<00:02:45.160> seem<00:02:45.280> all

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459
