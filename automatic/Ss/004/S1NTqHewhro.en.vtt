I'd love to do scraps and bits and
pieces<00:00:10.320> occasionally<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.370> really<00:00:11.639> do<00:00:11.820> get<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
pieces occasionally we really do get a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.640 
pieces occasionally we really do get a
painting<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.420> doesn't<00:00:12.840> deserve<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.380> kept

and<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.460> really<00:00:14.730> needs<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.089> be<00:00:15.210> worked<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:16.170> in

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and it really needs to be worked with in

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.130 
and it really needs to be worked with in
ways<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.250> just<00:00:17.279> don't<00:00:17.640> seem<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.779> appeal<00:00:19.109> to

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
ways that just don't seem to appeal to

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.509 
ways that just don't seem to appeal to
all<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.590> us<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.820> what<00:00:21.000> I'll<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.109> will

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
paintings little bits little things that

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.030 
paintings little bits little things that
appeal<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.779> me<00:00:30.960> again<00:00:31.289> protecting<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
appeal to me again protecting what I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.250 
appeal to me again protecting what I
love<00:00:32.309> reusing<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> making<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.020> happen

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
love reusing it and making it happen

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
love reusing it and making it happen
again<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.160> again<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.670> will<00:00:37.579> continue<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.820> build

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
again and again I will continue to build

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.290 
again and again I will continue to build
and<00:00:39.510> make<00:00:39.870> little<00:00:40.410> collages<00:00:40.760> just<00:00:41.760> spend<00:00:42.030> some

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and make little collages just spend some

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.119 
and make little collages just spend some
time<00:00:42.739> seeing<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.100> might<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.020> add<00:00:46.260> bits

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
time seeing what might be if I add bits

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.000 
time seeing what might be if I add bits
and<00:00:47.399> pieces<00:00:47.610> together<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:49.320> happens<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and pieces together this happens to be a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.330 
and pieces together this happens to be a
paint<00:00:50.280> sample<00:00:50.730> from<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.210> those<00:00:51.360> stores

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
paint sample from one of those stores

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.529 
paint sample from one of those stores
they're<00:00:53.340> kind<00:00:53.610> enough<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> share<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.510> with

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
they're kind enough to share them with

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.350 
they're kind enough to share them with
us<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.770> good<00:00:55.949> way<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.129> practice<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
us but it's a good way to practice to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.970 
us but it's a good way to practice to
see<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:57.920> how<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:58.980> might<00:00:59.809> create<00:01:00.809> something<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
see how how you might create something a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.299 
see how how you might create something a
little<00:01:02.570> interesting<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.589> things<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
little interesting out of things that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.910 
little interesting out of things that
just<00:01:05.519> happen<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.290> normally<00:01:07.290> trash<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
just happen to be normally trash as a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.080 
just happen to be normally trash as a
matter<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> fact<00:01:08.430> when<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.939> New<00:01:09.030> York

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
matter of fact when I was in New York

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
matter of fact when I was in New York
City<00:01:09.390> recently<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.549> found<00:01:11.549> some<00:01:12.860> posters<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
City recently I found some posters and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.399 
City recently I found some posters and
an<00:01:14.420> advertisement<00:01:15.420> sitted<00:01:15.780> we're<00:01:16.020> peeling

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
an advertisement sitted we're peeling

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.649 
an advertisement sitted we're peeling
off<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> board<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.400> grabbed<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
off of a board I grabbed some of that

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.999 
off of a board I grabbed some of that
and<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.409> someday<00:01:19.680> make<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and I think that will someday make a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.120 
and I think that will someday make a
beautiful<00:01:20.729> collage<00:01:21.090> bit<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.659> well<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.979> when

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
beautiful collage bit as well but when

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
beautiful collage bit as well but when
I'm<00:01:23.250> tired<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.150> when<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:24.420> trying<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> realize

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
I'm tired and when I'm trying to realize

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.499 
I'm tired and when I'm trying to realize
what's<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.520> trying<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> improve<00:01:27.390> a
