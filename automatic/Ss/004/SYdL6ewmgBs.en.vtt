00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.830
 probably nowhere else that had so 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.480
 cheesy and bunch so extravagant and 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.300
 varied as on the salone 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.160
 internazionale del mobile since 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.290
 For decades, the fair is the most important 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.119
 Meet the industry Everyone of the something 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.079
 wants to introduce new or wants to see 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.079
 to Mailand 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.850
 Tom Dixon also took part this year 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.260
 British designer has as ex musician 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.230
 not just rhythm in the blood 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.850
 he also knows what's hot right now 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.910
 At the fair he presents his line 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.190
 works that some of his designs already 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.670
 To be considered a classic is his talent 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.670
 attributable 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.370
 I never thought about the design of 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.930
 I've thought of design classics 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.730
 things that interest me 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.050
 it was very difficult in the 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.330
 industry 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.490
 Now I have an infrastructure that it 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.770
 It allows me to design what I like 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.790
 when my products become classic 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.600
 I would be happy 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.600
 but it is not the goal 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.750
 innovative materials timeless designs 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.490
 and new technologies 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.410
 according to mateo kries, these are the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.900
 components for a design classic 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.420
 the german expert visits innumerable 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.979
 design exhibitions sang the world over 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.860
 Classics can also be inspired 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.710
 arise the shelf plano gates of the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.440
 british designer duos buscemi is like that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.150
 a blueprint 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.500
 of course, such objects can 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.630
 refer to the classic 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.280
 design history always rather than 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.930
 Establish classics because they are one 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.050
 Known to tie because they per se 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 timeless and that is the case 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.420
 at this shelf of barbaros kb there 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.830
 you can see references to a shelf of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.550
 shell if he is from post-war 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.680
 furniture manufacturers also rely on 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.970
 economy on classic because 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.750
 they sell well 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.769
 thonet brings the es 43 of marz in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.769
 new colors out 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.859
 the italian manufacturer cassina has 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.230
 the model lc 5 from nico is new 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.329
 the famous architect and 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.859
 designer had this couch in the 30s 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.459
 years for his paris apartment 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.620
 designed 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.609
 now there are feathers 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.739
 and as 2 and 3 seater all furniture must 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:34.870
 you say that it is already in the 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.370
 classic acts vw has shown that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.349
 all his previous furniture on the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.389
 market over decades 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.799
 and I think that will also be the case 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:47.209
 that new sofa from him too 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.980
 outside the fair halls in milan 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.700
 There is a lot of new things going on inside the city 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.560
 discover 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.639
 especially young designers represent the 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.639
 her designs 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.670
 including the Dutch 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.070
 Designer Maarten Baas 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.920
 the 36 year old is considered an enfant terrible 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.350
 The furniture world fits his designs in 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.380
 no classical grid should they too 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.630
 not the staging of a side blow 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.630
 on the milan design circus 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.920
 I do not like to get carried away 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.660
 for me has had less with 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.040
 industrial production or with 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.990
 to do technical things 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.910
 for me it is a big room 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.750
 in which all creative processes 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.750
 getting together 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.080
 back on the fairgrounds 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.730
 There are only a dozen worldwide 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.340
 designers whose handwriting is high 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.290
 sarah hadid and 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.270
 konstantin grcic are among them 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.490
 Designer presented at the salon 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.960
 by the way, his chair rival stands 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.960
 already in a museum 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.520
 pulled in and you could on the 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.390
 fair in any case so settled 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.480
 Escape with the stress of constant size 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.360
 always creates objects 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.600
 design them in their own way and 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.830
 wisely look completely new 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.560
 maybe there are some of the new ones 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.910
 designs of this year's furniture fair 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.910
 design classics of tomorrow
