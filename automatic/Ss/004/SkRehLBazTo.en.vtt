interested<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.479> there's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> step

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
interested in is that there's a step

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.660 
interested in is that there's a step
that<00:01:28.049> kind<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> tells<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.950> your<00:01:29.220> current<00:01:29.579> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that kind of tells you your current to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.370 
that kind of tells you your current to
score<00:01:29.909> per<00:01:30.030> minute<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:30.960> based<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.320> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
score per minute and then based on that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.200 
score per minute and then based on that
score<00:01:31.770> per<00:01:31.860> minute<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.610> tells<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.090> when

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
score per minute it then tells you when

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.450 
score per minute it then tells you when
your<00:01:33.390> next<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> prestige<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.950> i<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.220> at

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
your next get a prestige so i think at

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.710 
your next get a prestige so i think at
the<00:01:35.520> beginning<00:01:35.579> monomorphic<00:01:36.030> three<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> know

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the beginning monomorphic three you know

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.850 
the beginning monomorphic three you know
personally<00:01:37.200> i'm<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.560> trying<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
personally i'm going to be trying to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740 
personally i'm going to be trying to
prestige<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.430> often<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.790> possible<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:39.659> just

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
prestige as often as possible I'm just

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
prestige as often as possible I'm just
going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.170> exactly<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:40.950> long<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
going to know exactly how long it's

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.010 
going to know exactly how long it's
gonna<00:01:41.340> take<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> prestige<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.299> maybe<00:01:42.479> going

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
gonna take to prestige and maybe going

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.480 
gonna take to prestige and maybe going
to<00:01:43.079> focus<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.590> raising<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.100> school<00:01:44.369> per

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
to focus more on raising my school per

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
to focus more on raising my school per
minute<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.180> think<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:45.990> good

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
minute so I think that's a really good

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.440 
minute so I think that's a really good
aspect<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.070> kind<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.790> stats<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
aspect of it that kind of stats the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.810 
aspect of it that kind of stats the
score<00:01:49.409> per<00:01:49.500> minute<00:01:49.740> me<00:01:49.890> lap<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
score per minute me lap I think all the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
score per minute me lap I think all the
KD<00:01:51.180> stuff<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.140> may<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.439> getting<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.829> little

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
KD stuff is that may be getting a little

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.649 
KD stuff is that may be getting a little
bit<00:01:53.100> too<00:01:53.250> extreme<00:01:53.369> movies<00:01:53.970> even<00:01:54.210> too<00:01:54.479> much

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
bit too extreme movies even too much

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
bit too extreme movies even too much
information<00:01:54.960> out<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:56.040> sure<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
information out but not sure I have to

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.670 
information out but not sure I have to
do<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> guys<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.360> about<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.780> also

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
do what you guys think about that also

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.260 
do what you guys think about that also
as<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.189> saying<00:01:59.369> about<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> custom<00:02:00.000> classes

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
as I was saying about the custom classes

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.240 
as I was saying about the custom classes
you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.869> actually

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
you can actually

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.520 
you can actually
now<00:02:01.310> change<00:02:01.820> your<00:02:02.060> custom<00:02:02.420> classes<00:02:02.720> through

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
now change your custom classes through

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.350 
now change your custom classes through
alley<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.190> can<00:02:04.400> do<00:02:04.580> it<00:02:04.700> either<00:02:04.970> on<00:02:05.150> the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
alley so you can do it either on the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.580 
alley so you can do it either on the
console<00:02:05.750> because<00:02:05.960> it's<00:02:06.200> actually<00:02:06.260> going<00:02:06.500> to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
console because it's actually going to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.410 
console because it's actually going to
be<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.680> console<00:02:07.100> app<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:07.760> call<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:07.910> duty<00:02:08.210> elite

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.630 
be a console app for call of duty elite
it's<00:02:08.990> also<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.470> be<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.590> mobile<00:02:10.160> app<00:02:10.369> for

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640

of the kind of guides were a little bit

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.050 
of the kind of guides were a little bit
off<00:03:46.010> like<00:03:46.220> they<00:03:46.340> were<00:03:46.400> recommended<00:03:46.910> using

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
off like they were recommended using

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.550

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
so i'm not sure maybe that's more of an

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.120
