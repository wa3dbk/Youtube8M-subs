00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.160

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.530
 row after we start with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 the westernsattel something special 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.700
 special first look good from 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.270
 saddle then the larger pad 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.129
 and how all people can see 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.570
 yes it is a grasp no that is not 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.129
 handle this is normal area thought 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.079
 were going to do so for the return trip 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 the lasso when i work on cattle 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.949
 or I wanted to pull from the ground 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.559
 so now we have more to decorate or 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.420
 more about the decoration here is what else 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 the saddle especially as you can see 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 wide fender so wide chair straps 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.180
 we have heard broad city 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.500
 various spread their foot 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.390
 here or there in there if you are yes 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.760
 normal at hours live rides so 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.680
 long and the wide think that should be 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.670
 Protected that for that is everything 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.810
 already designed for comfort 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.810
 then we have this under the saddle 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.909
 blanket yes the blanket there are bedding 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.259
 thick so that the back is spared because 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.640
 that should be the bumps of bridge 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.450
 absorb so dampen 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.159
 Under the bed is deserved that is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.579
 thought to record white 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.140
 understand the patch worth gold and longer 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.900
 so that the sweat is then absorbed 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.670
 come to trense is especially we 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.530
 Do not talk noses we have 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.520
 Certainly certain and the rest of the is 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.950
 also open why all this as the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.970
 width has no nasal bone in us 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.850
 the nasal thongs are prohibited 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.649
 we have company here for him 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.790
 Prevent that from happening to your right 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.320
 can be pulled through 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.630
 can the money he should complain to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.909
 can move freely then goes bradls 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.680
 Here you have a place with headband 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.909
 trends or two trends is also 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.899
 a matter of taste 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.700
 the shooting in pakistan is to me 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.289
 a lot of work i can do the two hands 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810
 I can work you a mobile phone 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.610
 and which horses are practically off the ground 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.330
 I can prevent that from happening 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.000
 they much grass to eat without equal 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.379
 Permanently to move must be ok now 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.140
 it is quite certainly not more 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:31.140

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.080

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.290
 Always fast when kicking in any case 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.519
 Protected for the legs 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.230
 here you are only working 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.750
 check class unauthorized for others 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.180

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.129
 Horse Breed Dwarf is a quarter horse 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.730
 the biggest I think in itself very 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.799
 enjoyable 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.459
 what it is particularly aboard ahaus otherwise 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.549
 the very special is their ancestry 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.660
 is the largest horse breed in the world 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.810
 need about four million 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.489
 then hot ears on the racetrack but 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.099
 We have got her good company 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.810
 excellently suited for the trade fair 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.030
 but you can also go with it 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.950
 other horse breeds western riding one 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.180
 can save every year there is 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.829

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.959
 Let's go slowly with if we want to 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.450
 our borders 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.590
 what does the horse need for 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.019
 Requirements for western riding 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.030
 to be able to join 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.060
 physique the body is definitely coming 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.530
 to go for a ride on things 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.329
 we just go for a walk i believe but ask 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.389
 I've gone but I tell 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.709
 Testing for workouts should be physique 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.480
 accordingly be that still 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.819
 can participate, the area is the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.609
 body is different too and it has to be on everyone 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.440
 yes, even a quiet and 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.930
 Balanced beings have the horse to 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.970
 western riding would be more pleasant 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.829
 more comfortable so a quiet 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.410
 Balanced being in the horse is good 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.730
 otherwise see the equipment 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.150
 saddle and bridle is different 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.069
 already clearly from jumping or dressage 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.480
 saddle and saddle whether the saddle 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.430
 really as comfortable as he is 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.760
 looks like that can be in the next 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.760
 episode
