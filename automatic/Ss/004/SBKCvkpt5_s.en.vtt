00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.730
 so dear friends try to do 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.709
 small video report on the work 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.519
 onboard computer on car 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:18.170
 subaru forester body sg5 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:21.740
 2007 release here it is installed 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:26.060
 instead of regular hours I will say right away that 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.660
 inconvenient to press buttons because 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.369
 It prevents this is now the cover 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.629
 Lazarevskogo glove box and convenience, we have it 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.649
 let's open the installed computer instead 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.640
 full-time 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.960
 hours in size everything fits very 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.999
 fits well into the interior 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.839
 let's see the functions first function this 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:53.589
 date and time function that is now 7 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.579
 November 2013 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.780
 local time 17 to 31 minutes 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:05.480
 the function is switched by regular buttons 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:10.310
 hours so shows the temperature in 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:16.430
 salon sensor I installed here in this 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:19.220
 Rack space and battery charge 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.700
 The battery is very comfortable in nature 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.710
 when you listen to music watch when 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.570
 they need to start a car 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:34.220
 recharge the battery a little 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:39.520
 further common odometer and how much 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.520
 spent fuel for these kilometers 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.650
 that is, I haven't updated it for a long time, but 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.350
 very convenient when you change the oil one 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.320
 pour it and after that period of time 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.280
 when you need to replace the oil 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.490
 very convenient to track the moment so here 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.940
 control how much fuel you poured 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:06.310
 fuel residue in the tank and on which 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:11.200
 the distance we have enough fuel 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.200
 he considers the average fuel consumption 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.500
 so this is our average speed 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:32.940
 movement and average fuel consumption per 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:36.420
 the trip is a tachometer and hourly consumption 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.280
 fuel there is a tachometer it is installed 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.270
 there are several provisions that is 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.220
 choose which will be closer to you and 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:51.060
 this way the instrument is calibrated by pressing 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.570
 on the gas pedal shows what is changing 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.489
 turnover and hourly fuel consumption 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:05.840
 the next function is instant 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:05.840
 speed and instant fuel consumption 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.730
 one more function which now 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.640
 maybe it will be irrelevant 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.470
 cost of travel 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.780
 set the cost of flooded 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.230
 fuel and it will take you as much 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.030
 worth your trip why now she doesn't 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.700
 important because the cost of gasoline 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.570
 here you can set only 20 to 30 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.030
 rubles let's say we cost 36 rubles 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.519
 so I do not know you can in dollars 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.630
 of course install then he will you 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:50.760
 read it right again 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:55.250
 date basically all the functions I give you 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.250
 showed further 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:04.900
 setting here minin me we have a diary 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.900
 I do not remember trips as far as trips 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.030
 but a few extreme trips he 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.160
 shows you can choose you can 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:18.440
 watch yesterday the day before yesterday and so 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.010
 then reset the counters that is it 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.910
 average odometer consumption and so on 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:31.250
 you can set the acceleration time from zero 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:34.450
 up to a hundred kilometers per hour so me 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:43.360
 let's see what we show 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:47.800
 yeah I will change the output so let's continue 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.800
 now he will write about you 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:27.700
 so here we look what he writes about 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:32.740
 see what else he has 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:36.150
 I will still change the exit menu 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:41.290
 let's see what is in the instrument settings 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:45.150
 clock settings and calendar settings 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.710
 tachometer for instrument calibration 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.860
 flow settings in the instructions are very 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:57.400
 well described how it is done on 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:59.080
 building side at the subway can be customized 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.370
 that he gave you a signal when you 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.900
 will exceed the specified speed 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.030
 it is possible that he gave a signal when 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.490
 overrunning for those people who 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.540
 switches by turns while there 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.340
 races or overclocking some tune 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.460
 indicator that can be changed 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.880
 brightness contrast to you 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:28.410
 it is also convenient to read information 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:35.650
 adjust the sound of the signals 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:41.530
 set up a travel cost calculation and so 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:44.770
 further data groups see what 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.620
 This but displays here during 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:54.120
 parking when the engine is muffled during 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.120
 movements can be returned presets 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:08.510
 we will not return well here with us 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:11.740
 I got such a report on the board 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:16.940
 computer on the car subaru forester 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:20.240
 sg5 body if there are any questions 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:26.890
 write me try to answer them 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.890
 thank you for your attention everyone bye
