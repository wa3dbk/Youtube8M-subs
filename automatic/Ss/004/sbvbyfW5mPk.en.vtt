think the way we played today that will
bring<00:01:07.560> massive<00:01:07.799> confidence<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> side<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
bring massive confidence in the side and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.460 
bring massive confidence in the side and
I<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.360> we'll<00:01:09.540> carry<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.049> over<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
I think we'll carry that over into the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.280 
I think we'll carry that over into the
next<00:01:10.560> game<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:12.570> mean
