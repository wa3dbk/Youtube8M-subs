00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.040
 today I would like to talk to you about a 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:32.140
 treatment that is very very old it's 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.150
 what animals do when they are 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.060
 wounded the wild animals the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.200
 boars well to others via lend 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.629
 they are injured 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.100
 they will put themselves in the mud to get 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.309
 fix the simple end and very little this 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.500
 loop we see us as we will say 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.239
 unhealthy with full of fermentation and 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.520
 well this advice of the clay of 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.810
 the green clay the gray clay we will say 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.630
 well this mud can repair and not 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.550
 only she can repair but it's 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.869
 the most extraordinary product the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.520
 cheaper first and the most 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.300
 extraordinary far more than a lot of 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.030
 ointment with very complicated names 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.440
 it is in case of pain in the body 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.950
 on the knee on the elbow in case of 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.190
 various problems 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.040
 it is the ideal care of his official name 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.720
 it's green clay 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.270
 there is the red clay that exist that 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.950
 we use mostly in pottery but 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.289
 green clay of course if you cuise 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.800
 and she's still going to make a mass 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:39.039
 compact but it has properties 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.009
 extraordinary inside the body 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.360
 like outside inside the 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.009
 body it means that it exists 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.530
 powder you find pharmacy 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:52.899
 it exists in fine powder and it is 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.509
 possible to drink it so just 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.490
 put to take a drink to put a 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.799
 teaspoon of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.920
 fine powder m clay half 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.990
 hula to whole with water on 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.110
 turn a little and let it act 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.930
 so little by little the water will settle 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.269
 it takes at least three hours three 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.170
 hours for the radiation 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.970
 radioactive leaves this scene you is 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.519
 so you let yourself do that for the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.260
 morning or and tips at night you 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.590
 do the evening to see the morning even 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.769
 you can do it a day in advance 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.140
 once the water is pure that the whole 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.049
 mud hero fallen in the bottom oh well 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.450
 it's enough to drink it is not more 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.880
 effective to drink back again 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.459
 to trace all the particles in 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.330
 the water for a redo the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:53.080
 trouble the simple to the clear that remains of 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.599
 this fermentation of this time of two 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.519
 presence with the mud and well this 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.500
 rise is charged with the principles 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.470
 essentials that come to help the body 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.989
 it's kind of two ways in the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.690
 body to heal the camp to remove the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.220
 inflammations inside so that's 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.010
 something that we know since 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.200
 millennia 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.079
 it's something that seems a little 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.609
 primary care is by far the most 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.350
 simpler in prevention 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.459
 when we do not know what we have 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.980
 little bit of green clay drink water 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.840
 where there was this green clay 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.840
 it's a kind of drink that we 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.370
 can all take from time to time in 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.569
 Prevention is both a drink 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.880
 but it brings a rebalance of the 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.000
 body she leads to removing the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.200
 internal inflammations if we have 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.139
 rheumatism if you feel pain in 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.819
 the body take green clay a 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.799
 times a day it's not worth it 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.920
 to learn too much just a little bit 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.359
 always always this notion of 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.239
 sobriety even in relation to things 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.940
 very healthy there is a book that was written 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.980
 decades ago by 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.420
 extracted worlds called clay 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.300
 this is the ultimate reference that is 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.800
 current day to drink water eh 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.970
 well that you can do that a cure of 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.040
 15 days for example you take your 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.310
 clay on finn and then there you the 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.530
 put in the water and you drink during 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.620
 fifteen days eight days fifteen days a 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.300
 small cleaning cure 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.690
 flow of your body very simply without 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.090
 risk to conclude when you have a 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.490
 problem at the level of the skin at the level 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.410
 of an articulation at the level of a 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.960
 pain that you do not know what 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.400
 it is and start with clay 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:51.060
 it's already the first 100 approach without 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.669
 external genes without risk and sometimes 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.669
 it's more than enough to act
