00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 but I want to see on the 13th who do you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.330
 gives the air that gold ball because 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.519
 it is clear that the faces of one and the other 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.710
 have changed but today that moment from 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.320
 when you take this gold ball jobs 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.109
 during the president of the fifa that was 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.010
 Christian sitting there at that moment 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.010
 waiting and one thing 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.580
 just like when the ball takes two steps 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.949
 back I'm an agent that could do that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.179
 but he knows what madrid did 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.529
 This year what cristiano ronaldo 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.149
 although there is a big favorite in all 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.770
 bets that shriver and then there is messi 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.430
 but Real Madrid says this year what 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.790
 deser 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790
 cr7 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.449
 if it were for blatter maybe I would not win it 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.280
 I can not I can not win you way I can not 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.199
 kanoute way I what Christian made 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.300
 merits to spare there in the field as 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.789
 repeated in each game in the bernabéu not 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.860
 It lodges no doubt either in 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.050
 england where 84% according to one 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.000
 survey the sky sports supports you and 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.269
 they even have slight shen wenger ahead 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.269
 from messi 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.490
 Christian has had to put face 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.860
 poker these last four years but 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.320
 this year 2013 the ball deserves to be his 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.640
 of the world reasons there are plenty of what 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.560
 first because it is an individual prize 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.479
 first and to get a triplet 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.710
 incredible with the bayern is true the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.479
 star of a team that has won 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.060
 everything but there is sufficient background 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.399
 against him and in 2010 they saw him 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.810
 messi instead of iniesta or xavi that 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.580
 they had won the same titles with the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.289
 Barça and they were also world champions 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.149
 second reason the direct battle to 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.280
 body body here the numbers of 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.610
 Christians are incontestable has marked 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.110
 62 goals in 53 games between Real 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.570
 Madrid and Portugal 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.520
 in less than a third 20 goals in 47 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.350
 parties both play in the same 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.840
 position the two start from the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.430
 left and the numbers sing messi by 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.290
 the injuries seems to be this year a 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.330
 step behind in this war the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.520
 third reason is because of its progression 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.710
 Christian is exceeded year after year takes three 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.470
 consecutive years marking more than 60 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.229
 stratospheric goals if the golden ball 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.090
 awards the best of the Christian year has 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.090
 Reasons to be chosen
