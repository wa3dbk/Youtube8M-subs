check the production tab on the top left
and<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.039> corresponding<00:00:29.699> timing<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.300> the

however<00:00:32.520> timing<00:00:33.059> won't<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.510> too<00:00:34.260> important

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
however timing won't be too important

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.889 
however timing won't be too important
it's<00:00:35.340> gonna<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.700> pretty<00:00:35.940> straight<00:00:36.329> forward<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it's gonna be pretty straight forward in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.729 
it's gonna be pretty straight forward in
this<00:00:37.410> game<00:00:37.559> we're<00:00:38.520> gonna<00:00:38.610> send<00:00:39.030> our<00:00:39.690> SUV<00:00:40.500> at

this game we're gonna send our SUV at

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.670 
this game we're gonna send our SUV at
about<00:00:41.010> nine<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.840> build<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.200> barracks<00:00:43.500> in

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
about nine to go and build a barracks in

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.560 
about nine to go and build a barracks in
fact<00:00:43.950> inside<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.489> his<00:00:44.640> base<00:00:44.850> where<00:00:45.149> he<00:00:45.300> can't

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
fact inside of his base where he can't

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.000 
fact inside of his base where he can't
spot<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.610> our<00:00:47.719> next<00:00:48.719> barracks<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.710> up

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
spot it and our next barracks will go up

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.319 
spot it and our next barracks will go up
at<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.969> end<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.300> our<00:00:51.449> ramp<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:52.110> about<00:00:52.829> Oh

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
at the end of our ramp at about Oh

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.930 
at the end of our ramp at about Oh
following<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.800> fifteen<00:00:56.430> supply

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
following that or about fifteen supply

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.080 
following that or about fifteen supply
now<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:58.440> supply<00:00:58.800> depot<00:00:59.160> will<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.730> go<00:00:59.910> up

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
now our supply depot will actually go up

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
now our supply depot will actually go up
at<00:01:00.329> normal<00:01:00.750> timing<00:01:01.170> because<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.859> obviously

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
at normal timing because we obviously

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.440 
at normal timing because we obviously
want<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.879> able<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.390> make<00:01:03.930> more<00:01:04.170> suvs<00:01:05.450> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
want to be able to make more suvs you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.969 
want to be able to make more suvs you
can<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.140> are<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.650> building

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
can see that we are going to be building

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.490 
can see that we are going to be building
a<00:01:08.070> tower<00:01:08.220> ramp<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.119> isn't<00:01:09.479> quite<00:01:09.750> normal

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
a tower ramp now this isn't quite normal

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.310 
a tower ramp now this isn't quite normal
in<00:01:10.740> terran<00:01:11.130> vs<00:01:11.460> terran<00:01:11.760> however<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.960> want<00:01:13.170> our

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
in terran vs terran however we want our

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.530 
in terran vs terran however we want our
barracks<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> ramp<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:14.970> close<00:01:15.299> as

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
barracks at the ramp so that as close as

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.530 
barracks at the ramp so that as close as
possible<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.770> our<00:01:17.100> Marines<00:01:17.549> will<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
possible so that our Marines will have a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140 
possible so that our Marines will have a
shorter<00:01:18.960> distance<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.580> our<00:01:20.610> opponents

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
shorter distance to get to our opponents

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.120 
shorter distance to get to our opponents
base<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> therefore<00:01:21.960> we'll<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.830> able<00:01:22.979> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
base and therefore we'll be able to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
base and therefore we'll be able to
reach<00:01:23.430> his<00:01:23.640> base<00:01:23.880> more<00:01:24.509> quickly<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.990> see

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
reach his base more quickly you can see

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
reach his base more quickly you can see
that<00:01:28.409> we're<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.740> gonna<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.159> waiting<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.700> our

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that we're just gonna be waiting for our

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.580 
that we're just gonna be waiting for our
supply<00:01:30.060> depot<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> finish<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.930> then<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.380> will

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
supply depot to finish and then we will

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.640 
supply depot to finish and then we will
be<00:01:34.970> throwing<00:01:35.970> down<00:01:36.180> our<00:01:36.509> barracks<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.380> about

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
be throwing down our barracks at about

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.880 
be throwing down our barracks at about
this<00:01:37.860> time<00:01:38.299> inside<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.450> its<00:01:39.570> base<00:01:39.890> now

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
this time inside of its base now

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560 
this time inside of its base now
following<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.579> want<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> continue

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
following this we want to continue

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.410 
following this we want to continue
pumping<00:01:42.960> suvs<00:01:43.820> because<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:44.939> still<00:01:45.180> need<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
pumping suvs because we still need a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120 
pumping suvs because we still need a
decent<00:01:45.930> economy<00:01:46.170> even<00:01:46.619> though<00:01:46.710> we're<00:01:46.979> gonna

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
decent economy even though we're gonna

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.530 
decent economy even though we're gonna
be<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:49.110> very<00:01:49.680> early<00:01:50.280> aggression<00:01:53.540> now

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
be going for a very early aggression now

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450 
be going for a very early aggression now
the<00:01:54.960> reason<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.470> call<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.979> very<00:01:56.189> early

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the reason we call this a very early

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.149 
the reason we call this a very early
aggression<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.689> because<00:01:58.110> even<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.799> does

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
aggression is because even if this does

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.200 
aggression is because even if this does
fail<00:01:59.579> we<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.659> potentially<00:02:01.020> hurt<00:02:01.799> our

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
fail we can potentially hurt our

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.560 
fail we can potentially hurt our
opponent's<00:02:03.210> economy<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:04.700> macro<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.270> bad<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
opponent's economy or macro so bad that

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.680 
opponent's economy or macro so bad that
we<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.350> still<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.099> game<00:02:08.390> now

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
we can still be in this game now

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.120 
we can still be in this game now
it's<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.950> our<00:02:11.280> opponent<00:02:11.550> does<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.150> fact<00:02:12.330> spot

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
it's if our opponent does in fact spot

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.250 
it's if our opponent does in fact spot
we<00:02:13.640> are<00:02:13.880> inside<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.360> his<00:02:14.540> base<00:02:14.810> which<00:02:15.080> isn't

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
we are inside of his base which isn't

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.610 
we are inside of his base which isn't
uncommon<00:02:15.890> especially<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:17.150> higher<00:02:17.870> level<00:02:18.350> play

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
uncommon especially on higher level play

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.160 
uncommon especially on higher level play
in<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.370> Master<00:02:19.760> League<00:02:19.940> for<00:02:20.210> example<00:02:20.690> it's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
in the Master League for example it's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.050 
in the Master League for example it's
not<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.380> big<00:02:21.590> deal<00:02:21.770> we'll<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:22.400> lift<00:02:22.610> off<00:02:22.790> our

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
not a big deal we'll just lift off our

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.210 
not a big deal we'll just lift off our
barracks<00:02:23.570> after<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:24.050> finish<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.010> we're

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
barracks after we finish it and we're

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.970 
barracks after we finish it and we're
gonna<00:02:25.370> place<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.700> somewhere<00:02:26.210> a<00:02:26.840> little<00:02:27.830> more

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
gonna place it somewhere a little more

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.270 
gonna place it somewhere a little more
convenient<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:30.470> see<00:02:30.650> we're<00:02:30.830> actually<00:02:30.980> just

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
convenient to see we're actually just

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.370 
convenient to see we're actually just
gonna<00:02:31.370> place<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.760> right<00:02:32.090> at<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.840> bottom<00:02:33.200> of

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
gonna place it right at the bottom of

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.750 
gonna place it right at the bottom of
his<00:02:34.190> base<00:02:35.080> now<00:02:36.080> something<00:02:36.620> important<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.580> go

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
his base now something important to go

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.810 
his base now something important to go
over<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:38.830> really<00:02:39.830> type<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.460> play<00:02:40.640> like

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
over is that really type of play like

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.330 
over is that really type of play like
this<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.360> gonna<00:02:41.720> be<00:02:41.930> most<00:02:42.200> effective<00:02:42.740> on<00:02:42.980> small

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
this is gonna be most effective on small

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.000 
this is gonna be most effective on small
maps<00:02:43.610> especially<00:02:44.060> like<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:45.050> steps<00:02:45.830> of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
maps especially like this one steps of

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.370 
maps especially like this one steps of
war<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.030> because<00:02:47.540> we're<00:02:47.840> gonna<00:02:47.990> get<00:02:48.200> our

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
war this is because we're gonna get our

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.960 
war this is because we're gonna get our
reinforcements<00:02:49.190> from<00:02:49.280> our<00:02:49.490> base<00:02:49.700> more

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
reinforcements from our base more

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.360 
reinforcements from our base more
quickly<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.900> we're<00:02:51.410> gonna<00:02:51.500> be<00:02:51.710> able<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.040> send

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
quickly and we're gonna be able to send

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.340 
quickly and we're gonna be able to send
our<00:02:52.610> drone<00:02:53.120> over<00:02:53.810> there<00:02:53.960> more<00:02:54.140> quickly

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
our drone over there more quickly

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.140 
our drone over there more quickly
because<00:02:54.710> he's<00:02:55.070> going<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.430> able<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.790> reach

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
because he's going to be able to reach

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.910 
because he's going to be able to reach
there<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:57.500> shorter<00:02:57.950> time<00:02:59.380> however<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.770> you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
there in a shorter time however if you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.860 
there in a shorter time however if you
want<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.220> do<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.430> on<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.550> longer<00:03:02.000> map<00:03:02.180> such<00:03:02.720> as

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
want to do it on a longer map such as

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.510 
want to do it on a longer map such as
Xel'Naga<00:03:03.290> cabins<00:03:03.890> you're<00:03:04.070> probably<00:03:04.280> gonna

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
Xel'Naga cabins you're probably gonna

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.940 
Xel'Naga cabins you're probably gonna
have<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.850> send<00:03:05.060> your<00:03:05.180> first<00:03:05.390> SUV<00:03:05.660> more<00:03:06.650> quickly

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
have to send your first SUV more quickly

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.910 
have to send your first SUV more quickly
and<00:03:07.370> try<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.420> compensate<00:03:09.080> for<00:03:09.230> other<00:03:09.350> timings

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
and try to compensate for other timings

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.190 
and try to compensate for other timings
now<00:03:10.100> we<00:03:10.550> want<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.880> try<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.120> get<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.360> bunker<00:03:12.050> up

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
now we want to try to get a bunker up

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.800 
now we want to try to get a bunker up
very<00:03:12.620> quickly<00:03:12.950> however<00:03:13.520> if<00:03:13.670> we<00:03:13.850> can't<00:03:14.480> it's

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
very quickly however if we can't it's

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.230 
very quickly however if we can't it's
not<00:03:14.990> that<00:03:15.170> big<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.530> deal<00:03:15.760> we'll<00:03:16.760> bring<00:03:16.970> more

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
not that big of a deal we'll bring more

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.170 
not that big of a deal we'll bring more
suvs<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:18.890> case<00:03:19.520> we're<00:03:19.730> bringing<00:03:20.000> three

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
suvs in this case we're bringing three

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
you could being four and we're just

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.620 
you could being four and we're just
gonna<00:03:24.050> try<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.470> push<00:03:25.460> into<00:03:25.730> his<00:03:25.910> base<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.420> get

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
gonna try to push into his base and get

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.190 
gonna try to push into his base and get
a<00:03:26.660> bunker<00:03:27.230> or<00:03:27.410> two<00:03:27.650> up<00:03:27.890> now<00:03:28.580> SUVs<00:03:29.060> do<00:03:29.390> do<00:03:29.690> decent

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
a bunker or two up now SUVs do do decent

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.110 
a bunker or two up now SUVs do do decent
damage<00:03:30.410> against<00:03:30.950> Marines<00:03:31.370> as<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:31.760> can<00:03:31.910> see

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
damage against Marines as you can see

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.840 
damage against Marines as you can see
here<00:03:32.480> with<00:03:33.260> our<00:03:33.440> three<00:03:33.680> SUVs<00:03:33.830> we<00:03:34.400> are<00:03:34.550> able<00:03:34.820> to

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
here with our three SUVs we are able to

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.830 
here with our three SUVs we are able to
take<00:03:35.210> out<00:03:35.390> two<00:03:35.690> Marines<00:03:36.080> quite<00:03:36.530> easily<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.840> we

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
take out two Marines quite easily and we

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.900 
take out two Marines quite easily and we
have<00:03:39.020> been<00:03:39.170> pumping<00:03:39.560> from<00:03:39.860> both<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.580> barracks

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
have been pumping from both the barracks

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.260 
have been pumping from both the barracks
and<00:03:41.090> our<00:03:41.240> main<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:42.770> barracks<00:03:43.190> at<00:03:43.580> his

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
and our main and the barracks at his

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.850 
and our main and the barracks at his
base<00:03:44.590> all<00:03:45.590> game<00:03:46.100> now<00:03:46.580> we<00:03:47.540> will<00:03:47.750> have<00:03:47.930> probably

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
base all game now we will have probably

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.180 
base all game now we will have probably
a<00:03:48.980> little<00:03:49.340> bit<00:03:49.640> of<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:50.750> surplus<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.740> minerals

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
a little bit of a surplus and minerals

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.160 
a little bit of a surplus and minerals
so<00:03:52.430> it's<00:03:52.610> not<00:03:52.820> a<00:03:52.850> bad<00:03:53.090> idea<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.750> throw<00:03:53.990> down

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
so it's not a bad idea to throw down

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.840 
so it's not a bad idea to throw down
another<00:03:55.160> barracks<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:56.270> be<00:03:56.390> able<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:57.380> produce

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
another barracks to be able to produce

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.360 
another barracks to be able to produce
more<00:03:58.850> marines<00:03:59.690> now<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:00.530> can<00:04:00.710> see<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:01.130> in

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
more marines now you can see that in

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.520 
more marines now you can see that in
this<00:04:01.730> time<00:04:02.060> we<00:04:02.240> still<00:04:02.480> have<00:04:02.750> been<00:04:02.960> producing

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
this time we still have been producing

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.970 
this time we still have been producing
harvesters<00:04:04.130> and<00:04:04.600> this<00:04:05.600> also<00:04:05.840> goes<00:04:06.170> along<00:04:06.350> with

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
harvesters and this also goes along with

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.460 
harvesters and this also goes along with
the<00:04:07.190> idea<00:04:07.520> that<00:04:07.730> even<00:04:08.030> if<00:04:08.270> we<00:04:08.420> do<00:04:08.720> fail<00:04:09.110> and

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
the idea that even if we do fail and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.070 
the idea that even if we do fail and
ending<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.370> game<00:04:10.520> here<00:04:11.120> we<00:04:11.600> still<00:04:11.870> will<00:04:12.050> have

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
ending the game here we still will have

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.890 
ending the game here we still will have
a<00:04:12.260> better<00:04:12.560> economy<00:04:13.010> than<00:04:13.880> our<00:04:14.030> opponent<00:04:14.390> or<00:04:14.780> at

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
a better economy than our opponent or at

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.349 
a better economy than our opponent or at
least<00:04:15.080> that<00:04:15.290> is<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.560> hope<00:04:15.830> that<00:04:16.130> is<00:04:16.760> if<00:04:17.150> we

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
least that is the hope that is if we

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.900 
least that is the hope that is if we
don't<00:04:17.540> finish<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.960> game<00:04:18.140> here<00:04:18.730> now<00:04:19.730> we're

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
don't finish the game here now we're

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.080 
don't finish the game here now we're
just<00:04:20.030> gonna<00:04:20.150> be<00:04:20.390> moving<00:04:20.750> forward<00:04:21.350> slightly

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
just gonna be moving forward slightly

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.540 
just gonna be moving forward slightly
building<00:04:23.870> bunkers<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:24.949> looks<00:04:25.130> like<00:04:25.310> he's

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
building bunkers and it looks like he's

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.330 
building bunkers and it looks like he's
going<00:04:25.850> to<00:04:26.030> go<00:04:26.750> after<00:04:27.020> our<00:04:27.199> SUVs<00:04:27.680> however<00:04:28.100> we

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
going to go after our SUVs however we

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.000 
going to go after our SUVs however we
are<00:04:28.669> able<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.720> kill<00:04:29.990> off<00:04:30.139> all<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.500> his<00:04:30.590> Marines

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
are able to kill off all of his Marines

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.360 
are able to kill off all of his Marines
with<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.699> little<00:04:31.940> push<00:04:32.440> now<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:34.010> is<00:04:34.190> one<00:04:34.340> of

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
with that little push now this is one of

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.400 
with that little push now this is one of
the<00:04:34.520> reasons<00:04:34.970> why<00:04:35.150> we<00:04:35.360> do<00:04:35.690> really<00:04:35.990> want<00:04:36.199> a

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
the reasons why we do really want a

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.280 
the reasons why we do really want a
bunker<00:04:36.830> up<00:04:36.979> so<00:04:37.790> that<00:04:38.000> if<00:04:38.419> he<00:04:38.660> tries<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.110> bring

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
bunker up so that if he tries to bring

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.920 
bunker up so that if he tries to bring
SUVs<00:04:39.889> off<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.250> line<00:04:40.400> we<00:04:40.580> can<00:04:40.729> easily<00:04:41.000> go<00:04:41.750> back

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
SUVs off the line we can easily go back

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.330 
SUVs off the line we can easily go back
to<00:04:42.080> our<00:04:42.199> bunker<00:04:42.530> for<00:04:42.740> safety

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
to our bunker for safety

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.750 
to our bunker for safety
now<00:04:44.120> we're<00:04:44.330> gonna<00:04:44.449> be<00:04:44.630> inching<00:04:45.110> up<00:04:45.310> slowly<00:04:46.310> but

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
now we're gonna be inching up slowly but

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.750 
now we're gonna be inching up slowly but
surely<00:04:46.790> we're<00:04:47.570> gonna<00:04:47.690> be<00:04:47.900> planting<00:04:48.440> down

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
surely we're gonna be planting down

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.700 
surely we're gonna be planting down
another<00:04:49.760> bunker<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.210> is<00:04:50.449> still<00:04:51.020> about<00:04:51.500> in

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
another bunker that is still about in

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.230 
another bunker that is still about in
the<00:04:51.830> range<00:04:52.040> of<00:04:52.190> our<00:04:52.340> other<00:04:52.520> bunkers<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.000> that

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
the range of our other bunkers so that

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.640 
the range of our other bunkers so that
we<00:04:53.360> can<00:04:53.510> still<00:04:53.720> go<00:04:53.870> back<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.260> for<00:04:54.290> safety

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
we can still go back to it for safety

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.159 
we can still go back to it for safety
however<00:04:55.490> at<00:04:55.580> this<00:04:55.700> point<00:04:55.820> it<00:04:56.600> looks<00:04:56.780> like<00:04:56.960> our

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
however at this point it looks like our

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.890 
however at this point it looks like our
opponent<00:04:57.800> has<00:04:58.210> definitely<00:04:59.210> lost<00:04:59.419> any<00:04:59.660> type<00:04:59.870> of

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
opponent has definitely lost any type of

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.340 
opponent has definitely lost any type of
defense<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.590> he<00:05:01.490> can<00:05:01.729> use<00:05:02.270> to<00:05:02.630> fund<00:05:02.960> this<00:05:03.080> off

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
defense that he can use to fund this off

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.800 
defense that he can use to fund this off
and<00:05:04.010> we<00:05:04.220> even<00:05:04.430> get<00:05:04.669> a<00:05:04.700> little<00:05:04.790> bit<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.300> Rage<00:05:05.540> you

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810

and we even get a little bit of Rage you
know<00:05:05.960> you've<00:05:06.139> done<00:05:06.200> a<00:05:06.350> good<00:05:06.530> job<00:05:06.590> when<00:05:07.400> you<00:05:07.490> get

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669
