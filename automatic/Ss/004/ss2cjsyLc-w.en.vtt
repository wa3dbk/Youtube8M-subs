00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.869
 Hello everyone and welcome to our 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.279
 video guide this video is a fragment of 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.500
 the third part of our video guide 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.840
 on Chapter 7 which let them 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.220
 leave in the description of this video and 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.110
 good in this video we are going to show you 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.869
 how to get 20,000 points 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.520
 needed against made them saurians with 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.719
 this battle we need to have ready the 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.719
 heroic battle mission 3 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.870
 in the third part of the bio guide you 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.000
 I showed two children who have a garden and 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.489
 beast besides x this battle without him 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.230
 he made rest placid for this 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.210
 fragment of video we are showing you 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.220
 the use of ready boosted rest 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.230
 placid in campsites in this way is 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.239
 sure that yes or yes they can get more than 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.160
 20,000 points and as already seen in the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.780
 full video is not really hard 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.820
 it's just a matter of not letting you 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.559
 eliminate the characters and finish with 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.339
 the two alive preferably that both 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.339
 have a lot of life 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.550
 here 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.430
 here the most dangerous is the predator 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.820
 alpha so we will have to eliminate what 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.820
 First 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 everyone 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.109
 here play with skills this 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.270
 battle especially because we can not 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.280
 to leave a dinosaur alone alive but 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.610
 call for reinforcements and we will 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.320
 complicate the battle quite 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 for that reason with his last lizard he 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.020
 be alone there is no mistake as soon as 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.020
 possible 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.230
 and everyone 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.209
 and how I come with many scores without 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.090
 complications and complete the vast and 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.530
 heroic to show our homework with 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.530
 this we have known a point of command
