 Javier Pizzolito and his bike come with a 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:37.600
 Go dizzy device at the time 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.600
 how strenuous we arrived as very low 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.950
 temperature up now we lower the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.209
 forty-something degree really does not
