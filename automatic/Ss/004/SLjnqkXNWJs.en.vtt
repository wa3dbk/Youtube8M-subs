00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
from that from that pizza place

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.610 
from that from that pizza place
we've<00:04:59.909> tried<00:05:00.180> loading<00:05:00.629> it<00:05:00.749> up<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.289> that<00:05:01.319> can

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
we've tried loading it up so that can

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.010 
we've tried loading it up so that can
barely<00:05:01.949> move<00:05:02.069> with<00:05:02.309> too<00:05:02.460> much<00:05:02.580> weight<00:05:02.819> and<00:05:03.180> it

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
barely move with too much weight and it

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.189 
barely move with too much weight and it
still<00:05:04.319> goes<00:05:08.389> so<00:05:09.389> now<00:05:09.539> we're<00:05:09.719> gonna<00:05:09.839> chuck<00:05:10.169> it

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
still goes so now we're gonna chuck it

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.920 
still goes so now we're gonna chuck it
off<00:05:10.379> a<00:05:10.409> building<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.330> see<00:05:12.330> if<00:05:12.389> it<00:05:12.539> goes<00:05:12.689> after

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
off a building and see if it goes after

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.249 
off a building and see if it goes after
that<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:13.949> bike<00:05:14.219> is<00:05:14.399> gonna<00:05:14.580> fall<00:05:14.909> 22<00:05:15.689> meters<00:05:16.080> to

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
that the bike is gonna fall 22 meters to

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.540 
that the bike is gonna fall 22 meters to
the<00:05:16.289> ground<00:05:16.789> surely<00:05:17.789> that<00:05:17.999> should<00:05:18.029> kill<00:05:18.569> it

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
the ground surely that should kill it

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:32.779 
the ground surely that should kill it
here<00:05:20.550> we<00:05:20.639> go<00:05:30.919> that<00:05:31.919> looks<00:05:32.069> all<00:05:32.249> right<00:05:32.279> actually

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
here we go that looks all right actually

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.059 
here we go that looks all right actually
though<00:05:33.629> the<00:05:33.749> wheels<00:05:33.930> are<00:05:34.080> dented<00:05:34.439> but<00:05:34.710> but<00:05:34.979> it

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
though the wheels are dented but but it

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.089 
though the wheels are dented but but it
looks<00:05:35.219> all<00:05:35.370> right<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:37.169> bike<00:05:37.409> was<00:05:37.709> traveling

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
looks all right the bike was traveling

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.889 
looks all right the bike was traveling
at<00:05:38.189> 54<00:05:38.849> miles<00:05:39.060> an<00:05:39.270> hour<00:05:39.389> when<00:05:39.629> it<00:05:39.719> hit<00:05:39.870> the

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:39.899 
at 54 miles an hour when it hit the

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:42.320 
at 54 miles an hour when it hit the
ground<00:05:40.020> there's<00:05:41.009> surely<00:05:41.279> no<00:05:41.699> way<00:05:41.969> it<00:05:42.149> can

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
ground there's surely no way it can

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:51.800 
ground there's surely no way it can
still<00:05:42.629> work<00:05:49.279> see<00:05:50.279> if<00:05:50.339> we<00:05:50.459> can<00:05:50.639> get<00:05:51.209> it<00:05:51.330> moving

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
still work see if we can get it moving

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.519 
still work see if we can get it moving
I<00:05:52.159> think<00:05:53.159> it's<00:05:53.279> buggered<00:05:53.639> really<00:05:54.529> anyway

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
I think it's buggered really anyway

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.079 
I think it's buggered really anyway
we'll<00:05:55.770> see<00:05:55.800> let's<00:05:56.129> just<00:05:56.370> get<00:05:56.459> it<00:05:56.580> starts<00:05:56.879> if<00:05:57.029> we

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.089 
we'll see let's just get it starts if we

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:05.829 
we'll see let's just get it starts if we
can<00:05:57.209> start<00:05:57.449> it<00:05:57.709> see<00:05:58.709> what<00:05:58.860> happens<00:05:59.219> there<00:05:59.509> okay

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:05.839 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:29.070 

see<00:06:06.839> the<00:06:07.110> indicator

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.630 

well<00:06:30.080> it's<00:06:30.740> still<00:06:31.040> going

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
well it's still going

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.190 
well it's still going
ish<00:06:32.440> these<00:06:33.440> two<00:06:33.560> went<00:06:33.740> forward<00:06:34.220> and<00:06:35.200> so

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
ish these two went forward and so

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.800 
ish these two went forward and so
effectively<00:06:36.710> the<00:06:36.920> bike<00:06:37.070> is<00:06:37.250> one<00:06:37.490> and<00:06:37.750> they<00:06:38.750> are

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
effectively the bike is one and they are
