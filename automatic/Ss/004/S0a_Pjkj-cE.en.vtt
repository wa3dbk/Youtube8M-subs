tried to do is to find an existing town
where<00:00:33.530> we<00:00:33.650> could<00:00:33.860> use<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.040> sort<00:00:34.400> of<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.550> skeleton

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
where we could use a sort of a skeleton

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.820 
where we could use a sort of a skeleton
and<00:00:35.300> kind<00:00:35.480> of<00:00:35.540> transform<00:00:36.110> that<00:00:36.290> into<00:00:36.500> what<00:00:36.710> you

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
and kind of transform that into what you

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.430 
and kind of transform that into what you
see<00:00:36.860> here<00:00:37.220> today<00:00:37.720> we<00:00:38.720> were<00:00:38.870> looking<00:00:39.200> for<00:00:39.410> a

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
see here today we were looking for a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.160 
see here today we were looking for a
location<00:00:39.830> that<00:00:40.100> was<00:00:40.280> a<00:00:40.520> town<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:41.510> might<00:00:41.960> need

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
location that was a town that might need

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.140 
location that was a town that might need
a<00:00:42.230> little<00:00:42.440> financial<00:00:42.770> assistance<00:00:43.580> and<00:00:43.760> might

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
a little financial assistance and might

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.210 
a little financial assistance and might
also<00:00:44.420> have<00:00:44.809> some<00:00:44.989> missing<00:00:45.470> buildings<00:00:45.950> in<00:00:46.100> it

also have some missing buildings in it
so<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.550> we<00:00:46.730> could<00:00:46.940> build<00:00:47.150> in<00:00:47.570> ruined

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
so that we could build in ruined

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.890 
so that we could build in ruined
structures<00:00:48.890> we're<00:00:49.879> taking<00:00:50.420> existing

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
structures we're taking existing

the photographs and converting them into
construction<00:01:01.640> documents<00:01:02.409> we<00:01:03.409> build<00:01:03.830> it<00:01:03.980> up

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
construction documents we build it up

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.090 
construction documents we build it up
redesign<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.449> then<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:05.930> blow<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.320> out<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:06.650> then
