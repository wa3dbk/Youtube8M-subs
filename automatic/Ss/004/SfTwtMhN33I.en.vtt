00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.020
 -Blissa, where are you, kitten? 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.740
 Come play with you. 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.840
 My cat, my cat, my cat, come on, kitty, come on. 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.860
 Is that your ass? Why are you hiding? 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.040
 Are you thirsty, kitty? 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.640
 You don't come from him? 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.000
 Here, have some water. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.140
 Oh, you're not drinking. 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.740
 So you're not thirsty. 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 - If it's not the water you want, 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.520
 I know what your pleasure fulfills. 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.960
 Al Blissa, you're normally forbidden to eat cake 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.220
 But now let me eat this cake for your joy. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.460
 I'm sure you can't say no. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.700
 Oh, Blissa, you don't eat pie! 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.200
 - What's the problem, Blissa? 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.780
 You're not drinking water, you're not eating. 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 Maybe your problem is playing games. 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.660
 Don't you want to chase your yellow ball? Come play. 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.920
 -Of Blissa isn't cooking, not water, not game. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.200
 What is happening to you? 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.280
 There is something weird about this matter. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.720
 I'd better take you to the vet. 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.500
 The vet will examine you and if you're sick, he'il know. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.400
 I hope you don't have a serious disease, Blissa. 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.880
 Let's go right now. Let's not waste time. 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 - Sit behind the engine, you kitty. 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.720
 Don't worry, we'il be at the vet soon. 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.480
 and if there is a problem 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.880
 Hold on, Blissa, we're out of the way. 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.900
 How beautiful you are. 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.180
 I know you like to ride, puss. 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.820
 -Yeah, the next patient can come in, please. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.660
 - Hi, Doctor Lady, we're here. 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.020
 -What a sweet cat this is, what's his name? 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.060
 -Mr. Blissa, I think he's sick. 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.460
 - What's wrong with Bulissa? 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.480
 -I do not know that. Today, he has never eaten, he is not drinking, he is not playing. 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.760
 I gave her the cake she loved, didn't even want to eat her. 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.680
 I came to you because I suspected you were sick. 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.020
 -Yeah, you did very well. 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.300
 Now, let's put him on the examination table. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.700
 And I'll have a nice examination. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 So let's start. 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.600
 Don't be afraid, dear Blissa. 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.460
 I won't hurt you. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.540
 I'm just listening to your internal organs. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.380
 - It's all right, according to your first visit. 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.500
 There seems to be no problems. 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.500
 Now let's measure his weight. Let's see if he's weak. 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.520
 -OK. 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.200
 - It's good, Blissa. Looks like you're eating well. 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.400
 Until now, I can easily say that I have not seen any signs of disease. 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.780
 -Well, everything seems to be fine, why didn't this little kitten stop? 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.200
 Then what is the problem? I don't understand, actually. 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.260
 The game doesn't even play. What's with this animal? 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.340
 What do you think, Lady Doctor? 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.180
 Do you have a guess, please, is that bad? 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.440
 - Don't worry about it. Looking at the x-ray, we know what happened. 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.580
 Oh, well, the problem is clear! 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.180
 Look, he swallowed a whole fish without chewing! 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.020
 However, a little tiny biting his own food, should eat. 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.060
 Such a large fish has obviously disturbed his stomach. 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.360
 - Oh, my God, it's my fault. 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.500
 I must have left the closet open. 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.540
 The cat is sick because of me. 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.740
 -Please don't cry. Now I give him a drug, and he'il recover. 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.680
 There's nothing to worry about. 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.980
 -Thanks. 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.740
 - Drink your medicine, sweet kitty. 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.940
 This drug will bring you to it. 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.400
 After your stomach relaxes, your pleasure will come. 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.380
 Finish the drug, well done. 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.740
 You're such a good cat. 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.580
 -Miyaaav, miyaaav. 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.020
 -He's feeling better now, look. 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.580
 You don't have to worry anymore. 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.660
 After that it will heal quickly and it will be the same as before. 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.980
 -Oh, I'm so glad. You scared me, Blissa, but luckily you're okay now. 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.120
 Let's get back to our house and get some rest. 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.020
 Then we'll play nice together, beautiful.
