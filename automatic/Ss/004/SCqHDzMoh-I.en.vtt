00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.690 

what<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.200> up<00:00:04.350> guys<00:00:04.380> wear<00:00:04.980> khakis<00:00:05.339> here<00:00:05.520> and

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
what is up guys wear khakis here and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.290 
what is up guys wear khakis here and
this<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.270> EV<00:00:06.720> 88<00:00:07.080> shotgun<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.300> titanfall

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
this is the EV 88 shotgun in titanfall

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.650 
this is the EV 88 shotgun in titanfall
so<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.860> gun<00:00:11.160> if<00:00:11.340> your<00:00:11.550> generation<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.420> you're

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
so this gun if your generation to you're

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.299 
so this gun if your generation to you're
probably<00:00:12.900> familiar<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.740> because<00:00:13.889> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
probably familiar with it because to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.060 
probably familiar with it because to
become<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> generation<00:00:15.210> 30<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> go<00:00:16.680> from<00:00:16.830> two

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
become a generation 30 so to go from two

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.480 
become a generation 30 so to go from two
to<00:00:17.160> three<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.300> get<00:00:18.420> 75<00:00:19.350> pilot<00:00:20.250> kills

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
to three you have to get 75 pilot kills

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.070 
to three you have to get 75 pilot kills
with<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.029> gun<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> believe<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.750> part<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:21.990> your

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
with this gun I believe as part of your

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
with this gun I believe as part of your
generation<00:00:22.470> challenge<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.760> if<00:00:23.880> you're<00:00:24.029> not

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
generation challenge but if you're not

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.429 
generation challenge but if you're not
perceived<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.720> probably<00:00:25.019> haven't<00:00:25.230> been

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
perceived you probably haven't been

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.109 
perceived you probably haven't been
using<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> shotgun<00:00:26.250> too<00:00:26.369> much<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:26.970> if

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
using the shotgun too much and then if

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.269 
using the shotgun too much and then if
your<00:00:27.269> mid<00:00:27.630> doing<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.109> challenge<00:00:28.410> you're

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
your mid doing this challenge you're

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.529 
your mid doing this challenge you're
probably<00:00:29.490> also<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:30.029> starting<00:00:30.269> out<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
probably also just starting out with a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.410 
probably also just starting out with a
shotgun<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.070> evo<00:00:32.369> 8<00:00:32.610> shotgun<00:00:33.090> let's<00:00:33.270> go

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
shotgun so the evo 8 shotgun let's go

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.900 
shotgun so the evo 8 shotgun let's go
over<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> stats<00:00:33.930> first<00:00:34.290> first<00:00:34.680> damage<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
over the stats first first damage the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.400 
over the stats first first damage the
damage<00:00:36.329> potential<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> maximum<00:00:37.230> damage

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
damage potential the maximum damage

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.389 
damage potential the maximum damage
potential<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.489> gun<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.379> 285<00:00:40.399> meaning

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
potential of this gun is 285 meaning

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.790 
potential of this gun is 285 meaning
that<00:00:41.550> you're<00:00:41.760> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.469> one-shot<00:00:43.469> kill

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that you're going to get a one-shot kill

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
that you're going to get a one-shot kill
on<00:00:44.070> other<00:00:44.280> pilots<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.570> five<00:00:45.930> point<00:00:46.350> one

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
on other pilots out to five point one

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.650 
on other pilots out to five point one
four<00:00:46.890> meters<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.520> essentially<00:00:48.000> five<00:00:48.239> meters

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
four meters so essentially five meters

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.740 
four meters so essentially five meters
now<00:00:49.410> after<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> slow<00:00:50.850> down<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
now after that is going to slow down to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.310 
now after that is going to slow down to
a<00:00:51.780> minimum<00:00:52.110> damage<00:00:52.410> potential<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.629> 28<00:00:54.629> now

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a minimum damage potential of 28 now

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.130 
a minimum damage potential of 28 now
it's<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.800> doing<00:00:55.890> 28<00:00:56.579> damage<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it's going to be doing 28 damage and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.639 
it's going to be doing 28 damage and
this<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:59.960> 16.1<00:01:00.960> 9<00:01:01.260> meters

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
this is going to be from 16.1 9 meters

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.759 
this is going to be from 16.1 9 meters
so<00:01:01.800> basically<00:01:02.190> 16.2<00:01:03.059> meters<00:01:03.470> onwards<00:01:04.470> until

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so basically 16.2 meters onwards until

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
so basically 16.2 meters onwards until
the<00:01:05.610> end<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> time<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.210> actually<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:07.170> gonna

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the end of time so actually is not gonna

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
the end of time so actually is not gonna
it<00:01:07.830> actually<00:01:08.640> drop<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.150> fully<00:01:09.540> you're

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it actually drop off fully you're

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.880 
it actually drop off fully you're
actually<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.380> able<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.740> hit

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
actually going to be able to get hit

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.700 
actually going to be able to get hit
marcus<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.610> gun<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:12.540> across<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> map

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
marcus with this gun from across the map

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.270 
marcus with this gun from across the map
now<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.150> being<00:01:15.390> said<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.320> pretty<00:01:17.040> much

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
now this being said it's pretty much

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.490 
now this being said it's pretty much
going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.759> closed<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.630> nothing<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.380> it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
going to be closed or nothing when it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.170 
going to be closed or nothing when it
comes<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.950> pilots<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> definitely

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
comes to pilots you definitely

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.450 
comes to pilots you definitely
definitely<00:01:21.689> want<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> be<00:01:22.439> within<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.979> 60

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
definitely want to be within that 60

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
definitely want to be within that 60
meters<00:01:23.729> probably<00:01:24.509> actually<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.200> 10<00:01:25.439> meters

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
meters probably actually up to 10 meters

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.399 
meters probably actually up to 10 meters
when<00:01:26.310> engaging<00:01:26.640> other<00:01:26.939> pilots<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.170> are

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
when engaging other pilots now you are

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.780 
when engaging other pilots now you are
going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.770> having<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> advantage<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
going to be having the advantage of this

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.539 
going to be having the advantage of this
being<00:01:30.030> semi<00:01:30.479> automatic<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.590> even<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.189> said

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
being semi automatic but even that said

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.780 
being semi automatic but even that said
it<00:01:32.939> only<00:01:33.150> has<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.930> hundred<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.320> three<00:01:34.920> rounds

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
it only has one hundred and three rounds

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.179 
it only has one hundred and three rounds
per<00:01:35.939> minute<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.780> actually<00:01:37.229> are<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.979> going

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
per minute so you actually are not going

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
per minute so you actually are not going
to<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.340> shooting<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.850> fast<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.840> gun

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to be shooting that fast with this gun

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.990 
to be shooting that fast with this gun
at<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.159> takes<00:01:41.430> quite<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> while

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
at all it actually takes quite a while

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.810 
at all it actually takes quite a while
to<00:01:42.270> settle<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.079> gun<00:01:43.229> after<00:01:43.649> each<00:01:43.829> shot<00:01:44.220> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to settle the gun after each shot so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
to settle the gun after each shot so
you're<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.090> getting<00:01:45.390> at<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.229> huge<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.710> an

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you're not getting at that huge of an

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.310 
you're not getting at that huge of an
advantage<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.759> being<00:01:48.320> semi-automatic

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
advantage for it being semi-automatic

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.800 
advantage for it being semi-automatic
because<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.700> again<00:01:51.030> takes<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.450> long<00:01:51.780> time

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
because it still again takes a long time

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.429 
because it still again takes a long time
to<00:01:52.110> shoot<00:01:52.380> between<00:01:52.590> shots<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.229> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
to shoot between shots so what is this

gun like well basically this gun is
quite<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.850> average<00:02:00.659> shotgun<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.619> hit

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
quite a you know average shotgun one hit

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.620 
quite a you know average shotgun one hit
kill<00:02:01.950> potential<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.579> close<00:02:02.880> you're<00:02:03.390> probably

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
kill potential up close you're probably

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.780 
kill potential up close you're probably
going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> need<00:02:03.960> two<00:02:04.350> shots<00:02:04.799> though<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.280> most

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
going to need two shots though in most

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
going to need two shots though in most
situations<00:02:06.090> against<00:02:06.899> pilot<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.500> let's<00:02:07.770> not

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
situations against pilot so let's not

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.110 
situations against pilot so let's not
forget<00:02:08.399> pilots<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.379> 200<00:02:10.379> health<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.370> again

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
forget pilots have 200 health so again

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.340 
forget pilots have 200 health so again
this<00:02:12.330> shotgun<00:02:12.599> really

this shotgun really
really<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:13.890> need<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.220> engage<00:02:14.460> people<00:02:14.970> in

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
really you do need to engage people in

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.570 
really you do need to engage people in
close<00:02:15.570> quarters<00:02:16.050> luckily<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.190> burn

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
close quarters luckily you have burn

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.330 
close quarters luckily you have burn
cards<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.600> will<00:02:18.930> help<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.500> first<00:02:20.190> of

all amped EV a shotgun is great it does

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.080 
all amped EV a shotgun is great it does
increase<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.130> damage<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.700> gun<00:02:23.880> and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
increase the damage of this gun and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.760 
increase the damage of this gun and
makes<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.390> more<00:02:24.570> likely<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:25.050> get<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.200> one-shot

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
makes it more likely to get a one-shot

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.620 
makes it more likely to get a one-shot
kill<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:26.670> there's<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.910> lot<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.150> other<00:02:27.390> burn

rare burn card absolutely shines with a
shotgun<00:02:40.680> because<00:02:40.980> you're<00:02:41.070> able<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.640> know

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790

shotgun because you're able to know
where<00:02:42.030> everyone<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.780> no<00:02:43.470> does<00:02:43.770> get<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> little

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
where everyone is no does get a little

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.920 
where everyone is no does get a little
bit<00:02:44.520> confusing<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.030> find<00:02:45.270> sometimes<00:02:45.540> because

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
bit confusing I find sometimes because

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.780 
bit confusing I find sometimes because
there<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> little<00:02:46.470> bit<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.740> leg<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
there is a little bit of a leg so in the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.490 
there is a little bit of a leg so in the
extreme<00:02:48.150> close<00:02:48.390> questionnaire<00:02:48.960> scenarios

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
extreme close questionnaire scenarios

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.930 
extreme close questionnaire scenarios
sometimes<00:02:49.920> you're<00:02:50.100> shooting<00:02:50.340> at<00:02:50.460> where<00:02:50.760> its

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
sometimes you're shooting at where its

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.730 
sometimes you're shooting at where its
showing<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.330> red<00:02:51.510> outline<00:02:51.900> when<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.560> reality

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
showing the red outline when in reality

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.730 
showing the red outline when in reality
they're<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> couple<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.150> feet<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.870> left<00:02:54.990> per

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
they're a couple of feet to the left per

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.070 
they're a couple of feet to the left per
se<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.420> an<00:02:57.570> adverse<00:02:57.720> effect

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
se and this can have an adverse effect

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.470 
se and this can have an adverse effect
but<00:02:58.800> usually<00:02:59.280> knowing<00:02:59.550> where<00:02:59.700> everyone<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:00.240> on

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
but usually knowing where everyone is on

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.270 
but usually knowing where everyone is on
the<00:03:00.600> map<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.960> huge<00:03:01.320> advantage<00:03:01.560> when<00:03:01.890> using<00:03:02.220> a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
the map is a huge advantage when using a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.460 
the map is a huge advantage when using a
shotgun<00:03:02.580> now<00:03:03.360> obviously<00:03:03.540> stuff<00:03:04.080> like<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
shotgun now obviously stuff like the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.850 
shotgun now obviously stuff like the
ghost<00:03:04.800> squad<00:03:05.100> works<00:03:06.090> tremendously<00:03:06.720> well<00:03:07.410> but

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
ghost squad works tremendously well but

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680 
ghost squad works tremendously well but
there's<00:03:08.010> also<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.340> burn<00:03:08.550> card<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:08.970> lets<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.420> I

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
there's also a burn card that lets you I

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.300 
there's also a burn card that lets you I
forget<00:03:09.930> exactly<00:03:10.080> what<00:03:10.410> it's<00:03:10.560> called<00:03:10.770> but<00:03:10.950> it

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
forget exactly what it's called but it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.270 
forget exactly what it's called but it
does<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.210> ping<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> mini-map<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.130> shows

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
does a ping on the mini-map but it shows

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.980 
does a ping on the mini-map but it shows
you<00:03:14.400> where<00:03:14.520> everyone<00:03:14.910> has<00:03:15.060> every<00:03:15.330> 10<00:03:15.570> seconds

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
you where everyone has every 10 seconds

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.560 
you where everyone has every 10 seconds
this<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.740> great<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.190> can<00:03:17.340> totally<00:03:17.670> kind<00:03:18.450> of

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
this is great you can totally kind of

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.330 
this is great you can totally kind of
predict<00:03:18.870> people's<00:03:18.990> movements<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.770> then<00:03:20.100> get

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
predict people's movements and then get

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.520 
predict people's movements and then get
into<00:03:20.550> closed<00:03:20.880> course<00:03:21.120> scenarios<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:22.140> because

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
into closed course scenarios now because

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.200 
into closed course scenarios now because
pilots<00:03:22.800> health<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.340> two<00:03:23.610> hundred<00:03:23.640> percent

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
pilots health is two hundred percent

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.650 
pilots health is two hundred percent
even<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.380> super<00:03:26.340> Opie<00:03:26.700> carbine<00:03:27.240> is<00:03:27.270> going<00:03:27.600> to

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
even the super Opie carbine is going to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.660 
even the super Opie carbine is going to
have<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.810> hard<00:03:28.050> time<00:03:28.260> killing<00:03:28.800> at<00:03:29.250> really<00:03:29.640> close

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
have a hard time killing at really close

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.220 
have a hard time killing at really close
range<00:03:30.210> because<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.510> need<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.810> get<00:03:30.900> going<00:03:31.110> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
range because you need to get going to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.710 
range because you need to get going to
need<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.440> get<00:03:31.560> four<00:03:31.920> shots<00:03:32.310> off<00:03:32.580> so<00:03:33.150> when

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
need to get four shots off so when

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.080 
need to get four shots off so when
visiting<00:03:34.110> other<00:03:34.290> pilots<00:03:34.770> in<00:03:34.920> close<00:03:35.490> close

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
visiting other pilots in close close

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.550 
visiting other pilots in close close
quarters<00:03:36.510> scenarios<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.050> if<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.260> stick

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
quarters scenarios so if you stick

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.620 
quarters scenarios so if you stick
inside<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.130> buildings<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.700> stuff<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.060> you're

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
inside of buildings and stuff and you're

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.510 
inside of buildings and stuff and you're
using<00:03:39.780> an<00:03:39.990> EV<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> shotgun<00:03:40.770> you're<00:03:41.130> probably

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
using an EV a shotgun you're probably

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.790 
using an EV a shotgun you're probably
going<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.360> advantage<00:03:42.800> especially

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
going to have the advantage especially

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.490 
going to have the advantage especially
because<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.820> only<00:03:45.180> need<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.780> get<00:03:45.930> really<00:03:46.170> two

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
because you only need to get really two

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.830 
because you only need to get really two
shots<00:03:46.860> on<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.400> guy<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.150> have<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.360> pretty

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
shots on a guy and you have a pretty

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.140 
shots on a guy and you have a pretty
decently<00:03:49.230> wide<00:03:49.530> circle<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.520> put<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> guy

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
decently wide circle to put on a guy

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.050 
decently wide circle to put on a guy
whereas<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:52.020> you're<00:03:52.170> using<00:03:52.350> even<00:03:52.740> an<00:03:53.130> SMG<00:03:53.610> if

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
whereas if you're using even an SMG if

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.210 
whereas if you're using even an SMG if
you<00:03:54.210> miss<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.510> couple<00:03:54.780> shots<00:03:54.990> you're<00:03:55.950> pretty

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
you miss a couple shots you're pretty

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.740 
you miss a couple shots you're pretty
much<00:03:56.280> done<00:03:56.640> when<00:03:56.910> racing<00:03:57.270> a<00:03:57.330> shock<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.690> you

much done when racing a shock and you

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.090

have to be absolutely one hundred
percent<00:03:59.310> accurate<00:03:59.910> when<00:04:00.090> using<00:04:00.540> other<00:04:00.990> guns
