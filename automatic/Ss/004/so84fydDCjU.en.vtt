books are for similar reasons simply

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.470 
books are for similar reasons simply
because<00:00:22.050> they're<00:00:22.470> incredibly<00:00:23.400> hyped<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.060> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
because they're incredibly hyped and I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.599 
because they're incredibly hyped and I
was<00:00:24.600> worried<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.560> pressure<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.279> them

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
was worried that the pressure of them

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.179 
was worried that the pressure of them
being<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.119> hyped<00:00:27.510> would<00:00:28.230> mean<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.800> annoyed

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
being so hyped would mean I'm annoyed

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.679 
being so hyped would mean I'm annoyed
with<00:00:29.310> much<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> could<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:29.939> done<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.660> I

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
with much what I could have done so I

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.959 
with much what I could have done so I
put<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:30.929> off<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> long<00:00:31.529> time<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.250> I'm

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.729 
put them off for a long time and I'm
glad<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.149> finally<00:00:33.360> around<00:00:33.809> them<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.469> will

published in - back in the seventh and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.840 
published in - back in the seventh and
my<00:00:38.700> Edition<00:00:39.030> has<00:00:39.290> 554<00:00:40.290> pages<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.950> check<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.670> think

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
my Edition has 554 pages I check I think

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.340 
my Edition has 554 pages I check I think
three<00:00:42.120> days<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.480> week<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.750> book<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.260> an

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
three days to week this book it's an

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.310 
three days to week this book it's an
incredibly<00:00:43.739> easy<00:00:43.800> read<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.899> not<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> fast

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
incredibly easy read it's not a fast

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
incredibly easy read it's not a fast
pace<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:46.950> some<00:00:47.219> bits<00:00:47.399> were<00:00:47.520> quite<00:00:47.730> slow

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
pace because some bits were quite slow

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.139 
pace because some bits were quite slow
but<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.160> just<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.489> easy<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.969> keep

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
but it's just really easy to keep

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
but it's just really easy to keep
telling<00:00:51.360> pages<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.559> think<00:00:52.890> there's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
telling pages because I think there's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.209 
telling pages because I think there's
about<00:00:53.600> tens<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.930> longer<00:00:55.559> chapters<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.070> within

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
about tens or longer chapters but within

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.610 
about tens or longer chapters but within
each<00:00:56.370> slower<00:00:56.760> chapter<00:00:57.300> there's<00:00:57.899> lots<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
each slower chapter there's lots of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
each slower chapter there's lots of
little<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:59.460> chapters<00:00:59.910> that's<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
little little chapters that's how you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.990 
little little chapters that's how you
describe<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.489> lot<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.670> people

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
describe it so I think a lot of people

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
describe it so I think a lot of people

stuck<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.140> him<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> had<00:01:47.430> quite<00:01:47.579> an<00:01:47.700> effect

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
stuck with him and had quite an effect

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.670 
stuck with him and had quite an effect
on<00:01:48.119> him<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.140> he<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.350> then

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
on him so because of that he is then

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.249 
on him so because of that he is then
sort<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.310> summarizing<00:01:50.939> her<00:01:51.060> story<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.020> whilst

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
sort of summarizing her story and whilst

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.980 
sort of summarizing her story and whilst
telling<00:01:52.649> her<00:01:52.799> story<00:01:53.220> he<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.880> telling<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.450> how

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
telling her story he is telling you how

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
telling her story he is telling you how
he<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.290> somehow<00:01:55.470> connected<00:01:56.040> how<00:01:56.280> where<00:01:56.700> he

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
he was somehow connected how where he

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.749 
he was somehow connected how where he
was<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.030> certain<00:01:57.360> times<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.290> thought<00:01:59.189> that

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
was at certain times so I thought that

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.310 
was at certain times so I thought that
the<00:01:59.939> tool<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.360> deficit<00:02:00.750> narrating<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.200> was

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the tool of deficit narrating it was

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.859 
the tool of deficit narrating it was
slightly<00:02:01.530> gimmicky<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:03.060> done<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.570> way

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
slightly gimmicky and was done in a way

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.750 
slightly gimmicky and was done in a way
just<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.439> be

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
just to be

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.820 
just to be
different<00:02:05.420> hopefully<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.200> people<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.590> work

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
different hopefully that people to work

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.200 
different hopefully that people to work
really<00:02:07.100> well<00:02:07.220> because<00:02:07.580> definitely<00:02:07.880> have<00:02:08.180> a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
really well because definitely have a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.460 
really well because definitely have a
much<00:02:08.390> broader<00:02:08.630> perspective<00:02:08.870> on<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.440> whole

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
much broader perspective on the whole

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.890 
much broader perspective on the whole
thing<00:02:09.650> so<00:02:10.220> he<00:02:10.880> would<00:02:11.090> sort<00:02:11.390> tell<00:02:11.570> you<00:02:11.720> things

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
thing so he would sort tell you things

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.790 
thing so he would sort tell you things
that<00:02:11.990> hadn't<00:02:12.260> happened<00:02:12.380> yet

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
that hadn't happened yet

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.560 
that hadn't happened yet
and<00:02:12.980> prepared<00:02:13.340> before<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.820> people<00:02:14.120> tell<00:02:14.300> you

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
and prepared before the people tell you

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.300 
and prepared before the people tell you
what<00:02:15.230> was<00:02:15.350> happening<00:02:15.380> at<00:02:15.770> different<00:02:16.130> part

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
what was happening at different part

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
what was happening at different part
Germany<00:02:16.670> at<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.760> time<00:02:16.820> because<00:02:17.240> he<00:02:17.300> saw<00:02:18.200> it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
Germany at the time because he saw it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.280 
Germany at the time because he saw it
there<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.790> was<00:02:19.970> interesting<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.080> liked

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
there so that was interesting so I liked

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.190 
there so that was interesting so I liked
it<00:02:21.440> for<00:02:21.500> those<00:02:21.710> reasons<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.370> don't<00:02:22.850> think<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.780> was

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
it for those reasons I don't think I was

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.080 
it for those reasons I don't think I was
as<00:02:24.440> heartbroken<00:02:24.860> by<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.310> book<00:02:25.520> as<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> lot<00:02:26.030> of

easier crier I cry at TV adverts are

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.640 
easier crier I cry at TV adverts are
quite<00:02:31.670> trailers<00:02:32.300> acquired<00:02:32.990> might<00:02:33.320> see<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.620> a

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
quite trailers acquired might see like a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.930 
quite trailers acquired might see like a
little<00:02:33.890> old<00:02:33.980> man<00:02:34.070> could<00:02:34.460> never<00:02:34.550> marry<00:02:34.790> me

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
little old man could never marry me

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.670 
little old man could never marry me
because<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.300> want<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.570> devastate<00:02:35.960> him<00:02:36.200> so

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
because I just want to devastate him so

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.030 
because I just want to devastate him so
I<00:02:37.100> expected<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.450> be<00:02:38.570> something<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:39.470> choking

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
I expected to be something that choking

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.040 
I expected to be something that choking
not<00:02:40.400> quite<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> little<00:02:40.880> bit<00:02:41.150> right<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.900> end

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
not quite a little bit right in the end

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.590 
not quite a little bit right in the end
for<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.770> couple<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.070> pages<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.700> wasn't<00:02:44.480> joking

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
for a couple of pages I wasn't joking

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120 
for a couple of pages I wasn't joking
but<00:02:44.990> it's<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.230> few<00:02:45.350> tears<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.860> know<00:02:45.950> what's

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
but it's a few tears you know what's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.730 
but it's a few tears you know what's
going<00:02:46.280> away<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.540> obviously<00:02:47.690> got<00:02:48.050> to<00:02:48.080> me<00:02:48.410> but

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
going away so it obviously got to me but

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.500 
going away so it obviously got to me but
not<00:02:48.860> as<00:02:48.980> much<00:02:49.070> as<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.250> thought<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.580> would<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
not as much as I thought it would the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.090 
not as much as I thought it would the
reason<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.990> this<00:02:51.110> because<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.560> think<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.920> lot<00:02:51.950> of

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
reason to this because I think a lot of

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.680 
reason to this because I think a lot of
books<00:02:52.460> have<00:02:53.120> been<00:02:53.210> written<00:02:53.360> about<00:02:53.510> this
