00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it right on the first try but sometimes

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:28.660 
it right on the first try but sometimes
it<00:03:20.129> doesn't<00:03:20.340> always<00:03:20.370> work<00:03:20.550> out<00:03:20.819> that<00:03:20.879> way

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.150 

looks<00:03:29.540> like<00:03:29.690> it's<00:03:29.840> going<00:03:30.020> to<00:03:30.050> be<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.200> go<00:03:30.440> go<00:03:30.980> back

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
looks like it's going to be a go go back

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:44.860 
looks like it's going to be a go go back
to<00:03:31.310> you

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.259 

by<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.560> way<00:03:45.739> as<00:03:45.860> preference<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.670> don't<00:03:47.120> use

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
by the way as preference I don't use

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.750 
by the way as preference I don't use
instant<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:48.069> use<00:03:49.069> real<00:03:49.280> coffee<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:52.549> means

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
instant I use real coffee that means

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:03.360 
instant I use real coffee that means
anything<00:03:56.500> now<00:03:57.500> wait<00:03:57.680> till<00:03:57.890> the<00:04:01.870> grounds<00:04:02.870> drop

see<00:04:10.820> some<00:04:11.030> creek<00:04:11.240> water<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.690> save<00:04:11.840> this

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.740 

simple<00:04:24.430> pot<00:04:24.580> stand

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.990 

little<00:04:28.380> rock<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.280> point<00:04:29.490> sticking<00:04:29.820> to

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
little rock and just a point sticking to

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.840

the<00:04:30.090> ground<00:04:31.220> simplest<00:04:32.220> Rick's<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.670> best

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
the ground simplest Rick's the best

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.690 
the ground simplest Rick's the best
trick<00:04:33.090> sometimes<00:04:34.220> there's<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.280> little<00:04:35.340> wrong

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
trick sometimes there's a little wrong

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.440 
trick sometimes there's a little wrong
on<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.030> ground<00:04:36.330> it's<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:38.160> is<00:04:38.370> Pete<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:39.000> dirt

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
on the ground it's a it is Pete and dirt

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.870 
on the ground it's a it is Pete and dirt
and<00:04:39.690> just<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.620> few<00:04:40.950> feet<00:04:40.980> more<00:04:41.310> down<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.850> just

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
and just a few feet more down it just

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.250 
and just a few feet more down it just
turns<00:04:42.240> into<00:04:42.420> dirt<00:04:42.720> by<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.930> creek<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:45.260> did

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
turns into dirt by the creek so I did

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.840 
turns into dirt by the creek so I did
layer<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.650> bottom<00:04:46.950> of<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.130> fire<00:04:47.370> with<00:04:47.640> some

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
layer the bottom of the fire with some

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.440 
layer the bottom of the fire with some
thick<00:04:48.120> wet<00:04:48.330> long<00:04:48.540> pieces<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.290> wood<00:04:50.330> so<00:04:51.330> the

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
thick wet long pieces of wood so the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.840 
thick wet long pieces of wood so the
best<00:04:51.630> idea<00:04:52.020> yeah<00:04:52.650> it's<00:04:53.460> not<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.700> worst

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
best idea yeah it's not the worst

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.470 
best idea yeah it's not the worst
neither<00:04:54.150> should<00:04:54.870> be<00:04:55.020> alright<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:56.330> we're<00:04:57.330> good
