00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
possible and I don't plan on using it

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.750 
possible and I don't plan on using it
again<00:00:47.109> after<00:00:47.409> this<00:00:47.800> I<00:00:47.980> did<00:00:48.219> get<00:00:48.339> a<00:00:48.399> gold<00:00:48.670> a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
know to get some gameplay and to figure

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.160 
know to get some gameplay and to figure
out<00:00:55.120> really<00:00:55.269> what's<00:00:55.420> going<00:00:55.659> to<00:00:55.749> work<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.989> best

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
out really what's going to work the best

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.709 
out really what's going to work the best
for<00:00:56.319> everyone<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.339> I<00:00:57.999> didn't<00:00:58.239> enjoy<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.600> one

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
for everyone and I didn't enjoy it one

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.119 
for everyone and I didn't enjoy it one
bit<00:00:58.929> what<00:00:59.530> you're<00:00:59.649> watching<00:00:59.769> in<00:01:00.039> the

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
bit what you're watching in the

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.959 
bit what you're watching in the
background<00:01:00.579> is<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:00.789> vsat<00:01:01.690> VTOL<00:01:02.319> swarm<00:01:03.219> fail<00:01:03.670> I

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
background is a vsat VTOL swarm fail I

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.749 
background is a vsat VTOL swarm fail I
was<00:01:04.900> able<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.170> get<00:01:05.469> the<00:01:05.530> vsat<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.430> VTOL

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
was able to get the vsat and the VTOL

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.929 
was able to get the vsat and the VTOL
and<00:01:07.060> due<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.570> mistake<00:01:07.840> on<00:01:08.170> my<00:01:08.259> part<00:01:08.530> I<00:01:09.250> failed

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
and due to a mistake on my part I failed

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.450 
and due to a mistake on my part I failed
for<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.329> swarm<00:01:10.750> one<00:01:11.079> off<00:01:11.259> and<00:01:11.530> you'll<00:01:12.250> see

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
for the swarm one off and you'll see

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.789 
for the swarm one off and you'll see
that<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.850> you'll<00:01:13.030> laugh<00:01:13.210> at<00:01:13.329> me<00:01:13.649> moving<00:01:14.649> on

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
that and you'll laugh at me moving on

the KSG is a pump-action shotgun that

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.850 
the KSG is a pump-action shotgun that
does<00:01:18.159> 200<00:01:18.789> damage<00:01:18.909> up<00:01:19.240> close<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.719> 75<00:01:20.380> from<00:01:20.770> a

does 200 damage up close and 75 from a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.709 
does 200 damage up close and 75 from a
distance<00:01:21.280> now<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.880> seems<00:01:22.149> really<00:01:22.450> really

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
distance now that seems really really

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.200 
distance now that seems really really
odd<00:01:22.990> because<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.530> KSG<00:01:23.979> seems<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.610> kill<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.850> lot

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
odd because the KSG seems to kill a lot

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.420 
odd because the KSG seems to kill a lot
easier<00:01:25.420> from<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.380> distance<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.039> you'll<00:01:27.159> see<00:01:27.340> at

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
easier from a distance and you'll see at

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.859 
easier from a distance and you'll see at
the<00:01:27.549> end<00:01:27.579> of<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.850> video<00:01:27.939> I<00:01:28.119> included<00:01:28.539> a<00:01:28.630> clip

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
the end of the video I included a clip

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.440 
the end of the video I included a clip
of<00:01:28.899> a<00:01:29.140> four-shot<00:01:29.710> fail<00:01:30.159> up<00:01:30.700> close<00:01:31.090> with<00:01:31.329> the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
of a four-shot fail up close with the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.069 
of a four-shot fail up close with the
KSG<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.140> I<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:34.060> had<00:01:34.359> no<00:01:34.390> words<00:01:34.750> at<00:01:34.930> that

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
KSG and I just had no words at that

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.690 
KSG and I just had no words at that
moment<00:01:35.259> so<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.560> figured<00:01:35.920> out<00:01:36.009> included<00:01:36.460> just<00:01:36.640> so

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
moment so I figured out included just so

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.599 
moment so I figured out included just so
you'll<00:01:36.850> see<00:01:37.390> how<00:01:37.630> awful<00:01:38.170> this<00:01:38.350> gun<00:01:38.560> really<00:01:39.399> can

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
you'll see how awful this gun really can

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.050 
you'll see how awful this gun really can
be<00:01:39.789> even<00:01:40.210> with<00:01:40.329> the<00:01:40.899> right<00:01:41.460> class<00:01:42.460> setup<00:01:42.820> it's

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
be even with the right class setup it's

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.580 
be even with the right class setup it's
all<00:01:43.390> dependent<00:01:43.780> on<00:01:43.869> connection<00:01:44.320> if<00:01:44.409> you<00:01:44.469> have

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
all dependent on connection if you have

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.870 
all dependent on connection if you have
a<00:01:44.619> bad<00:01:44.829> connection<00:01:44.979> this<00:01:45.369> gun<00:01:45.520> will<00:01:45.670> fail<00:01:45.850> you

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
a bad connection this gun will fail you

fast<00:03:44.820> mag<00:03:45.090> instead<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.510> laser<00:03:45.690> sight<00:03:45.960> if<00:03:46.140> you

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
fast mag instead of laser sight if you

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
draw instead of laser sight as well I

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.310 
draw instead of laser sight as well I
still<00:03:54.030> recommend<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.720> keep<00:03:54.930> long

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
the KSG is just phenomenal sometimes I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.580 
the KSG is just phenomenal sometimes I
get<00:04:00.180> kills<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.600> I'm<00:04:00.660> like<00:04:00.810> there's<00:04:01.020> no<00:04:01.350> way

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
get kills and I'm like there's no way

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.440 
get kills and I'm like there's no way
that<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.830> should<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.130> got<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.060> that's

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
that I should have got that and that's

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.560 
that I should have got that and that's
just<00:04:03.660> ridiculous<00:04:05.000> but<00:04:06.000> that's<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.360> best
