00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.069

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.640
 today the company invoices 40 million dollars gives employment to more than a thousand 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 people 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.330
 it is a company that is outside

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.240
 although they have already begun 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.070
 good 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.330
 bowen Saturday almost the region we have 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.780
 2 thousand 100 dollars each is generated 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.860
 stop the truth that 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.810
 not only because an interesting derby 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.290
 in the world after the year 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.780
 2000 when it was the famous system that 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.050
 because the world was falling 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.260
 we must accompany with a single worker 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.420
 model wanted to receive has provided services from other parts of the world 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.900
 the central countries 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.580
 that its increase 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.030
 when we begin to think 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.770
 what can do something similar and Argentina 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.320
 all had the end of one died 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.870
 those presented is very complex 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.560
 for competing 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.830
 but 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.810
 after the failure in 2001 a paperweight adopted the ability 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.640
 available argentina 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 What I'm looking for worked intact 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.939
 they did not work he had a clear opportunity 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.339
 to try to sell you 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.509
 to the world heavy oil much flavor 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.509
 I senators still leave at a distance 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.399
 I thought it was possible to do it with so little money is an asset 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.189
 After almost 30 years 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.189
 something we scrape 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:39.829
 this resident of mechanical engineer at the university of silver concord and 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.190
 as expected after the two founders of which we counted a little 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.210
 who request as to be that this relationship that allows them to develop 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.149
 this sector 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:51.689
 added 4 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.389
 leo martini goleada néstor nocetti lives well done 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.939
 martinelli martín deep studies in the faculty 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.179
 in the first year 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.299
 take red from some that from before 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.299
 Can euros to 30 years 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.969
 from a very good relationship 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.529
 of friendship development 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:14.509
 if I keep seeing it 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.519
 ii who can then 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.260
 Martinelli or working with him at the hotel was being little work 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.549
 Nestor 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.299
 He left us separated 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.769
 if we lose the relationship 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.919
 however this one but they live and as for what 10 years is added 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.189
 we have decided together on this 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.419
 Megan fox 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.729
 with this later 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.989
 and with me already the last stage of both ante with a greeting 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.799
 want to be it as to why they chose that name 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.889
 when a neighbor does not 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.889
 it's a lesson, let's say 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:53.869
 iver invented a small machine site around the treasury 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.399
 munar shibuya all names in greek latin 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.249
 and another on the other hand 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.399
 all the completions in a national parador 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.269
 and good that those players spend two or more clear 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.340
 the machine or names the name was looking for it to enter once if the domain 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.689
 its busy 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:12.719
 and so 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.799
 to the other and drawn up a long list of names 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.479
 not only have they yielded a 0 21 years they do not have 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.349
 there is no explanation of winning I could approve today to efe that applauds 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.229
 without ravaging the base san damián pérez globant world has a 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.249
 Explanation 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:32.819
 you can be seen as the paradigm of the entrance of the headquarters that 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.930
 have a good idea was to transform it into a big business 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.660
 what message would you give to one who has a good idea 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.919
 by certain balance 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.099
 this is what most can not be reached 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.919
 that they are going to vote to work and then the patient has what they 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.199
 you do 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.439
 if I'm convinced by a good team with a mediocre idea that the placebo in an idea 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.069
 very good a mediocre team not 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.300
 I think God's patience is more important 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.759
 It was the farewell of their companies with other teachers of carmen 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.030
 in defense of the valencia it was decided to do however lack people when it was 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.129
 so good 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.580
 but the fact of undertaking the act of putting yourself at the service of esso 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.180
 I one thing seems not to mind the entrepreneur 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.860
 because he knows his business a lot 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.860
 not the entrepreneur to do what he does not know anything that is chance 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.719
 this town has all the weapons 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:27.789
 to know 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.569
 it causes me more or less time we had uat in six years we build something 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:32.460
 big 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.849
 but the fact that the passion you put into it is the most important thing 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.669
 iizuka execution phase
