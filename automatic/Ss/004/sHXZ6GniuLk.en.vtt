00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.870
 very good girls very good guys in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
 the scream and we are in a news that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.790
 we found on the smack website 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.080
 dotcom hardware attentive because the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.759
 you have in the source in the description if 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
 you want to visit all this information and 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.590
 a lot more than one website that is worth 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.290
 worth visiting attentive all because 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.680
 windows 10 can disable games 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.770
 pirates and unauthorized hardware attentive 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.800
 because the new terms of service 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.899
 that came into force on August 1 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.089
 can prevent that well we play 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.570
 counterfeit games or use hardware 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:45.239
 unauthorized and that's so for that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.100
 did not know the terms are valid 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.350
 for everyone who uses the services 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.039
 from microsoft like for example 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.649
 xbox live sky one drive and so on 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.480
 etcetera also the software that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.309
 let's use in a microsoft account 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.670
 is covered by these terms, not what 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.430
 which means that it could also affect 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.070
 to most windows 10 at 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.140
 users of windows 10 although windows 10 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.330
 It can be used without an account 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 microsoft most users 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 They use a company account 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.230
 from microsoft logically the terms 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 they explicitly state that 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.460
 microsoft can launch updates 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.700
 that could have some consequences 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.149
 well serious enough not 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.130
 remember that users who do not use 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.110
 windows 10 could potentially 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 also become victims of these 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.759
 new terms of use such as for example 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.740
 skype windows live mail one drive 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.319
 windows movie maker photo gallery and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.819
 among others the games published by 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.670
 Microsoft are also covered by 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.719
 these terms with the release of 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.850
 windows 10 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.560
 also well, it has been speculated that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.119
 there would be a lot of buzz about 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.100
 the privacy settings 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.369
 operating system already 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.590
 and the truth is that uses as they cut 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.619
 to automatic updates and use of 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.850
 a microsoft account and all this well 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.810
 with good 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.780
 would consider some users 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.520
 consider they would consider that 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.180
 privacy issues but of all 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.640
 shapes 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.459
 we will see what happens if in the end 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.310
 he backs out but the terms of 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.079
 conditions are there not and all this 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.819
 could do could result in that 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.250
 windows 10 could disable games 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.200
 pirate and hardware not authorized by the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.730
 own microsoft we'll see what it is that 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.980
 it happens many thanks to all for 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.239
 be there there are shared favorites 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.239
 We see you at the next ciao
