00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 When we come back for a big mess 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.670
 have worried there are so typical 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.680
 locate the desk for example us 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.710
 get professional help now 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.580
 namely the clean up experts their 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.580
 short was with us 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.670
 by order is half the life 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.410
 my motto chaos is the other half 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.150
 but the one on von coach sees it 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.529
 different 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.960
 we will try everything now 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.540
 to give a home here and then 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.170
 keep your desk tidy 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.390
 have to 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.190
 that is his motto and that 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.900
 First there is a checklist where are 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.370
 the most chaotic ones do something 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.140
 brought a bowl inbox 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.360
 You can even use his shield 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.360
 provided she says to the sung 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.460
 this is where the five minute rules apply 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.129
 everything I do in five minutes 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.170
 can immediately take anything 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.400
 mark or dispose of immediately 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.950
 they do not let themselves go now 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.890
 really can recycle again the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.340
 actually crack down and take them in 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.340
 to throw the garbage 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.200
 but if they are in doubt if they are 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.409
 That's why this can be let go 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.280
 Rearing a sample in carton box 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.940
 label and do not say here 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.820
 world stock markets 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:35.369
 that way, for example, simply represent 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:41.520
 that is always certain of the month 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.530
 or for pacts rainer change date 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.310
 then we will have it done then it will 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.840
 either crossed out with tip-ex 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.000
 paints or in a missing room with 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.119
 to write pencil 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 that's all I do not want 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.360
 can disappear in the disappears 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.340
 desk because on the table should only 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.470
 that's what we focus on 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.990
 kaiser briefly calls this from the 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.270
 Japanese for change for the better 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.080
 So also with the distraction maneuver 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.250
 from the wall 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.610
 suddenly you will work with me 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.030
 claudia can imagine that 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.030
