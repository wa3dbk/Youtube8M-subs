with hypoplastic left heart syndrome but
born<00:00:30.480> before<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> 1980s<00:00:31.410> had<00:00:31.560> no<00:00:31.680> chance<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.189 
born before the 1980s had no chance to
survive<00:00:32.369> many<00:00:32.940> children<00:00:33.449> are<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:33.720> in<00:00:33.750> their

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
survive many children are now in their

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.590 
survive many children are now in their
early<00:00:35.040> teens<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.030> kind<00:00:36.269> of<00:00:36.390> heart

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
early teens with this kind of heart

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.060 
early teens with this kind of heart
condition<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.290> they're<00:00:37.410> doing<00:00:37.650> quite<00:00:37.920> well

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
condition and they're doing quite well

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.010 
condition and they're doing quite well
they're<00:00:38.580> basically<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.149> medical<00:00:39.570> frontier

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
they're basically on a medical frontier

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.510 
they're basically on a medical frontier
they're<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.470> cutting<00:00:40.680> edge<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.130> medicine

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
they're on the cutting edge of medicine

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
they're on the cutting edge of medicine
right<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.149> surgery<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.750> hypoplastic

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
right now the surgery for hypoplastic

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.170 
right now the surgery for hypoplastic
left<00:00:43.230> heart<00:00:43.649> syndrome<00:00:43.829> has<00:00:44.370> evolved<00:00:45.000> since

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
left heart syndrome has evolved since

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.540 
left heart syndrome has evolved since
the<00:00:45.329> early<00:00:45.600> 1980s<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.620> continues<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.430> evolve

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the early 1980s and continues to evolve

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.420 
the early 1980s and continues to evolve
so<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> child<00:00:48.870> who<00:00:49.110> survived<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.219> this

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so really a child who survived all this

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.119 
so really a child who survived all this
in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.880> late<00:00:51.030> 80s<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.530> different<00:00:52.800> from

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
in the late 80s it's very different from

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.400 
in the late 80s it's very different from
a<00:00:53.280> child<00:00:53.520> having<00:00:53.760> surgery<00:00:54.300> today<00:00:54.450> so<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.290> have

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a child having surgery today so we have

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.750 
a child having surgery today so we have
a<00:00:55.440> moving<00:00:55.739> target<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.370> we're<00:00:56.670> getting

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
a moving target because we're getting

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
a moving target because we're getting
better<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.899> only<00:00:58.230> time<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.890> tell

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
better at what we do only time will tell

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
better at what we do only time will tell
what<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.700> long-term<00:01:00.090> outcome<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.110> is<00:01:01.410> she

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what the long-term outcome really is she

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.820 
what the long-term outcome really is she
is<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.460> full<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.000> energy<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.229> mean<00:01:04.259> you<00:01:04.559> can't

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
is so full of energy I mean you can't

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.469 
is so full of energy I mean you can't
even<00:01:05.039> believe<00:01:05.190> she<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> heart<00:01:05.910> defect<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
even believe she has a heart defect and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.790 
even believe she has a heart defect and
people<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.899> don't<00:01:07.200> know<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.410> she's<00:01:07.770> been

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
people that don't know what she's been

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.859 
people that don't know what she's been
through<00:01:08.039> look<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:08.759> her<00:01:08.910> in<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:09.690> she's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
through look at her in all of what she's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.590 
through look at her in all of what she's
capable<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.590> from<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.310> heart<00:01:11.610> standpoint<00:01:12.240> most

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
capable of from a heart standpoint most

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.749 
capable of from a heart standpoint most
of<00:01:12.840> these<00:01:12.929> children<00:01:13.410> are<00:01:13.530> very<00:01:14.039> good<00:01:14.520> at

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
of these children are very good at

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.230 
of these children are very good at
adapting<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.929> their<00:01:16.200> limitations<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.160> so<00:01:17.819> if

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
adapting to their limitations and so if

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.969 
adapting to their limitations and so if
they're<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.899> playground<00:01:19.530> playing<00:01:19.830> with

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
they're on the playground playing with

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
they're on the playground playing with
other<00:01:20.130> children<00:01:20.459> there<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.630> play<00:01:21.869> with

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
other children there they will play with

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
other children there they will play with
them<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.530> around<00:01:22.800> with<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.160> and<00:01:23.459> limit

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
them and get around with them and limit

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.139 
them and get around with them and limit
themselves<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.569> they<00:01:24.840> need<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:26.149> addition

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
themselves as they need to in addition

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.230 
themselves as they need to in addition
we're<00:01:27.690> finding<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.259> there<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.800> also

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
we're finding out that there are also

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.430 
we're finding out that there are also
neurologic<00:01:30.240> abnormalities<00:01:30.599> that<00:01:31.140> many<00:01:31.319> of

neurologic abnormalities that many of

neurologic abnormalities that many of
these<00:01:31.500> children<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.550> will<00:01:32.819> have<00:01:33.090> as

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
these children have and will have as

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.940 
these children have and will have as
they<00:01:33.390> grow<00:01:33.539> older<00:01:33.959> some<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> them<00:01:34.770> with

they grow older some of them with

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.830 
they grow older some of them with
learning<00:01:35.250> difficulties<00:01:36.119> some<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.509> them<00:01:36.660> with

complex than this we've really pushed
