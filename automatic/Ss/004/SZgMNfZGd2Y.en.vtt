to<00:00:45.359> do<00:00:45.659> it<00:00:47.149> working<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.359> that<00:00:48.629> project<00:00:48.839> a

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
to do it working on that project a

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.119 
to do it working on that project a
different<00:00:49.260> team<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.129> different

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
different team or you have different

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.369 
different team or you have different
issues<00:00:53.249> that<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.729> have<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.940> solve<00:00:54.379> sometimes

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
issues that you have to solve sometimes

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.919 
issues that you have to solve sometimes
the<00:00:55.679> challenge<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.819> the<00:00:57.269> model<00:00:57.539> itself

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
the challenge is the the model itself

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.750 
the challenge is the the model itself
when<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.409> too<00:00:58.619> complicated<00:00:58.949> too<00:00:59.369> complex

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
when it's too complicated too complex

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.779 
when it's too complicated too complex
and<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> recent<00:01:01.679> project<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.159> can<00:01:02.339> think<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and the recent project I can think of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.820 
and the recent project I can think of
was<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:04.280> tower<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.640> Japan<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.360> Tokyo<00:01:06.830> they

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
was the tower for Japan for Tokyo they

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.580 
was the tower for Japan for Tokyo they
built<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.760> tower<00:01:09.120> which<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.170> actually

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
built the the tower which is actually

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.660 
built the the tower which is actually
recently<00:01:11.930> being<00:01:12.930> built<00:01:13.260> there<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:14.520> in

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
recently being built there right in

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.790 
recently being built there right in
Tokyo<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> real<00:01:15.660> building<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.710> not

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
Tokyo as a real building it's not

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.130 
Tokyo as a real building it's not
finished<00:01:17.130> yet<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.510> we<00:01:18.510> finished<00:01:18.660> first

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
finished yet but we finished first

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.430 
finished yet but we finished first
we've<00:01:19.560> done<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> lego<00:01:20.310> model<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:22.050> 5

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
we've done the lego model and it was 5

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.730 
we've done the lego model and it was 5
meter<00:01:22.650> high<00:01:22.970> which<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.180> quite<00:01:24.450> high<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.110> as

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
meter high which is quite high and as

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.880 
meter high which is quite high and as
the<00:01:25.890> II<00:01:25.920> Japanese<00:01:26.160> are<00:01:26.730> using<00:01:27.890> special

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the II Japanese are using special

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
the II Japanese are using special
technology<00:01:29.580> which<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:30.030> use<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> real

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
technology which they use in the real

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.460 
technology which they use in the real
buildings

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
buildings

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
buildings
to<00:01:31.890> protect<00:01:32.220> them<00:01:32.960> from<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> earthquake<00:01:35.360> it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to protect them from the earthquake it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.970 
to protect them from the earthquake it
was<00:01:36.630> big<00:01:37.080> it<00:01:37.800> was<00:01:38.220> big<00:01:38.460> challenge<00:01:38.940> for<00:01:39.030> us<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
was big it was big challenge for us to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.770 
was big it was big challenge for us to
get<00:01:40.980> it<00:01:41.130> done<00:01:41.370> in<00:01:41.580> bricks<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
get it done in bricks because when you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.140 
get it done in bricks because when you
are<00:01:43.110> building<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.190> bricks<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.760> do

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
are building out of bricks you can do

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.250 
are building out of bricks you can do
almost<00:01:45.420> anything

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
almost anything

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.250 
almost anything
but<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.280> can't<00:01:47.520> avoid<00:01:47.790> some<00:01:48.120> limits<00:01:48.750> saying

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
but you can't avoid some limits saying

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.170 
but you can't avoid some limits saying
that<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> challenge<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.760> we<00:01:50.940> have<00:01:51.060> to
