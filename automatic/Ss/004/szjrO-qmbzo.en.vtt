in<00:00:17.550> his<00:00:17.580> fire<00:00:18.060> truck<00:00:18.330> mode<00:00:18.779> now<00:00:19.619> then<00:00:19.859> as<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
in his fire truck mode now then as a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.609 
in his fire truck mode now then as a
special<00:00:21.240> sort<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> thing<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.080> considering<00:00:22.470> how

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619

he's supposed to be from generation to
this<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.279> thought<00:00:26.279> I'd<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> comparison

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
this one I thought I'd do a comparison

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.720 
this one I thought I'd do a comparison
with<00:00:27.900> his<00:00:27.960> original<00:00:28.650> generation<00:00:29.340> two<00:00:29.490> main

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
with his original generation two main

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.009 
with his original generation two main
sake<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.720> he<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
sake so here he is

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.229 
sake so here he is
there<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.160> go<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.430> that's<00:00:32.550> swim<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
there we go and that's swim with the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.270 
there we go and that's swim with the
water<00:00:33.780> cannon<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> front<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
can see universe inferno is a bit bigger

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.439 
can see universe inferno is a bit bigger
bit<00:00:52.440> darker<00:00:52.949> red<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:53.280> well<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
bit darker red as well but you know I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.029 
bit darker red as well but you know I
think<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.840> Han<00:00:55.020> carry<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> lighter

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
think the Han carry one was a lighter

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.849 
think the Han carry one was a lighter
red<00:00:56.219> much<00:00:56.760> more<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:58.739> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
course okay because the am and the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.780 
course okay because the am and the
original<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> course<00:01:29.340> did<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.700> this

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
original one of course did have this

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.880 
original one of course did have this
water<00:01:30.060> blaster<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.750> put<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.470> water<00:01:31.619> then

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
water blaster that you put in water then

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
water blaster that you put in water then
you<00:01:32.009> would<00:01:32.159> suck<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.810> then

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you would suck up like that and then

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.980 
you would suck up like that and then
squirt<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> water<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.990> still

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
squirt out all the water like that still

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450 
squirt out all the water like that still
this<00:01:37.170> guy's<00:01:37.409> never<00:01:37.619> been<00:01:37.799> near<00:01:38.009> water<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.310> he

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
this guy's never been near water and he

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
this guy's never been near water and he
probably<00:01:38.759> never<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> ice<00:01:40.140> unless

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
probably never will be so the ice unless

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
probably never will be so the ice unless
my<00:01:40.590> house<00:01:40.770> works<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.310> that's<00:01:41.729> probably

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
my house works but that's probably

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.660 
my house works but that's probably
longer<00:01:42.259> anyway<00:01:43.259> yeah<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
longer anyway yeah so that was that

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.460 
longer anyway yeah so that was that
gimmick<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.840> course<00:01:45.869> everything

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
gimmick of this of course everything

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.319 
gimmick of this of course everything
else<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.100> same<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> generation<00:01:48.090> 1

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
else was just the same as a generation 1

by<00:02:13.739> flipping<00:02:13.980> these<00:02:14.250> little<00:02:14.489> tabs<00:02:15.269> back<00:02:15.659> on

by flipping these little tabs back on

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.640 
by flipping these little tabs back on
both<00:02:16.500> sides<00:02:17.569> then<00:02:18.569> we<00:02:18.659> get<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> wheels<00:02:19.079> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
both sides then we get the wheels the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.770 
both sides then we get the wheels the
front<00:02:19.829> wheel<00:02:19.950> sorry<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.489> just<00:02:20.700> spin<00:02:21.659> them

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
front wheel sorry and we just spin them

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.869 
front wheel sorry and we just spin them
around<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.500> inside<00:02:23.159> but<00:02:23.519> she's<00:02:23.640> quite

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
around like that inside but she's quite

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.100 
around like that inside but she's quite
neat<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:24.629> white<00:02:24.900> light<00:02:25.140> actually<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:26.610> we

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
neat like white light actually then we

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.559 
neat like white light actually then we
simply<00:02:28.129> have<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.159> detach<00:02:29.640> these<00:02:30.090> little

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
simply have to detach these little

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.780 
simply have to detach these little
sections<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:31.680> both<00:02:31.920> sides<00:02:32.220> which<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.609> be<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
sections on both sides which can be a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.809 
sections on both sides which can be a
little<00:02:32.970> bit<00:02:33.150> annoying<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.489> go

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
little bit annoying then we have to go

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.630 
little bit annoying then we have to go
inside<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.599> then<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:37.769> grab<00:02:38.069> this<00:02:38.310> filler

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
inside and then we grab this filler

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.649 
inside and then we grab this filler
right<00:02:39.480> by<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.689> torso<00:02:41.090> here<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.180> go<00:02:42.359> right

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
right by the torso here we go right

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.130 
right by the torso here we go right
there

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
there

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.500 
there
and<00:02:43.409> then<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.680> flip<00:02:44.069> them<00:02:44.220> around<00:02:44.329> then<00:02:45.329> we

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
and then we flip them around then we

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.440 
and then we flip them around then we
split<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.079> legs<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:47.299> rotate<00:02:48.299> them

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
split the legs like that rotate them

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.220 
split the legs like that rotate them
around<00:02:48.480> at<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.870> waist<00:02:49.099> like<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:51.079> flip<00:02:52.079> a

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
around at the waist like that flip a

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.020 
around at the waist like that flip a
little<00:02:52.560> feet<00:02:52.799> there<00:02:53.670> we<00:02:53.790> go<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:55.440> there<00:02:56.030> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
little feet there we go and there and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.410 
little feet there we go and there and
that<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.299> him<00:02:57.510> nearly<00:02:57.930> almost<00:02:58.079> dumb<00:02:59.150> now<00:03:00.150> what

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
that is him nearly almost dumb now what

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.059 
that is him nearly almost dumb now what
do<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.629> to<00:03:00.720> do<00:03:00.870> next<00:03:01.079> I<00:03:01.319> have<00:03:01.409> to<00:03:01.530> separate

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
do I have to do next I have to separate

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.420 
do I have to do next I have to separate
them<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:03.450> at<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:04.170> door<00:03:04.620> section<00:03:05.159> there

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
them just at the door section there

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.509 
them just at the door section there
right<00:03:05.670> there<00:03:06.329> we<00:03:06.420> go<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.810> selfie<00:03:07.430> all<00:03:08.430> right

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
right there we go to selfie all right

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.140 
right there we go to selfie all right
that<00:03:08.840> way<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:09.959> we<00:03:10.079> go<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.670> then<00:03:11.849> we<00:03:11.939> just

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
that way here we go and then we just

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.000 
that way here we go and then we just
sort<00:03:12.359> of<00:03:12.389> like<00:03:12.599> break<00:03:13.290> him<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.739> little<00:03:13.859> bit

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
sort of like break him up a little bit

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.930 
sort of like break him up a little bit
rotate<00:03:14.909> these<00:03:15.359> around<00:03:16.370> that's<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.519> best<00:03:17.760> way

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
rotate these around that's the best way

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.020 
rotate these around that's the best way
I<00:03:17.970> found<00:03:18.180> out<00:03:18.359> or<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.629> it<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:20.030> one

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
I found out or do it like that and one

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.580 
I found out or do it like that and one
is<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.480> we<00:03:21.629> get<00:03:21.750> these<00:03:21.900> little<00:03:22.290> tab

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
is like that we get these little tab

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.610 
is like that we get these little tab
things<00:03:23.069> flip<00:03:23.669> them<00:03:23.849> up<00:03:24.000> on<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.470> rotate<00:03:25.470> that

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
things flip them up on that rotate that

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.119 
things flip them up on that rotate that
round<00:03:25.889> like<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.099> so<00:03:26.639> it's<00:03:26.760> under<00:03:26.970> his<00:03:27.060> arm<00:03:28.129> do

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
round like that so it's under his arm do

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.939 
round like that so it's under his arm do
the<00:03:29.250> same<00:03:29.459> on<00:03:29.579> this<00:03:29.730> one<00:03:30.139> now<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.379> he's<00:03:31.620> almost

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
the same on this one now and he's almost

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.869 
the same on this one now and he's almost
done<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.370> fact<00:03:32.579> we<00:03:33.299> just<00:03:33.510> lift<00:03:33.780> these<00:03:33.959> up<00:03:34.879> get

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
done in fact we just lift these up get

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.970 
done in fact we just lift these up get
these<00:03:36.000> little<00:03:36.299> tabs<00:03:36.720> sections<00:03:37.440> here<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.829> flip

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
these little tabs sections here and flip

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.439 
these little tabs sections here and flip
them<00:03:38.159> under<00:03:38.370> there<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.879> tuck<00:03:39.060> them<00:03:39.209> away

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
them under there to tuck them away

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.550 
them under there to tuck them away
nice<00:03:39.720> wait<00:03:40.250> then<00:03:41.250> we<00:03:41.669> just<00:03:42.479> simply<00:03:42.989> where<00:03:43.440> am<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
nice wait then we just simply where am I

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.809 
nice wait then we just simply where am I
going<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:43.829> here<00:03:44.220> we<00:03:44.310> go

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
going now here we go

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.110 
going now here we go
rotate<00:03:45.629> them<00:03:45.810> there<00:03:46.159> bring<00:03:47.159> that<00:03:47.250> down<00:03:47.489> rotate

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
rotate them there bring that down rotate

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.259 
rotate them there bring that down rotate
yep<00:03:48.590> then<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.859> like<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.280> spin<00:03:50.729> these<00:03:50.909> and

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
yep then I like to just spin these and

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.280 
yep then I like to just spin these and
just<00:03:51.510> place<00:03:51.780> them<00:03:51.989> on<00:03:52.169> his<00:03:52.409> back<00:03:52.829> like<00:03:53.129> that

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
just place them on his back like that

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.729 
just place them on his back like that
there<00:03:55.290> we<00:03:55.319> go

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
there we go

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.729 
there we go
now<00:03:56.400> then<00:03:57.019> last<00:03:58.019> bit<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.319> its<00:03:58.440> transformation

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
now then last bit of its transformation

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.710 
now then last bit of its transformation
we<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.400> simply<00:03:59.669> grab<00:03:59.940> one<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.269> these<00:04:00.419> front

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
we just simply grab one of these front

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.270 
we just simply grab one of these front
lights<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.199> we<00:04:01.260> move<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.560> forward<00:04:01.949> and<00:04:02.069> his

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
lights and we move it forward and his

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550 
lights and we move it forward and his
head<00:04:02.519> will<00:04:02.669> fit<00:04:02.879> round<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.019> there<00:04:04.409> we

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
head will fit round like that there we

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.949 
head will fit round like that there we
go<00:04:04.709> pretty<00:04:05.639> cool<00:04:05.790> then<00:04:06.419> we<00:04:06.510> get<00:04:06.659> this<00:04:06.780> little

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
go pretty cool then we get this little

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.990 
go pretty cool then we get this little
back<00:04:07.199> section<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.859> that's<00:04:08.099> just<00:04:08.370> foot<00:04:08.729> stuck

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
back section and that's just foot stuck

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.569 
back section and that's just foot stuck
into<00:04:09.209> there<00:04:09.569> finds<00:04:10.319> a<00:04:10.440> little<00:04:10.739> open<00:04:11.069> space<00:04:11.220> is

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
into there finds a little open space is

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.550 
into there finds a little open space is
pretty<00:04:11.849> good<00:04:11.970> then<00:04:12.720> we<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:12.959> rotate<00:04:13.409> his<00:04:13.530> head

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
pretty good then we just rotate his head

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.719 
pretty good then we just rotate his head
and<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.769> universal<00:04:16.769> fellow<00:04:17.039> in<00:04:17.370> robot

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
and that is universal fellow in robot

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.879 
and that is universal fellow in robot
mode<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.840> really<00:04:19.079> do<00:04:19.199> like<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.409> all<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.769> is

mode and I really do like it all you is

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:20.960 
mode and I really do like it all you is
supposed<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.220> flip<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.519> little<00:04:20.639> section

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
supposed to flip this little section

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.970 
supposed to flip this little section
down<00:04:21.299> there<00:04:21.510> but<00:04:21.659> my

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
down there but my

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.650 
down there but my
keen<00:04:22.220> on<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:22.400> looks<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:22.730> bit<00:04:22.760> strange<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.630> be

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
keen on that looks a bit strange to be

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.890 
keen on that looks a bit strange to be
honest<00:04:24.370> there<00:04:25.370> we<00:04:25.460> go<00:04:25.610> he's<00:04:25.790> got<00:04:26.000> articulation

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
honest there we go he's got articulation

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.230 
honest there we go he's got articulation
in<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.350> about<00:04:27.560> everywhere<00:04:28.010> he<00:04:28.610> will<00:04:28.760> move

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
in just about everywhere he will move

get these little arms there put them
down

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
down

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.160 
down
rotate<00:05:43.010> these<00:05:43.160> little<00:05:43.430> silver<00:05:44.000> chrome<00:05:44.870> bits

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
rotate these little silver chrome bits

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.920 
rotate these little silver chrome bits
all<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.950> way<00:05:46.010> around<00:05:46.280> like<00:05:46.400> that<00:05:46.730> and<00:05:47.060> put

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
all the way around like that and put

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.480 
all the way around like that and put
that<00:05:48.050> one<00:05:48.500> stiffer<00:05:48.890> than<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.130> other<00:05:49.310> one<00:05:49.430> for

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
that one stiffer than the other one for

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.970 
that one stiffer than the other one for
some<00:05:49.640> reason<00:05:50.170> then<00:05:51.170> we<00:05:51.260> get<00:05:51.380> this<00:05:51.500> section

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
some reason then we get this section

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.610 
some reason then we get this section
this<00:05:52.520> is<00:05:52.580> a<00:05:52.790> weird<00:05:53.000> transformation<00:05:53.690> so<00:05:54.440> I<00:05:54.470> got

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
this is a weird transformation so I got

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.710 
this is a weird transformation so I got
to<00:05:54.680> flipping<00:05:54.920> it<00:05:55.010> around<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:56.210> just<00:05:56.450> flips

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
to flipping it around that just flips

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.900 
to flipping it around that just flips
into<00:05:56.900> there<00:05:57.110> and<00:05:57.710> then<00:05:57.920> this<00:05:58.250> whole<00:05:58.550> thing

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
into there and then this whole thing

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.480 
into there and then this whole thing
just<00:05:59.120> collapses<00:06:00.010> and<00:06:01.010> then<00:06:01.190> he's<00:06:01.310> got<00:06:01.460> a

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
just collapses and then he's got a

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.240 
just collapses and then he's got a
little<00:06:01.520> hook<00:06:01.910> bit<00:06:02.390> just<00:06:02.840> there<00:06:03.200> that's<00:06:04.100> gonna

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
little hook bit just there that's gonna

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.670 
little hook bit just there that's gonna
go<00:06:04.460> right<00:06:04.640> under<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.030> rope<00:06:05.180> there<00:06:05.570> we<00:06:05.810> go<00:06:05.960> then

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
go right under the rope there we go then

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.770 
go right under the rope there we go then
we<00:06:06.710> get<00:06:06.920> this<00:06:07.040> little<00:06:07.220> section<00:06:07.820> and<00:06:08.000> rotate<00:06:08.630> it

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
we get this little section and rotate it

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.080 
we get this little section and rotate it
all<00:06:08.900> the<00:06:08.960> way<00:06:09.080> back<00:06:09.260> down<00:06:09.700> and<00:06:10.700> there<00:06:10.850> we<00:06:10.970> go

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
all the way back down and there we go

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.810 
all the way back down and there we go
then<00:06:11.390> we<00:06:11.420> can<00:06:11.660> put<00:06:11.870> these<00:06:11.930> little<00:06:12.140> hands<00:06:12.320> in

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
then we can put these little hands in

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.950 
then we can put these little hands in
now<00:06:13.820> you<00:06:13.910> can<00:06:14.060> tell<00:06:14.210> this<00:06:14.300> intergeneration

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
now you can tell this intergeneration

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.900 
now you can tell this intergeneration
too<00:06:15.080> because<00:06:15.500> you<00:06:16.010> start<00:06:16.250> spring<00:06:16.580> fired

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
too because you start spring fired

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.160 
too because you start spring fired
things<00:06:17.240> on<00:06:17.360> air<00:06:17.510> but<00:06:17.600> I<00:06:17.690> took<00:06:17.750> them<00:06:18.020> out<00:06:18.140> for

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.170 
things on air but I took them out for

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.530 
things on air but I took them out for
the<00:06:18.380> generation<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:18.860> release<00:06:19.340> let<00:06:20.300> me<00:06:20.360> just

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
the generation to release let me just

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.760 
the generation to release let me just
put<00:06:20.690> the<00:06:20.750> right<00:06:20.900> ones<00:06:21.110> in<00:06:21.290> the<00:06:21.350> right<00:06:21.470> house

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
put the right ones in the right house

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.140 
put the right ones in the right house
