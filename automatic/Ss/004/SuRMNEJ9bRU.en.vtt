a day so

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.729 
a day so
it's<00:02:09.359> probably<00:02:09.689> why<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:10.019> weren't<00:02:10.409> doing

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
it's probably why they weren't doing

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.619 
it's probably why they weren't doing
what<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.099> wanted<00:02:11.579> and<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.849> stopped<00:02:12.120> taking<00:02:12.359> them

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
what I wanted and I stopped taking them

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.030 
what I wanted and I stopped taking them
because<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:12.989> weren't<00:02:13.170> doing<00:02:13.290> what<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.560> wanted

because they weren't doing what I wanted

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.190 
because they weren't doing what I wanted
but<00:02:14.459> maybe<00:02:14.640> that's<00:02:14.819> because<00:02:14.939> I<00:02:15.450> wasn't<00:02:15.689> taking

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
but maybe that's because I wasn't taking

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.990 
but maybe that's because I wasn't taking
what<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.409> was<00:02:16.590> supposed<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.069> taking<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:17.939> you
