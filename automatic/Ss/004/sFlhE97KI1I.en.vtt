00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.099
 dear beekeepers friends my name is bernd 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.470
 ani i am already known by that 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.669
 bees are probably well 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.610
 composite 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:26.090
 whether hydrochloric acid citric essential 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.039
 oils sugar and water and is like that 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.019
 built it together only 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.230
 superficially works in the hair dress 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.440
 the bees and the mite are not allowed anymore 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.350
 her will find and therefore falls down 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.559
 and thus starves the relationship mite 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.890
 and bee is drizzling through this 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.489
 disturbed and that's what it was then 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.769
 has been referred to as a care product 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.479
 it has to be well shaken I can 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.680
 just recommend to everyone he should get involved 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.650
 take a shot glass 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.489
 with ten milliliters and there you can still 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.589
 go for a drive and then find out 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.950
 because of how often the back and forth 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.580
 and how much it consumes 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.970
 so it is very small you come often 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.410
 it does not take more than ten milliliters 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.100
 to push the bottle 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.880
 because that's how it works automatically 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:29.570
 through the thin gooseneck in one 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.820
 very thin form c12 milliliter so that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.680
 is actually the maximum one you can 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.940
 we need now as the leftovers 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.550
 and education 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.560
 with the bee flat the rest and 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.870
 education is one of the autumn 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.790
 key measures for the coming 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.790
 bee year and is crucial first 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.320
 once that bottle bees well 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.020
 is warmed up and that we do that 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.790
 At home we put it in the warm water 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.479
 Make and keep warm or baby warm 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.670
 heat up this liquid 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.940
 and then you do it in the newspaper 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.849
 wrapping and so keeps us the hours 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.069
 long warm that we use it everywhere 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.510
 Of course, it is always crucial 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:20.420
 again where does the people have their place? 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.340
 upholstery center and you have the sides 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.820
 were not necessarily treat because 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.220
 to form there 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.530
 So we have the center here about 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.690
 eight honeycomb checkouts 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.970
 we take care of ourselves and they will 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.250
 we treat and at the bottom 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.920
 You can always see that underlies 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.440
 Center of mildness in this area 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.680
 So in 67 were in the center of the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.790
 bee colonies fall the mild and on 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.220
 hardly edge 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.700
 she once again shows here it just needs to 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.380
 drive this where the bee colony sits 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.780
 drizzling this area is enough 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:11.340
 through the scales cash registers 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:16.360
 once twice three times four times five times 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.710
 six times and thus still good climate 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.840
 in the outer class seven times 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.630
 that's enough and we have 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.720
 as previously demonstrated this 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.780
 amount now a lot of dribbles 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.970
 the bees are tolerated that is enough 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.280
 now westend message westend 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.920
 education is basically only once 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.170
 performed and now fall 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.210
 You can be exceptionally mild 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.250
 eight to ten or twelve days later 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.040
 the same treatment again 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.190
 Carry out and after the cabins well 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.380
 So up to 10 15 days directly in the bee colony 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.020
 and always mild 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.150
 that is the proof for it then you can 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.140
 again a westend education 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.590
 carry out 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.990
 in the course of the summer and in the times 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.240
 with the block treatment there is now 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.580
 set six to seven days in the 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.820
 distance and three times in a row 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.750
 So first day seventh day 14 days or 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.630
 21 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.010
 and in this time he is pretty much the one 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.320
 whole wild population does not hatch 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.570
 and you have achieved pretty much everything 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.080
 what you could achieve 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.350
 in the 21 days yes hatch constantly 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.860
 play and in the 21 days we want 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.389
 reach all many 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.419
 even the young bees hatch 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.909
 mites and therefore the idea 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.750
 Carrying out the block treatment with 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.750
 the bee well
