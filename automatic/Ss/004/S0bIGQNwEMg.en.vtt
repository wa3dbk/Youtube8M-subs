lead<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.580> course<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.220> usually<00:00:24.119> make<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
lead of course and then I usually make a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.269 
lead of course and then I usually make a
list<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.840> stuff<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.920> wouldn't<00:00:26.070> for

itch to mail me whatever reference she
has<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.040> then<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.340> into<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.940> layout<00:00:39.149> phase

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
has and then I go into a layout phase

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510 
has and then I go into a layout phase
where<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.780> usually<00:00:40.500> started<00:00:40.980> laying<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
where I usually started laying out the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.860 
where I usually started laying out the
whole<00:00:41.700> book<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> make<00:00:43.079> kind<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.410> an<00:00:43.530> image<00:00:43.739> map

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
whole book and make kind of an image map

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.889 
whole book and make kind of an image map
where<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.100> pages<00:00:47.719> next<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.809> each

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
where I have all the pages next to each

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.569 
where I have all the pages next to each
other<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.260> way<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.500> would<00:00:49.649> appear<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
other the way they would appear in a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
other the way they would appear in a
printed<00:00:50.879> book<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:52.260> page<00:00:52.530> goes

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
printed book so I know what page goes

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.400 
printed book so I know what page goes
next<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> other<00:00:55.379> page<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.550> there's<00:00:56.760> no

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
next to to the other page so there's no

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.299 
next to to the other page so there's no
sometimes<00:00:58.410> there's<00:00:58.530> there's<00:00:58.829> weird<00:00:59.070> tangent

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
sometimes there's there's weird tangent

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
sometimes there's there's weird tangent
stuff<00:00:59.699> setting<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.300> happen<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
stuff setting that can happen if you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510 
stuff setting that can happen if you
don't<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> don't<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> page<00:01:02.160> next<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
don't if you don't see the page next to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
don't if you don't see the page next to
each<00:01:02.609> other<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.030> usually<00:01:03.210> try<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.170> avoid

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
each other so I usually try to avoid

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.370 
each other so I usually try to avoid
that<00:01:05.150> once<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> layout<00:01:06.570> figured<00:01:07.260> out

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that once I have the layout figured out

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
that once I have the layout figured out
I<00:01:08.070> usually<00:01:08.760> go<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:08.909> into<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> penciling

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
I usually go right into the penciling

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.399 
I usually go right into the penciling
phase<00:01:10.400> which<00:01:11.400> nowadays<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.570> pretty<00:01:13.320> much

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
phase which nowadays I do pretty much

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.820 
phase which nowadays I do pretty much
how<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.740> percent<00:01:14.100> digitally<00:01:15.140> because<00:01:16.140> digital

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
how to percent digitally because digital

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
how to percent digitally because digital
just<00:01:17.130> has<00:01:17.310> great<00:01:17.520> editing<00:01:18.330> options<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:19.020> can

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
just has great editing options them can

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010 
just has great editing options them can
you<00:01:20.340> know<00:01:20.430> issues<00:01:21.030> screwed<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.570> drawing<00:01:21.810> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you know issues screwed up drawing a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
you know issues screwed up drawing a
large<00:01:23.009> head<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.400> something<00:01:23.610> gonna<00:01:23.880> actually

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
large head or something gonna actually

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760 
large head or something gonna actually
erase<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.509> redraw<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.259> shrink

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
erase and redraw it you can just shrink

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.310 
erase and redraw it you can just shrink
it<00:01:25.950> down<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.700> position<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.900> just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
it down and position it or you can just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.350 
it down and position it or you can just
even<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.799> layout<00:01:29.009> phase<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.790> much<00:01:30.000> easier<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
even in layout phase it's much easier to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
even in layout phase it's much easier to
try<00:01:30.600> different<00:01:30.780> things<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> would<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.280> on

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
try different things then it would be on

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.399 
try different things then it would be on
with<00:01:33.119> pencil<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.509> paper<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.170> can

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
with pencil on paper because you can

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.749 
with pencil on paper because you can
just<00:01:34.560> move<00:01:34.680> stuff<00:01:34.890> around<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.310> much<00:01:35.369> easier

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
just move stuff around so much easier

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.020 
just move stuff around so much easier
and<00:01:36.200> scale<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> whatever<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> usually

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
and scale it whatever and then I usually

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.920 
and scale it whatever and then I usually
I<00:01:39.930> print<00:01:40.710> out<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.729> turn<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.570> turn<00:01:42.840> my

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
I print out I I turn out my I turn my

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109 
I print out I I turn out my I turn my
pencils<00:01:43.259> blue<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.549> looks<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
pencils blue so it looks like like a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.870 
pencils blue so it looks like like a
blue<00:01:45.360> line<00:01:45.540> drawing<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.049> printed<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.530> on

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
blue line drawing and I printed out on

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.840 
blue line drawing and I printed out on
an<00:01:47.880> 11<00:01:48.299> by<00:01:48.390> 17<00:01:48.689> paper<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.439> inked<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.860> using

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
an 11 by 17 paper and I inked it using

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.940 
an 11 by 17 paper and I inked it using
whatever<00:01:51.840> has<00:01:52.079> laying<00:01:52.320> around<00:01:52.439> usually<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
whatever has laying around usually a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.880 
whatever has laying around usually a
brush<00:01:53.280> needs<00:01:54.409> some<00:01:55.409> microns<00:01:55.799> maybe

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
brush needs some microns maybe

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
brush needs some microns maybe
especially<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:57.119> straight<00:01:57.329> lines<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.750> a

scene it has more page than 1 to it then

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.150 
scene it has more page than 1 to it then
