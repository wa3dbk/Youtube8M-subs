00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:02.290
 Hello who are you what are you doing 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.090
 Hi, I am Tom from or Sports around here today to a bit of change 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.760
 tell and then of two following the superstar is one thats motorsport 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.369
 deep c is allowed more 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.359
 the mode orchestra large community of victims between 1 8 million visitors 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.949
 the right thing to say is the big community of Europe 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.949
 one speaks of Rolf with us his but Austria Switzerland could also 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.230
 You can tell us everything about cars or their mobility 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.550
 So escort motor or similar ticks and to do so 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.409
 a colorful advantage must speak so completely 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.090
 Communities introduce a spongy word Apple's iOS as a magazine than 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.890
 above a bit of both hobbyist times quite the product 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.699
 yes, that's important 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.120
 permanently a little less to the other to this course no 

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:45.119
 Launched as a phone in 2001, there are already dinosaurs 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.430
 classically nowadays 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.660
 the hot generous discussions to each other spread across 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.770
 all sorts of things 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.560
 Moving in the automobile that is announcing 9 over 9 90 percent of the content and the 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.930
 Also, the zoos team tend to be actual use with partners 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.370
 publish with us on the platform 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.789
 and then put together in the form of American Water Team 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.480
 Concert Bernard's only community magazine rest so well 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.130
 Boca Chica by our users in the context of this magazine percent contain 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.950
 and thereby would have tried greater variety of oaks 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.030
 March there is a phase that every third with me could not give then 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.360
 the whole case so that every second entered again 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.440
 Question is always for the money you do not need ships sees it with you 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.510
 So by earning a community foundation 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.820
 Enders can be done relatively hard 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.340
 around us it is so that we have existed quite a long time by also in 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.250
 We have not had so many in the past 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.100
 Community forums on the subject of car league the name on the fan groups 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.130
 had a good start percent between it making a lot of our a country 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.720
 that results from advertising 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.510
 but also there try relatively reduced to tackle completely and you them 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.939
 not to someone of the pop-art prof other 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.230
 These are all prefixed but that gets the publicity 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.440
 just not the main purpose but to use the advertising to finance 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.929
 and we also work very closely with open resistance 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.990
 and to give them the opportunity to approach the drivers but us 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.199
 are and are then only so-called operation with what is found 

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:04.050
 also a bit with consulting services that no longer deserves 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.360
 when I think from the user's point of view now what's coming up with something like this 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.579
 terrorists 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.359
 Brawn is so that no one is looking around but is a good keyword world 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.219
 many actually just say that 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.729
 no idea Audi a6 cooling water gets hotter and then throw more rules 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.879
 Hit Motorsport because they already said a lot about the topic of the automobile 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.589
 has been 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.489
 to the man between ever spent 20 million contributions if one 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.679
 The takeover then starts up the tower twice as high 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.699
 So there are really many answers to the classical problem of 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.909
 Everyday with his car also how expensive that is in a review or what you can 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.309
 maybe we can fix it ourselves if you go on it 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.869
 Has 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:42.319
 that means for classic Mr. Onlinern that does not exist but there are more 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.700
 We do not value the distance 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.629
 undisturbed opinion of other motorists 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.579
 Unlimited clear help if I have a problem 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.529
 I thought to Munich from the scrubbing generation but we 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.339
 until he has technology screwdrivers 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.599
 Wheatley bisserl get to mothers day as Swertz Genesis of the 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.349
 country 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.629
 yes, I would love to shrink and scary fascinating percent 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.759
 also impossible per car and like 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.499
 We're losing a dirty one but I'm afraid the change may be 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.199
 But do not do it anymore 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.579
 Mattes &amp; Ammann together 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.509
 That's why Mr. Buschmann is actually one of the audit study shows 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:18.239
 then percent at the time of the New Economy to 20 agency landscape once 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.849
 experienced it was very very instructive 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.829
 So it's been me since September 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.999
 and am now 2000 percent 6 2007 Motorsport 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.560
 and I am now responsible for everything that is so organizational 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.069
 the song composes the same as technical power 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.169
 The shot goes around Bert and the Hang Seng Mamm in May decided that he said 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.529
 has okay i do technique 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.059
 Percent you have to do the rest 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:45.299
 Do not clear under the dike now either 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.949
 What is more fun because I feel so connected with people and 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.229
 Model traffic problem several times at Brink 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.159
 The situation has been gracing since I play out of the weather 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.989
 we have around 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:54.950
 to serve the principle 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.310
 in the original founder 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.390
 and the wings of the Professor of Burials had normalized the whole 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.189
 Ever made it what it is about 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.399
 along with the percent of ten members 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.699
 but we are also informed about this as a shareholder on board 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.089
 Database company and yet on board then but the springer-Verlag 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.739
 and in Eutin from Ashanti we still support us well 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.529
 the deputy 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:18.250
 Persons the turbo-motors between is around this CPUs place mobile community too 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.129
 the topic 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.109
 to grow up very well for her 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.820
 which still have many couples from format waiting for us forums are now 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:25.840
 not for everyone 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.470
 that's why we're doing a bit more on the program under Blogs and this 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.400
 continue reading 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.380
 Everyone just wants to stay in the areas that are easier to consume 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.460

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.870

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.340
 Opinions and information about the car to make much smaller tangible 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.930
 as of course not pending behind 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.990
 we also try to touch it 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.960
 a develop further 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.039
 by itself professionals to already have these communities "Can you be so

 Arques Kugel kullert channel or rather direct sales or rather social

 Cooperation food was good so it has turned out to be classic job application 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.949
 keep working great with us 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.030
 and say it does about one-third of our mouse 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.670
 with us, of course, powerful Enders big factor because you yourself 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.830
 for automobiles and reported on many of Motor Rice and Alicia 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.300
 Sentence course itself offered there as well that of course ran out that too 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.099
 Robert Hock 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.150
 otherwise, of course, I still have an unmanageable number of 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:25.379
 Affiliate programs that you can do with it one always has to look a bit 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.620
 that is not out of proportion so does 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.279
 so that users are not too strong 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.550
 Date become overwhelmed 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.490
 and otherwise 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.569
 is of course still without classic banner advertising 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.100
 Possibility that obviously compensates too much where else to be careful 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.960
 guess because it is very pretty then works 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.460
 but has a certain size 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.410
 Fire it is quite difficult for a heat pump to death the big advantage 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.289
 we meanwhile 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.569
 about as big as car run or car engine sport and car

 So that can be on the inside of the dome the motorists 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.750
 Hunt within reach is fiercely easy as you are still 5 6 1 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:01.859
 this with the current government offered him a better half of my office 

00:06:01.859 --> 00:06:05.259
 can sometimes be that you see it or missing so show what is coming 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.490
 So do not mess around in these counters 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.360
 In fact we started motor racing as the main engine of Toralf Mama's Grandma 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.939

 Pam 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.119
 but it's so we're on special topics 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.219
 so far, for example, make a good example 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.570
 that we are all ahead of time and looking for 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.530
 with it the SCM 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.659
 Bender again motivate us to come by but that I am

 Rivets 2 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.820
 when I'm genuinely generating for the grandmother because that's the most 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.450
 and that's about the content and then decide to stay with us 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.719
 wherever I am 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:51.719

 Pogatetz statements Bonse four men why everything to men 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.560

 and I have always 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.990
 that's a lot harder to decide is usually not wanting to do just about
