anime and said plat ultimate break and
all<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.470> good<00:02:16.620> stuff<00:02:17.480> but<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.510> guess<00:02:18.690> um<00:02:19.340> just

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
all that good stuff but I guess um just

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.550 
all that good stuff but I guess um just
want<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.610> describe<00:02:20.970> some<00:02:21.750> strategy<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.530> I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
want to describe some strategy that I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.130 
want to describe some strategy that I
used<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.580> sneak<00:02:23.910> peak<00:02:24.120> which<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.660> guess

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
used for the sneak peak which I guess

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.630 
used for the sneak peak which I guess
kind<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.440> defeats<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.860> purpose<00:02:26.010> since<00:02:26.489> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
kind of defeats the purpose since the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.199 
kind of defeats the purpose since the
sneak<00:02:26.880> peaks<00:02:27.120> are<00:02:27.270> over<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:28.680> whatever<00:02:29.209> so

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
sneak peaks are over but whatever so

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.180 
sneak peaks are over but whatever so
these<00:02:30.360> cards<00:02:30.840> are<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.050> cars<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.470> felt<00:02:31.800> were

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
these cards are the cars I felt were

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.110 
these cards are the cars I felt were
like<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.610> all-stars<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.690> didn't<00:02:33.900> know

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
like the all-stars and I didn't know

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.210 
like the all-stars and I didn't know
much<00:02:36.120> about<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.600> set<00:02:36.810> before<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.500> drafted<00:02:38.130> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
much about the set before I drafted the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.860 
much about the set before I drafted the
for<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.430> first<00:02:38.640> day<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:39.209> when<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> opened<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.780> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
for the first day but when I opened up a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.580 
for the first day but when I opened up a
pack<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.500> saw<00:02:40.680> these<00:02:40.890> grade<00:02:41.220> tues<00:02:42.410> or<00:02:43.410> these

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
pack and I saw these grade tues or these

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.380 
pack and I saw these grade tues or these
great<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.010> specifically<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.850> one<00:02:44.970> we<00:02:45.120> top

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
great to specifically the one we top

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.210 
great to specifically the one we top
deck<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.630> grade<00:02:45.900> one<00:02:46.110> or<00:02:46.200> two<00:02:46.380> like<00:02:47.040> I

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
deck a grade one or two like I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.880 
deck a grade one or two like I
immediately<00:02:47.489> just<00:02:48.000> took<00:02:48.269> all<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:48.989> these<00:02:49.590> any

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
immediately just took all of these any

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.570 
immediately just took all of these any
time<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.130> saw<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.290> these<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:53.040> met<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.370> so

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
time I saw it so these just met you so

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.789 
time I saw it so these just met you so
much<00:02:53.760> advantage<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.930> if<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.590> have

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
much advantage and like if you have

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.289 
much advantage and like if you have
enough<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.220> these<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.519> your<00:02:56.610> deck<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.030> you

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
enough of these in your deck and you

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.320 
enough of these in your deck and you
play<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.080> into<00:02:58.530> another<00:02:58.650> grade<00:02:59.069> 2<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.580> 2

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
play this into another grade 2 and 2

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.000 
play this into another grade 2 and 2
another<00:03:00.450> grade<00:03:00.810> 2<00:03:00.989> or<00:03:01.230> grade<00:03:01.440> 1<00:03:01.650> or<00:03:01.769> whatever

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
another grade 2 or grade 1 or whatever

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.949 
another grade 2 or grade 1 or whatever
it<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.790> set<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.239> far<00:03:03.450> ahead<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
it just set you so far ahead in the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.610 
it just set you so far ahead in the
limited<00:03:04.350> draft<00:03:04.590> format<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.220> then<00:03:06.290> these<00:03:07.290> guys

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
limited draft format and then these guys

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.840 
limited draft format and then these guys
the<00:03:08.340> aquaphor<00:03:08.850> skies<00:03:10.250> these<00:03:11.250> were<00:03:11.430> awesome

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
the aquaphor skies these were awesome

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.400 
the aquaphor skies these were awesome
too<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.450> just<00:03:12.630> counterblast<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.350> you

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
too like you just counterblast and you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.670 
too like you just counterblast and you
get<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.620> swap<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.579> just<00:03:14.820> attack<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.840> draft

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
get to swap so just attack and in draft

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.069 
get to swap so just attack and in draft
I<00:03:16.890> find<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:17.790> going<00:03:18.180> all<00:03:18.359> out<00:03:18.390> as<00:03:18.840> soon

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
I find that just going all out as soon

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.410 
I find that just going all out as soon
as<00:03:19.230> possible<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.890> your<00:03:20.070> best<00:03:20.310> strategy<00:03:21.980> and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
as possible is your best strategy and

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.960 
as possible is your best strategy and
then<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.930> if<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.500> didn't<00:03:25.890> pull<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.700> one<00:03:26.850> of

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
then this if you didn't pull like one of

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.810 
then this if you didn't pull like one of
the<00:03:27.030> rare<00:03:27.290> Vanguard<00:03:28.290> grade<00:03:28.620> threes<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.640> was

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
the rare Vanguard grade threes this was

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.060 
the rare Vanguard grade threes this was
probably<00:03:30.000> your<00:03:30.299> best<00:03:30.480> option<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.769> lets<00:03:31.920> you

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
probably your best option so it lets you

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.949 
probably your best option so it lets you
discard<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.579> card<00:03:32.609> four<00:03:33.000> plus<00:03:33.239> six<00:03:33.299> thousand

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
discard a card four plus six thousand

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.199 
discard a card four plus six thousand
power<00:03:34.109> so<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:35.130> lets<00:03:35.250> your<00:03:35.400> Vanguard<00:03:35.820> hit<00:03:35.970> over

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
power so it lets your Vanguard hit over

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.340 
power so it lets your Vanguard hit over
21<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.160> then<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.459> was<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> great<00:03:38.940> grade<00:03:39.420> 17<00:03:40.140> k

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
21 and then this was a great grade 17 k

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.250 
21 and then this was a great grade 17 k
and<00:03:40.940> you'll<00:03:41.940> always<00:03:42.239> have<00:03:42.420> most<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.140> time

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
and you'll always have most of the time

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.620 
and you'll always have most of the time
you<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.440> spare<00:03:43.799> counterblast<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.000> he<00:03:45.390> allows

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
you have spare counterblast so he allows

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.560 
you have spare counterblast so he allows
you<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.959> hit<00:03:46.190> those<00:03:47.190> good<00:03:47.459> numbers<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.299> hit

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
you to hit those good numbers and hit

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.610 
you to hit those good numbers and hit
like<00:03:48.600> 20<00:03:49.230> with<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.890> plus<00:03:50.370> 2000<00:03:51.120> grade<00:03:51.870> 3<00:03:52.200> when

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
like 20 with the plus 2000 grade 3 when

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.009 
like 20 with the plus 2000 grade 3 when
it<00:03:52.739> when<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.549> boosted<00:03:53.970> or<00:03:54.150> when<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.630> gets<00:03:54.810> or

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
it when it's boosted or when it gets or

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.509 
it when it's boosted or when it gets or
wanted<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.590> text<00:03:55.859> Vanguard<00:03:58.250> see<00:03:59.250> how<00:03:59.310> these

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
wanted a text Vanguard see how these

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.420 
wanted a text Vanguard see how these
