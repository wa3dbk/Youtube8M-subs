 a record producer, a photographer 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.250
 but above all I am a drummer in the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.539
 last 25 years I have played in many bands 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.160
 Italians of progressive rock power metal 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.349
 the most important records are certainly 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.939
 the first two disks of the labyrinth all 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.519
 all wonderland records 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.769

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.870
 a series of sporadic appearances o 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.520
 as a guest for other bands we are here 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.700
 today to talk to you about an instrument 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.900
 incredible the tracks a lot of battery 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.980
 innovative 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.980
 discover it with us 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.300
 the trans is an incredible battery 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.130
 all in one box I took it apple 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.990
 I'm loaded in the car and I went 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.190
 to the school where I teach entered 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.890
 in the classroom with my students 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.200
 we mounted a snap once 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.390
 mounted I immediately wanted to try the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.930
 response of this battery is 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 incredible it looks like an acoustic drums 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 traditional 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.479
 I tried the tracks only a few minutes 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.630
 but I immediately got a good idea 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.189
 clear of this battery the tom 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.380
 they look like traditional tom I can't 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.470
 understand without stem as they can 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.659
 respond like an acoustic tom with 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.000
 mounted but traditional yet it is 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.549
 incredible really respond like a 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.319
 tom true the snare equal to one 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.619
 answer as acoustic snare drum 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.720
 traditional but also depth la 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.880
 cash did n't impress me so much 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.950
 but it responds very well by loosening the I 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.959
 also found the right punch great for 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.030
 also play more music genres 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.459
 as heavy as the kind I am 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.160
 playing rock and metal a chest of 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.380
 it would seem impossible to do so 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.239
 pull out a sound and pull it instead 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.959
 outside the sound also on the trap yes 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.269
 loosen the skin a little lies the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.069
 right suite home draw and blend the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.480
 answer is like that of a battery 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.480
 traditional acoustics 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.290
 ok as you saw the fast approach 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.020
 on the battery it was incredible 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.300
 in the classrooms of our school we have 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.370
 tried this battery both me and me 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.980
 students and we all had the same 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.870
 impression a lot battery 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.120
 very light professional a lot 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.980
 practice does not sound incredible 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.650
 now let's try to take this 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.200
 let me try and try microfon arla ea 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.209
 record it in the next video we do 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.840
 see how this battery responds in 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.400
 study 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.400
