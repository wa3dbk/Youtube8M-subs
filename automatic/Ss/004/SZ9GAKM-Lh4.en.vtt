00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
the 498 T in the back and the 496 are in

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.220 
the 498 T in the back and the 496 are in
the<00:02:20.000> front<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.890> for<00:02:21.890> me<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.700> pickup<00:02:23.150> has<00:02:23.810> all

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
the front and for me this pickup has all

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.860 
the front and for me this pickup has all
the<00:02:24.470> nuance<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.280> articulation<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.540> like

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
the nuance and articulation that I like

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.690 
the nuance and articulation that I like
to<00:02:27.019> find<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.530> got<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.739> warp<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.280> natural

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
to find it's got a warp the natural

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.680 
to find it's got a warp the natural
warmth<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:31.120> might<00:02:32.120> taste<00:02:32.330> some<00:02:32.599> of

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
warmth to it that might taste some of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.089 
warmth to it that might taste some of
the<00:02:32.750> other<00:02:32.870> pickups<00:02:33.140> didn't<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.860> there

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
the other pickups didn't have there

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.720 
the other pickups didn't have there
maybe<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.430> little<00:02:34.670> too<00:02:34.849> bright<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:36.549> just<00:02:37.549> not

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
maybe a little too bright a just not

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.640 
maybe a little too bright a just not
suited<00:02:38.209> for<00:02:38.390> what<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.569> wanted<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.260> hear<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.530> this

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
suited for what I wanted to hear on this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.030 
suited for what I wanted to hear on this
guitar

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
guitar

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.850 
guitar
so<00:02:40.670> quite<00:02:40.880> happy<00:02:41.180> about<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.630> on<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.530> bottom

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
so quite happy about that on the bottom

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.660 
so quite happy about that on the bottom
here<00:02:43.599> there's<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.870> normal<00:02:47.049> input<00:02:48.670> which

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
here there's the normal input which

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.850 
here there's the normal input which
combines<00:02:50.299> both<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.690> magnetic<00:02:51.349> and<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.560> PI's

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
combines both the magnetic and the PI's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.890 
combines both the magnetic and the PI's
out<00:02:52.069> together<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.269> just<00:02:53.420> blend<00:02:53.599> it<00:02:53.780> in

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
out together so you can just blend it in

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.339 
out together so you can just blend it in
and<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.560> rear<00:02:55.040> tone<00:02:55.549> knob<00:02:55.849> is<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:57.019> volume

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
and the rear tone knob is the volume

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.729 
and the rear tone knob is the volume
knob<00:02:57.560> for<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.420> paison<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.660> run<00:03:00.500> mine

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
knob for the paison I run mine

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.740 
knob for the paison I run mine
separately<00:03:01.549> and<00:03:01.760> there's<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.030> separate<00:03:02.450> jack

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
separately and there's a separate jack

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.039 
separately and there's a separate jack
for<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.410> paison<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.610> run<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.360> direct<00:03:05.750> into

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
for the paison so I run this direct into

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.229 
for the paison so I run this direct into
the<00:03:06.140> house<00:03:06.319> not<00:03:06.620> through<00:03:06.860> an<00:03:06.950> amplifier<00:03:07.430> even

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
the house not through an amplifier even

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.059 
the house not through an amplifier even
when<00:03:08.389> you<00:03:08.450> blend<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.780> through<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.799> has<00:03:09.829> an

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
when you blend it through it's it has an

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.580 
when you blend it through it's it has an
interesting<00:03:10.389> effect<00:03:11.389> if<00:03:12.230> you're<00:03:12.440> going

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
interesting effect if you're going

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.520 
interesting effect if you're going
through<00:03:12.829> you<00:03:13.370> know<00:03:13.489> dirty<00:03:13.790> Channel<00:03:14.269> or<00:03:14.530> that

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
through you know dirty Channel or that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.490 
through you know dirty Channel or that
sort<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.829> thing<00:03:16.069> but<00:03:16.609> certainly<00:03:17.380> through<00:03:18.380> the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
sort of thing but certainly through the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.539 
sort of thing but certainly through the
PA<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.940> has<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.239> very<00:03:20.660> natural<00:03:20.930> sounding<00:03:21.889> almost

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
PA it has a very natural sounding almost

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.629 
PA it has a very natural sounding almost
acoustic<00:03:23.510> as<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.840> pheasant<00:03:24.470> as<00:03:24.799> acoustic<00:03:25.190> as<00:03:25.609> a

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
acoustic as a pheasant as acoustic as a

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.990 
acoustic as a pheasant as acoustic as a
less<00:03:26.120> Balkan<00:03:26.569> sound<00:03:27.519> character<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.790> and

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
less Balkan sound character to it and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.740 
less Balkan sound character to it and
it's<00:03:29.530> incredibly<00:03:30.530> useful<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:31.730> knobs<00:03:31.940> pull<00:03:32.569> up

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
it's incredibly useful the knobs pull up

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.400 
it's incredibly useful the knobs pull up
and<00:03:32.989> push<00:03:33.590> them<00:03:34.540> for<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.690> series<00:03:36.109> in<00:03:36.319> the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
and push them for the series in the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.759 
and push them for the series in the
parallel<00:03:36.829> in<00:03:37.100> in<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.840> pickups<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.109> again<00:03:39.620> you

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
parallel in in the pickups so again you

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.009 
parallel in in the pickups so again you
have<00:03:39.799> some<00:03:40.310> differences<00:03:41.269> in<00:03:41.329> sound<00:03:41.870> and

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
have some differences in sound and

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.050 
have some differences in sound and
character<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.160> great<00:03:43.430> thing<00:03:43.700> when<00:03:43.910> you're

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
character it's a great thing when you're

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.250 
character it's a great thing when you're
sitting<00:03:44.299> around<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.750> doing<00:03:44.840> some<00:03:45.079> writing

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
sitting around and doing some writing

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.849 
sitting around and doing some writing
and<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.790> recording<00:03:47.389> it's<00:03:47.630> again<00:03:48.139> gives<00:03:48.620> great

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
and and recording it's again gives great

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.819 
and and recording it's again gives great
variety<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.370> sound<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.989> for<00:03:51.260> me<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.590> biggest

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
variety and sound and for me the biggest

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.620 
variety and sound and for me the biggest
thing<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:53.299> pies<00:03:53.810> oh<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:56.180> them<00:03:56.389> and

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
thing is the pies oh and and them and

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.120 
thing is the pies oh and and them and
there's<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.019> standard<00:03:57.410> magnetic<00:03:57.799> pickups

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
there's the standard magnetic pickups

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.370 
there's the standard magnetic pickups
the<00:03:58.819> combination<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.750> two<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.200> how<00:04:00.349> I

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
the combination of the two and how I

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.110 
the combination of the two and how I
blend<00:04:00.799> them<00:04:00.919> and<00:04:01.099> use<00:04:01.220> them<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.609> use<00:04:01.819> that

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
blend them and use them and I use that

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.140 
blend them and use them and I use that
combination<00:04:02.889> quite<00:04:03.889> a<00:04:03.919> bit<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.760> know<00:04:04.880> through

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
combination quite a bit you know through

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.430 
combination quite a bit you know through
two<00:04:05.329> different<00:04:05.480> amplifiers<00:04:05.870> as<00:04:06.230> well

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
two different amplifiers as well

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.089 
two different amplifiers as well
response<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.459> set<00:04:08.329> up<00:04:08.560> for<00:04:09.560> me<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.799> have<00:04:09.919> a<00:04:09.950> nice

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
response is set up for me to have a nice

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.369 
response is set up for me to have a nice
really<00:04:10.400> clean<00:04:10.489> sound<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.900> nice<00:04:12.079> dirty

the<00:04:15.740> discussion<00:04:16.280> amongst<00:04:16.730> us<00:04:16.880> is<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.299> quite

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
the discussion amongst us is that quite

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.620 
the discussion amongst us is that quite
possibly<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.920> last<00:04:19.130> major<00:04:19.549> tour<00:04:19.970> that<00:04:20.510> we

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
possibly is the last major tour that we

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.020 
possibly is the last major tour that we
do<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.079> could<00:04:21.680> still<00:04:21.980> see<00:04:22.190> us<00:04:22.340> going<00:04:22.670> out<00:04:22.880> and

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
do I could still see us going out and

do I could still see us going out and
