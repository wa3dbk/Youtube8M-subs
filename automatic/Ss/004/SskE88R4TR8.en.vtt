have a guest connected by the way it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
have a guest connected by the way it
because<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.300> only<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> metal<00:00:45.960> if

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
because you can only get the metal if

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you have like a ah two people play when

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.900 
you have like a ah two people play when
you<00:00:51.059> fondue<00:00:51.420> bar<00:00:51.629> self<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.730> connect<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you fondue bar self then you connect the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.910 
you fondue bar self then you connect the
second<00:00:54.300> control<00:00:54.660> off<00:00:55.370> that's<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.579> did

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.430 

I'm<00:01:02.550> pretty<00:01:02.820> sure<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.089> six<00:01:03.269> other

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
I'm pretty sure the six other

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.520 
I'm pretty sure the six other
kind<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.670> long<00:01:06.420> time<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.870> get<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.530> haven't

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
kind of a long time to get but I haven't

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
kind of a long time to get but I haven't
even<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> yet<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.880> probably<00:01:12.150> gonna

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
even got it yet but it's probably gonna

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.490 
even got it yet but it's probably gonna
take<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> while

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
take a while

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.080 
take a while
I've<00:01:13.890> only<00:01:14.040> had<00:01:14.190> like<00:01:14.310> twenty<00:01:14.640> ribbons<00:01:14.940> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
I've only had like twenty ribbons you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.260 
I've only had like twenty ribbons you
need<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> hundred<00:01:15.600> you'll<00:01:16.440> see<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.270> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
need a hundred you'll see what I do and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.830 
need a hundred you'll see what I do and
I<00:01:18.840> didn't<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.100> technique<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.840> saw

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I didn't think of this technique I saw

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.940 
I didn't think of this technique I saw
this<00:01:22.020> technique<00:01:22.640> on<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:24.110> some<00:01:25.430> website<00:01:27.950> or

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
this technique on like some website or

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
this technique on like some website or
something<00:01:30.680> or<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> saw<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.100> somewhere<00:01:32.720> some

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
something or I saw it somewhere some

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.350 
something or I saw it somewhere some
written<00:01:34.020> form<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.710> made<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.860> video<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and then you make a command post and

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.930 
and then you make a command post and
then<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.259> first<00:01:55.440> one<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.860> don't<00:01:56.070> do

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
then this first one you don't do

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.240 
then this first one you don't do
anything<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.660> just<00:01:57.840> want<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.250> defend

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
anything and you just want to defend

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.040 
anything and you just want to defend
against<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> bosses<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.750> pretty<00:02:00.930> easy

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
against the bosses and it's pretty easy

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.469 
against the bosses and it's pretty easy
I<00:02:01.380> mean<00:02:01.560> depending<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> people<00:02:02.479> it's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
I mean depending out to people it's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.770 
I mean depending out to people it's
pretty<00:02:03.690> easy<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.200> equal<00:02:04.920> melee<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.780> super

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
pretty easy with equal melee and super

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.240 
pretty easy with equal melee and super
reload<00:02:07.050> because<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.470> makes<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.950> bullets

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
reload because it makes like the bullets

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.440 
reload because it makes like the bullets
do<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> lot<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.729> damage<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:10.549> melees<00:02:11.549> do<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
do a lot of damage and melees do is to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.400 
do a lot of damage and melees do is to
kill<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:13.799> pretty<00:02:13.950> easy<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.280> defend<00:02:16.250> but

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
kill so it's pretty easy to defend but

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.009 
kill so it's pretty easy to defend but
so<00:02:19.410> look<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:20.519> top<00:02:20.730> left<00:02:20.970> it'll<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.450> mm

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
so look the top left it'll have mm

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.030 
so look the top left it'll have mm
you'll<00:02:22.860> need<00:02:23.810> 5,000

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
you'll need 5,000

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.729 
you'll need 5,000
anymore<00:02:26.970> again<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.049> another<00:02:28.110> thing<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.530> can

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
anymore again is another thing you can

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.259 
anymore again is another thing you can
do<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.069> sitting<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.640> how<00:02:29.819> do<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.000> like
