here first off what we did we are to

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.350 
here first off what we did we are to
secure<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:23.649> whole<00:00:23.860> area<00:00:24.310> with<00:00:24.489> boot<00:00:25.059> in

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
secure the whole area with boot in

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.659 
secure the whole area with boot in
liners<00:00:25.840> so<00:00:26.020> obviously<00:00:26.710> we'll<00:00:26.950> report<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.340> resin

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
liners so obviously we'll report a resin

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.999 
liners so obviously we'll report a resin
on<00:00:27.790> it<00:00:27.820> doesn't<00:00:28.210> get<00:00:28.300> met<00:00:28.689> in<00:00:28.899> goes<00:00:29.739> on<00:00:29.919> the

vehicle this is a fiberglass madam that

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.520 
vehicle this is a fiberglass madam that
we've<00:00:33.160> used<00:00:33.430> we've<00:00:34.000> pasted<00:00:34.360> it<00:00:34.630> all<00:00:35.080> the<00:00:35.380> way

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
we've used we've pasted it all the way

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.110 
we've used we've pasted it all the way
around<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:35.950> spare<00:00:36.220> wheel<00:00:36.400> compartment<00:00:37.000> and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
around the spare wheel compartment and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.930 
around the spare wheel compartment and
the<00:00:37.690> advantage<00:00:38.200> of<00:00:38.470> using<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.430> fiberglass

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
the advantage of using the fiberglass

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.030 
the advantage of using the fiberglass
it's<00:00:40.180> lightweight<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:40.870> we<00:00:41.290> get<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.590> optimize

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
it's lightweight and we get to optimize

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.620 
it's lightweight and we get to optimize
every<00:00:42.430> bit<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:42.640> airspace<00:00:43.150> that<00:00:43.390> we're<00:00:43.510> going

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
every bit of airspace that we're going

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.610 
every bit of airspace that we're going
to<00:00:43.690> make<00:00:43.840> a<00:00:43.870> sub<00:00:44.170> enclosure<00:00:44.530> with<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.440> I'll

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
look like once we start gluing it all

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.270 
look like once we start gluing it all

jl<00:01:29.640> audio<00:01:29.729> range<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.930> main<00:01:31.200> issue<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.650> using

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
jl audio range the main issue for using

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
jl audio range the main issue for using
this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.729> low<00:01:32.970> power<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.630> only

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
this is it's low power but it's only

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.480 
this is it's low power but it's only
about<00:01:33.930> 200<00:01:34.440> watts<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.280> also

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
about 200 watts and it's also

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.550 
about 200 watts and it's also
lightweight<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.050> not<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.380> away<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
lightweight so it's not going away to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.969 
lightweight so it's not going away to
beat<00:01:37.830> down<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:39.380> right<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.680> we've<00:01:40.830> done

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
beat down at all right what we've done

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
beat down at all right what we've done
now<00:01:41.159> we've<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.550> all<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.970> their<00:01:42.119> friends
