00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.789
 created that of course stay with 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.370
 me so for this manicure you should 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.100
 remember only one main rule 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.199
 dark pattern light on your manicure and 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.710
 I took a dark purple shimmer from 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.309
 catrice 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.589
 number 14 and for the pattern light beige from 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.589
 essense number 0 4 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.629
 you will also need a wand for 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.670
 manicure off with if you don't have it 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.460
 can use ordinary pencil 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.379
 the main thing that he was not sharp and that 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.780
 our manicure lasted longer I tell you 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.750
 advise using protective cover 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.030
 for a manicure I have a mosaic for me 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.900
 beginning we paint all the nails dark 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.900
 purple shade 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.880
 so I already painted over nails now 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.110
 take our wand and light shade on 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.700
 edge where the ball 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.700
 slaughter we put varnish 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:05.130
 and on the ring finger and Wednesday 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.130
 put small dots 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.010
 we . 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.360
 now we need an edge with a little 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:35.330
 we pierce our edge with this edge 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:39.430
 balls farther from the patterns we are trying 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.430
 make a small triangle 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.190
 this pattern we have to do and on 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.820
 the ring and middle finger also 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.610
 forget to cover our manicure with protecting 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.190
 coated and so our manicure is ready 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.790
