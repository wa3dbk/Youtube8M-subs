00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.349 
that's why I go with a small gun I go
under<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.560> impression<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.859> any<00:02:00.850> gun<00:02:01.119> is

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
under the impression that any gun is

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.719 
under the impression that any gun is
better<00:02:01.539> than<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.899> knife<00:02:02.109> so<00:02:02.920> that's<00:02:03.490> why<00:02:03.700> I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
better than a knife so that's why I

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.389 
better than a knife so that's why I
carry<00:02:03.999> small<00:02:04.270> gun<00:02:04.479> in<00:02:04.899> reality<00:02:05.740> think<00:02:06.219> about

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
carry small gun in reality think about

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.370 
carry small gun in reality think about
it<00:02:06.520> folks<00:02:06.700> we're<00:02:06.999> probably<00:02:07.509> never<00:02:07.810> going<00:02:08.140> to

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
it folks we're probably never going to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.490 
it folks we're probably never going to
use<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.890> gun<00:02:09.250> but<00:02:10.000> at<00:02:10.479> least<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.929> have<00:02:11.140> something

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
use a gun but at least I have something

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.250 
use a gun but at least I have something
so<00:02:12.250> I'm<00:02:12.370> not<00:02:12.489> going<00:02:12.819> into<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.360> situation<00:02:13.690> to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
so I'm not going into a situation to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.390 
so I'm not going into a situation to
where<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.440> don't<00:02:14.650> have<00:02:14.830> anything

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
where I don't have anything

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.490 
where I don't have anything
or<00:02:15.459> rather<00:02:16.180> let<00:02:16.450> me<00:02:16.540> rephrase<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:16.959> I'm<00:02:17.290> not

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
or rather let me rephrase that I'm not

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.610 
or rather let me rephrase that I'm not
going<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.920> find<00:02:18.640> myself<00:02:18.879> out<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.599> way<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:20.050> a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
going to find myself out of a way of a
