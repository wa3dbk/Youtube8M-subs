00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.230
 love events and therefore you decided 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.130
 help the young guys who 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.320
 try to do it yourself 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.540
 but 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.150
 t-shirts hats mighty some bracelets 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.790
 decorations are not very happy to help i find 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.730
 that sooner or later I, too, all this 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.640
 backfire and need help where it wanted 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.620
 to tell 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.480
 i'm not kiddies don't just like me 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.769
 it's interesting because i have 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.350
 there is a thought maybe me too 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.800
 become a designer and I would like to 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.360
 Our famous designers have switched to 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 second plan and so young guys 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.840
 they took their places she is acute because 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.550
 designers do everything by hand in 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.890
 this time you have no 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.170
 balancing the premises was given away 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.930
 wunderbarbar just 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.850
 no demand would fall and the guys for 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.270
 idea and white 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.160
 I respect such talented guys who 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.800
 do with my hands more than once I have it 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.500
 I said thankful to this institution 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.509
 what they were allowed to spend here 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.280
 market for young designers, I would 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.289
 I wanted to say every month 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.229
 such events were held 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.530
 because people are interested and I 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.119
 See what sales are going on. 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.390
 they are asked to do something to order 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.890
 I think that even if we are not, he 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.720
 next month will be like 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.570
 the event will not necessarily come and I will 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.940
 help you refuse 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 your collection of boutique hotel del 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.440
 if I released my collection 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.480
 probably most likely it would be dresses 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.970
 skirts 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:07.080
 but it's not just a girl's dress in style 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.960
 chanel no whether barbie have it been 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.340
 what is such an outrageous all that 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.160
 I love this moment now 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.730
 necessarily black passivity 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.730
 hard
