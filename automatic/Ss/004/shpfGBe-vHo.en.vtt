00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Welcome to the weekend weather 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.220
 for Germany, yes, if that was possible 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.250
 already through the media 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.590
 Spring is 20 degrees 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.870
 weekend will be really nice though 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.179
 as it always is in the weather there is 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.070
 then a few famous exception 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.930
 and it is Saturday itself 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.210
 really the part of the clear 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.609
 Fekter is there is not everywhere yet 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.380
 pure sun and that has especially the and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.720
 east tomorrow to Berlin and Berlin 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 brandenburg still with many clouds 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.590
 it is because of that that it is about the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.020
 selection is now active from Friday 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.670
 So rain is not raining anymore though 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.680
 The air is kind of humid therefore 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.059
 there are still many clouds left 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.309
 sun significantly better chances of work 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.809
 cloudless and just wanted it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.210
 direction bathing will be on the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.520
 can be found fazeli 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.899
 but it's getting warmer shifts the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.670
 It is now from france 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.890
 Direction from europe via germany 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.109
 that wants to turn south on it 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.420
 to get them what more air to us 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.980
 that means it's already 10 to 14 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.979
 15 degrees north-westphalia 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.140
 maybe already 16 17 degrees only in 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.000
 you'll probably get bavaria right now 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.680
 then it will claim that there is no 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.570
 spring because there are the temperatures 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.659
 on saturday really under 10 degrees 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.950
 on the edge of the alps, the 5 is more about the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.320
 8 and 9 degrees 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.549
 but it will be there on sunday too 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.979
 Overall, warmer is in germany 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.810
 still the coldest corner will be 11 12 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.560
 grad otherwise , but then give 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.119
 much higher with 14 to 18 degrees 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.659
 maybe really with the first 20 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.630
 degree of the year is just on sunday 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.880
 really a lot of sun are actually then 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.100
 yes, somehow you do it then 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.930
 also canon bath 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.430
 bavaria and miss in saxony there knows 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.380
 you can do that with a few toes 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.939
 nebulae had been faster 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.950
 or just on slow but then 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.570
 It will definitely be later 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.850
 sunday the sunnier it gets 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.530
 at least for most because it is coming 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.450
 at the same time on sunday the next one 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.399
 deep slowly closer to the northeast and 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.950
 right here in the northwestern half 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.030
 is coming then more and more want the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.130
 nation these are high fog clouds 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.320
 So this would be sunshine 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.390
 then rather milky and depending on 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.220
 how you wanted it then it is 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.989
 the exciting question will be the 20 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.420
 degree or maybe even 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.150
 slightly exceeded or stay yet 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.730
 works under but whether it is 18 19 or 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.950
 somehow 20 21 degrees will be the sunday 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.720
 will definitely for the vast majority 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.060
 possible really nice and warm 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.650
 sun is also there so it will be 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.480
 enjoy spring in front of everyone 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.980
 Sunday sunday because next week 's 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.720
 not completely so on it comes already 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 next to it on monday the next lows 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.799
 at least for the northern half pulled in 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.489
 insofar as the weekend I use 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.489
 wish you a lot of fun
