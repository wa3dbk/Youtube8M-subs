using<00:01:44.170> sometimes<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.799> can<00:01:44.920> see<00:01:45.070> one<00:01:45.340> better

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
using sometimes you can see one better

using sometimes you can see one better
than<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:45.970> other<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.450> then<00:01:47.380> use<00:01:47.530> their<00:01:47.680> tip<00:01:47.920> it

is a fluorocarbon material so to make
the<00:01:51.819> cider<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.270> actually<00:01:52.690> pretty<00:01:52.899> simple<00:01:53.140> we

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
the cider is actually pretty simple we

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.340 
the cider is actually pretty simple we
just<00:01:54.130> take<00:01:54.369> our<00:01:54.729> length<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.750> two<00:01:55.899> foot<00:01:56.110> lengths

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
just take our length of two foot lengths

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.840 
just take our length of two foot lengths
of<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:57.700> mono<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.420> put<00:01:59.259> loops<00:01:59.950> Onaga<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.700> use

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
of of mono and put loops Onaga and I use

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.760

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
of course I'm showing now and one thing

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.320 
of course I'm showing now and one thing
to<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.620> careful<00:02:34.800> when<00:02:35.130> you're<00:02:35.280> putting<00:02:36.090> these

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
to be careful when you're putting these

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.380 
to be careful when you're putting these
on<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.930> tried<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.590> keep<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.550> loops<00:02:38.730> free<00:02:39.120> so

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
on I tried to keep the loops free so

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.880 
on I tried to keep the loops free so
that<00:02:39.570> they<00:02:39.690> don't<00:02:39.810> get<00:02:39.960> all<00:02:40.080> buzzing<00:02:40.350> upside

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
that they don't get all buzzing upside

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.020 
that they don't get all buzzing upside
down<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.490> zip<00:02:41.820> ties<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.370> also<00:02:44.490> use<00:02:44.790> other

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
down the zip ties you can also use other

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.760 
down the zip ties you can also use other
objects<00:02:45.660> I've<00:02:45.780> used<00:02:45.990> two<00:02:46.230> drivers<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.710> the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
objects I've used two drivers in the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.860 
objects I've used two drivers in the
past<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> one<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:48.240> just<00:02:48.330> made<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> other

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
past this is a one I just made the other

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.650 
past this is a one I just made the other
day<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:50.220> cut<00:02:50.460> off<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.480> zip

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
day and I just just cut off the the zip

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.480 
day and I just just cut off the the zip
ties<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.140> see<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.590> coil<00:02:52.980> starting<00:02:53.400> to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
ties you can see the coil starting to

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.470 
ties you can see the coil starting to
relax<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.910> little<00:02:54.000> bit

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
relax a little bit

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.090 
relax a little bit
screwdrivers<00:02:55.260> at<00:02:55.380> least<00:02:55.590> you're<00:02:55.770> going<00:02:56.010> to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
screwdrivers at least you're going to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.620 
screwdrivers at least you're going to
have<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> handle<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.570> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
have a handle to get in and out of the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.270 
have a handle to get in and out of the
pot<00:02:59.960> oil<00:03:00.960> on<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> cider<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.800> looks<00:03:01.980> like<00:03:02.130> when

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
pot oil on a cider so it looks like when

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.920 
pot oil on a cider so it looks like when
you<00:03:02.370> slide<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.790> off<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.330> bolt<00:03:03.570> or<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
you slide it off of the bolt or the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.050 
you slide it off of the bolt or the
screwdriver<00:03:04.350> whatever<00:03:04.710> used<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:05.610> about<00:03:05.760> six

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
screwdriver whatever used it's about six

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.670 
screwdriver whatever used it's about six
inches<00:03:06.360> long<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:07.020> see<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> Cordova

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
inches long and you can see the Cordova

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.380 
inches long and you can see the Cordova
fits<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.340> there<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.910> can<00:03:09.060> take<00:03:09.240> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
fits in there and you can take and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.730 
fits in there and you can take and
stretch<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:09.840> thing<00:03:10.020> in<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.320> out<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.650> that

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
stretch this thing in and out and that

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.040 
stretch this thing in and out and that
coil<00:03:11.370> will<00:03:11.670> stay<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:15.660> that's

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
coil will stay in there and that's

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.360 
coil will stay in there and that's
there's<00:03:16.350> just<00:03:16.590> an<00:03:16.650> example<00:03:16.890> what<00:03:17.130> looks<00:03:17.280> like

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
there's just an example what looks like

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.960 
there's just an example what looks like
when<00:03:17.640> it's<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:18.000> fully<00:03:18.570> extended

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
when it's it's fully extended

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.480 
when it's it's fully extended
20<00:03:20.300> inches<00:03:20.570> long

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.100 

and<00:03:23.580> what<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.790> closed<00:03:24.090> up<00:03:24.270> with<00:03:24.420> what<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.690> coils

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
and what I closed up with what the coils

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.960 
and what I closed up with what the coils
look<00:03:25.200> like<00:03:25.380> one

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
look like one

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.000 
look like one
as<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.630> said<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:26.960> can<00:03:27.110> pull<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:27.470> thing<00:03:27.710> in<00:03:27.860> and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
as I said you can pull this thing in and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.590 
as I said you can pull this thing in and
out<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.790> will<00:03:28.910> come<00:03:29.090> back<00:03:29.270> to<00:03:29.450> its

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
out and it will come back to its

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.540 
out and it will come back to its
original<00:03:29.690> shape<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:31.010> stays<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.370> way<00:03:31.430> for

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
original shape and it stays that way for

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.880 
original shape and it stays that way for
you<00:03:32.090> know<00:03:32.210> a<00:03:32.390> couple<00:03:32.450> days<00:03:32.900> fish<00:03:33.170> them<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:33.470> how

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
you know a couple days fish them and how

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.940 
you know a couple days fish them and how
long<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.160> fish<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.930> usually<00:03:36.500> lasts<00:03:36.890> a

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
long the fish but it usually lasts a

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.300 
long the fish but it usually lasts a
pretty<00:03:37.130> good<00:03:37.310> good<00:03:37.700> Y<00:03:38.770> so<00:03:39.770> again<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:40.130> take

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
pretty good good Y so again you take

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.400 
pretty good good Y so again you take
that<00:03:40.520> oil<00:03:40.790> section<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.780> put<00:03:41.960> it<00:03:42.050> back<00:03:42.080> in

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
that oil section and you put it back in

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.350 
that oil section and you put it back in
here<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:43.010> your<00:03:43.190> cider<00:03:43.490> which<00:03:43.850> is<00:03:44.000> usually

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
here in your cider which is usually
