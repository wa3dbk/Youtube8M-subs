00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 and as you are looking at this is a 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:10.950
 Ragdoll cat puppy is a breed 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.139
 that is not very widespread is little seen and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.599
 the characteristic that the trait has 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 means rag doll because it's a 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.830
 cat that when you touch it and make it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.400
 themselves reacts like a bag of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.920
 cheaters are pulled to be touched 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.390
 this is very very loving he loves 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.539
 be with people 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.790
 This is ideal for life in 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.450
 departments the eyes you have if 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.680
 he has light blue eyes like that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.800
 how the Siamese has them 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.330
 it's soft and you're puppy 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.280
 is a breed that usually in the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.870
 adult male can reach 9 kilos 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.150
 so he's going to be bigger he's in 5 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.150
 kilos and a half now and has 7 months 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.330
 the color is very variable in the race 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.890
 usually this have on the blankets 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.440
 that has cats birds that is the head 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.780
 dark the four legs and the tail but 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.840
 they may have white gloves and cough 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.820
 there are even cats with another type of 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.710
 color layout but how interesting 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.500
 in this race is this that I told you 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.990
 before I can put it like that 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.220
 look what a baby is with him and I speak 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.220
 as if to pamper him 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.760
 what is is very very good data very 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.260
 affectionate and very attached to the owner and 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.920
 that myth that cats are 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.710
 treacherous that there is really with that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.960
 it's not that knowing the psychology 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.439
 of the cat the cat what you have is a 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.649
 aggression redirected or he is 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.860
 nervous or angry and can not face 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.660
 To who 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.790
 is causing him he got angry and hits the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.410
 that has a side but it's not that it's 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 treacherous sir I'm good but 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.760
 clear but due to ignorance of the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.080
 Spice psychology no longer no is not 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.430
 same as the dog to compare a 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.500
 dog with a while are two things 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.510
 absolutely different and therefore 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.860
 If I know the psychology of the cat I'm going 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.520
 to realize that what is happening in 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.740
 he is angry and I am going away 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.480
 I'm going to approach him to touch him grab him 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.800
 because it can bite me and it happens 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.900
 many times the cat is 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.630
 concentrated looking at another cat in a 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.970
 medianera and you will grab it and bites you 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.790
 but he is controlling his house 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.340
 controlling the presence of cats and 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.920
 invaders and they are very territorial the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.370
 cats and you die 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.470
 and the fact is that everything that people 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.480
 He says he does not leave the house that you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.370
 you can have in the yard outside in a 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 terrace that goes and comes is never going to go 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.670
 of the house is true if the subject is the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.940
 next the cat of this editorial but 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.350
 you need a very large territory 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.120
 then he goes through the territory that 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.860
 daily about everything life has life 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.590
 nightly so if I want to have a 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.510
 animal is in a department does not 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.950
 I am proposing to him the possibility of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.930
 go out to tour prisoners that's why they 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.650
 they want to go out I recommend them that 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.650
 have a cat 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.710
 to take care of it in the sense that if 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:15.240
 let it out remember that the density 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.240
 of cats that are in some cities
