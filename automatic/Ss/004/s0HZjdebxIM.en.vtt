boiling<00:02:36.079> I<00:02:36.470> chop<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.190> cabbage<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
boiling I chop the cabbage and the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.140 
boiling I chop the cabbage and the
cabbage<00:02:39.140> shrinks<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.769> don't<00:02:40.640> worry<00:02:40.790> if<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
cabbage shrinks so don't worry if the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.390 
cabbage shrinks so don't worry if the
pieces<00:02:41.359> are<00:02:41.540> big<00:02:41.840> or<00:02:42.170> small<00:02:42.349> those<00:02:43.129> are<00:02:43.250> not

pieces are big or small those are not
too<00:02:43.579> big<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:43.970> just<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.510> right<00:02:44.659> size<00:02:44.930> because<00:02:45.560> I

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
too big is just the right size because I

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.640 
too big is just the right size because I
don't<00:02:46.670> want<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.879> cut<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.150> too<00:02:47.450> small<00:02:47.659> so<00:02:48.530> it

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
don't want to cut it too small so it

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.530 
don't want to cut it too small so it
wouldn't<00:02:49.010> shrink<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.549> disappear<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:50.329> has
