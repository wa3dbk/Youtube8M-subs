and<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:44.400> cardio<00:00:45.400> now<00:00:46.500> cardio<00:00:48.540> can<00:00:49.540> burn<00:00:50.440> fat

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
and it is cardio now cardio can burn fat

and it is cardio now cardio can burn fat
and<00:00:51.010> can<00:00:51.670> also<00:00:51.880> burn<00:00:52.210> muscle<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:53.290> I<00:00:53.440> know<00:00:53.500> it's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
and can also burn muscle and I know it's

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.690

muscle<00:01:02.470> mass<00:01:02.860> and<00:01:03.160> burn<00:01:03.489> fat<00:01:03.699> at<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.940> same

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
muscle mass and burn fat at the same

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.230 
muscle mass and burn fat at the same
time<00:01:04.540> but<00:01:05.019> they're<00:01:05.470> worried<00:01:06.010> if<00:01:06.490> they<00:01:06.700> do<00:01:07.000> the

especially after weight lifting Dooney

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
especially after weight lifting Dooney
and<00:01:38.680> make<00:01:38.860> sure<00:01:39.450> you're<00:01:40.450> at<00:01:40.630> least<00:01:41.079> getting

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
now when you're doing cardio I recommend

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.270 
now when you're doing cardio I recommend
that<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.280> don't<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:30.940> long<00:02:31.180> periods<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:32.280> steady

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
that you don't do long periods of steady

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.040 
that you don't do long periods of steady
cardio<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.890> mean<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.270> it's<00:02:37.270> cool<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:37.870> it's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
cardio I mean it's it's cool but it's

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.230 
cardio I mean it's it's cool but it's
not<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.590> most<00:02:38.800> effective<00:02:39.190> when<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.760> comes<00:02:40.000> to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
not the most effective when it comes to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.860 
not the most effective when it comes to
burning<00:02:41.020> fat<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.510> especially<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:43.750> you're
