iPad<00:04:12.489> Mini<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.419> really<00:04:13.780> cool<00:04:14.019> Baja<00:04:14.500> case<00:04:14.909> all

iPad Mini in a really cool Baja case all
leather<00:04:16.630> very<00:04:16.989> cool<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.949> I<00:04:18.280> was<00:04:18.909> able<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.209> hold

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
leather very cool so I was able to hold

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.940 
leather very cool so I was able to hold
all<00:04:19.720> of<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:20.199> and<00:04:20.500> then<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.680> still<00:04:21.070> had

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
all of that and then I still had

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.170 
all of that and then I still had
for<00:04:22.220> more<00:04:22.780> inside<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.170> mini<00:04:25.000> messenger<00:04:26.000> bag

for more inside the mini messenger bag

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.630 
for more inside the mini messenger bag
so<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> was<00:04:27.110> really<00:04:27.260> surprised<00:04:27.800> at<00:04:28.160> how<00:04:28.310> big<00:04:28.340> it

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
so I was really surprised at how big it

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.380 
so I was really surprised at how big it
was<00:04:29.740> because<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:30.980> was<00:04:31.130> expecting<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.730> mini<00:04:32.090> bag

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
was because I was expecting a mini bag

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.870 
was because I was expecting a mini bag
so<00:04:33.260> I'm<00:04:33.590> actually<00:04:33.770> glad<00:04:34.100> it's<00:04:34.430> this<00:04:34.610> large

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
so I'm actually glad it's this large

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.880 
so I'm actually glad it's this large
because<00:04:35.180> when<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.390> travel<00:04:35.720> this<00:04:36.320> is<00:04:36.500> going<00:04:36.770> to

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
because when I travel this is going to

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.130 
because when I travel this is going to
be<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.190> bag<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.550> take<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:38.360> have<00:04:38.510> a<00:04:38.540> very<00:04:38.870> house

be the bag I take you have a very house

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.860 
be the bag I take you have a very house

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
a heavy-duty handle right here the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.770

bottom<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.550> rain<00:04:43.550> proof<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.180> if<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.360> set<00:04:44.660> it

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
the bag the back has this padded area

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.110 
the bag the back has this padded area

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
that allows it to breathe when it's

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.210 
that allows it to breathe when it's
against<00:04:53.690> your<00:04:53.840> body<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.470> lets<00:04:54.710> air<00:04:54.950> flow
