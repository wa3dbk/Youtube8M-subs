00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.649

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
 start by applying my base this is a 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.820
 base from givenchy and it's a base 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.230
 green called a little kiwi that I 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.190
 really place locally on my 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:55.289
 redness so that is to say 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:56.699
 mainly on my cheeks hesitates 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.710
 not to apply if ever 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.210
 I was little button like here a little 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.829
 red just olympic games on 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.949
 like that it goes a little attenuated was 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.000
 red iron 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.710
 then I take my foundation from 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 moment that the nargue scheer glow so 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.890
 it was a foundation that made 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.240
 really beautiful light on time 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.650
 are discarded as you see it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 there is no pump so it's 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.759
 directly open like this so voila 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 I do as you see there I 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 overthrow if you want a little bit of 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.790
 produced on my finger and that's enough for me 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.320
 it's really the quantity I need 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.320
 and I put a little bit everywhere 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.940
 and to spread all that I take my 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.800
 beauf a technical rice gouache 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.060
 really my favorite brush of all 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.060
 time to spread the foundation 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.489
 then I come to correct my small 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.739
 imperfections with the corrector of 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.600
 checchi qu as number 2 this is the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.890
 natural when they hours and for 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.510
 apply it I take a tiny 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.650
 brush that just as my kit 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.850
 scenes that is really very very 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.850
 practical for little things 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.540
 what am I doing to fix it 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.010
 the corrector know that I'm taking a make-up 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.569
 flesh-colored eyelids so there in 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.580
 the occurrence was burned from mac 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.440
 really the same color as the color 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.879
 of my skin simply and I come 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:12.319
 apply it with the same brush 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:13.879
 always on top now for 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.829
 avoid shine and to fix the 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.629
 rest of assembly takes the prep + prime 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.890
 from mac who is a powder bed 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.590
 really really good because the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.359
 very fine trains and Olympic games with 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.709
 brush my favorites still powder 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:48.410
 technical chÃ©rif is the port of 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:50.150
 pins and always with the same pass 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.700
 at I take my brothers who is the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.709
 bronze goddess the soft map loader of 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.299
 at estÃ©e lauder I had a floor 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.950
 from last year it seems to me but 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.630
 that I use very very very very 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.250
 often right now because like his 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.389
 name indicated this browser and mat it has 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.389
 really a perfect color 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.380
 and we end of course with the blush so 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.480
 this is really my darling of the moment 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.400
 it's the something about this bet from 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.350
 everything is really beautiful and 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.550
 made it bright enough but not too 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:30.210
 still makes a brief it is really 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.520
 Too much too beautiful and I just applied 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.110
 with my little biofibre brush from 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.370
 costa scene alone like a lot am here 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.360
 because it gives a very very 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.360
 diffuse it's really pretty 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.690
 so that's for this little routine not 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.160

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.540
