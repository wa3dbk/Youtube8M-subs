00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
is just a blue dye that they use to dye

is just a blue dye that they use to dye
blue<00:01:49.380> jeans<00:01:49.649> blue<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> any<00:01:51.899> case<00:01:52.729> when<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> put

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
blue jeans blue but any case when I put

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
blue jeans blue but any case when I put
the<00:01:54.180> eggs<00:01:54.390> into<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> cup<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.320> put<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.770> methylene

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the eggs into the cup I put in methylene

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.010 
the eggs into the cup I put in methylene
blue<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.119> almost<00:01:57.240> looks<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.509> blue<00:01:57.810> food

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
blue and it almost looks like blue food

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.270 
blue and it almost looks like blue food
coloring<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.590> add<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> water

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
coloring when you add it to the water

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.420 
coloring when you add it to the water
and<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> prevents<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.659> fungus<00:02:01.140> from<00:02:01.500> taking

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.870

so<00:02:05.240> then<00:02:05.390> I'm<00:02:05.540> day<00:02:05.720> two<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:06.020> went<00:02:06.440> ahead<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.880> did

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
so then I'm day two I went ahead and did

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.050 
so then I'm day two I went ahead and did
a<00:02:07.940> 50%<00:02:08.780> water<00:02:08.929> change<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:10.009> lower<00:02:10.820> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
a 50% water change to lower the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.620 
a 50% water change to lower the
concentration<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.900> methylene<00:02:12.290> blue<00:02:13.390> on<00:02:14.390> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
concentration of methylene blue on the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.550 
concentration of methylene blue on the
eggs<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:16.700> day<00:02:17.660> three<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.080> found<00:02:18.410> some

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
eggs and then day three I found some

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.070 
eggs and then day three I found some
free<00:02:18.800> swimmers<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.300> went<00:02:20.570> ahead<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.840> did<00:02:21.020> a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
free swimmers so I went ahead and did a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.540 
free swimmers so I went ahead and did a
90%<00:02:21.560> water<00:02:21.890> change<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:23.690> go<00:02:23.840> ahead<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.400> get<00:02:25.400> rid

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
90% water change to go ahead and get rid

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.160 
90% water change to go ahead and get rid
of<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.790> concentration<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.690> methylene<00:02:27.050> blue

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
of that concentration of methylene blue

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.210 
of that concentration of methylene blue
almost<00:02:27.590> all<00:02:27.770> together

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
almost all together

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.330 
almost all together
you<00:02:28.550> don't<00:02:28.700> want<00:02:28.820> methyl<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.240> blue<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:31.130> high

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
you don't want methyl and blue and high

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.030 
you don't want methyl and blue and high
concentrations<00:02:32.240> when<00:02:32.420> your<00:02:32.570> egg<00:02:33.380> start<00:02:33.830> hatch

concentrations when your egg start hatch

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.479 
concentrations when your egg start hatch
and<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.340> got<00:02:34.490> free<00:02:34.700> swimming<00:02:34.970> fish<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:36.380> as<00:02:37.280> I

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
and you got free swimming fish but as I

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.250 
and you got free swimming fish but as I
said<00:02:37.550> before<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.300> first<00:02:38.480> set<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.780> babies<00:02:39.140> I

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
said before the first set of babies I

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.010 
said before the first set of babies I
had<00:02:39.440> allophones<00:02:39.860> one<00:02:40.190> survivor<00:02:40.870> second<00:02:41.870> set

had allophones one survivor second set
of<00:02:42.050> eyes<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.620> got<00:02:42.770> about<00:02:42.950> 15<00:02:43.459> survivors<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.360> I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
of eyes I got about 15 survivors and I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.710 
of eyes I got about 15 survivors and I
did<00:02:45.110> at<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.920> rate<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.459> right<00:02:46.730> now<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:47.209> have

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
did at this rate I have right now I have

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.229 
did at this rate I have right now I have
almost<00:02:47.900> I've<00:02:48.650> counted<00:02:48.950> over<00:02:49.190> 150<00:02:50.000> free

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
almost I've counted over 150 free

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.280 
almost I've counted over 150 free
swimming<00:02:51.010> plecos<00:02:52.010> right<00:02:52.280> now<00:02:52.750> now<00:02:53.750> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
swimming plecos right now now the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.320 
swimming plecos right now now the
outcome<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.739> this<00:02:55.070> is<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.580> be<00:02:55.730> determined<00:02:56.300> on

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
outcome of this is to be determined on

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.790 
outcome of this is to be determined on
how<00:02:56.510> many<00:02:56.570> are<00:02:56.870> going<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.110> actually<00:02:57.440> survive

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
how many are going to actually survive

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.150 
how many are going to actually survive
this<00:02:58.070> ordeal<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.780> go<00:02:59.900> from<00:03:00.110> 1<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.530> 15<00:03:01.010> to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
this ordeal but to go from 1 to 15 to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.509 
this ordeal but to go from 1 to 15 to
over<00:03:01.400> 150<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.360> hell<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.540> an<00:03:02.750> improvement<00:03:03.519> so

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
over 150 is a hell of an improvement so

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.680 
over 150 is a hell of an improvement so
I<00:03:04.580> just<00:03:04.760> thought<00:03:04.880> I'd<00:03:05.030> share<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:05.450> with<00:03:05.570> you

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
I just thought I'd share that with you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.270 
I just thought I'd share that with you
guys<00:03:05.720> this<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:06.170> actually<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.709> little<00:03:06.739> 16

just stagnant water will make them

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
suffocate and die you need that

suffocate and die you need that
circulation<00:03:20.269> especially<00:03:21.079> with<00:03:21.440> bristlenose

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
circulation especially with bristlenose

plecos<00:03:22.780> one<00:03:23.780> of<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.959> parents<00:03:24.350> actually<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
plecos one of the parents actually just

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.289 
plecos one of the parents actually just
keeps<00:03:25.010> fanning<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.519> eggs<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:26.000> keep<00:03:26.150> the

keeps fanning the eggs to keep the

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.819 
keeps fanning the eggs to keep the
circulation<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.170> was<00:03:27.320> trying<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.590> emulate

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
circulation so I was trying to emulate

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.229 
circulation so I was trying to emulate
that<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:29.390> so<00:03:29.600> far<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.019> good<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:31.190> that's<00:03:31.880> that

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
that and so far so good so that's that

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.520 
that and so far so good so that's that
just<00:03:32.480> want<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.780> go<00:03:32.840> ahead<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.049> show<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.320> that

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
just want to go ahead and show you that

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.830 
just want to go ahead and show you that
my<00:03:34.310> dogs<00:03:34.579> are<00:03:34.820> being<00:03:34.910> pains<00:03:35.329> in<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.630> asses
