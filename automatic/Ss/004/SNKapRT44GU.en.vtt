00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.399
 in which I will explain 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.259
 how to easily move from 

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:23.630

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.669
 iii 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.320
 so know before I start that I 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.820
 in no way responsible in 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.829
 case of mishandling your 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.509
 share however know that I'm here 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.610
 to help you in case of a problem and 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.470
 little important details to look for 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.090
 first the solution on the internet there is 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.740
 very often explanations to the 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.600
 most problems that can 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.130
 occur during the procedure me 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.510
 contact and so that in case of big 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.150
 problem or just if you 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.220
 did not find anything on google so this 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.630
 tutorial is aimed at galaxy s iii 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.310
 the international model gti 9300 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.860
 so check your version of the galaxy s 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.370
 iii in the settings under about the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.260
 phone 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.930
 so you see your model number 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.960
 and check that it is the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.580
 model gt i9000 300 so it's gone 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.990
 first of all to start your 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.909
 phones must be road and so is 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.710
 own louis cauvery advanced mode 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.990
 which allows between installing roms 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.400
 I made a tutorial for router 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.150

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.190
 minutes 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.320
 click on the video that appears 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.310
 on the screen to see their route and if that 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.780
 is not already done obviously and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
 Then you will come back here to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.810
 continue the tutorial know by the way 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.010

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.740
 we will waive the warranty of your 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.510
 smartphone second step i invite you 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 to backup your data 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.440
 since you will lose them all except 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.810
 the contents of the internal memory and or 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.860
 external, that is, your video photos 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.360
 music etc 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.850
 I advise you anyway 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.860
 backups and to be sure you 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.570
 back up your apps as well as 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.490
 the data of this one you can 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.340
 use apps like go back 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.680
 up or titanium backup now you 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.020
 go download the asome so know 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.640
 that these are haiti versions so who 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.350
 is not quite stable yet 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.270
 these are updated versions 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.880
 daily I advise you to 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.830
 install one every two to three 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.149
 weeks or so because it's useless to 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.829
 update the cheek asia 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.159
 daily of the moment you are 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:15.919
 just a basic user it's 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.120
 to say a simple user who does not 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.180
 hack not every day his 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.300
 phone and also know that the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.940
 main features make 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.740
 all very well of course there are some 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.420
 bugs but it's completely normal 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.440
 since it is not yet a question of 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.030
 stable version 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 to download the latest version 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.900
 so you can go to the link 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.090
 marked with a number one in the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.880
 description of the video you will fall

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.970
 download which is automatic so 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.440
 as you see once these 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.300
 facts do not touch the files do it 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.980
 desire and especially not you go 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.540
 now download the gaps this it 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.730
 so these are google apps 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.930
 so all that is google peeled maps 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.340

 you will simply slip the 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.430
 two files you just 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.200
 download ie the Roma and 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.630
 caps on the internal memory of your 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.820
 phone so you have to white and 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.070
 to the computer to do it if your 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.590
 computer does not recognize voice 6-3 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.450
 when you plug in this one 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.890
 download the drivers via the link that 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.890
 is in the description of the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.170

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.560
 your phone is restarting at 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.000
 present and as you will see 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.190
 you have the latest version of 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.170
 the cyanogen rom 10 under jelly bean 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.390
 know that the first reboot can 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.950
 to be a little bit long so for 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.720
 update your man now 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.190
 so just to install a 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.720
 new version so you download 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.580
 the most recent update 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.860
 you put the file on the memory 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.840
 internal of your phone you re 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.160
 start in recovery mode as we have 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.030
 seen before so once your 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.610
 phone is off 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.950
 you click on the home power button and 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.610
 volume at the same time I have 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.160
 precise 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.890
 and so the yes mode cowboy launches and 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.380
 there you choose shoes install zee 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.170
 promises of forgiveness caps thing if from 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.760
 sd card or something hip hop internal sd 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.080
 next map where she files from the 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.080
 update and there you click on the 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.360
 file you do yes install blah blah 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.180
 blah blah blah blah is the name 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.670
 of the file and subsequently you do 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.200
 simply a cash wipe partition and a 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.990
 cash albi wipe 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.610
 you can go back to the tutorial that 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.800
 has just been done for simply 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.700
 see how it goes white dalvik 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.590
 cache and so is under advance you 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.760
 here you do not wipe 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.650
 factory with it 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.810
 and since we do not do just that 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.700
 factor with it none of your data does 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.800
 will be affected so do not worry 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.470
 not during a simple update of the 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.060
 rom you do not lose anything so 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.390
