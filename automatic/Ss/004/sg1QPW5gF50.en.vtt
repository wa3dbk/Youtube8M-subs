00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.030
 we have lighting equipment in the 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.010
 market that without the need to add them 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.680
 filter diffusers already give us a light 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.480
 soft without defined shadows with what 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.700
 if we know beforehand that we are going to 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.710
 want soft light we can choose this 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.270
 type of appliances directly and so we 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.180
 we avoid work and we also save 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.370
 space some of these light sources 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.800
 diffuse would be the fluorescents the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.180
 LED screens the space lights or the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.400
 soft lights 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.320
 fluorescents have low consumption and 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.920
 we can have soft light in little space 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.870
 the LEDs are small light have 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.420
 variable color temperature and can 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.609
 go to batteries the soft lights cover us 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.460
 larger distances and have a 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:57.070
 bounced lamp the space lights cover 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.280
 Large surfaces are often used in 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.230
 set or for chromas what happens with the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.940
 diffuse light is that it is more difficult to 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.130
 control and cut that light 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.980
 directed tends to spread so 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.110
 general to be able to control the light that 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.820
 the funds and the walls of 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.040
 a decorated these devices have 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.500
 visors and grilles that allow in 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.630
 some measure direct a little more light 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.540
 direction and prevent it from expanding without 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.550
 control so we can have our 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.260
 character illuminated with soft light but 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.420
 cut a little light that escapes the 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.040
 background if the light source we have is 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.380
 hard but we want to work with light 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.330
 soft we have to vary its geometry 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.369
 somehow there are two ways of 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.410
 turn a hard light into soft once 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.240
 using diffuser filters and the other 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.760
 bouncing that light source on a 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.410
 reflection surface filters 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.570
 diffusers blur the light beam 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.400
 making it wider and smoothing the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.160
 edges so that the shadows are 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.500
 they make less defined less hard and the 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.570
 area that covers that light is greater there 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.850
 many types of diffuser gelatins and 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.190
 each one acts on the geometry of the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.990
 light in a different way let's see 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.430
 examples of some of the more diffusers 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.410
 commonly used 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.360
 the melting white scatters the beam of light 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.970
 reducing shadows well in 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.950
 different gradations from lowest to highest 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.620
 the greater the degree the more diffusion and 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.480
 it spreads more light there is a certain 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.100
 loss of intensity depending on the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.050
 degree with what we will have to correct 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.470
 diaphragm when we put a filter 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.270
 diffuser in front of the light 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.040
 this is one thing we should have in 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.740
 account when calculating the power 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.110
 of our appliances the opal is a 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.090
 Weak diffusion is used to soften the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.280
 beam of hard light without altering its shape 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.310
 well in different degrees of greater or 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.410
 less spread the tuxpan creates a 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.720
 general diffusion softens the shadows 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.330
 but leaves the tape shape not the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.130
 modify the cloud grid is a kind of 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.020
 diffuser that is usually used more in 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.330
 exteriors is a type of material 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.730
 Water resistant and more flexible than 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.520
 the other gelatins we have in ranges 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.500
 from medium to very dense diffusion is 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.959
 reinforced with what can be sewn 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.240
 Without tearing it can be used for large 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.480
 racks creating the effect of a beam 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.860
 of light without shadows these are just 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.170
 some of the many diffusers 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.120
 different that you can use in the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.250
 web pages of the manufacturers you can 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.650
 see listings of all of them and choose the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.480
 what interests you most right now 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.430
 now we have seen the effect of the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.830
 diffuser filters placed on the blades 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.870
 of the device but we can also put 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.240
 the diffuser on a frame to be able 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.060
 move away the diffusion of the light source 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.950
 this will increase the diffusing effect how much 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.930
 more let's separate a diffusion gelatin 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.329
 of the device more blur to light 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.280
 we said that the other way to vary the 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.099
 geometry of a light to turn it into 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.900
 soft is bouncing we can bounce a 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.790
 light against the ceiling to get a light 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.159
 very soft and general that comes from above 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.260
 although we must bear in mind that this 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.180
 light will be very difficult to cut with what 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.639
 it will be a very enveloping light and it 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.500
 will spread throughout the space too 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.540
 we must take into account the color of the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.000
 surface on which we bounce light 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.340
 a non-white wall will reflect the 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.310
 light of its color if it is yellow will reflect 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.139
 the light with yellow dominant but another 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.359
 option that we have is to bounce the light 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.980
 on a stick or white like this we will have 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.200
 greater control of health management 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.569
 although it is soft because we can 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.479
 control its height and inclination and 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.799
 so vary the direction of light 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.049
 we can also control the intensity 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.580
 of this soft light closing the blades of 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.440
 appliance and making them arrive less 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.690
 amount of light to stick or what 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.000
 will reflect less light and if we wanted 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.639
 have even greater control we can 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.380
 cut the light with black styles for 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.870
 that does not get to the bottom we have to have 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.880
 note that to cut a diffuse light 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.139
 we need a larger flag 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.569
 that if it were a 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.400
 of directed light and the cuts that we make 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.979
 of this light will always have edges 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.840
 soft we can never get a cut 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.139
 very defined when our source of 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.789
 light is soft good and up here this 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.099
 introductory tutorial on light 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.370
 Diffuse I hope you have been helpful to us 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.370
 we see
