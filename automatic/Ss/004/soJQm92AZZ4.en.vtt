00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.670
 and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.039
 my name is erasmo eri malacara 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.039
 founder of r aviation you would say 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.490
 for the gps 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.330
 in the way that we think is from the side 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.910
 left to the right side of top 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.380
 down we process to see how the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.690
 name the city I'm going to throw away 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.580
 times that is natural of the cross the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.300
 part of following the next line 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.890
 it appears that this one is tested umbrella 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.820
 but the plane has no duration we do not go 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.190
 to do it 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.880
 let's throw a conventional gps the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.119
 atrocious buses 349 I'm going to put it here 349 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.270
 the number two means to be able to agree 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.700
 what is the course of the nights the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.310
 skies are at 700 feet but I have 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.310
 much attention on needle stuff in the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.670
 center to find the clue 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.650
 the track is 340 feet long is 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:42.710
 enough for it again confirmed 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:46.220
 the right side that is the psn to see 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.170
 gps rowe 35 very important to dry that is 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.030
 in the cities of antonio in the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 Peronist airport and rose because there 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.540
 many airports around 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.670
 sanatoriums and there's the identification here 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.930
 for charlie watts the one that I have a 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.930
 annotations for example 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.220
 circular let's throw at 35 if 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.200
 we have to move to about 7 we can not 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.789
 make them from the teacher because there 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.420
 obstacles we have to do it from the side 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.420
 West 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.700
 but we hope that we are not going to circulate 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.870
 let's see what happens we do not see the track 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.680
 at the minimum we have to go up to four thousand 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.370
 a hundred feet direct 5 is today the waypoint and 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.349
 then make radial character 273 average 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.139
 that is another wayport then there is no 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:42.169
 you can appear on the plane's GPS 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:44.719
 we will go along with GPS 8.72 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.069
 already put it is called me here in the 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.459
 back and let's hope to get closer 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.560
 we still have 90 miles to receive 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:03:00.579
 on Thursday the weather and then decide 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:00.579
 what kind of airport 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.340
 release 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.150
 the people that are there we have to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.870
 use 123 the next part that 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.870
 we have to check is to enter to request 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.900
 the control of the vector to intercept 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.300
 lebanon 349 that I already have it there for 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.120
 remind me who will decide what 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.290
 height they enter will go down going down 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.300
 little by little until we intercept 3200 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.860
 feet that is the initial minimum to pull 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.230
 of one's own 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.560
 depends on traffic sanatorium 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.560
 international 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.480
 you are simply and height 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.930
 like the days outside I discover that it is the 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.170
 panel approx 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.280
 here not only here we know another 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.280
 how but there again 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:11.270
 once we have learned 200 feet 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:14.030
 we are going to intercept the gps and the start 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.080
 You can also send us to wikis or the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:23.120
 safe rector on the wiki controller 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:27.320
 has to lower the radial 3 49 thousand 500 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.360
 feet below 1,500 feet the root down 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.370
 difficult that the mandatory can not go down 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.400
 something 500 feet until we got to 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.710
 cure conceals let's continue to 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.160
 cultivate the calculation let's continue the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.340
 decline to our monthly minimum in 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.450
 this what does not have a 1920 foot yo 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.450
 I would use 2,000 feet 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.880
 and if we do not see the right track to 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:01.340
 4100 pieces is active gps and then 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:05.270
 actually fly 273 from the guard of san 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.750
 antonio to the wey can measure this already 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.750
 they are here 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.070
 the last thing we have to get out is how 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.910
 let's leave the juve in relation to 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:25.240
 the track is this critical square of the plane 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.240
 700 feet 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.330
 and once we go down the clouds and 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.069
 the clouds are 700 feet above 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.340
 airport then let's get out of the 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.129
 clouds let's be able to see the track the 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.989
 straight 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.989
 in the in the life 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.660
 is what we expect from the bottom 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.660
 until confirmation for all 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:01.620
 35 we offer ourselves in this way left 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.780
 right up down that way you do not know 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.550
 we forget nothing today have the next 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.550
 have the opportunity to see them there 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.250
 my friends, we are well 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.530
 happy because we are here with janet 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.449
 in 8 where you are going to have the 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.210
 opportunity to get my book in 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.979
 audio form and in book form 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.320
 also so you can come here 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.250
 the airport san antonio texas will look for 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.870
 have in 8 that is crossing the 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.759
 building of the fbi or the sea â€‹â€‹cndh 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.800
 just cross in the street come to 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:39.240
 sticks and here they will be able to find my 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.240
 products and with janet 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.530
 and
