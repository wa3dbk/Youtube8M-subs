prevent lumbar flexion or lower back
rounding<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.510> deadlift<00:00:09.960> now<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.920> made

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
rounding in the deadlift now I have made

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.009 
rounding in the deadlift now I have made
a<00:00:11.219> video<00:00:11.429> about<00:00:11.849> lumbar<00:00:12.450> flexion<00:00:12.570> or

preventing lower back rounding in

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.670 
preventing lower back rounding in
general<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> deadlift<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.260> recommend

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
general in the deadlift and I recommend

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.170 
general in the deadlift and I recommend
that<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.830> look<00:00:17.070> at<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.369> if<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.730> haven't

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
that you look at that if you haven't

description but what this video is on is
it's<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> specific<00:00:23.070> scenario<00:00:23.689> what<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> see

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it's for a specific scenario what I see

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.660 
it's for a specific scenario what I see
a<00:00:25.050> lot<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.410> times<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.859> what<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> recently<00:00:26.250> got

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
a lot of times and what I recently got

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
a lot of times and what I recently got
in<00:00:26.910> my<00:00:27.060> form<00:00:27.359> check<00:00:27.539> service<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.109> someone<00:00:28.470> who

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
in my form check service is someone who

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.009 
in my form check service is someone who
showed<00:00:28.949> me<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> video<00:00:29.310> where<00:00:30.090> their<00:00:30.390> first<00:00:30.660> rep

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
showed me a video where their first rep

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.440 
showed me a video where their first rep
looks<00:00:31.380> fine<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:32.730> their<00:00:33.030> subsequent

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
looks fine but then their subsequent

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870 
looks fine but then their subsequent
reps<00:00:33.870> after<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> first<00:00:34.829> rep<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.399> their<00:00:35.610> form

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
reps after the first rep then their form

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
reps after the first rep then their form
ends<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.180> breaking<00:00:36.390> down<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.860> happens

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
ends up breaking down and what happens

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
ends up breaking down and what happens
is<00:00:38.520> their<00:00:38.850> setup<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.629> really<00:00:40.020> what's<00:00:40.200> messing

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
is their setup is really what's messing

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
is their setup is really what's messing
them<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.579> problem<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> real-life

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
them up so this problem was a real-life

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.209 
them up so this problem was a real-life
example<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:43.200> someone<00:00:43.530> who<00:00:43.649> submitted<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
example from someone who submitted a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.670 
example from someone who submitted a
form<00:00:44.489> check<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.030> me<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> told<00:00:46.079> them<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
form check to me and what I told them to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.619 
form check to me and what I told them to
do<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.100> contract<00:00:47.730> their<00:00:47.910> hip<00:00:48.149> flexors

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
do was to contract their hip flexors

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.229 
do was to contract their hip flexors
before<00:00:49.079> each<00:00:49.320> rep<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.550> solve<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> issue

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
before each rep in this solve the issue

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.600 
before each rep in this solve the issue
because<00:00:52.230> what<00:00:52.440> happens<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.100> oftentimes

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
because what happens is oftentimes

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
because what happens is oftentimes
you're<00:00:54.030> able<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> control<00:00:54.930> yourself<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you're able to control yourself for the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
you're able to control yourself for the
first<00:00:55.949> rep<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:57.000> able<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.420> brace

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
first rep because you're able to brace

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
first rep because you're able to brace
your<00:00:57.899> core<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.489> basically<00:00:59.489> start<00:00:59.760> from<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
your core and basically start from the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.729 
your core and basically start from the
top<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.449> bottom<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.140> set<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
top to the bottom as you set up for the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
top to the bottom as you set up for the
deadlift<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.550> brace<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:03.030> core<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.510> then

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
deadlift you brace your core and then

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.329 
deadlift you brace your core and then
you<00:01:03.960> hinge<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.379> hip<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> pull

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you hinge at the hip and then you pull

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.820 
you hinge at the hip and then you pull
but<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> subsequent<00:01:06.869> reps<00:01:07.290> your

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
but then for the subsequent reps your

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
but then for the subsequent reps your
hands<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.310> staying<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> bar<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.330> then

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
hands are staying on the bar and then

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
hands are staying on the bar and then
you're<00:01:09.720> not<00:01:09.810> able<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> tense<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.680> core

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you're not able to tense your core

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070 
you're not able to tense your core
unless<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> focus<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.360> tightening<00:01:12.900> those

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
unless if you focus on tightening those

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
unless if you focus on tightening those
hip<00:01:13.320> flexors<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> puts<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
hip flexors and then that puts you in a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
hip flexors and then that puts you in a
good<00:01:15.540> position<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.080> then<00:01:16.439> focus<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.009> hip

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
good position to then focus on hip

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
good position to then focus on hip
extension<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> bottom<00:01:18.540> position<00:01:18.990> see

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
extension out of the bottom position see

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.359 
extension out of the bottom position see
that<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> tricky<00:01:19.979> part<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that is the tricky part is that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.980 
that is the tricky part is that
sometimes<00:01:20.880> people<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.810> amount

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
sometimes people have the right amount

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
sometimes people have the right amount
of<00:01:22.229> knee<00:01:22.409> bent<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.920> their<00:01:23.520> hips<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:23.909> back<00:01:23.939> but

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
of knee bent and their hips are back but

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.359 
of knee bent and their hips are back but
their<00:01:25.080> core<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.650> tight<00:01:25.979> they're<00:01:26.220> not

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
their core is not tight they're not

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
their core is not tight they're not
flexing<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> hips<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:28.020> allow<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.590> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
flexing at the hips to allow for that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.800 
flexing at the hips to allow for that
hip<00:01:28.890> extension<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:29.820> instead<00:01:30.540> they're

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
hip extension then instead they're

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020 
hip extension then instead they're
flexing<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.710> spine<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.460> bring<00:01:32.670> their<00:01:32.850> hips

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
flexing at the spine to bring their hips

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.270 
flexing at the spine to bring their hips
back<00:01:33.270> rather<00:01:33.600> than<00:01:33.780> flexing<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> hips<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
back rather than flexing at the hips and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
back rather than flexing at the hips and
that's<00:01:35.520> why<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> make<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.090> recommendation<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that's why I make that recommendation to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960 
that's why I make that recommendation to
focus<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> contraction<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.790> hip

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
focus on the contraction of your hip

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
focus on the contraction of your hip
flexors<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.869> set<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:41.250> just

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
flexors as you set up or you can just

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.490 
flexors as you set up or you can just
imagine<00:01:41.549> pulling<00:01:42.329> your<00:01:42.479> knees<00:01:42.750> up<00:01:43.049> towards

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
imagine pulling your knees up towards

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.710 
imagine pulling your knees up towards
your<00:01:43.649> torso<00:01:43.979> either<00:01:44.820> way<00:01:45.149> works<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
your torso either way works and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.450 
your torso either way works and
accomplishes<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> same<00:01:46.710> goal<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.340> it's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
accomplishes the same goal now it's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.889 
accomplishes the same goal now it's
important<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> note<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
important to note that this is just a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
important to note that this is just a
mental<00:01:49.140> cue<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> help<00:01:49.740> your<00:01:49.950> set<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.340> before

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
mental cue to help your set up before

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.999 
mental cue to help your set up before
each<00:01:51.000> rep<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.229> actually<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.710> cue

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
each rep and it's not actually a cue

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:53.899 
each rep and it's not actually a cue
that<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> use<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.790> you're

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that you want to use when you're

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.760 
that you want to use when you're
actually<00:01:54.060> lifting<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> weight<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.320> I'm

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
actually lifting the weight and I'm

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.810 
actually lifting the weight and I'm
assuming<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.430> doing<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
assuming that you're doing a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
assuming that you're doing a
conventional<00:01:57.509> stance<00:01:57.810> deadlift<00:01:58.350> when<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> say

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
conventional stance deadlift when I say

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.440 
conventional stance deadlift when I say
that<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.280> hip<00:01:59.430> flexors<00:01:59.850> aren't<00:02:00.180> actually

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that your hip flexors aren't actually

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
that your hip flexors aren't actually
going<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.899> help<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.200> lift<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> weight<00:02:01.770> that's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
going to help you lift the weight that's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.039 
going to help you lift the weight that's
just<00:02:02.520> hip<00:02:02.670> extension<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.689> want<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> say

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
just hip extension now I want to say

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.569 
just hip extension now I want to say
that<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:04.649> necessarily<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.399> case

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
that this is not necessarily the case

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.910 
that this is not necessarily the case
for<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.000> sumo<00:02:06.360> deadlift<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.290> may<00:02:07.469> feel<00:02:07.680> your

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
for the sumo deadlift you may feel your

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
for the sumo deadlift you may feel your
hip<00:02:08.069> flexors<00:02:08.520> active<00:02:08.970> throughout<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> entire

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
hip flexors active throughout the entire

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.110 
hip flexors active throughout the entire
lift<00:02:10.050> not<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> set<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.340> that's<00:02:11.910> due

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
lift not just the set up and that's due

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.530 
lift not just the set up and that's due
to<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> fact<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.720> many<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> muscle

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
to the fact that many of the muscle

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.170 
to the fact that many of the muscle
is<00:02:13.659> also<00:02:13.900> involved<00:02:14.379> in<00:02:14.680> hip<00:02:14.980> flexion<00:02:15.310> also

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
is also involved in hip flexion also

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.330 
is also involved in hip flexion also
involved<00:02:16.569> in<00:02:16.629> hip<00:02:16.930> adduction<00:02:17.439> and<00:02:17.769> external

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
involved in hip adduction and external

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.759 
involved in hip adduction and external
rotation<00:02:18.459> at<00:02:18.969> the<00:02:19.000> hips<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.930> that's<00:02:20.200> why<00:02:20.439> in<00:02:20.680> a

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
rotation at the hips so that's why in a

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.410 
rotation at the hips so that's why in a
sumo<00:02:21.040> deadlift<00:02:21.489> since<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.909> have<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> wider

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
sumo deadlift since you have a wider

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.390 
sumo deadlift since you have a wider
stance<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.200> you're<00:02:23.379> forcing<00:02:23.709> your<00:02:23.980> knees<00:02:24.159> out

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
stance and you're forcing your knees out

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.399 
stance and you're forcing your knees out
that<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.150> can<00:02:25.390> feel<00:02:25.629> some<00:02:25.840> hip<00:02:26.019> flexor

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
that you can feel some hip flexor

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.559 
that you can feel some hip flexor
soreness<00:02:26.890> there<00:02:27.099> but<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:27.969> conventional

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
soreness there but for the conventional

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.420 
soreness there but for the conventional
deadlift<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.109> really<00:02:29.439> won't<00:02:29.650> feel<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.159> and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
deadlift you really won't feel this and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.069 
deadlift you really won't feel this and
it's<00:02:30.939> really<00:02:31.000> just<00:02:31.269> tighten<00:02:31.840> your<00:02:31.930> hip

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
it's really just tighten your hip

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.589 
it's really just tighten your hip
flexors<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:32.799> for<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.069> set<00:02:33.340> up<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.730> then<00:02:34.390> you

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
flexors just for the set up and then you

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.809 
flexors just for the set up and then you
focus<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:35.079> contracting<00:02:35.709> your<00:02:35.829> glutes<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.370> of

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819
