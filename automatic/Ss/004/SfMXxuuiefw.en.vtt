like another small banjo there are other

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
like another small banjo there are other
major<00:01:08.070> differences<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.030> make<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> Dulce

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
major differences that make the Dulce

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
major differences that make the Dulce
Joe<00:01:09.930> unique<00:01:10.380> first<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> has<00:01:11.820> only

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
Joe unique first of all it has only

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060 
Joe unique first of all it has only
three<00:01:12.390> strings<00:01:12.750> similar<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> mountain

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
three strings similar to a mountain

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
three strings similar to a mountain
dulcimer<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:14.880> usually<00:01:15.270> has<00:01:15.450> three<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:15.810> four

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
dulcimer which usually has three or four

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560 
dulcimer which usually has three or four
strings<00:01:16.729> probably<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> major<00:01:18.060> difference

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
strings probably the major difference

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.810 
strings probably the major difference
though<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.470> fretboard<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.070> diatonic

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
though is that the fretboard is diatonic

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.359 
though is that the fretboard is diatonic
just<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> mountain<00:01:22.229> dulcimer<00:01:28.369> on

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
just like on the mountain dulcimer on

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
just like on the mountain dulcimer on
other<00:01:29.820> fretted<00:01:30.240> instruments<00:01:30.360> such<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
other fretted instruments such as the

other fretted instruments such as the
banjo<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> guitar<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.420> frets<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.810> laid

divided by half steps throughout the

divided by half steps throughout the
fretboard<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:38.700> allows<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.180> play<00:01:39.450> in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
fretboard which allows you to play in

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.780 
fretboard which allows you to play in
any<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> twelve<00:01:40.259> keys<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:41.220> also<00:01:41.369> makes

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
any of the twelve keys but also makes

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.190 
any of the twelve keys but also makes
things<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.119> little<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.390> difficult<00:01:43.020> because

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
things a little more difficult because

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
things a little more difficult because
there<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.799> many<00:01:43.829> wrong<00:01:44.220> notes<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.759> can

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
there are so many wrong notes that can

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.050 
there are so many wrong notes that can
be<00:01:45.030> played<00:01:45.530> by<00:01:46.530> contrast<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> Dulce<00:01:47.729> Joe<00:01:47.909> is

be played by contrast the Dulce Joe is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.389 
be played by contrast the Dulce Joe is
designed<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.570> play<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.810> only<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.320> key<00:01:49.590> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
designed to play in only one key this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.910 
designed to play in only one key this
simplifies<00:01:51.030> things<00:01:51.270> tremendously<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
simplifies things tremendously all the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
simplifies things tremendously all the
unused<00:01:53.280> notes<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:53.970> wrong<00:01:54.450> notes<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:54.990> will

thing about the Dulce Joe is that the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.270
