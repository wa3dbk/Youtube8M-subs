cam<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:36.000> clever<00:00:36.780> thing<00:00:36.870> about<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> has

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
cam the clever thing about it is it has

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.220 
cam the clever thing about it is it has
a<00:00:37.800> range<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.610> functionality<00:00:39.120> embedded<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
a range of functionality embedded in it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260 
a range of functionality embedded in it
so<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> shock<00:00:41.160> G<00:00:41.489> sensor<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.090> it'll

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so it has a shock G sensor so it'll

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.229 
so it has a shock G sensor so it'll
sense<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.170> car<00:00:43.579> has<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.730> accident<00:00:45.030> or

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
sense if your car has an accident or

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.010 
sense if your car has an accident or
something<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
something like that

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.799 
something like that
it<00:00:46.469> also<00:00:46.620> does<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> motion<00:00:47.489> detection<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.360> you

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it also does a motion detection and you

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
it also does a motion detection and you
can<00:00:48.930> download<00:00:49.110> software<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.829> trigger<00:00:50.129> various

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that it's it is a genuine high-def we've

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320 
that it's it is a genuine high-def we've
seen<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.430> quality<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> video<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.180> it's
