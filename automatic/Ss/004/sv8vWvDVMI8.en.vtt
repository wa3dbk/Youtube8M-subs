tutorial<00:00:40.610> saref<00:00:41.610> Godfrey's<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.180> barking<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
tutorial saref Godfrey's like barking in

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.540 
tutorial saref Godfrey's like barking in
the<00:00:42.629> background<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.170> basically<00:00:44.719> you<00:00:45.719> just

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
the background but basically you just

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.080 
the background but basically you just
need<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:48.239> take<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.110> bottom<00:00:49.590> layer<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.219> it

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
need to take the bottom layer and it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.580 
need to take the bottom layer and it
doesn't<00:00:51.390> matter<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.960> thick<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
doesn't matter how like thick you do it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.350 
doesn't matter how like thick you do it
it<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.100> depends<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.520> how<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.030> thick<00:00:54.239> your

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it all depends on how like thick your

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.670 
it all depends on how like thick your
hair<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.870> usually<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.260> mine<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.500> three

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
hair is I usually do mine in three

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
hair is I usually do mine in three
layers<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> start<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.750> all

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
layers so I start out like that and all

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.229 
layers so I start out like that and all
you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.620> achieve<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.340> many<00:00:59.609> ways<00:00:59.879> but

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you can achieve this in many ways but

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
you can achieve this in many ways but
this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> way<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:02.190> of

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this is just the way I do it kind of

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
this is just the way I do it kind of
pull<00:01:02.460> everything<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> front<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
pull everything to the front and I just

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.800 
pull everything to the front and I just
take<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.820> section<00:01:06.210> by<00:01:06.360> section<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
take a little section by section and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.260 
take a little section by section and
really<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> flick<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> wrist<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
really like do a flick of the wrist and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.550 
really like do a flick of the wrist and
just<00:01:09.360> curve<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> under<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:12.560> like

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
just curve it under it like that like

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
just curve it under it like that like
that<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that you see you really just want to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.090 
that you see you really just want to
curve<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.200> under<00:01:16.439> almost<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.979> you're

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
curve it under almost as if you're

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.760 
curve it under almost as if you're
curling<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:19.009> like<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.200> push

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
curling it like that and then just push

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.570 
curling it like that and then just push
it<00:01:22.920> over<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> side

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
it over to the side

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.220 
it over to the side
and<00:01:25.150> then<00:01:25.300> adjusted<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.110> was<00:01:26.230> needed<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.820> so

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
and then adjusted it was needed like so

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.050 
and then adjusted it was needed like so
and<00:01:29.230> I<00:01:29.830> do<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.130> in<00:01:30.220> three<00:01:30.400> layers<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:30.880> just

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
and I do that in three layers and I just

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.060 
and I do that in three layers and I just
do<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.270> same<00:01:31.450> thing<00:01:31.510> to<00:01:31.810> each<00:01:31.840> one<00:01:32.260> basically

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
do the same thing to each one basically

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.380 
do the same thing to each one basically
what<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.370> really<00:01:33.610> wants<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.940> get<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.120> lot<00:01:34.270> of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
what you really wants to get a lot of

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.350 
what you really wants to get a lot of
volume<00:01:34.690> at<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.870> root<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.460> some<00:01:36.460> curl<00:01:36.790> almost

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
volume at the root and some curl almost

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.880 
volume at the root and some curl almost
at<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.750> root<00:01:37.930> because<00:01:38.290> that's<00:01:38.500> where<00:01:38.710> like

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
at the root because that's where like

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.740 
at the root because that's where like
the<00:01:39.100> volume<00:01:39.460> comes<00:01:39.730> from<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.330> that's<00:01:40.480> how<00:01:40.630> it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
the volume comes from and that's how it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.920 
the volume comes from and that's how it
really<00:01:40.960> gets<00:01:41.230> that<00:01:41.380> swoopy<00:01:41.860> effect<00:01:42.190> is<00:01:42.930> by

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
really gets that swoopy effect is by

00:01:43.930 --> 00:02:12.000 
really gets that swoopy effect is by
curving<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:44.740> under

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.520 

then<00:02:12.549> afterwards<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.439> adjust<00:02:14.560> as<00:02:15.069> needed

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.350 

make<00:02:20.070> sure<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.340> always<00:02:20.460> spray<00:02:21.150> heat

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
make sure you always spray heat

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.480

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
remind the night before otherwise it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.450 
remind the night before otherwise it
gets<00:02:25.080> too<00:02:25.230> greasy<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.070> do<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.370> the
