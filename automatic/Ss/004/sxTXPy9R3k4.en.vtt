00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.220

 sweet with a thrifty 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.509
 the thrifty boxing foodies we will cut the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.159
 sweet potatoes in pieces in pub for 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.610
 cook them in the water so I put some water 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.610
 to boil 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.090
 we will put the sweet potatoes to cook 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.729
 in boiling water and we will check 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.719
 cooking by planting a knife 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.190
 while sweet potatoes are in 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.640
 train of cooking we will continue with the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.989
 zucchini 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.810
 will be cut into slices not too 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.690
 thick we're just going to go from 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.640
 olive oil on zucchini for 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.480
 avoid putting too much especially we pass 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.590
 olive oil on both sides and we're going 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.319
 put them in a hot pan 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.819
 for grates and sweet potatoes 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.310
 have cooked about twenty minutes 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.200
 now we will crush them with a 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.069
 fork is where a potato masher but a 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.950
 fork works very well 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.269
 we will crush my bosses I like 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.980
 to keep some textures in 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.830
 mashed sweet potatoes we're going 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.620
 also add olive oil a 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.500
 or two tablespoons and self 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.280
 help then jump again to the choice 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.310
 take that one back in mashed potatoes 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.000
 sweet potato I will also added 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.280
 some chopped hazelnuts 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.319
 everything is ready for our gratin us 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.329
 have the leaves to grill the mashed potatoes 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.010
 sweet potatoes with hazelnuts and 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.430
 red onions grilled in oil oven 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.709
 olive 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.900
 then we will take the dishes to 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.910
 gratin here two small individual dishes 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.500
 end anyway for at least two 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.420
 people can make a big gratin 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.310
 pumpkins do that in the dish that 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.350
 so we want for editing I 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.040
 proposes to make a millefeuille in 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.810
 several layers 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.180
 so we will take onions in the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.730
 background then we feel the onions that 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.410
 crunch we're going to put a little bit of 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.790
 onion cream from the cross street is 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.569
 in grilled onions 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.799
 we put a small teaspoon 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.490
 say losses as we can on the 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.640
 onions 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.550
 we're going to put a layer of mashed potatoes 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.990
 sweet potato on mashed potatoes 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.380
 sweet I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.960
 Confit Mediterranean zucchini 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.100
 a thin layer and we will put or 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.100
 layers of grilled zucchini 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.650
 and we end up with a layer of hazelnut 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.170
 we will put on top 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.970
 and we're going to bake them a 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.200
 fifteen minutes since the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.790
 zucchini are already cooked August already 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.370
 just slipped for everything warmed up and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.290
 with shrimp the skewers of 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.769
 shrimp 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.289
 then we plant as we can 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.459
 two three shrimp per person 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.870
 once we've done the skewers of 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.220
 shrimp we're going to cook them then 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.960

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.710
