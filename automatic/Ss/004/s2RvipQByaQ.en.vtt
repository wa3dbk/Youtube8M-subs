00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.210
 hello everyone then in this 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.359
 video i'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.320
 fortify your hair so with 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.790
 uncontrolled elements at home what 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.940
 you will need it will be just a 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.000
 soup spoon a knife a small 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.679
 ramekin to mix so not very not 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.310
 up one way there is not a lot of 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:28.240
 products an egg and a half lemon 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.330
 so I just broke my work 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.010
 entirely in the small ramekin 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.330
 you can simply select the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.050
 egg yolk 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.810
 if you really want to target the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.820
 fortifying your hair but if 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.040
 you put the white over it's going 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.810
 allow to feed your hair too 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.670
 so it's not bad to leave 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.430
 whole instead of throwing some of 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.600
 the eye and so we will mix it 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.880
 with the tablespoon 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.950
 so I take my tablespoon I 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.230
 come broke the yellow then I come on 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.230
 mixture is so to egg whites 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.170
 until the mix is ​​really 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.560
 homogeneous and so goes 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.009
 my mix so and so john ware 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.930
 orange even but it is well mixed because 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.740
 there are no more whites than we can 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.590
 see so now I come to take 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.869
 my whole lemon and my knife and I 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.990
 will come cut in the very center of 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.990
 lemon to come take a single side 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.399
 so here I take the part that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.240
 interests me and I leave aside 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.920
 putting it in the refrigerator 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.740
 I resume my mix with my friendship 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.990
 of lemon and I'm going to come and squeeze my 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.549
 half of lemon so in the nine in 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.299
 avoiding of course to do like me and 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.709
 to put two everywhere so for the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:07.649
 glitches it does not matter you'll 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:08.160
 if the line produces it later 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.170
 you 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.030
 to see that there are movements 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.030
 egg yolk that did not mix 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.910
 properly so has my lemon so I 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.610
 just mix the product until the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.240
 touch is really mixed and that it 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.240
 forms a whole and a homogeneous liquid 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.150
 so this preparation will require 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.940
 apply it on your scalp in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.850
 massaging delicately it will be necessary 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.350
 leave it a few minutes and rinse it 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.030
 abundantly with warm water 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.610
 your hair will be stronger and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.400
 invigorated so I tell you very soon 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.400
