but<00:00:44.399> fostex<00:00:44.969> has<00:00:45.239> moves<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.930> lot<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.440> that

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
but fostex has moves a lot of that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
but fostex has moves a lot of that
technology<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.360> build<00:00:48.750> into<00:00:49.260> their<00:00:49.440> new<00:00:49.739> line

technology and build into their new line
I<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.390> made<00:00:51.570> some<00:00:51.719> major

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I do think they made some major

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680 
I do think they made some major
improvements<00:00:52.079> however<00:00:52.829> though<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> first

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
improvements however though the first

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.490 
improvements however though the first
one<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> bill<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> th<00:00:56.730> 600<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.320> can

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
one on the bill is the th 600 so you can

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
one on the bill is the th 600 so you can
see<00:00:58.710> these<00:00:58.859> really<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.239> lot<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> old

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960

black<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> Denton's<00:01:19.619> tended<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.460> kind

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
black the Denton's tended to have kind

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450 
black the Denton's tended to have kind
of<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> thick<00:01:21.930> low-mid<00:01:22.530> response<00:01:22.950> sometimes

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
of a thick low-mid response sometimes

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
of a thick low-mid response sometimes
and<00:01:23.820> maybe<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.299> little<00:01:24.810> bit<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.200> recessed

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and maybe a little bit of a recessed

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.700 
and maybe a little bit of a recessed
upper<00:01:26.220> mid-range<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> vocal<00:01:27.330> region<00:01:27.710> but

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
upper mid-range in the vocal region but

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.679 
upper mid-range in the vocal region but
these<00:01:28.890> phones<00:01:29.159> definitely<00:01:29.880> tighten<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
these phones definitely tighten up that

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.039 
these phones definitely tighten up that
bass<00:01:31.259> response<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.750> think<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.900> they're

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
bass response a bit I think that they're

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.420 
bass response a bit I think that they're
just<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.290> cleaner<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> low<00:01:35.159> mids

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
just a little cleaner in the low mids

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.480 
just a little cleaner in the low mids
and<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.170> vocals<00:01:37.170> tend<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.250> more

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
and the vocals tend to be a bit more

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.350 
and the vocals tend to be a bit more
present<00:01:39.890> just<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.009> very<00:01:41.220> nice<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.000> open

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360

sound<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.470> impressed<00:01:43.560> by<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
sound I was really impressed by the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.149 
sound I was really impressed by the
soundstage<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.060> fostex<00:01:45.570> 602<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
soundstage on these fostex 602 for a

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.249 
soundstage on these fostex 602 for a
closed<00:01:47.399> backbone<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.149> felt<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.810> sounded

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
closed backbone I felt that they sounded

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.970 
closed backbone I felt that they sounded
just<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.680> airaid<00:01:50.159> or<00:01:50.340> maybe<00:01:50.549> even

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
just as airaid or maybe even

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.760 
just as airaid or maybe even
more<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:51.310> than<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.850> lot<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.330> open<00:01:53.320> backs<00:01:53.530> at

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
more so than a lot of the open backs at

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.440 
more so than a lot of the open backs at
this<00:01:53.890> price<00:01:54.130> range<00:01:54.280> if<00:01:55.000> you're<00:01:55.180> into

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
this price range if you're into

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.300 
this price range if you're into
electronic<00:01:56.020> music<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:56.560> really<00:01:56.770> anything<00:01:57.040> I

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
electronic music or really anything I

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.620 
electronic music or really anything I
think<00:01:57.520> these<00:01:57.580> are<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.760> pretty<00:01:57.940> personal<00:01:58.210> phone

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
think these are a pretty personal phone

think these are a pretty personal phone
the<00:01:58.870> bass<00:01:59.050> response<00:01:59.260> is<00:01:59.710> fun<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.280> punchy<00:02:00.910> but

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
the bass response is fun and punchy but

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.230 
the bass response is fun and punchy but

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
pretty well controlled and tight as you

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.650 
pretty well controlled and tight as you
get<00:02:04.540> up<00:02:04.570> into<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.080> th<00:02:05.410> 900<00:02:06.280> it's<00:02:07.270> really<00:02:07.630> a

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
get up into the th 900 it's really a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.710 
get up into the th 900 it's really a
pretty<00:02:08.220> similar<00:02:09.220> sounding<00:02:09.670> phone<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.060> 600

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
pretty similar sounding phone to the 600

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.560 
pretty similar sounding phone to the 600
but<00:02:10.960> kind<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.770> reminds<00:02:12.190> me<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:13.120> move<00:02:13.330> from

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
but kind of reminds me of the move from

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.870 
but kind of reminds me of the move from
like<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> denon<00:02:14.230> 2000<00:02:14.890> maybe<00:02:15.250> up<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.730> dead

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
like the denon 2000 maybe up to the dead

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.670 
like the denon 2000 maybe up to the dead
and<00:02:16.060> five<00:02:16.210> thousand<00:02:16.690> or<00:02:16.810> seven<00:02:17.110> thousand<00:02:17.530> is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and five thousand or seven thousand is

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.790 
and five thousand or seven thousand is
just<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.070> more<00:02:18.310> buttery<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.780> know<00:02:19.930> lush<00:02:20.410> kind

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
just a more buttery you know lush kind

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.070 
just a more buttery you know lush kind
of<00:02:20.890> sound<00:02:21.130> especially<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.390> base<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:22.900> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
of sound especially in the base it's a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.560 
of sound especially in the base it's a
little<00:02:23.320> bit<00:02:23.440> heftier<00:02:24.030> maybe<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.120> little<00:02:25.330> bit

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
little bit heftier maybe a little bit

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.720 
little bit heftier maybe a little bit
more<00:02:25.840> aggressive<00:02:25.960> in<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.770> base<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.460> still

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
more aggressive in the base but still

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.690 
more aggressive in the base but still
what<00:02:27.880> control<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.800> did<00:02:29.800> feel<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.040> compared<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
what control I did feel that compared to

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.270 
what control I did feel that compared to
the<00:02:30.850> 600<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.510> 900s<00:02:32.110> are<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.470> little<00:02:32.740> smoother

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the 600 the 900s are a little smoother

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.520 
the 600 the 900s are a little smoother
in<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.060> upper<00:02:34.330> mid-range<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.200> high

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
in the upper mid-range and high

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.420 
in the upper mid-range and high
frequency<00:02:36.100> response<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.130> seemed<00:02:39.340> like

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
frequency response it just seemed like

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.400 
frequency response it just seemed like
the<00:02:39.580> 600<00:02:40.270> sometimes<00:02:40.660> could<00:02:40.930> get<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.080> little

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
the 600 sometimes could get a little

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.320 
the 600 sometimes could get a little
edgy<00:02:41.920> if<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.400> wanted<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.760> kind<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.000> turn<00:02:43.150> them

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
edgy if you wanted to kind of turn them

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.310 
edgy if you wanted to kind of turn them
up<00:02:43.710> but<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.950> 900<00:02:45.610> really<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.390> sounds<00:02:46.780> silky

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
up but the 900 really just sounds silky

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.880 
up but the 900 really just sounds silky
and<00:02:47.440> smooth<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.130> still<00:02:49.120> very<00:02:49.330> open<00:02:49.720> did<00:02:50.650> feel

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
and smooth and still very open did feel

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.620 
and smooth and still very open did feel
that<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.190> sound<00:02:51.400> stage<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.880> probably<00:02:52.210> even<00:02:52.450> a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
that the sound stage is probably even a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.720 
that the sound stage is probably even a
little<00:02:52.810> better<00:02:53.080> on<00:02:53.380> these<00:02:53.830> nine<00:02:54.070> hundreds<00:02:54.520> and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
little better on these nine hundreds and

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.550 
little better on these nine hundreds and
compared<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.660> stuff<00:02:55.870> like<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.140> AH<00:02:56.170> disease

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
compared to stuff like the AH disease

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.500 
compared to stuff like the AH disease
and<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:56.980> other<00:02:57.130> open<00:02:57.430> back<00:02:57.610> phones<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.209> think

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
and the other open back phones I think

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.990 
and the other open back phones I think
that<00:02:58.690> they<00:02:58.810> really<00:02:58.840> have<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.370> spacious<00:03:00.370> sound

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
that they really have a spacious sound

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.900 
that they really have a spacious sound
that's<00:03:01.990> very<00:03:02.170> competitive<00:03:02.740> with<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.580> planar

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
that's very competitive with the planar

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.000 
that's very competitive with the planar
magnetic<00:03:04.120> sand<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.870> other<00:03:05.020> open<00:03:05.380> bags<00:03:05.590> you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
magnetic sand the other open bags you

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.710 
magnetic sand the other open bags you
see<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.250> construction<00:03:06.489> on<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.030> 900<00:03:07.540> is

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
see the construction on the 900 is

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.680 
see the construction on the 900 is
pretty<00:03:07.930> much<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.110> same<00:03:08.380> as<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.590> 600<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:10.150> is

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
pretty much the same as a 600 it is

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.660 
pretty much the same as a 600 it is
actually<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.410> Whittier<00:03:11.770> cup<00:03:12.010> though<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.489> these

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
actually a Whittier cup though on these

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.780 
actually a Whittier cup though on these
nine<00:03:12.850> hundreds<00:03:13.239> with<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:13.959> red<00:03:14.200> finish<00:03:14.530> on

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
nine hundreds with this red finish on

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.280 
nine hundreds with this red finish on
glossy<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.180> some<00:03:16.540> people<00:03:16.780> find<00:03:16.870> out<00:03:17.020> a<00:03:17.080> little

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
glossy so some people find out a little

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.890 
glossy so some people find out a little
sexier<00:03:17.680> cooler<00:03:18.300> definitely<00:03:19.300> kind<00:03:19.570> of<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.750> hip

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
sexier cooler definitely kind of a hip

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.040 
sexier cooler definitely kind of a hip

color red the earcups on both of these

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.660 
color red the earcups on both of these
are<00:03:23.230> very<00:03:23.440> comfortable<00:03:23.770> they<00:03:24.280> don't<00:03:24.459> really

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
are very comfortable they don't really

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.670 
are very comfortable they don't really
have<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.820> tapered<00:03:25.360> feel<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:26.020> them<00:03:26.200> like<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.560> old

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
have a tapered feel to them like the old

have a tapered feel to them like the old
Dennis<00:03:27.040> did<00:03:27.340> but<00:03:27.870> they<00:03:28.870> sit<00:03:29.140> nice<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.350> light

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
Dennis did but they sit nice and light

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.650 
Dennis did but they sit nice and light
on<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.100> ears<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.489> overall<00:03:31.090> they're<00:03:31.300> not<00:03:31.480> very

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
on the ears and overall they're not very

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
heavy headphones they do have a cloth

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.770 
heavy headphones they do have a cloth
cable<00:03:35.140> or<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.190> cloth<00:03:36.459> wrapped<00:03:36.730> cable<00:03:37.209> with

quarter-inch determination both of them

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.130 
quarter-inch determination both of them
do

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
do

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.370 
do
they<00:03:40.770> do<00:03:40.830> not<00:03:41.010> come<00:03:41.220> with<00:03:41.370> an<00:03:41.460> adapter<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.840> if

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
they do not come with an adapter so if

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.990 
they do not come with an adapter so if
you've<00:03:43.620> got<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.860> little<00:03:44.220> portable<00:03:44.550> amp<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.940> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
you've got a little portable amp of the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.280 
you've got a little portable amp of the
mini<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.360> might<00:03:45.540> want<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.780> think<00:03:45.870> about<00:03:45.990> being

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
mini you might want to think about being

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.530 
mini you might want to think about being
a<00:03:46.350> quarter<00:03:46.650> inch<00:03:47.040> adapter<00:03:47.300> but<00:03:48.300> these<00:03:48.420> are

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
a quarter inch adapter but these are

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.390 
a quarter inch adapter but these are
definitely<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.990> good<00:03:49.170> contender<00:03:49.560> both<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.310> them

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
definitely a good contender both of them

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.520 
definitely a good contender both of them
for<00:03:50.430> portable<00:03:51.209> clothes<00:03:51.510> back<00:03:51.780> they<00:03:52.380> are

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
for portable clothes back they are

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.699 
for portable clothes back they are
fairly<00:03:52.770> easy<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.130> drive<00:03:53.660> 25<00:03:54.660> ohms<00:03:55.020> on<00:03:55.500> both<00:03:55.680> of

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
would maybe recommend you're having a

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.050 
would maybe recommend you're having a
lot<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.750> these<00:04:42.870> aussie<00:04:43.310> travel<00:04:44.310> cases<00:04:44.520> they're

lot of these aussie travel cases they're

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.980 
lot of these aussie travel cases they're
75<00:04:45.419> bucks<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:47.000> they<00:04:48.000> fit<00:04:48.180> perfectly<00:04:48.570> in<00:04:48.750> there

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
75 bucks and they fit perfectly in there

nice foam lined interior waterproof so

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.610 
nice foam lined interior waterproof so
this<00:04:53.760> would<00:04:53.940> be<00:04:53.970> my<00:04:54.240> choice<00:04:54.270> for<00:04:54.870> taking<00:04:55.560> these

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
this would be my choice for taking these

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.710 
this would be my choice for taking these
portably<00:04:56.070> because<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.669> definitely<00:04:57.300> wouldn't

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
portably because I definitely wouldn't

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.090 
portably because I definitely wouldn't
want<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:58.020> stuff<00:04:58.260> in<00:04:58.470> my<00:04:58.590> suitcase<00:04:58.800> or

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
want to stuff in my suitcase or

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.680 
want to stuff in my suitcase or
something<00:04:59.310> like<00:04:59.370> that<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.580> although<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:03.210> 600

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
something like that so although the 600

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.960 
something like that so although the 600
and<00:05:03.810> 900<00:05:03.960> are<00:05:04.440> fairly<00:05:04.919> similar<00:05:05.160> I<00:05:05.580> think<00:05:05.610> some

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
and 900 are fairly similar I think some

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.000 
and 900 are fairly similar I think some
people<00:05:06.240> might<00:05:06.270> actually<00:05:06.690> like<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.470> 600<00:05:07.979> a

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
people might actually like the 600 a

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.830 
people might actually like the 600 a
little<00:05:08.220> better<00:05:08.400> in<00:05:08.760> certain<00:05:09.000> ways<00:05:09.120> because<00:05:09.690> it

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
little better in certain ways because it

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.440 
little better in certain ways because it
is<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.380> tap<00:05:10.590> cleaner<00:05:10.950> and<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.490> base<00:05:11.700> is<00:05:12.060> a

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
is the tap cleaner and the base is a

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.080 
is the tap cleaner and the base is a
little<00:05:12.750> more<00:05:12.900> reserved<00:05:13.669> kind<00:05:14.669> of<00:05:14.700> reminds<00:05:15.030> me

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
little more reserved kind of reminds me

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.910 
little more reserved kind of reminds me
of<00:05:15.210> like<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.630> set<00:05:15.900> eyes<00:05:16.080> are<00:05:16.229> 600<00:05:16.740> versys<00:05:17.010> 650

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
of like the set eyes are 600 versys 650

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.550 
of like the set eyes are 600 versys 650
600<00:05:19.520> is<00:05:19.610> just<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:19.910> little<00:05:20.120> bit<00:05:20.300> cleaner<00:05:21.140> more

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
600 is just a little bit cleaner more

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.460 
600 is just a little bit cleaner more
open<00:05:21.950> kind<00:05:22.430> of<00:05:22.490> sound<00:05:22.790> in<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.210> highs<00:05:23.390> not<00:05:24.290> that

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
open kind of sound in the highs not that

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.070 
open kind of sound in the highs not that
the<00:05:24.620> sound<00:05:24.830> stage<00:05:25.100> is<00:05:25.490> better<00:05:26.270> really<00:05:26.780> in<00:05:26.960> the

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
the sound stage is better really in the

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.490 
the sound stage is better really in the
th<00:05:27.350> 600<00:05:28.010> and<00:05:28.220> 900<00:05:28.520> but<00:05:29.090> I<00:05:29.330> think<00:05:30.230> that<00:05:30.380> they

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
th 600 and 900 but I think that they

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.080 
th 600 and 900 but I think that they
just<00:05:30.530> pop<00:05:30.980> a<00:05:31.010> little<00:05:31.280> more<00:05:31.550> in<00:05:31.670> the<00:05:31.700> Volga

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
just pop a little more in the Volga

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.660 
just pop a little more in the Volga
region<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.680> bass<00:05:33.890> just<00:05:34.250> doesn't<00:05:34.550> quite

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
region and the bass just doesn't quite

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.970 
region and the bass just doesn't quite
have<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:34.940> enhancement<00:05:35.870> of<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.020> 900<00:05:36.620> so<00:05:36.860> if

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
have the enhancement of the 900 so if

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.170 
have the enhancement of the 900 so if
you're<00:05:37.100> looking<00:05:37.340> for<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.520> slightly<00:05:37.880> more

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
you're looking for a slightly more

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.410 
you're looking for a slightly more
neutral<00:05:38.720> presentation<00:05:39.560> 600<00:05:40.550> might<00:05:40.910> be<00:05:41.240> up

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
neutral presentation 600 might be up

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.300 
neutral presentation 600 might be up
your<00:05:41.570> alley<00:05:41.720> more<00:05:42.050> so<00:05:42.230> than<00:05:42.380> than<00:05:42.530> 900<00:05:42.950> so<00:05:43.190> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
your alley more so than than 900 so the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.670 
your alley more so than than 900 so the
th<00:05:43.610> 600<00:05:44.330> is<00:05:44.620> 1299<00:05:46.840> fairly<00:05:47.840> reasonable<00:05:48.500> price

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
th 600 is 1299 fairly reasonable price

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.900 
th 600 is 1299 fairly reasonable price
points<00:05:49.190> I<00:05:49.340> guess<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:50.360> 900<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.280> 1999<00:05:52.280> so<00:05:52.670> that

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
points I guess the 900 is 1999 so that

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.780 
points I guess the 900 is 1999 so that
bumps<00:05:53.180> it<00:05:53.300> up<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.510> little<00:05:53.630> bit<00:05:53.810> more<00:05:54.460> but<00:05:55.460> if

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
bumps it up a little bit more but if

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.950 
bumps it up a little bit more but if
you're<00:05:56.000> in<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.150> market<00:05:56.300> for<00:05:56.450> some<00:05:56.600> high-end
