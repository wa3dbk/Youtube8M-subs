00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.610
 joker let's say that's what he did 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.819

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.429
 here they made her skin 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.450
 imagine that he had purple eyes 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:56.119
 like steve and the first thing they started with 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.670
 this ski put his smile on his face 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.980

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 purple eyes 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.300
 and what is the good thing that happened 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.230
 and when 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.130
 they were doing minecraft for 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.130

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.950
 as i will tell you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.370

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.590
 latex 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.940
 this this evening by introducing the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.209
 character fall that would call 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.549
 this dlc and the name came from the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.299
 characters of a fired creator 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:39.190
 because they were in 3-d they were not square 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:42.070
 they were 3d and the animations were very ugly 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.770
 he was fired and he remained 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.750
 character that was called steve and from there 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.050
 they took out the name I hope that I did not 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.300
 interrupt and good this 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.020
 we had already told them I had the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.100
 smile quoted and when he pulled that out I 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.050
 they were saying skiing 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:08.850
 this they wanted to introduce this a new 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:11.250
 character to be like the frog the vile 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.690
 yesterday all this is nothing else I would like 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.880
 introduce yourself as a character so that 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.430
 you feel accompanied more or less 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.900
 said night he hears then so he does not 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.410
 feel alone the player we are going to 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.080
 put a character a company and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.010
 they put this guy here 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.420
 what 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.520
 with purple eyes 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.120
 and you were the same or it was the same as you 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.310
 flames what night did you prefer that you do not 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.959
 They erased but as I tell them as night 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.880
 he was very joker he put his eyes on 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.440
 white but what happened 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.470
 when they added it up they did the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.450
 test of how it came out yesterday work and rather 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.280
 this your company how it came out and this one 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.800
 had the animations that opened the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.290
 Chests had chopped doors and all that 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.480
 is that when we decided to remove it 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.640
 rolled his eyes and left the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.700
 animations of whole skin and 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.360
 good animations in the alpha I think that 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.360
 it was in the alpha 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.080
 to the wiki 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.960
 today I do not see if I think that here says a 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.760
 fire image 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.440
 Let's see 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:25.260
 and here says alpha version 1.0 point 16 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.250
 and diagonal under 0 2 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:33.690
 good with that this when they launched 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.060
 the alpha this reunion that put the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.850
 eyes blank and everything left the skin and 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.340
 when the player does not know if this is 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.410
 true actually with the player saw a 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.390
 hero brain 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.120
 maybe we set up the animations 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.449
 so that he exposes so that Spain 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.120
 in front of you or next to you 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.330
 that put him to be shy I do not know what for 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.900
 that started running this hero brain is 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.680
 a money for removing the dirty face and 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:08.500
 this and steve I think he brings it clean 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.650
 It reminds me of a song and good 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.380
 this one stayed the animations and everything 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:22.120
 and it was even better it was not until it was up 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:24.460
 beta 1.6 in which you already read you are 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.289
 removing it and removed it 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.110
 animations 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.279
 this of ger work and its corner and no longer 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.369
 found in the archives but to me 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:35.499
 It makes you look me follow your animations 

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:36.939
 since tonight is very like the chest 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:39.729
 closed and guasa link and is appearing 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.560
 and it opened us that the waters did not touch me 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.480
 but so says 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.730
 and well that's the true story of 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.550
 hero brain was a mystical bro product 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.770
 of nights is no ghost and today it 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.419
 He put a lot of time on the computer 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.770
 died on top or donnell on the cake 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.440
 carnal 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.550
 so true and good that's the truth 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.610
 history is not knitting man is a 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.590
 product of the prank days at night 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.650
 they are the eyes in white left the 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.800
 animations and everything and that's it 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.210
 this start a new series maybe 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.700
 So if I upload this video myself 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.229
 but good that 's all 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.510
 I only have to edit if I have been 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.650
 in the suppose I put me in and deleted 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.660
 the frames 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.660
 and well that's all goodbye
