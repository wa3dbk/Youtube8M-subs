police seaplane mock I built it using

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.910 
police seaplane mock I built it using
most<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.210> pieces<00:00:09.420> from<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.200> lego<00:00:10.590> city

see in the background here I will

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.460 
see in the background here I will
rebuild<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.720> back<00:00:18.990> into<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> helicopter

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
rebuild it back into the helicopter

because as cool as my plane is I still
like<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> helicopter<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> little<00:00:23.580> bit<00:00:23.699> more

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
little set to take apart and rebuild and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.519 
little set to take apart and rebuild and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.319 
try and build your own things and I came
up<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:32.420> as<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:34.140> i<00:00:34.410> am<00:00:34.739> using

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
up with this as you can see i am using

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.850 
up with this as you can see i am using
parts<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.719> weren't<00:00:36.899> included<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> set

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
parts that weren't included in the set

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
parts that weren't included in the set
first<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.210> notice<00:00:39.329> would<00:00:39.629> be

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
first thing that you notice would be

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.340 
first thing that you notice would be
these<00:00:39.960> big<00:00:40.200> wing<00:00:40.469> pieces<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.840> rear<00:00:43.050> wings

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
these big wing pieces and the rear wings

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.430 
these big wing pieces and the rear wings
those<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> biggest<00:00:45.809> things<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.289> are

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
those are the biggest things that are

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.100 
those are the biggest things that are
not<00:00:46.559> including<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.510> included<00:00:48.930> in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
not including that are not included in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.400 
not including that are not included in
the<00:00:49.620> set<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> background<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.020> had<00:00:52.230> them

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the set in the background but I had them

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
the set in the background but I had them
anyway<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.890> they're<00:00:53.340> white<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> use<00:00:54.539> them

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
anyway and they're white so I use them

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.500 
anyway and they're white so I use them
and<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.850> comes<00:00:57.090> off<00:00:57.239> easily

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and as you can see it comes off easily

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.229 
and as you can see it comes off easily
there<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> reason<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.789> I'll<00:00:59.910> show<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
there is a reason but I'll show you that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.930 
there is a reason but I'll show you that
in<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.750> second<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> building<00:01:02.789> up

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
in a second just kind of building up

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.590 
in a second just kind of building up
kind<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.300> off<00:01:03.390> camera<00:01:03.799> sorry<00:01:04.799> guys<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.970> yeah<00:01:06.180> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
kind of off camera sorry guys so yeah it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.710 
kind of off camera sorry guys so yeah it
looks<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.900> bit<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.350> Cessna<00:01:08.479> it's<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.630> my

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
looks a bit like a Cessna it's not my

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
looks a bit like a Cessna it's not my
best<00:01:09.930> creation<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:10.860> pretty<00:01:11.280> cool

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
best creation but it's pretty cool

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.230 
best creation but it's pretty cool
considering<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> limit<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.350> had<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:14.240> 94

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
considering the limit that I had of 94

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.710 
considering the limit that I had of 94
pieces<00:01:15.720> plus<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> couple<00:01:16.439> others<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.630> I

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
pieces plus a couple others I think I

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140 
pieces plus a couple others I think I
did<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> pretty<00:01:18.960> good<00:01:19.290> job<00:01:19.640> see<00:01:20.640> you've<00:01:20.790> got<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
did a pretty good job see you've got the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.700 
did a pretty good job see you've got the
propeller<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> front<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.439> spins

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
propeller in the front here that spins

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.200 
propeller in the front here that spins
um<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:24.360> camera<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:26.100> doesn't<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.640> focus

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
um this camera it doesn't really focus

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
um this camera it doesn't really focus
very<00:01:27.390> well<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> set<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.040> macro

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
very well you have to set it to macro

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
very well you have to set it to macro
but<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.759> set<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> macro<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.960> all

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
but if I set it to macro then it's all

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.219 
but if I set it to macro then it's all
unfocused<00:01:31.920> back<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> macro

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
unfocused back here so it's not a macro

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.510 
unfocused back here so it's not a macro
right<00:01:34.439> now<00:01:34.619> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> sucks<00:01:36.409> I'm<00:01:37.409> hoping<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.490> be

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
right now kind of sucks I'm hoping to be

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.359 
right now kind of sucks I'm hoping to be
able<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.880> use<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> different<00:01:39.180> camera<00:01:40.189> it's<00:01:41.189> my

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
able to use a different camera it's my

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.520 
able to use a different camera it's my
mom's<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.840> he<00:01:42.930> doesn't<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.470> me

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
mom's but if he doesn't really like me

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
yeah so there's a good amount of detail

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.319 
you got some like engine detail here
it's<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> best<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.390> pretty<00:01:58.350> nice

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's not the best you know pretty nice
the<00:02:00.329> bottom<00:02:00.810> design<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.920> pretty<00:02:02.219> much<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the bottom design is pretty much the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.510
