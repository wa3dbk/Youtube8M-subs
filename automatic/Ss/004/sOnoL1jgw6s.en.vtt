the first thing I'm going to discuss is

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.470 
the first thing I'm going to discuss is
the<00:00:09.960> external<00:00:10.650> output<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> report<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:12.210> has

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
the external output or the report it has

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.760 
the external output or the report it has

mistake<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.599> they<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.810> eight<00:00:28.080> or<00:00:28.349> nine<00:00:28.529> data

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
mistake and they have eight or nine data

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.620 
mistake and they have eight or nine data

city<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.390> there's<00:00:33.570> seven<00:00:33.809> data<00:00:34.110> elements<00:00:34.530> on

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
city so there's seven data elements on

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.580 
city so there's seven data elements on
this<00:00:34.829> report<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.930> there's<00:00:37.110> seven<00:00:37.320> data

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this report so there's seven data

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.080 
this report so there's seven data
elements<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.250> only<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.460> file<00:00:38.820> type

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
elements and there's only one file type

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.340 
elements and there's only one file type
referenced<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:42.210> means<00:00:42.420> we'd<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.230> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
referenced that means we'd be in this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.330 
referenced that means we'd be in this
column<00:00:43.800> between<00:00:44.190> 6<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> 19<00:00:44.910> data<00:00:45.300> elements

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
column between 6 and 19 data elements

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
column between 6 and 19 data elements
less<00:00:47.340> than<00:00:47.370> 2<00:00:47.730> ft<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.870> rate<00:00:49.110> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
less than 2 ft are so we rate this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
less than 2 ft are so we rate this
external<00:00:49.890> output<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> low<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> would<00:00:51.120> be

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
external output as a low and it would be

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.319 
external output as a low and it would be
valued<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.690> 4<00:00:51.899> function<00:00:52.320> points<00:00:56.030> now<00:00:57.030> let's

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
valued with 4 function points now let's

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.740 
valued with 4 function points now let's
look<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> external<00:00:58.020> inputs<00:00:59.449> there's<00:01:00.449> an

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
look at the external inputs there's an

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.049 
look at the external inputs there's an
add<00:01:00.899> Change<00:01:01.320> button<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.489> kicks<00:01:02.730> off<00:01:02.879> an

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
add Change button that kicks off an

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.390 
add Change button that kicks off an
external<00:01:03.780> input<00:01:05.510> there's<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> city

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
external input there's one for the city

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.179 
external input there's one for the city
one<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> state<00:01:08.909> data<00:01:09.330> elements

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
one for the state data elements

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.320 
one for the state data elements
temperature<00:01:11.299> rainfall<00:01:12.470> date<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
temperature rainfall date and then the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.510 
temperature rainfall date and then the
6th<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.020> would<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.650> add<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.220> change

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
6th one would be the add or change

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.660 
6th one would be the add or change
button<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.049> an<00:01:19.140> e<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> add<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:20.400> six

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
button so we have an e I add with six

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.780 
button so we have an e I add with six

let's look at the external enquiry again

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.360 
let's look at the external enquiry again
we<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.119> some<00:02:09.899> buttons<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.979> would<00:02:11.280> be

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
we have some buttons and this would be

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.220 
we have some buttons and this would be
kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.209> data<00:02:12.420> element

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
kind of just as one data element

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.710 
kind of just as one data element
but<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.160> data<00:02:14.430> element<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.940> city

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
but we have a data element for city

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.750 
but we have a data element for city
state<00:02:16.760> temperature<00:02:17.760> rainfall<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.319> date<00:02:19.950> all

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
consider just one data element so we'll

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.490 
consider just one data element so we'll
have<00:02:25.230> six<00:02:25.500> data<00:02:25.739> elements<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.930> an<00:02:28.050> EQ

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
have six data elements so we have an EQ

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.940 
have six data elements so we have an EQ
with<00:02:29.250> six<00:02:29.489> data<00:02:29.700> elements<00:02:30.180> one<00:02:30.840> FTR<00:02:31.290> it's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
with six data elements one FTR it's

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.710 
with six data elements one FTR it's
rated<00:02:32.340> as<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.489> low<00:02:32.730> with<00:02:33.180> three<00:02:33.360> function

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
rated as a low with three function

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.540 
rated as a low with three function
points<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:35.760> internal<00:02:36.060> logical<00:02:36.420> file<00:02:36.660> has<00:02:37.550> one

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
points the internal logical file has one

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.610 
points the internal logical file has one
a<00:02:38.790> data<00:02:39.090> element<00:02:39.239> for<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.630> city<00:02:39.840> another<00:02:40.470> one

so<00:02:45.330> we<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.750> internal<00:02:46.019> logical<00:02:46.440> file

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
so we have one internal logical file

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.000 
so we have one internal logical file
rated<00:02:48.690> as<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> low<00:02:49.140> with<00:02:49.349> seven<00:02:49.680> function

rated as a low with seven function
points<00:02:50.540> again<00:02:51.540> there's<00:02:52.170> five<00:02:52.410> data<00:02:52.650> elements

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
points again there's five data elements

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.740 
points again there's five data elements
and<00:02:53.190> one<00:02:53.519> record<00:02:53.910> type<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.329> if<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.480> look<00:02:54.630> at

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
and one record type so if we look at

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.690 
and one record type so if we look at
your<00:02:55.200> reference<00:02:55.920> card<00:02:56.310> hopefully<00:02:56.640> you
