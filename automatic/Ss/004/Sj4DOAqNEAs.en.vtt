00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 we changed everything we changed the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.090
 platform that is new the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.410
 motorizations essentially the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.290
 gasoline engines are absolutely 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.910
 new with engines with the 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.040
 turbocharger the whole range and 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.830
 turbocharged now but before 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.990
 everything is a design it's a presence 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.320
 it's a crossover qashqai it's the icon 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
 crossover so we will continue to 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.739
 to advance to be a pioneer in the segment 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.739
 with this new qashqai 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.790
 obviously its design but we brought 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.370
 also I will have a lot of refinement 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.370
 a lot of quality in materials 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.650
 in execution in use the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.930
 all that is the daily life of 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.620
 users in terms of holding noise 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.170
 road safety also has 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 a lot of technology on this new 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.339
 qashqai with what is called his sons 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.590
 the security shield so who is going 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.869
 allow users to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.930
 drivers to be better surround better 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.970
 protected with systems that are going 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.290
 to avoid accidents 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.720
 the car will brake when it leaves 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.110
 anticipated an obstacle for example 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.480
 our engine evolved to do 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.240
 quote that a manage our our engine 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 diesel 1 liter 5 which is the spearhead 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.510
 the one we sell the most will give us 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.510
 one of the 99 g emissions with with 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.550
 meaning we start with co2 levels 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.010
 of the order of 115 grams for the 1 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.530
 liter 2 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.250
 diesel versions will be available 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.290
 from launch 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.820
 so the 1 liter 5 the18 6 dci that has 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.560
 respectively develops 110 horses 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.140
 and 130 horses 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.240
 on the species side we have a whole 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.370
 new engine 1 league 2 turbocharged 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.680
 who will do 115 horses that is going to be 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.940
 also available at launch is a 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.260
 little bit later in the months to 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.140
 come we will have a new engine 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.320
 petrol 1 liter 6 turbo compressed 150 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.320
 horses 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.870
 we are below 4 liters in diesel 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.620
 and around 4 liters with the essences 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.620
 at the entry level 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.290
 it is produced in our name our 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.230
 factory spearhead sunderland in 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.270
 England so where she already produced 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.070
 the current qashqai and it's a factory 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.210
 extremely effective which has produced more 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.210
 500 thousand vehicles last year 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.420
 we realized at the time of 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 qashqai development and order 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.470
 during the life of qashqai 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.530
 current that a large part of the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.730
 qashqai customers +2 buy buy the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.989
 cars not for the seven seats 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.090
 but to have a bigger chest 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.220
 so we increased the size of the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.349
 chest of the new qashqai and we are going 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.480
 book the 7-seater version at the new 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.660
 extracted to really make it a 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.660
 family suv vehicles if you want 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.140
 plan to launch on the new 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.150
 qashqai an automatic box on the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.120
 diesel version which is our new 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.620
 xtronic box that is based in terms of 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.000
 technology on the cvt that you 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.960
 know but who is totally 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.750
 unrecognizable 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.710
 so really impressive and a whole 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.630
 little bit later we launch 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.180
 also an automatic box version 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.180
 so xtronic on on a gasoline engine
