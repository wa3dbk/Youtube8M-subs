00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
that sets it on the top it's going to be

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:54.050 
that sets it on the top it's going to be
easiest<00:02:50.180> pull<00:02:51.180> your<00:02:51.330> spring<00:02:51.720> over<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:53.060> put

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
easiest pull your spring over it put

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:14.520 
easiest pull your spring over it put
your<00:02:54.180> big<00:02:54.390> spring<00:02:54.750> on

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and on your a valve there's that hole

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.410 
and on your a valve there's that hole
right<00:03:59.579> there<00:03:59.639> as<00:03:59.969> well<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.329> need<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:01.769> line<00:04:02.010> up
