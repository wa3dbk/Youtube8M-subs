what James said is like I believe him i

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.990 
what James said is like I believe him i
don't<00:03:55.500> think<00:03:55.620> he's<00:03:55.709> lying<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> Marvel

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
don't think he's lying that the Marvel

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.970 
don't think he's lying that the Marvel
is<00:03:57.060> not<00:03:57.180> going<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.360> be<00:03:57.480> there<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:57.930> force<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:58.950> I

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
is not going to be there in force but I

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.160 
is not going to be there in force but I
think<00:03:59.250> there<00:03:59.459> will<00:03:59.640> be<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.850> panel<00:04:00.840> with<00:04:00.900> Paul

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
think there will be a panel with Paul

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.720 
think there will be a panel with Paul
Rudd<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.709> think<00:04:02.100> there'll<00:04:02.250> be<00:04:02.280> an<00:04:02.430> ant-man

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
Rudd I think there'll be an ant-man

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.910 
Rudd I think there'll be an ant-man
panel<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.540> might<00:04:03.780> not<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:03.989> be<00:04:04.200> like<00:04:04.410> Marvel

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
panel it might not just be like Marvel

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.009 
panel it might not just be like Marvel
like<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.790> know<00:04:05.940> showing<00:04:06.360> off<00:04:06.600> all<00:04:06.780> their

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
like you know showing off all their

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.270 
like you know showing off all their
stuff<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.500> think<00:04:07.680> there'll<00:04:07.860> be<00:04:07.890> an<00:04:08.040> ant-man

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
stuff I think there'll be an ant-man

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.890 
stuff I think there'll be an ant-man
panel<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.820> doesn't<00:04:09.120> mean<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.420> you

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
panel and that doesn't mean that you

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.900 
panel and that doesn't mean that you
know<00:04:10.049> Marvel<00:04:10.830> isn't<00:04:10.980> there<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.489> just<00:04:11.640> means

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
know Marvel isn't there that just means

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.150 
know Marvel isn't there that just means
that<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.510> ant-man<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.870> there<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.380> mean<00:04:13.620> and

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
that the ant-man is there I mean and

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.860 
that the ant-man is there I mean and
