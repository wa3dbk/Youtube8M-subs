rudenko is already

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.979 
rudenko is already
I<00:04:07.640> mean<00:04:07.910> rudenko<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.540> not<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.810> most

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
I mean rudenko is not the most

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.690 
I mean rudenko is not the most
experienced<00:04:09.680> heavyweight<00:04:10.070> around<00:04:10.400> but<00:04:10.580> he's

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
experienced heavyweight around but he's

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.690

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.630 
forced a bit of a rethink about his
career<00:06:04.900> that's<00:06:05.900> right<00:06:06.200> and<00:06:06.470> Rustom<00:06:07.220> of<00:06:07.340> trying

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
career that's right and Rustom of trying

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.029 
career that's right and Rustom of trying
to<00:06:07.789> come<00:06:08.030> forward<00:06:08.270> trying<00:06:08.690> to<00:06:08.810> find<00:06:09.710> something

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
to come forward trying to find something

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.719 
to come forward trying to find something
but<00:06:11.590> mostly<00:06:12.590> this<00:06:12.800> round<00:06:13.070> it's<00:06:13.250> a<00:06:13.310> question<00:06:13.640> of

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
but mostly this round it's a question of

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.840 
but mostly this round it's a question of
surviving<00:06:14.330> if<00:06:14.450> he<00:06:14.539> can<00:06:14.840> oops<00:06:15.580> around<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.700> back

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
surviving if he can oops around the back

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.629 
surviving if he can oops around the back
of<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.060> head<00:06:17.300> referee<00:06:17.990> didn't<00:06:18.440> mind<00:06:18.710> nor<00:06:19.520> did

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
of the head referee didn't mind nor did
