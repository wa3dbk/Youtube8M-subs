antenna<00:01:24.640> now<00:01:24.940> this<00:01:25.870> is<00:01:26.080> where<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:26.710> gets<00:01:27.010> tricky

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
antenna now this is where it gets tricky

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.080 
antenna now this is where it gets tricky
because<00:01:27.670> now<00:01:28.600> we're<00:01:28.750> gonna<00:01:28.870> do<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.380> pinch<00:01:29.710> twist

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
because now we're gonna do a pinch twist

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.780 
because now we're gonna do a pinch twist
without<00:01:31.090> popping<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.050> balloon<00:01:32.670> some<00:01:33.670> of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
without popping the balloon some of

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.160 
without popping the balloon some of
those<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.240> who<00:01:34.390> are<00:01:34.510> doing<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:34.840> for<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
be springing a leak but but enough

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.530 
be springing a leak but but enough
practice<00:01:44.130> you'll<00:01:45.130> be<00:01:45.340> able<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.550> do<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.910> and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
practice you'll be able to do that and

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.040 
practice you'll be able to do that and
then<00:01:47.490> let's<00:01:48.490> take<00:01:48.640> our<00:01:48.820> scissors<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.210> make

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
then let's take our scissors and make

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.770 
then let's take our scissors and make
the<00:01:50.290> antennas<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.520> same<00:01:51.760> length<00:01:52.000> that<00:01:52.240> is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
the antennas the same length that is

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.500 
the antennas the same length that is
going<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.080> be<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.320> antenna<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.979> butterfly

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
going to be the antenna to the butterfly

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.750 
going to be the antenna to the butterfly
we're<00:01:55.510> done<00:01:55.630> with<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:55.900> for<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.260> now<00:01:56.760> take

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
we're done with this for right now take

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760 
we're done with this for right now take
our<00:01:57.910> other<00:01:58.090> balloon

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
our other balloon

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.800 
our other balloon
this<00:02:00.340> pink<00:02:00.609> one<00:02:00.670> we're<00:02:00.909> gonna<00:02:01.060> blow<00:02:01.299> up<00:02:01.420> two

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
this pink one we're gonna blow up two

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.469 
this pink one we're gonna blow up two
thirds<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.289> way<00:02:05.969> gonna<00:02:06.969> let<00:02:07.149> some<00:02:07.299> air<00:02:07.420> out

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
thirds of the way gonna let some air out

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.220 
thirds of the way gonna let some air out
we're<00:02:08.289> gonna<00:02:08.470> twist<00:02:09.060> tie<00:02:10.060> into<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.539> knot<00:02:10.569> and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
we're gonna twist tie into a knot and

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.589 
we're gonna twist tie into a knot and
there<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.560> go<00:02:11.709> now<00:02:14.160> we're<00:02:15.160> gonna<00:02:15.280> squeeze<00:02:15.640> this

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
there we go now we're gonna squeeze this

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:27.360 
there we go now we're gonna squeeze this
bubble<00:02:19.440> make<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.590> extremely<00:02:21.160> soft<00:02:25.170> then<00:02:26.370> we're

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
bubble make it extremely soft then we're

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.360 
bubble make it extremely soft then we're
going<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.670> wrap<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:29.110> between<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.129> two

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
going to wrap it in between the two

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.360 
going to wrap it in between the two
pieces<00:02:31.079> looks<00:02:32.079> like<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:35.160> we're<00:02:36.160> going

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
pieces looks like that and we're going

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.479 
pieces looks like that and we're going
to<00:02:36.430> squeeze<00:02:36.790> again<00:02:37.860> try<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:38.890> make<00:02:39.069> them<00:02:39.340> the

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
to squeeze again try and make them the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:48.530 
to squeeze again try and make them the
same<00:02:39.670> size

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.030 

and<00:02:49.540> there<00:02:49.750> we<00:02:49.840> go<00:02:49.870> those<00:02:50.410> what<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:50.710> have<00:02:50.860> so

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
and there we go those what we have so

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.150 
and there we go those what we have so
far<00:02:51.120> now<00:02:52.120> we're<00:02:52.270> gonna<00:02:52.360> make<00:02:52.710> two<00:02:53.710> smaller

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
far now we're gonna make two smaller

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.210 
far now we're gonna make two smaller
bubbles<00:02:56.880> make<00:02:57.880> sure<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.480> squeeze<00:02:59.260> these

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
bubbles make sure that you squeeze these
