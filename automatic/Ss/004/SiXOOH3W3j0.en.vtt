until you CTAs travel pack and I've just
ruined<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:57.750> top<00:00:58.379> varnish<00:00:59.010> never<00:00:59.820> mind

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.200 

if<00:01:04.030> we<00:01:04.210> didn't<00:01:04.540> let<00:01:04.660> it<00:01:04.720> dry<00:01:05.019> properly<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.880> here

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
if we didn't let it dry properly so here

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.440

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
worse as you can to longer the word the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.690 
worse as you can to longer the word the
higher<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.510> score<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:29.410> number<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.430> players

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
higher the score and number of players

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.010 
higher the score and number of players
is<00:01:31.090> two<00:01:31.600> or<00:01:31.960> more<00:01:32.290> so<00:01:33.100> way<00:01:33.580> here<00:01:34.510> we<00:01:34.630> have<00:01:34.810> our

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
is two or more so way here we have our

00:01:35.020 --> 00:02:01.770 
is two or more so way here we have our
letters<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.250> that's<00:02:00.369> good<00:02:00.640> fun<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.270> I

guess<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.410> tying<00:02:02.710> yourself<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.430> we'll<00:02:03.610> have

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
guess you tying yourself that we'll have

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.139 
guess you tying yourself that we'll have
a<00:02:04.509> look<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:06.369> what<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.580> says<00:02:06.789> on<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.030> other

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
a look and see what it says on the other

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.580 
a look and see what it says on the other
side<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.689> instructions<00:02:08.260> I'm<00:02:08.380> just

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
side of the instructions I'm just

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.190 
side of the instructions I'm just
curious<00:02:08.799> to<00:02:09.190> see<00:02:09.220> are<00:02:09.580> those<00:02:09.940> more<00:02:10.269> letters<00:02:10.630> on

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
curious to see are those more letters on

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.240 
curious to see are those more letters on
the<00:02:11.410> other<00:02:11.560> side<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.760> let's<00:02:13.239> read<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.830> rest<00:02:14.860> of

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the other side so let's read the rest of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.580 
the other side so let's read the rest of
the<00:02:15.400> instruction<00:02:16.060> sets<00:02:16.440> shuffle<00:02:17.440> their

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the instruction sets shuffle their

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.130 
the instruction sets shuffle their
letter<00:02:17.830> strip<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.519> then<00:02:18.790> pick<00:02:19.299> four<00:02:19.660> strips

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
letter strip and then pick four strips

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.979 
letter strip and then pick four strips
and<00:02:20.440> random<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.340> line<00:02:21.940> them<00:02:22.150> up<00:02:22.269> on<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.570> table

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
and random and line them up on the table

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.410 
and random and line them up on the table
so<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.230> you're<00:02:23.560> you've<00:02:24.549> got<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.820> four<00:02:25.180> by<00:02:25.390> four

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
so that you're you've got a four by four

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.890 
so that you're you've got a four by four
grid<00:02:25.900> grab<00:02:26.650> some<00:02:27.010> pencils<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.730> write<00:02:27.940> down<00:02:28.239> as

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
grid grab some pencils and write down as

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.220 
grid grab some pencils and write down as
many<00:02:29.170> words<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.709> can<00:02:30.269> as<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.299> can<00:02:31.600> find<00:02:31.900> on

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
many words as you can as you can find on

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.190 
many words as you can as you can find on
a<00:02:32.290> piece<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.769> paper<00:02:32.920> each<00:02:33.850> letter<00:02:34.239> must<00:02:34.959> be

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
a piece of paper each letter must be

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.110 
a piece of paper each letter must be
connected<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:36.370> some<00:02:36.790> way<00:02:38.579> so<00:02:39.579> that<00:02:39.730> sounds

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
connected in some way so that sounds

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.410 
connected in some way so that sounds
good

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
good

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.330 
good
when<00:02:40.840> you're<00:02:40.989> all<00:02:41.140> done<00:02:41.350> add<00:02:41.650> up<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.010> score

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
when you're all done add up the score

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.330 
when you're all done add up the score
for<00:02:42.880> each<00:02:42.940> player<00:02:43.420> one<00:02:44.170> point<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.680> given<00:02:44.950> for

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
for each player one point is given for

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.630 
for each player one point is given for
each<00:02:45.549> letter<00:02:45.970> used<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.230> word<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.610> for

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
each letter used in the word so for

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.110 
each letter used in the word so for
example<00:02:49.360> Q<00:02:49.660> u<00:02:49.959> counts<00:02:50.470> us<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.730> play<00:02:51.940> with

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
example Q u counts us to the play with

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.720 
example Q u counts us to the play with
the<00:02:52.209> highest<00:02:52.450> score<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.650> winner<00:02:53.730> so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
the highest score is the winner so

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.850 
the highest score is the winner so
