00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.069 
thinking about leaving Dortmund it looks
like<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> probably<00:01:33.240> will<00:01:33.390> happen<00:01:33.600> will<00:01:33.990> he

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
like it probably will happen will he

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.300 
like it probably will happen will he
come<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> us<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> question<00:01:35.220> obviously

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
come to us is the question obviously

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.770 
come to us is the question obviously
that<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.030> want<00:01:36.240> answered

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that we want answered

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.880 
that we want answered
quite<00:01:37.290> possibly<00:01:38.130> however<00:01:39.110> round<00:01:40.110> Madrid<00:01:40.500> have

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
quite possibly however round Madrid have

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.580 
quite possibly however round Madrid have
first<00:01:41.340> refusal<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> player<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.840> part<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
first refusal on the player as part of a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
for Nuri Sahin between the clubs and so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.190 
for Nuri Sahin between the clubs and so
unfortunately<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.450> first<00:01:51.689> chance<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
unfortunately they have first chance and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.749 
unfortunately they have first chance and
the<00:01:52.320> other<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:52.979> thing<00:01:53.280> about<00:01:53.310> guns

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the other the other thing about guns

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.740 
the other the other thing about guns
again<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.180> he<00:01:54.299> hasn't<00:01:54.420> played<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
again is that he hasn't played the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240 
again is that he hasn't played the
season<00:01:55.140> he's<00:01:55.229> picked<00:01:55.409> three<00:01:55.680> games<00:01:55.950> because

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
season he's picked three games because

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
season he's picked three games because
he<00:01:56.340> has<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> serious<00:01:56.850> back<00:01:57.149> injury<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:58.110> not

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.280 
he has a serious back injury that's not
ideal<00:01:58.590> obviously<00:01:59.570> but<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.750> don't<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.049> guns

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
the more accurate doesn't appear does it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.450 
the more accurate doesn't appear does it
so<00:03:00.990> we<00:03:01.320> would<00:03:01.470> love<00:03:01.650> Tony<00:03:01.950> Cruz<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.250> mean<00:03:02.370> he's

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
been compared to push goals but he's the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.990 
been compared to push goals but he's the
best<00:03:04.770> thing<00:03:05.010> anybody<00:03:05.220> could<00:03:05.460> tear<00:03:05.640> about<00:03:05.790> any

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
best thing anybody could tear about any

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.190 
best thing anybody could tear about any
human<00:03:06.480> on<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> planet

human on the planet
it's<00:03:07.710> obviously<00:03:07.980> not<00:03:08.070> as<00:03:08.130> good<00:03:08.160> as<00:03:08.310> Porsche

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
it's obviously not as good as Porsche

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.580 
it's obviously not as good as Porsche
goals<00:03:08.700> nobody<00:03:09.060> ever<00:03:09.180> will<00:03:09.360> be<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.410> that's
