video is going to be about couple speed
tests<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.240> i<00:00:27.570> used<00:00:28.080> fairly<00:00:28.710> light<00:00:29.130> programs

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
tests so i used fairly light programs

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
probably say the heaviest program that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720 
probably say the heaviest program that
i'm<00:00:41.489> using<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:42.059> iMovie<00:00:43.280> don't<00:00:44.280> use<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> quite

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
i'm using is iMovie don't use it quite

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.760 
i'm using is iMovie don't use it quite
up<00:00:44.940> too<00:00:45.719> often<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:47.180> anyway<00:00:48.590> I'm<00:00:49.590> going

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
up too often but some anyway I'm going

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
up too often but some anyway I'm going
to<00:00:49.829> launch<00:00:50.100> each<00:00:50.460> individually<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.360> I'm

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to launch each individually and I'm

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.049 
to launch each individually and I'm
going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.379> launch<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:53.340> after<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.879> quit

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
going to launch them all after I quit

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.049 
going to launch them all after I quit
them<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.780> once<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.340> how<00:00:56.579> fast

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
them at once and we can see how fast

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.099 
them at once and we can see how fast
these<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.719> let's<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:59.070> start<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.609> iMovie

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
these are so let's go start with iMovie

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.700 
these are so let's go start with iMovie
okay<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:02.300> three<00:01:03.300> four<00:01:04.290> five<00:01:05.299> six

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
okay so one two three four five six

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
okay so one two three four five six
seven<00:01:07.710> eight<00:01:10.280> whatever<00:01:11.280> later<00:01:11.720> okay<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
seven eight whatever later okay so that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.289 
seven eight whatever later okay so that
anyway<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> took<00:01:14.159> about<00:01:14.250> seven<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.180> eight

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
anyway that took about seven or eight

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.890 
anyway that took about seven or eight
seconds<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.470> load<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.979> completely<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
seconds to load up completely and I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.840 
seconds to load up completely and I
don't<00:01:19.049> use<00:01:19.229> iMovie<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> often<00:01:20.220> i<00:01:20.340> clear<00:01:20.820> my

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
don't use iMovie that often i clear my

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
don't use iMovie that often i clear my
cache<00:01:21.210> fairly<00:01:21.720> often<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.229> i<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.650> if

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
cache fairly often so i don't know if

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.530 
cache fairly often so i don't know if
this<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:23.009> cached<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.170> anyway<00:01:26.540> so

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
this was cached or not but anyway so

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.830 
this was cached or not but anyway so
eight<00:01:28.200> seconds<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.390> movie<00:01:30.720> was

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
eight seconds for that so I movie was

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
eight seconds for that so I movie was
fairly<00:01:31.079> quick<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.680> try<00:01:31.829> i<00:01:31.890> fold<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> noun<00:01:32.460> 1<00:01:32.790> 2<00:01:33.630> 3

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
fairly quick and try i fold a noun 1 2 3

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.090 
fairly quick and try i fold a noun 1 2 3
4<00:01:35.840> okay<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:36.900> about<00:01:37.680> four<00:01:38.100> seconds<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.670> iphoto

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
4 okay so about four seconds for iphoto

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.590 
4 okay so about four seconds for iphoto
let's<00:01:41.100> try<00:01:41.310> word<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.630> two<00:01:43.560> three<00:01:44.600> four

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
let's try word now one two three four

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.960 
let's try word now one two three four
five<00:01:46.729> six<00:01:47.899> seven<00:01:48.899> okay<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> go

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
five six seven okay and there you go

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.530 
five six seven okay and there you go
seven<00:01:51.509> seconds<00:01:51.899> forward<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.890> imagine<00:01:53.159> that

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
seven seconds forward and I imagine that

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.899 
seven seconds forward and I imagine that
Excel<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.869> PowerPoint<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.700> about

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
Excel and PowerPoint would be all about

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.520 
Excel and PowerPoint would be all about
the<00:01:57.149> same<00:01:59.540> man<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:00.659> brother<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:01.140> came<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the same man my brother just came in the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.200 
the same man my brother just came in the
room<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:03.049> but<00:02:04.049> anyway<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.159> those<00:02:05.340> entourage

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
room here but anyway so those entourage

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.880 
room here but anyway so those entourage
PowerPoint<00:02:06.780> Excel<00:02:06.899> would<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.560> about<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
PowerPoint Excel would all be about the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.880 
PowerPoint Excel would all be about the
same<00:02:08.270> now<00:02:09.270> itunes<00:02:09.629> i<00:02:10.110> really<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.470> itunes

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
same now itunes i really like itunes

same now itunes i really like itunes
we're<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> try<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.520> one<00:02:11.910> two<00:02:12.480> three

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
we're going to try that one two three

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.750 
we're going to try that one two three
four<00:02:14.360> five<00:02:15.379> six<00:02:16.379> seven<00:02:17.930> okay<00:02:19.040> anyway<00:02:20.040> that's

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
four five six seven okay anyway that's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.729 
four five six seven okay anyway that's
my<00:02:20.910> brother's<00:02:21.360> he<00:02:21.810> sort<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.410> late<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.709> that

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
my brother's he sort of late so that

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.119 
my brother's he sort of late so that
stuff<00:02:26.510> anyway<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:28.110> think<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.830> was<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> little

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
stuff anyway I think that was a little

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.360 
stuff anyway I think that was a little
slower<00:02:29.550> than<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.819> usually<00:02:30.060> loads<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.370> mmm

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
slower than it usually loads up but mmm

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.759 
slower than it usually loads up but mmm
hey<00:02:32.970> I'd<00:02:33.120> say<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.510> itunes<00:02:34.050> usually<00:02:34.410> loads<00:02:34.620> up
