and<00:00:00.240> we're<00:00:00.870> back<00:00:00.989> with<00:00:01.050> more<00:00:01.589> warzone<00:00:02.040> 2100

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:02.990 
and we're back with more warzone 2100

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.320 
and we're back with more warzone 2100
this<00:00:03.990> time<00:00:04.670> the<00:00:05.670> Finnish<00:00:06.120> Finnish<00:00:07.080> Minh<00:00:07.470> yes

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
this time the Finnish Finnish Minh yes

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:16.160 
this time the Finnish Finnish Minh yes
finishing<00:00:09.330> up<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.719> mission<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:15.080> don't<00:00:16.080> shoot

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
finishing up this mission so don't shoot

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.820 
finishing up this mission so don't shoot
that<00:00:16.560> thing<00:00:16.740> else<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.750> wanted<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> stand<00:00:19.350> in

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that thing else I wanted to stand in

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.560 
that thing else I wanted to stand in
there<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:21.119> now<00:00:22.460> because<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.850> guess<00:00:24.210> there<00:00:24.449> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
there for now because I guess there is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.500 
there for now because I guess there is
another<00:00:24.810> Lancer<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:26.010> side<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
another Lancer on this side here this

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.120 
another Lancer on this side here this
corner<00:00:29.420> but<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:31.019> want<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.619> keep<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.430> alive

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
corner but I just want to keep it alive

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.060 
corner but I just want to keep it alive
so<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> mission<00:00:35.550> does<00:00:35.790> not<00:00:36.030> end<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.600> edge

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
so the mission does not end the edge

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.350 
so the mission does not end the edge
besides<00:00:38.070> I'm<00:00:38.250> pretty<00:00:38.579> sure<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.239> are<00:00:39.329> some

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
besides I'm pretty sure there are some

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
besides I'm pretty sure there are some
artifacts<00:00:40.110> out<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.460> i<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.670> want<00:00:42.000> them

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
artifacts out there and i do want them

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.209 
artifacts out there and i do want them
to<00:00:42.420> repeat<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> research<00:00:43.200> before<00:00:43.710> continue

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
to repeat the research before continue

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.060 
to repeat the research before continue
on<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.309> is

rest is now being taken care of by these

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.840 
rest is now being taken care of by these

help you okay now let's move here it's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.469 
help you okay now let's move here it's
probably<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.080> Lancer<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.650> right

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
probably going to be a Lancer here right

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:18.950 
probably going to be a Lancer here right
no<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:14.869> surprised<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:17.960> let's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
no and I would be surprised if not let's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.030 
no and I would be surprised if not let's
slowly<00:01:19.290> move<00:01:19.619> forward<00:01:21.320> has<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> lance

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
slowly move forward has to be a lance

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.420 
slowly move forward has to be a lance
around<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.909> can't<00:01:25.040> think<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.220> they

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
around here I can't think that they

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.459 
around here I can't think that they
might<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.939> place<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.540> here

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.730 

hmm<00:01:34.469> I<00:01:35.180> would<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.329> very<00:01:36.360> surprised<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.680> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
hmm I would be very surprised if that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.660 
hmm I would be very surprised if that
wasn't<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> case<00:01:38.899> honestly<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.490> will

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
wasn't the case honestly but we will

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.169 
wasn't the case honestly but we will
probably<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.420> second<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:49.130> nothing<00:01:50.179> ok

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
probably see in a second and nothing ok

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.469 
probably see in a second and nothing ok
I'm<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> save<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:53.000> out<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.149> curiosity

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
I'm going to save here out of curiosity

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.569 
I'm going to save here out of curiosity
i'm<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> view<00:01:55.679> if<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.310> something

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
i'm going to view if there is something

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.709 
i'm going to view if there is something
around<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.090> corner<00:01:58.909> bar<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.179> scanning<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
around this corner bar the scanning of

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:11.390 
around this corner bar the scanning of
course<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:07.590> doesn't<00:02:08.190> seem<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.880> sh<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:11.280> is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
course it doesn't seem like a sh that is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
course it doesn't seem like a sh that is
awesome<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:12.599> let's<00:02:12.930> move<00:02:13.140> our

okay move down here and we get the heavy
body<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.060> new<00:02:33.180> paradigm<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.900> Mantis

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
body of the new paradigm the Mantis

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.120 
body of the new paradigm the Mantis
construction<00:02:35.910> completed<00:02:37.519> okay<00:02:39.200> now<00:02:40.200> will<00:02:41.069> you

get healed up you will healed up and new

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.809 
get healed up you will healed up and new
units<00:02:45.810> are<00:02:45.959> going<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.230> move<00:02:46.500> here<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.609> get

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
units are going to move here and you get

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.759 
units are going to move here and you get
real<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.450> someone's<00:02:49.440> damaged<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.850> Mantis

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
real if someone's damaged the Mantis

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.410 
real if someone's damaged the Mantis
definitely<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.100> best<00:02:56.370> heavy<00:02:56.730> body<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.269> we

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
definitely the best heavy body that we

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.140 
definitely the best heavy body that we
can<00:02:57.600> get<00:02:57.840> up<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.319> point<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:59.280> has<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.730> few

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
can get up to this point it has a few

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.379 
can get up to this point it has a few
less<00:03:00.480> hit<00:03:00.720> points<00:03:01.079> than<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.260> python<00:03:01.799> but<00:03:02.790> for

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
less hit points than the python but for

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.349 
less hit points than the python but for
moving<00:03:03.870> speed<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.549> best<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.180> get

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
moving speed it's the best you can get

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.220 
moving speed it's the best you can get
up<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.840> point<00:03:07.109> just<00:03:07.859> me<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.540> I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
up to this point just me it is and I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:18.500 
up to this point just me it is and I
want<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.769> body

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
but once i have the mentals i might

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:53.559 
but once i have the mentals i might
actually<00:04:30.890> do<00:04:31.370> this<00:04:31.520> differently

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.730 

major<00:04:54.020> research<00:04:55.839> so<00:04:57.129> let's<00:04:58.129> see<00:04:58.399> what<00:04:58.429> changes

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
major research so let's see what changes

for this part of the game this is
awesome<00:06:46.810> i<00:06:47.280> think<00:06:48.280> when<00:06:48.430> i<00:06:48.460> first<00:06:49.000> played<00:06:49.240> this

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
to get the kills from the fences and

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.450 
to get the kills from the fences and
from<00:06:56.860> the<00:06:57.010> walls<00:06:57.300> and<00:06:58.680> then<00:06:59.680> it<00:06:59.800> got<00:06:59.919> killed<00:07:00.280> I

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
from the walls and then it got killed I

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.300 
from the walls and then it got killed I
thing<00:07:00.700> in<00:07:01.050> about<00:07:02.050> two<00:07:02.350> third<00:07:02.680> of<00:07:02.830> the<00:07:02.950> campaign

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
thing in about two third of the campaign

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.900 
thing in about two third of the campaign
through<00:07:03.669> that<00:07:04.450> was<00:07:04.570> so<00:07:04.780> painful<00:07:05.760> but<00:07:06.760> that

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
through that was so painful but that

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.159 
through that was so painful but that
won't<00:07:07.090> happen<00:07:07.270> again<00:07:08.669> so<00:07:09.669> I'm<00:07:10.630> going<00:07:10.690> to<00:07:10.900> save

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:11.169 
won't happen again so I'm going to save

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:17.750 
won't happen again so I'm going to save
here<00:07:12.660> I<00:07:13.660> think<00:07:14.080> it<00:07:14.169> should<00:07:14.320> be<00:07:14.350> 52<00:07:15.040> then<00:07:15.660> and

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760 
here I think it should be 52 then and

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.620 
here I think it should be 52 then and
let's<00:07:18.760> destroy<00:07:19.270> this<00:07:19.419> last<00:07:19.660> hour<00:07:20.430> and<00:07:21.630> then

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:22.630 
let's destroy this last hour and then

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:33.120 
let's destroy this last hour and then
your<00:07:22.750> paradigm<00:07:23.229> is<00:07:23.850> history<00:07:31.860> objective<00:07:32.860> yes

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
your paradigm is history objective yes

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:40.670 
your paradigm is history objective yes
and<00:07:33.669> there<00:07:34.120> goes<00:07:34.330> to<00:07:34.479> new<00:07:34.600> paradigm

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.120 

however<00:07:41.669> i'm<00:07:42.539> going<00:07:42.960> to<00:07:43.110> cut<00:07:43.350> the<00:07:43.530> video<00:07:43.620> off
