pretty<00:01:36.329> obvious<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.560> increased<00:01:38.009> melee

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
pretty obvious you have increased melee

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.499 
pretty obvious you have increased melee
attack<00:01:38.520> speed<00:01:38.759> means<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.420> an

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
attack speed means you got to be an

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.929 
attack speed means you got to be an
hugging<00:01:39.689> range<00:01:40.049> bro<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.670> double

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
hugging range bro you have the double

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.460 
hugging range bro you have the double
stacking<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> scorching<00:01:42.899> energy<00:01:43.200> drain

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
stacking to the scorching energy drain

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.160 
stacking to the scorching energy drain
close<00:01:44.280> quarters<00:01:44.759> bro<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.780> course<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
close quarters bro and of course the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
close quarters bro and of course the
special<00:01:46.590> weapon<00:01:46.950> reloaded<00:01:47.490> increase<00:01:47.759> that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
special weapon reloaded increase that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.590 
special weapon reloaded increase that
one<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:49.590> much<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.220> trumps<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
one pretty much just trumps for the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.359 
one pretty much just trumps for the
shotgun<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.140> fusion<00:01:52.439> rifle<00:01:52.740> thing<00:01:52.860> yes<00:01:53.100> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
shotgun in fusion rifle thing yes that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.859 
shotgun in fusion rifle thing yes that
one<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.729> actually<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.270> beneficial<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
one can actually be beneficial to

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.690 
one can actually be beneficial to
snipers<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.100> much<00:01:56.250> eliminates

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
snipers but that pretty much eliminates

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
snipers but that pretty much eliminates
the<00:01:56.790> other<00:01:56.939> two<00:01:57.060> melee<00:01:57.360> features<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.100> yeah

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the other two melee features so yeah

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530 
the other two melee features so yeah
these<00:01:59.490> things<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.939> meant<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.360> close

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
these things are meant for close

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.560 
these things are meant for close
quarters<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.530> eliminate<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.189> chalk<00:02:02.399> off<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
quarters you eliminate and chalk off the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.660 
quarters you eliminate and chalk off the
PvE<00:02:03.899> element<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.590> these<00:02:04.829> are<00:02:04.979> not<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.460> good

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
PvE element to these are not that good

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
PvE element to these are not that good
of<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.850> PVE<00:02:06.149> piece<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.079> reason<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
of a PVE piece now the reason for that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.219 
of a PVE piece now the reason for that
is<00:02:08.039> most<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> time<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.940> may<00:02:09.149> lay<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.539> PvE<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
is most the time we may lay in PvE is

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.260 
is most the time we may lay in PvE is
generally<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.649> grant<00:02:10.950> us<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.340> shield<00:02:11.700> I'd

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
generally to grant us that shield I'd

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.610 
generally to grant us that shield I'd
say<00:02:12.480> ipv

you're going to melee the shit out of
things<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.200> PvE<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.680> don't<00:02:25.830> care<00:02:26.040> too<00:02:26.220> much

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
things in PvE you don't care too much

there's<00:02:26.760> not<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:26.940> real<00:02:27.209> threat<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:27.989> these

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
there's not a real threat so these

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.930 
there's not a real threat so these

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
so with that these things really don't

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.699 
so with that these things really don't
have<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> function<00:02:57.540> or<00:02:57.660> purpose<00:02:57.840> with<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.530> void

have a function or purpose with the void
Walker<00:02:59.099> category<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.209> that's<00:03:00.359> because<00:03:00.930> it

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
Walker category and that's because it

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.720 
Walker category and that's because it
just<00:03:01.319> doesn't<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.890> good<00:03:02.159> ability<00:03:02.609> to

there was such potential there it just
the<00:03:23.910> abilities<00:03:24.389> are<00:03:24.569> lacking<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.319> melee

the abilities are lacking on the melee

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.119 
the abilities are lacking on the melee
for<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.880> energy<00:03:27.090> drain<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.780> that's<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.739> so

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
for the energy drain so that's that so

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.800 
for the energy drain so that's that so
again<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.459> feel<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.090> leaves<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.359> little<00:03:30.450> bit<00:03:30.690> to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
again I feel it leaves a little bit to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.930

and<00:04:41.129> was<00:04:41.520> able<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.849> do<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.030> solo<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.830> is

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
and was able to do it solo and that is

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.070 
and was able to do it solo and that is
because<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:44.580> armor<00:04:45.030> piece<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.449> incredible

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
because this armor piece is incredible

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.839 
because this armor piece is incredible
for<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.349> sun<00:04:46.530> singer<00:04:46.860> in<00:04:47.009> those<00:04:47.190> situations

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
for the sun singer in those situations

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.029 
for the sun singer in those situations
so<00:04:48.300> how<00:04:48.780> does<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:48.990> hold<00:04:49.259> up<00:04:49.379> to<00:04:49.530> other<00:04:49.740> ones

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
so how does this hold up to other ones

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.520 
so how does this hold up to other ones
does<00:04:50.490> this<00:04:50.669> Trump<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.120> praxic<00:04:51.539> fire<00:04:51.780> in<00:04:52.020> my

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
does this Trump the praxic fire in my

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.800 
does this Trump the praxic fire in my
opinion<00:04:52.889> hell<00:04:53.370> naw<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.940> praxic<00:04:54.389> is<00:04:54.509> probably

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
opinion hell naw the praxic is probably

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.570 
opinion hell naw the praxic is probably
the<00:04:54.960> best<00:04:55.139> song<00:04:55.379> singer<00:04:55.680> item<00:04:55.979> in<00:04:56.159> the<00:04:56.310> game

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
the best song singer item in the game

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.399 
the best song singer item in the game
and<00:04:56.789> it<00:04:57.270> does<00:04:57.479> almost<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.930> same<00:04:58.110> thing<00:04:58.319> the

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
and it does almost the same thing the

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.649 
and it does almost the same thing the
clause<00:04:58.650> does<00:04:58.889> it<00:04:59.099> regenerates<00:04:59.639> things<00:04:59.909> faster

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
clause does it regenerates things faster

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.629 
clause does it regenerates things faster
not<00:05:01.169> only<00:05:01.349> that<00:05:01.440> you<00:05:01.830> also<00:05:01.889> get<00:05:02.220> fusion

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
not only that you also get fusion

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.980 
not only that you also get fusion
grenades<00:05:02.909> with<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.240> so<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:03.539> only<00:05:03.690> major

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
grenades with it so the only major

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.480 
grenades with it so the only major
difference<00:05:04.139> between<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.069> praxic

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
difference between this and the praxic

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.219 
difference between this and the praxic
is<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.669> praxic<00:05:06.090> is<00:05:06.210> better<00:05:06.449> with<00:05:07.080> the

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
is the praxic is better with the

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.960 
is the praxic is better with the
grenades<00:05:07.590> but<00:05:07.979> it's<00:05:08.130> only<00:05:08.310> used<00:05:08.610> when<00:05:08.849> you

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
grenades but it's only used when you

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.219 
grenades but it's only used when you
super<00:05:09.330> you're<00:05:09.479> only<00:05:09.599> going<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:09.840> get<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:10.080> do

melees<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.530> entire<00:05:16.889> game<00:05:17.340> you<00:05:18.030> pick<00:05:18.240> and

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
melees the entire game you pick and

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.360 
melees the entire game you pick and
choose<00:05:18.539> which<00:05:18.719> one<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.110> want<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.380> use<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.830> guess

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
choose which one you want to use I guess

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.159 
choose which one you want to use I guess
it's<00:05:20.550> it's<00:05:20.699> only<00:05:20.940> real<00:05:21.150> function<00:05:21.690> but<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:21.900> feel

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
it's it's only real function but I feel

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.839 
it's it's only real function but I feel
that<00:05:22.349> the<00:05:22.440> praxic<00:05:22.889> is<00:05:23.009> a<00:05:23.130> much<00:05:23.340> better<00:05:23.370> choice

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
that the praxic is a much better choice

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.730 
that the praxic is a much better choice
simply<00:05:24.630> because<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:25.110> does<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.349> same<00:05:25.379> thing

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
simply because it does the same thing

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.110 
simply because it does the same thing
this<00:05:25.889> does<00:05:25.949> but<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:26.460> also<00:05:26.610> throws<00:05:26.969> the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
this does but it also throws the

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.909 
this does but it also throws the
grenades<00:05:27.449> in<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.690> mix<00:05:27.870> look<00:05:28.139> at<00:05:28.319> this<00:05:28.469> the

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
grenades in the mix look at this the

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.529 
grenades in the mix look at this the
tankiness<00:05:29.430> got<00:05:29.669> one<00:05:29.879> may<00:05:30.030> lay<00:05:30.210> out<00:05:30.360> is

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
tankiness got one may lay out is

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.969 
tankiness got one may lay out is
regenerating<00:05:31.229> the<00:05:31.259> other<00:05:31.530> ones<00:05:31.770> already

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
regenerating the other ones already

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.379 
regenerating the other ones already
starting<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.610> stack<00:05:32.819> it's<00:05:33.000> already<00:05:33.210> halfway

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
starting to stack it's already halfway

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.659 
starting to stack it's already halfway
done<00:05:33.719> when<00:05:33.930> I<00:05:33.960> use<00:05:34.139> that<00:05:34.169> one<00:05:34.530> sustaining<00:05:35.430> some

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
done when I use that one sustaining some

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.240 
done when I use that one sustaining some
more<00:05:35.969> and<00:05:36.240> it<00:05:36.840> does<00:05:37.050> have<00:05:37.319> its<00:05:37.530> purpose<00:05:37.919> again

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
more and it does have its purpose again

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.830 
more and it does have its purpose again
I<00:05:38.280> don't<00:05:38.430> think<00:05:38.789> it's<00:05:38.909> as<00:05:39.030> good<00:05:39.150> as<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.389> praxic

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
I don't think it's as good as the praxic

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.659 
I don't think it's as good as the praxic
but<00:05:40.229> it's<00:05:40.349> a<00:05:40.440> good<00:05:40.620> alternative<00:05:40.770> for<00:05:41.250> the<00:05:41.460> sun

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
but it's a good alternative for the sun

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.219 
but it's a good alternative for the sun
singer<00:05:41.969> if<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.210> have<00:05:42.330> yet<00:05:42.539> to<00:05:42.719> purchase<00:05:43.110> a

praxic<00:05:43.710> fire<00:05:43.979> so<00:05:44.580> with<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.120> they<00:05:45.840> only<00:05:45.990> have

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
praxic fire so with that they only have

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.050 
praxic fire so with that they only have
one<00:05:46.380> real<00:05:46.529> purpose<00:05:46.979> not<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.580> greatest<00:05:47.819> thing

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060
