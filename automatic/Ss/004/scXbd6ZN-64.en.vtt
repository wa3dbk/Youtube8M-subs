00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 Murder only two victories have so far this season and the premiere success in 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.780
 the regional league is back for a long time it was the 28th of August against 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.669
 Wiedenbrück 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.159
 a case to zero at that time 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:18.320
 Holsten lasted he is open more precisely 77 days to the second success on 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.769
 last weekend against Bielefeld if his goal is the end with the new one 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:24.589
 Trainer 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:25.730
 Kristian 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.080
 4 and of course everyone is hoping for now 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.140
 that's about as long as the next victory took so long but today 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.980
 a very difficult task Homburg was a guest in the fourth 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.400
 in Dortmund Norton 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.780
 instead of a 77 this time maybe only you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.569
 the days wait until the next win of the season the hope 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.609
 from around 30 traveled Homburger followers and this hope has 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.729
 even the new coach Christian Hock even if this as he was against to evaluate 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:54.190
 is 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.650
 Looking back at the Boll again, the quake-squad is in charge 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.690
 8 players are missing in the short term to have joined the sixteen field hospital 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.569
 himself painter load 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.530
 Muscle problems thighs 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.010
 and the flu-sick Sebastian 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.680
 accordingly sickly hesitant the Homburger opening Dortmund against it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.010
 at least in parts like 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.400
 the BVB in the app with the captain with Christian Eggert 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.710
 with Sandra Schneider bundesliga-profi today with the Saarbahn deployment 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.500
 with a fine double pass 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 none is 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.290
 and Benito Muller can not clear the sentence yet 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820
 that was her first contact with the crew of Theo Schneider 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.890
 with the Homburger penalty area 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.229
 18 The minute preparations for the PlayStation are under way 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.790
 Store shot at all these games went from sender Tamas Hajnal 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.980
 Dortmund in a low-opportunity initial phase with slight advantages 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.420
 the replacement-weakened eleven of Christian Hock still good we pay the PZ 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.799
 Dortmund against Homburg 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.799
 that saw in the first half predominantly Soros 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.710
 Fourth is on one side 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.460
 closely followed by a still unnecessary passport the others 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.549
 handsome this is definitely a joke no 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.379
 but then attention for the most exciting and 60 seconds one 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.969
 modest first half Dortmund finally on the direct way 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.749
 Therefore go alone against Thomas Wächter teaching the first 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.749
 the 0 2 0 but the scene intervened 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.650
 Dortmund in this phase with short but noticeable from the Bund German cyclists 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.089
 Savas Scheiner 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:45.979
 so the Dieter Langhart 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.259
 Marcel Kandziora 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.559
 Nazareth 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:53.249
 take our measure and Daniel Etter will be sorry 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.439
 31 minutes double chance BVB initiated by a failed 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.309
 Clarification attempt by Sebastian Sonnenberger 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:05.010
 then Richter initially prevented the first goal of the season from Donald in chic 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.389
 most successful scorer in the entire Regionalliga 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.529
 and then insulted the game in the header of Oliver Lück 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.510
 Knoll to 0 to break in the shadow of the big signal iduna parks better 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.840
 known place under the old name Westfalen Stadium 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.930
 second half and so much is promised it will be much livelier 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.969
 Daniel Wiencek 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.399
 is not going to give up so fast 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:34.999
 and Mr Nolte was Thomas Richter the FCH before the deficit 48 minutes Theo 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.349
 Tailors usually do not believe it 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.550
 His personal gracious torgarantie Dawn r Gain sends 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.340
 after the mistake of Martinz 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.010
 fails for the second time at the Homburger captain 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.189
 the ailing Str after snuffling on behalf of the thoroughly offensive 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.149
 involved 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:55.149
 Müller after a successful double pass with a successful template 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.539
 but I tell her 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:02.499
 just the ex-Dortmunder fails on his return to the Palomina 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.650
 Homburg in the break of Christian Hock apparently with the right medicine 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.329
 finally gets offensive with the organ seeking portion 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.349
 that's just 1 after her 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.539
 Hamburg defender Michael the week before against Bielefeld today just not 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.539
 only in which tens to meet 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.069
 Image again for the next scene Homburg the standard again Knaus see 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.300
 small oases 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.300
 Real Madrid is in Munster 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.730
 Last week still failed from the penalty spot today unsupervised by 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:41.940
 the Dortmund cover 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.940
 responsible for the Homburger added 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.340
 and the headache at the coach because of the modest starts disappearing 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.680
 even better his team worked in the preliminary decision 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.389
 Corner St Ledger 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.389
 Hackel Christopher Waltz 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.300
 1 0 for Homburg so ended the last meeting of the two before 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.650
 eleven years in the same place 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.530
 but still playing at the 20 minutes 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.289
 and Dortmund 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.229
 resists 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.889
 Mark 2 sees Herrmann 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.229
 with fine gravel tears dahlias Letter leak 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.229
 it was not easy 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.340
 but he should not have counted the goal because it will be with you 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.060
 Christopher Kullmann not only the forest but also 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.389
 the left foot of Tim Schwarz instead of the game and free kick for Holland 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.050
 becomes 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.050
 Dr compensation match for Borussia Dortmund 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.509
 OK 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.439
 but again Homburg once again explained 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.110
 Once again, she has always only as 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.889
 It remains at Buy one to one earned for FC Homburg after clearer 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.430
 Performance increase in the second half 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.990
 Yes 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.240
 but the second half 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.010
 was there was football-based weapons deployment conversion progress from the advances of 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.400
 our blows to our being 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.909
 first half at the less Klose gave the second half we already have 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.909
 some sections often had around midway through the post shot from those of 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:21.650
 Show also the players in Cologne 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.150
 Philipp did not miss the first away win of the season 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.370
 Homburg ddp despite staff shortage an important point in the fourth 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.139
 Dortmund 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.430
 is at least sporty again 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.169
 on the way to recovery 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.410
 the rhine-main-hallen point what the weather means weather he sings right away 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.370
 before all the results of the football regional league from this 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.740

 Lotter Wiedenbrück club to new Münster wins against Cologne 13 new 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:50.319

 at 13 o'clock in Kaiserslautern, however, it is subject only to 4 Schalke Bochum 2 to 

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:59.080

 Trier Mönchengladbach 1 to 2 and Boppard semi-final one to zero ready 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:15.550
 yesterday, the view already on the table front Münster now ten years ago
