 Today followed his wish consists of 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.750
 say four ingredients but the 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.720
 all fit together quite well yes 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.820
 wish is from comics and he wanted 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.430
 have something with cucumbers tomatoes onions 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.280
 and cake and yes I wanted one 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.260
 make greek salad and 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.920
 as a father, your popo 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.300
 use 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.790
 that's why they have ever 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.680
 inserted our glass are actually 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.409
 just like a laid sheep's cheese 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.870
 or peter has indeed could actually 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:47.350
 use for anything else possible or 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.809
 Just eat like that and that's why we do it 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.449
 it again together ok so first 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.460
 you need a glass also best one 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.640
 topical stuff fits the family 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.769
 200 came that fits then you need 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.430
 about two teaspoons coarse 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.199
 peppercorns a teaspoon of salt then 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.320
 I have dried two teaspoons here 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.580
 Rosemary and of course you can 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.170
 everything else on herbs use what 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.880
 you want fresh, for example 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.490
 fresh basil fresh 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.690
 bear leek or just simply fresh 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.180
 I have rosemary right now 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.600
 not to enter 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.890
 then you can now also these little ones 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.350
 use dried chili peppers or 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 The baptism just keeps a fresh money 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.170
 is about half use 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.950
 Just grab it in there as it is 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.940
 The forums are the back only small dice 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.390
 you can also do us if you want 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.050
 Put fresh garlic in the glass 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.590
 then needed a bit now 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.590
 Olive oil could only about one 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.760
 fill the third of the lawn and the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.610
 whole spices ever together 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.350
 mix and then you can just 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.880
 add euro 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.020
 yes , that is really one now 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.930
 a little too small then that makes 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.630
 nothing really ends when he does 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.110
 if that's the case then it falters 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.039
 any case not too full the po before 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.349
 because it should also take a bit of space 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.159
 you'll be around for a while 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.470
 to get up 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.900
 and also into tofu right away 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.620
 cover with oil and that should be on everyone 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.620
 case still be possible 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.520
 no party screw the lid on that 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.950
 Put the whole thing on its head and put it on 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.320
 shake it up a bit 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.980
 spices spread a bit so 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.040
 unfinished 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.330
 this must be at least two days or so 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.610
 Hold on longer 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.370
 I think my other tofu has 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.570
 had about five or six days and 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.220
 the glass in any case not in first 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.410
 the fridge for the olive oil would 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.580
 then get stuck then too 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.130
 worse to go through 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.280
 best for that nourishes a drive to 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.500
 example about the heater or special 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.160
 Either way so that now at 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.290
 Greek salad in itself for it 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.380
 I first have one or two bodies on 10 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.350
 depending on how I garlic here 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.459
 you want to have logo and you can now 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.540
 either rub or crush or 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.540
 cut small 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.190
 what you prefer is just fast 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.100
 small dice out of here then I have 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.680
 her one onion I have once 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:43.560
 led her again and then snowed 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:45.350
 such rough pieces of it if you 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.900
 no big pieces of chunks then like 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:53.400
 we can not do it either then 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.269
 one to two peppers hp2 right 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.660
 less because of that I will 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.459
 probably one and a half lives 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.459
 I cut that into little cubes 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:09.900
 There are two tomatoes left 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:14.870
 I'll just cut it in half and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.870
 to dice 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.260
 and then I have half another here 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.210
 Cucumber simply designed twice 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.760
 through the individual pieces still too 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.390
 twice through then quite simply the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.740
 throw but also here you can again 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.870
 actually in the case of herbs themselves 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.150
 decide what you take a bit 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.500
 fresh basil can also be there again 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.230
 dry rosemary or quad 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.150
 info.premiere.de urano yes what you are holding 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.150
 from all the herbs likes to lay down 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:59.090
 basil rocky is just rough 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.950
 once small to salad then you can 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.790
 either take her lemon juice now 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.260
 or something vinegar for example one 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.900
 would have good herbal vinegar then 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:14.930
 very good for a few times 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.220
 splash lemon juice when it pays 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.500
 have to be a bit careful because 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.510
 how do you go with nintendo and will 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.370
 which then pulls through with the salad 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.250
 then there is also a bit salt 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:29.300
 That's why I would say 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.710
 First, not more than a teaspoon of it 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.260
 could a Greek salad of course 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.520
 actually still love with 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.770
 however i can love so much at all 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.660
 do not like that so you can 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.600
 just decide how many 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:49.040
 and opel love get married then I give 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:50.660
 now the turbo for that was so 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.070
 now about half the glass is enough 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.220
 I think if you like you can 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.240
 Of course , then have more pure in it 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.350
 the whole thing first nice and then 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:05.350
 who likes can also a tablespoon 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:07.370
 Add olive oil 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.130
 it can still be quite a while now 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.800
 by goal but if you want you can 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.160
 The food already immediately as long again 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.160
 try 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.170
 tastes so sweet to me 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.430
 remember the critical and the topo 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.870
 taste I think there is actually 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.890
 almost not at all by a good one 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.430
 and yes if the color that I a 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:44.330
 would be a little different than gas crisis 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.140
 So almost we know for sure 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.650
 you probably could 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.910
 confuse their consistency is just 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:55.200
 still a bit different 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.240
 yes in any case very delicious and the 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.250
 inlaid turbo as I said I have you 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.530
 at five to six days 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.900
 room temperature and let the 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.450
 is just nothing happens but I think 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.120
 times after two to three weeks should 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.470
 you have already used up or 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.950
 then really stop in the fridge 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.500
 put 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.540
 so that was it again many 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.580
 thanks for this great ingredient suggestion 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.640
 and yes we have other suggestions 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:23.790
 I would like to have two or three myself 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:26.100
 ingredients in the comments and years 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.830
 Torres will and otherwise I would you 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.760
 make a lot of fun bike and again 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.760
 pessimistic 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.420
 apa 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.050
 at 

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.909
 at 

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.539
 there
