00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.759
 at the level of people who come the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.320
 to visit at your time is what you 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.210
 find that so that they have a good 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.070
 watchmaking knowledge it surprises you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.480
 they have a very good knowledge about 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.280
 the game we knew them a bit because 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.960
 that made us 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.620
 twelve years working in mexico 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.630
 with our age in may 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.130
 do not participate so art so we 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.810
 came this year because we come 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 to open the los angeles store and 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.070
 that of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.680
 my friends last year so this is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.410
 more to publicize our watches in 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.910
 latin america this is the only show 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.590
 from Latin America for the moment he 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.320
 was at buenos aires is but in this 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.470
 moment the country is economically 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 blocked and otherwise we are now at 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.680
 also in caracas in venezuela and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 level of the type of watch that the legion 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.010
 from latin america m is what you 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 find that he's sort of a drag 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.460
 of a particular trend good we 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 it's a bit special because we 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.640
 is not the first purchase of a 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.770
 collector and has a lot of things to 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.830
 buy before us so we still have 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.940
 that customers who are rather very 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.640
 raised in culture which he likes 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.990
 classic watches they do a little 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.840
 as in the rest of the world they have 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.520
 themselves same type of people it's 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.770
 obvious that in emerging markets 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.410
 people have to mature at a 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 moment then no the pitfall when they are 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.399
 at maturity only and precisely 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.330
 and if there is in relation to this clientele 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.700
 that's what there are requests 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 specials that are formulated to you 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 directly not for the moment in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.590
 special requests 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.869
 Not at first did not worry because 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.119
 otherwise it would be necessary to make each world 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.350
 would be a special request so we 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.909
 just reserve our efforts 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 customers who are who just came in 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.090
 shops and this 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.810
 from a certain level of buying it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.979
 do they begin to discuss very 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.979
 well thank you very much for your time
