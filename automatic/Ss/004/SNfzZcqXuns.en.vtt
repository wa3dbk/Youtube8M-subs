 end of the year and start 2014 champion 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.719

 rematch between anderson silva and cris o 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.890
 language is that it has knockout 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.149
 another defeat for the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.600
 spider resume 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.910
 This is good with you, the guy who knocked over 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.340
 anderson silva or anderson silva wanted 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.110
 fall on the octagonal June 5 is very good 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 in falls then it's time for him to fall 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 even because our great champion 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.710
 anderson silva the spider is great on foot and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.470
 will be theme will be hard will be by 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.080
 decision of the arbitrators or is going to win 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 by decision our anderson silva is the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
 My guess now the ball rolls through 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.110
 english league 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.909
 to make magical toxin difficult question 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.909
