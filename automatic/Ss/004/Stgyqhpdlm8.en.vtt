 that they were docked but actually no 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.310

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.619

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.800
 it's gone so here I cut the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.780

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.770

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.290

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.189
 does all of them all end up at the hundred level 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.469
 and they are in the order of pokedex 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.149

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:02.889
 below the boxes and here is how they 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.899
 are stored the pokemon or the box 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.969

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.530

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.620
 hop it goes on I pass quickly made all 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.510
 maulin pokemons 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.459
 they have no objects all this no 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.530
 no object and natures were 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.909
 randomly chosen 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.319
 I did not even care if he had 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:30.440
 the Russian poke but no I do not think so 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.180
 to go I go fast do the right here 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.909
 are all healthy the legendary there 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.049
 understood I will go towards the end for 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.720
 show you here so here is the end 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.950
 of the pokedex and the legendary here is it 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.670
 is at the beginning and there you have them in 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.010
 double so towards the end and here is the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.220
 last box so some pokemon who 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.379
 reappear again is here 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.099
 pitchous but that's what you could 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.599
 have in pokemon events so 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.620
 there but two picchu who are here it's 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.659
 the pitchous ones who have the colors of 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.129
 pikachu be a little different if 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.650
 I show you now go the little one 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.970
 difference is there is the famous picchu 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.190
 in the ear all weird we do not know 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.030
 what exactly is his name and I 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.260
 believe that there are also arceus 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.640
 the artists you could have 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.500
 also in some events 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.269
 they are there and in duplicate here for the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.459
 pokemon and then we go back to the beginning so 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.280
 really you have no place all 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.900
 the boxes are full so you 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.540
 as nice anyway all 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.250
 pokémons chagny levels are same the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.340
 pokemon that you could have in the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.150
 events good but it's nice then at 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.530
 following one year 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.620
 there are other assets objects 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:51.459
 so I'm leaving the pc for you 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.750
 show the box the bag earlier then 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.849
 so that's it we do not care we pass 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.680
 now on the bottom screen and I was saying 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.690
 that all the objects were at 9 without name 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.699
 was 99 forgiveness actually no it's fine 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.010
 more than that I was going to forget another 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:07.280
 figure 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.720
 here and you see down on 27 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.549
 so in fact I really have all 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.310
 objects here all the stones I am 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.310
 went a little too fast to 1995 2 everywhere 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.970
 so here are the well- filled ones like if I 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.949
 misses for example the potions the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.870
 material that you use during your 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:33.229
 fighting like this here is dreaming when 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.880
 even 1,995 master bolt was nice 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:40.610
 to that and that's all present too is at 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.100
 max comfort almost 1995 but at the same 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.810
 time to use them have to go there and 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.470
 already in addition not even have pokemon 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:53.320
 since my boxes are all filled 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:59.020
 now here are the 95's 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.370
 hop and berries too I do not do you 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.170
 all the pages ask us really 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.210
 quickly made the letters here by cons at 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.580
 better personal I have never used in 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:13.180
 previous versions 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:15.250
 here we do not care a bit 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.960
 collapses wedge that plays really settle 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:24.190
 me and not that too all the objects say 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.550
 in my opinion they are all there too and 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:33.970
 in one time obviously an egg 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:35.190
 mysterious cat is holding on well I will see more 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.350
 late what is in 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.690
 so that's for the little tour objects 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.310
 side there because trainer now good nothing 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.130
 to say apart from the idea number that me 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.210
 seems a little weird anyway 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.470
 money no it does not seem strange to me 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.110
 it's perfectly normal to have that in 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.760
 pocket maximum pokedex max 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.230
 also and the car started in 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.050
 2010 so that it's been a while 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.580
 that I have this cartridge anyway 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.820
 I'm going in the crampons is nothing to 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.100
 special actually that has nothing more to 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.420
 show you to tito lille who is not 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.370
 so be it, we'll give him a 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.840
 little trick with him and then on this I 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.710
 you leave me I tell you very soon 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.710
 for a new video
