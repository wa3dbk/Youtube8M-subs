real McCoy I believe at the time that my

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.660 
real McCoy I believe at the time that my
relative<00:00:35.730> received<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.079> case<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
relative received this case it was the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
relative received this case it was the
only<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.660> United<00:00:40.050> States<00:00:40.320> available

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
only one in the United States available

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
only one in the United States available
I<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.640> don't<00:00:41.790> even<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.149> them<00:00:42.300> available

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I really don't even see them available

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.500 
I really don't even see them available
on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.410> Louis<00:00:43.649> Vuitton<00:00:43.680> web<00:00:44.129> site<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:45.030> guess

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
on the Louis Vuitton web site I guess

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.670 
on the Louis Vuitton web site I guess
you<00:00:45.629> could<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.440> wanted

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
you could get one if you really wanted

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
you could get one if you really wanted
to<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.100> mostly<00:00:47.430> they're<00:00:47.640> available<00:00:47.820> in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to but mostly they're available in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.840 
to but mostly they're available in
Europe<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.899> again<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> contact

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850

in the US with Louie Vuitton you could

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.290

it's<00:01:21.689> probably<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> least<00:01:22.350> functional<00:01:23.009> iPad

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.270 
case I've ever seen yet it cost almost
as<00:01:25.950> much<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:28.049> more<00:01:28.409> than<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.920> iPad

certainly<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> mid-range

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
certainly as much as like the mid-range

certainly as much as like the mid-range
32gig<00:01:32.009> iPad<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:33.960> than<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> entry-level

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.569 
sleep/wake and the headset jack sure you
can<00:02:58.019> hopefully<00:02:58.170> make<00:02:58.470> out<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:58.889> how<00:02:59.010> recess

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
can hopefully make out just how recess

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.699 
can hopefully make out just how recess
that<00:02:59.609> one<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.049> sleep/wake<00:03:01.530> you

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
that one is for the sleep/wake you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.440 
that one is for the sleep/wake you
really<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.189> like<00:03:02.340> dig<00:03:02.670> your<00:03:02.879> finger<00:03:03.239> down

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
really have to like dig your finger down

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.039 
really have to like dig your finger down
in<00:03:03.689> there<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.439> get<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.859> it<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.510> case<00:03:06.810> does

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
in there to get to it so this case does

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.069 
in there to get to it so this case does
have<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.319> span<00:03:07.889> function<00:03:08.579> built<00:03:08.879> in<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.870> the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
have a span function built in on the

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.530 
have a span function built in on the
back<00:03:10.230> there's<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.620> separate<00:03:11.129> flap<00:03:11.489> which<00:03:12.090> opens

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
back there's a separate flap which opens

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.720 
back there's a separate flap which opens
like<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.650> when<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.129> want<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.340> put<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.579> in<00:03:14.670> a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
like so and when you want to put it in a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.330 
like so and when you want to put it in a
stand<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.510> simply<00:03:15.959> flip<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.560> cover<00:03:16.950> around

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
stand you simply flip the cover around

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.099 
stand you simply flip the cover around
then<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.269> see<00:03:18.449> hopefully<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:18.989> this

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
then you can see hopefully that this

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.490 
then you can see hopefully that this
flap<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.739> like<00:03:19.919> hinged<00:03:20.579> so<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.239> connect<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
flap is like hinged so you connect the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.210 
flap is like hinged so you connect the
two<00:03:22.530> snaps<00:03:23.099> on<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.239> hinge<00:03:24.810> portion<00:03:25.379> of<00:03:25.620> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
two snaps on the hinge portion of the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.879 
two snaps on the hinge portion of the
flap<00:03:26.669> and<00:03:26.970> lock<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.690> in<00:03:27.780> place<00:03:27.959> like<00:03:28.199> so<00:03:28.590> and

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
flap and lock it in place like so and

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.189 
flap and lock it in place like so and
then<00:03:29.310> you're<00:03:29.430> able<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.760> stand<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.480> case<00:03:30.690> up<00:03:30.959> in

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
then you're able to stand the case up in

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.619 
then you're able to stand the case up in
a<00:03:31.319> stand<00:03:31.650> position<00:03:32.159> like<00:03:32.579> so<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:33.510> obviously

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
a stand position like so you obviously

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.939 
a stand position like so you obviously
wouldn't<00:03:34.139> want<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.319> do<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.650> other<00:03:34.680> way

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
wouldn't want to do it the other way

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.059 
wouldn't want to do it the other way
because<00:03:35.549> because<00:03:36.150> there's<00:03:36.389> no<00:03:36.739> mechanism<00:03:37.739> to

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
because because there's no mechanism to

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.640 
because because there's no mechanism to
hold<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.579> iPad<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:39.299> here<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:40.019> would<00:03:40.199> just<00:03:40.230> flop

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
hold the iPad in here it would just flop

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.189 
hold the iPad in here it would just flop
right<00:03:40.680> out<00:03:41.129> once<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.239> do<00:03:42.449> that<00:03:42.629> you<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:43.019> see

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
right out once you do that you can see

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.649 
right out once you do that you can see

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
the screens fully accessible the case

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.229 
the screens fully accessible the case

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
still able to get to most of them when

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.110 
still able to get to most of them when
you're<00:04:02.909> done<00:04:03.079> you<00:04:04.079> pop<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.500> close<00:04:04.739> by<00:04:05.129> removing

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
you're done you pop it close by removing

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.830 
you're done you pop it close by removing
the<00:04:06.470> flap<00:04:07.470> portion<00:04:08.099> and<00:04:08.310> then<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:09.750> know

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
the flap portion and then you know

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.599 
the flap portion and then you know
securing<00:04:10.349> it<00:04:10.440> back<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.889> back<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.489> is

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
securing it back to the back so this is

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.189 
securing it back to the back so this is
kind<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.819> what<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:11.970> was<00:04:12.120> talking<00:04:12.299> about<00:04:12.540> if<00:04:13.049> you

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479

careful<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.109> can<00:04:16.260> see<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.530> start<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> slide
