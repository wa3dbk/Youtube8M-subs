straight edge like there you can see

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.070 
straight edge like there you can see
there's<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.750> gap<00:01:39.970> there's<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.060> gap<00:01:41.300> right<00:01:41.570> across

downwards that that is a bridge that was
on<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.130> guitar<00:01:52.430> for<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:54.530> know<00:01:54.649> over<00:01:55.159> 20

on that guitar for you know over 20

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.609 
on that guitar for you know over 20
years<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:56.570> was<00:01:56.659> talking<00:01:56.780> about<00:01:56.930> my<00:01:57.140> acidic

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
years so I was talking about my acidic

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.399 
years so I was talking about my acidic
sweat<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:58.159> saw<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.369> state<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.880> my<00:01:59.409> the

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
sweat and you saw the state that my the

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.630 
sweat and you saw the state that my the
original<00:02:00.830> bridge<00:02:01.040> that<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.280> had<00:02:01.399> on<00:02:01.520> this

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
original bridge that I had on this

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.520 
original bridge that I had on this
guitar

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
guitar

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.680 
guitar
you<00:02:03.979> saw<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.190> state<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.580> was<00:02:04.640> in<00:02:04.850> my<00:02:05.300> sweat

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
you saw the state it was in my sweat

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.219 
you saw the state it was in my sweat
basically<00:02:06.140> get<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.530> away<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:08.869> was<00:02:08.989> looking

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
basically get it away and I was looking

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.440 
basically get it away and I was looking
into<00:02:09.440> getting<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.739> replacement<00:02:10.360> kind<00:02:11.360> of

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
into getting a replacement kind of

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.370 
into getting a replacement kind of
original<00:02:13.510> looking<00:02:14.510> replacement<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
original looking replacement a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.680 
original looking replacement a
tune-o-matic<00:02:16.090> replacement<00:02:17.090> for<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.510> Les<00:02:17.660> Paul

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
tune-o-matic replacement for a Les Paul

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.120 
tune-o-matic replacement for a Les Paul
and<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:19.190> options<00:02:19.519> were<00:02:20.739> really<00:02:21.739> expensive

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
and the options were really expensive

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.479 
and the options were really expensive
and<00:02:24.190> also<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.220> thought<00:02:25.459> about<00:02:25.810> perhaps<00:02:26.810> just

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and also I thought about perhaps just

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.100 
and also I thought about perhaps just
trying<00:02:28.489> something<00:02:28.760> different<00:02:28.910> from<00:02:29.630> the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
trying something different from the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.500 
trying something different from the
standard<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.280> nematic<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.880> know<00:02:32.000> they<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
standard to nematic you know they the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.479 
standard to nematic you know they the
the<00:02:35.510> pointy<00:02:35.930> pieces<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.560> metal<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the pointy pieces of metal that the

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.090 
the pointy pieces of metal that the
string<00:02:37.820> sits<00:02:38.150> in<00:02:38.329> and<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:39.410> possibilities

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
string sits in and the possibilities

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.160 
string sits in and the possibilities
that<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.870> actually<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:44.480> strings<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.989> Les

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
that that actually the strings on a Les

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.350 
that that actually the strings on a Les
Paul<00:02:45.200> tend<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.799> catch<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.000> edges<00:02:47.239> those

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
Paul tend to catch on the edges those

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.319 
Paul tend to catch on the edges those
piece<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.750> metal<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:49.190> look<00:02:49.670> into<00:02:49.850> these<00:02:50.090> kind

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
piece of metal so I look into these kind

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.190 
piece of metal so I look into these kind
of<00:02:50.390> roller<00:02:51.700> roller<00:02:52.700> bridges<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.019> can

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
of roller roller bridges that you can

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.060 
of roller roller bridges that you can
see<00:02:54.440> here<00:02:54.680> hopefully<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.090> my<00:02:56.420> phone

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
see here hopefully this is just my phone

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.330 
see here hopefully this is just my phone
camera<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.640> it's<00:02:59.570> probably<00:03:00.500> shite<00:03:00.980> um<00:03:02.049> so<00:03:03.049> each

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
camera so it's probably shite um so each

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.030 
camera so it's probably shite um so each
string<00:03:04.340> on<00:03:04.519> these<00:03:04.810> rolls<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.350> these<00:03:06.799> little

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
string on these rolls and these little

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.039 
string on these rolls and these little
rollers<00:03:07.220> we<00:03:07.790> put<00:03:07.940> me<00:03:08.030> torch<00:03:08.269> on<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.930> can

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
rollers we put me torch on it so you can

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.360 
rollers we put me torch on it so you can
see<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.290> Bell<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.560> will<00:03:09.680> that's<00:03:09.920> terrible

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
see that Bell it will that's terrible

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.479 
see that Bell it will that's terrible
down<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:10.970> can<00:03:11.090> see<00:03:11.120> other<00:03:11.329> strings<00:03:12.489> go

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
down so you can see other strings go

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.940 
down so you can see other strings go
across<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.690> rollers<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:16.150> theoretically<00:03:17.950> the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
across the rollers so theoretically the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.270 
across the rollers so theoretically the
point<00:03:19.250> at<00:03:19.430> which<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:20.329> strings<00:03:20.750> now<00:03:21.079> go<00:03:22.040> across

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
point at which the strings now go across

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.170 
point at which the strings now go across
the<00:03:22.549> bridge<00:03:22.700> isn't<00:03:23.660> going<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.260> be<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:25.640> cause<00:03:26.150> for

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the bridge isn't going to be a cause for

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.810 
the bridge isn't going to be a cause for
string<00:03:26.930> breakage<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:28.010> what<00:03:28.400> I've<00:03:28.489> tried<00:03:28.519> as

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
string breakage and what I've tried as

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.650 
string breakage and what I've tried as
well<00:03:29.140> um<00:03:30.190> basically<00:03:31.190> my<00:03:31.519> whole<00:03:31.630> sort<00:03:32.630> of

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
well um basically my whole sort of

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.250 
well um basically my whole sort of
guitar<00:03:33.019> playing<00:03:33.260> life<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.680> mainly<00:03:34.100> used<00:03:35.260> any

set of really heavy gauge strings anyway
like<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.459> say<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.760> saw<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.090> state<00:04:11.329> of<00:04:11.360> my

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
like I say you saw the state of my

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.310 
had a change on the guitar it's it's
kind<00:04:57.349> of<00:04:57.410> made<00:04:57.620> it's<00:04:58.160> changed<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.729> oh<00:04:59.479> it's

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320

kind of changed the my terminal he's not

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.650 
kind of changed the my terminal he's not
very<00:05:02.660> good<00:05:02.780> but<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.740> guitar<00:05:04.070> now

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
very good but the guitar now

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.760 
very good but the guitar now
seems<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:09.040> the<00:05:10.540> where<00:05:11.540> it's<00:05:11.690> now<00:05:11.870> rolling<00:05:12.350> over

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
seems to the where it's now rolling over

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.910 
seems to the where it's now rolling over
this<00:05:12.890> roller<00:05:13.160> bridge<00:05:14.680> with<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.770> old

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
this roller bridge with the old

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.820 
this roller bridge with the old
cinematic<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.730> kind<00:05:16.940> of<00:05:17.290> it<00:05:18.290> felt<00:05:18.650> like<00:05:18.740> a

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
cinematic it kind of it felt like a

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.490 
cinematic it kind of it felt like a
proper<00:05:19.190> solid<00:05:19.760> barrier<00:05:20.320> how<00:05:21.320> would<00:05:21.440> you

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
proper solid barrier how would you

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.730 
proper solid barrier how would you
explain<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.670> felt<00:05:22.940> like<00:05:23.150> when<00:05:24.080> this<00:05:24.230> string

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
explain it it felt like when this string

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.490 
explain it it felt like when this string
hit<00:05:25.370> this<00:05:25.490> bridge<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:26.120> was<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.870> end<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:27.290> the

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
hit this bridge that was the end of the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.650 
hit this bridge that was the end of the
road<00:05:27.710> for<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:28.040> string<00:05:28.340> not<00:05:29.030> a<00:05:29.090> lot<00:05:29.300> going<00:05:29.330> on

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
road for that string not a lot going on

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.500 
road for that string not a lot going on
back<00:05:29.870> here<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.740> with<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:31.790> guitar<00:05:32.150> as<00:05:32.270> it<00:05:32.390> is

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
back here and with the guitar as it is

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.490 
back here and with the guitar as it is
now<00:05:33.100> it<00:05:34.100> feels<00:05:34.370> like<00:05:34.760> it's<00:05:35.720> hard<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.080> explain

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
now it feels like it's hard to explain

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.380 
now it feels like it's hard to explain
because<00:05:36.770> doesn't<00:05:37.340> doesn't<00:05:38.030> make<00:05:38.150> a<00:05:38.180> lot<00:05:38.330> of

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
because doesn't doesn't make a lot of

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.540 
because doesn't doesn't make a lot of
sense<00:05:38.570> what<00:05:38.780> I'm<00:05:38.840> saying<00:05:39.110> but<00:05:39.290> it<00:05:40.130> feels<00:05:40.340> like

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
sense what I'm saying but it feels like

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.200 
sense what I'm saying but it feels like
this<00:05:40.790> isn't<00:05:41.210> a<00:05:41.470> definite<00:05:42.470> end<00:05:42.730> for<00:05:43.730> the<00:05:43.790> string

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
this isn't a definite end for the string

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.160 
this isn't a definite end for the string
it<00:05:44.750> feels<00:05:45.140> like<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:46.540> vibrations<00:05:47.540> and<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:47.840> the

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
it feels like the vibrations and the the

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.320 
it feels like the vibrations and the the
resonance<00:05:48.560> of<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.800> strings<00:05:49.100> here<00:05:49.430> do<00:05:49.970> carry

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
resonance of the strings here do carry

there's an overall how would you

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
the same Les Paul and that for some will

the same Les Paul and that for some will

be a positive and for some will be a
negative<00:06:16.120> for<00:06:17.120> me<00:06:17.330> it's<00:06:18.170> actually<00:06:18.530> become<00:06:18.890> a

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
negative for me it's actually become a

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.480 
negative for me it's actually become a
little<00:06:19.160> bit<00:06:19.340> of<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:19.430> positive<00:06:21.070> it's<00:06:22.070> quite<00:06:22.340> nice

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
little bit of a positive it's quite nice

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.370 
little bit of a positive it's quite nice
to<00:06:23.000> play<00:06:23.420> with<00:06:23.510> a<00:06:23.630> different<00:06:23.930> sound<00:06:24.080> for<00:06:24.320> a

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
to play with a different sound for a

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.730 
to play with a different sound for a
change

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
change

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.550 
change
and<00:06:25.030> it's<00:06:26.030> kind<00:06:26.240> of<00:06:26.300> giving<00:06:26.570> me<00:06:26.600> a<00:06:26.690> new<00:06:27.410> lease

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
and it's kind of giving me a new lease

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.490 
and it's kind of giving me a new lease
of<00:06:27.710> life<00:06:27.770> of<00:06:28.130> it<00:06:28.280> and<00:06:28.810> another<00:06:29.810> good<00:06:30.050> point<00:06:30.260> was

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
of life of it and another good point was

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.550 
of life of it and another good point was
this<00:06:30.860> bridge<00:06:31.250> is<00:06:31.400> damn<00:06:31.610> cheap<00:06:31.880> I<00:06:32.570> think<00:06:33.320> it<00:06:33.440> was

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
this bridge is damn cheap I think it was

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.920 
this bridge is damn cheap I think it was
about<00:06:33.680> I<00:06:34.070> don't<00:06:34.790> know<00:06:34.880> I<00:06:35.120> even<00:06:35.570> remember<00:06:35.900> now

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
about I don't know I even remember now

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.400 
about I don't know I even remember now
17<00:06:36.920> quid<00:06:37.190> less<00:06:38.090> than<00:06:38.270> 20<00:06:38.540> quid<00:06:38.690> anyway<00:06:38.960> i'm

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
17 quid less than 20 quid anyway i'm

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.700 
17 quid less than 20 quid anyway i'm
compared<00:06:40.310> to<00:06:40.460> a<00:06:40.700> hundred<00:06:41.120> odd<00:06:41.290> for<00:06:42.290> a<00:06:42.320> new<00:06:42.440> chin

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
compared to a hundred odd for a new chin

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.170 
compared to a hundred odd for a new chin
o<00:06:42.740> matic

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
o matic

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.940

so<00:06:45.370> overall<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:47.840> point<00:06:48.080> of<00:06:48.170> this<00:06:48.260> video<00:06:48.590> is<00:06:48.770> to

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950 
so overall the point of this video is to

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.320 
so overall the point of this video is to
say<00:06:50.590> what<00:06:51.590> is<00:06:51.680> the<00:06:51.710> point<00:06:52.010> of<00:06:52.040> this<00:06:52.160> video

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
say what is the point of this video

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
say what is the point of this video
perhaps<00:06:53.330> I<00:06:53.540> should<00:06:53.660> have<00:06:53.690> had<00:06:53.840> a<00:06:53.870> point<00:06:54.050> to<00:06:54.260> the

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
perhaps I should have had a point to the

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.210 
perhaps I should have had a point to the
video<00:06:54.560> before<00:06:54.680> I<00:06:54.830> started<00:06:56.920> okay<00:06:57.920> what<00:06:58.100> am<00:06:58.190> I

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
video before I started okay what am I

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.590 
video before I started okay what am I
going<00:06:58.340> to<00:06:58.400> call<00:06:58.610> this<00:06:58.790> perhaps<00:06:58.940> I'm<00:06:59.180> gonna<00:06:59.330> say

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
going to call this perhaps I'm gonna say

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.090 
going to call this perhaps I'm gonna say
that<00:06:59.780> this<00:06:59.870> is<00:07:00.170> a<00:07:00.350> a<00:07:00.910> review<00:07:01.910> of<00:07:02.150> a<00:07:02.920> roll<00:07:03.920> of

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
that this is a a review of a roll of

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.740 
that this is a a review of a roll of
bridge<00:07:04.340> put<00:07:05.030> on<00:07:05.180> it<00:07:05.330> as<00:07:05.450> Paul<00:07:05.690> a<00:07:05.930> my<00:07:06.590> verdict

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.740 

different<00:07:10.750> but<00:07:11.260> I<00:07:11.320> like<00:07:11.500> it
