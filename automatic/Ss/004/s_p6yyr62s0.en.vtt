lenses<00:00:36.640> with<00:00:36.879> leica<00:00:37.300> these<00:00:37.930> ones<00:00:38.200> however

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
lenses with leica these ones however

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.829 
lenses with leica these ones however
have<00:00:38.770> been<00:00:38.950> built<00:00:39.219> entirely<00:00:39.820> in-house<00:00:40.570> and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
have been built entirely in-house and

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.989 
have been built entirely in-house and
Panasonic's<00:00:41.620> say<00:00:41.829> that<00:00:42.010> there<00:00:42.219> are<00:00:42.399> premium

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
Panasonic's say that there are premium

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.239 
Panasonic's say that there are premium
lenses<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:44.019> they've<00:00:44.140> been<00:00:44.289> given<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.679> x<00:00:44.920> name

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
lenses and they've been given the x name

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.389 
lenses and they've been given the x name
so<00:00:45.489> these<00:00:45.609> are<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.850> lumix<00:00:46.300> g<00:00:46.719> x<00:00:47.019> lenses<00:00:47.829> so

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
so these are the lumix g x lenses so

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.489 
so these are the lumix g x lenses so
first<00:00:48.640> i<00:00:48.820> will<00:00:48.969> have<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.149> quick<00:00:49.420> look<00:00:49.449> at<00:00:49.839> the<00:00:49.989> 14

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
first i will have a quick look at the 14

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.700 
first i will have a quick look at the 14
to<00:00:50.920> 42<00:00:51.489> millimeter<00:00:51.999> lens<00:00:52.179> now<00:00:52.659> at<00:00:53.409> first

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
to 42 millimeter lens now at first

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.559 
to 42 millimeter lens now at first
glance<00:00:53.949> this<00:00:54.249> might<00:00:54.429> look<00:00:54.609> like<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.879> 20<00:00:55.329> mil

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
glance this might look like a 20 mil

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:57.840 
glance this might look like a 20 mil
pancake<00:00:56.140> lens<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.589> that's<00:00:57.129> because<00:00:57.309> it's<00:00:57.730> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
pancake lens and that's because it's a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.270 
pancake lens and that's because it's a
collapsible<00:00:58.569> lens<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.350> we<00:00:59.469> can<00:00:59.589> see<00:00:59.829> if<00:01:00.069> we

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
collapsible lens so we can see if we

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.669 
collapsible lens so we can see if we
switch<00:01:00.579> it<00:01:00.729> on<00:01:00.850> here<00:01:01.210> that<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:02.079> pops<00:01:02.289> out<00:01:02.499> at

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
switch it on here that it pops out at

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.310 
switch it on here that it pops out at
the<00:01:02.739> front<00:01:03.039> there's<00:01:03.729> also<00:01:03.969> zoom<00:01:04.600> control<00:01:05.110> on

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
the front there's also zoom control on

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.830 
the front there's also zoom control on
the<00:01:05.650> lens<00:01:05.800> barrel<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.400> focus<00:01:07.150> control<00:01:07.450> too

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
the lens barrel and focus control too

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.660 
the lens barrel and focus control too
and<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.290> zoom<00:01:08.560> control<00:01:08.920> is<00:01:09.070> particularly

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
and that zoom control is particularly

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.330 
and that zoom control is particularly
handy<00:01:10.270> when<00:01:10.630> you're<00:01:10.750> shooting<00:01:10.930> video<00:01:11.409> so<00:01:12.310> now

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
handy when you're shooting video so now

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.780 
handy when you're shooting video so now
we'll<00:01:12.579> look<00:01:12.700> at<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.030> 45<00:01:13.930> 2<00:01:14.170> 1<00:01:14.380> 75<00:01:14.890> millimeter

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
we'll look at the 45 2 1 75 millimeter

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.959 
we'll look at the 45 2 1 75 millimeter
