processed voice obviously because it

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.070 
processed voice obviously because it
picks<00:00:51.400> up<00:00:51.520> through<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:51.820> microphone<00:00:52.240> I<00:00:52.480> tried

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
picks up through the microphone I tried

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.360 
picks up through the microphone I tried
to<00:00:53.200> connect<00:00:53.470> this<00:00:53.560> for<00:00:53.740> your<00:00:53.860> audio<00:00:54.160> as<00:00:54.340> well

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
to connect this for your audio as well

audiobook<00:02:04.729> compatible<00:02:05.299> but<00:02:05.390> it's<00:02:05.509> like<00:02:05.600> a

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
audiobook compatible but it's like a

audiobook compatible but it's like a
modular<00:02:06.080> synth<00:02:06.289> now<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.159> like<00:02:07.580> you

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
modular synth now this is a like you

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.650 
modular synth now this is a like you
know<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.179> group<00:02:08.600> logic<00:02:08.959> system<00:02:09.319> this<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.660> sort

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
know the group logic system this is sort

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.479 
know the group logic system this is sort
of<00:02:11.750> their<00:02:11.930> their<00:02:12.260> kind<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.560> thing<00:02:12.800> based<00:02:13.340> on

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
of their their kind of thing based on

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.150 
of their their kind of thing based on
their<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.360> see<00:02:14.540> it's<00:02:14.720> got<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.020> stuff<00:02:15.800> I

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
their so you see it's got this stuff I

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.930 

I'm<00:03:24.680> pretty<00:03:24.890> sure<00:03:25.010> if<00:03:25.340> it'll<00:03:25.610> wear<00:03:25.730> cause

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
I'm pretty sure if it'll wear cause

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.640 
I'm pretty sure if it'll wear cause
nothing's<00:03:26.270> connected<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:27.170> what<00:03:27.290> else<00:03:27.410> can<00:03:27.530> we

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
very modular sent if you understand

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.229 
very modular sent if you understand
modular<00:04:17.750> sit-ins<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.350> stuff<00:04:18.639> you<00:04:19.639> can<00:04:19.820> kind

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
modular sit-ins and stuff you can kind

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:37.310 
modular sit-ins and stuff you can kind
of<00:04:20.680> hook<00:04:21.680> things<00:04:21.949> in<00:04:22.100> an<00:04:22.190> RV<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:23.770> don't<00:04:24.770> know

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.960 

we<00:04:38.320> prepared<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.770> oscillators<00:04:39.370> low

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
we prepared the oscillators low

00:04:39.970 --> 00:05:29.480 
we prepared the oscillators low
frequency<00:04:40.390> oscillators<00:05:26.670> brings<00:05:27.670> up<00:05:27.820> the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
frequency oscillators brings up the

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.100 
frequency oscillators brings up the
thing<00:05:30.490> so<00:05:30.730> he<00:05:30.850> looks<00:05:31.150> like<00:05:31.270> you<00:05:31.390> can<00:05:31.510> jam<00:05:31.810> along

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:59.170 

away

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:06.890 

see<00:06:00.180> if<00:06:00.270> you<00:06:00.360> can<00:06:00.450> get<00:06:00.540> that<00:06:00.660> way<00:06:05.810> there's<00:06:06.810> a

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
see if you can get that way there's a

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:17.200 
see if you can get that way there's a
logic<00:06:07.230> system<00:06:07.620> stuff<00:06:10.760> nothing<00:06:11.810> in<00:06:12.810> there<00:06:13.080> so

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.980 

you<00:06:18.210> say<00:06:18.630> I<00:06:20.210> think<00:06:21.210> I've<00:06:21.510> got<00:06:21.690> through<00:06:21.840> nearly

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
you say I think I've got through nearly

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:35.540 
you say I think I've got through nearly
all<00:06:22.200> of<00:06:22.230> them<00:06:22.410> now

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:51.530 

I<00:06:48.320> always<00:06:49.320> think<00:06:49.850> with<00:06:50.850> the<00:06:50.940> modular<00:06:51.120> since

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
I always think with the modular since

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.580 
I always think with the modular since
because<00:06:51.840> there's<00:06:52.020> a<00:06:52.050> lot<00:06:52.170> of<00:06:52.260> people<00:06:52.500> that

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
because there's a lot of people that

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.750 
because there's a lot of people that
don't<00:06:52.680> I<00:06:52.890> mean<00:06:53.040> to<00:06:53.190> be<00:06:53.310> honest<00:06:53.490> really<00:06:53.580> I

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
don't I mean to be honest really I

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.970 
don't I mean to be honest really I
suppose<00:06:54.300> I<00:06:54.390> could<00:06:54.540> say<00:06:54.690> they're<00:06:54.870> in<00:06:54.960> lane<00:06:55.170> but

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
suppose I could say they're in lane but

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.540 
suppose I could say they're in lane but
it's<00:06:56.250> it's<00:06:56.610> it's<00:06:56.910> a<00:06:57.060> time<00:06:57.330> thing<00:06:57.660> isn't<00:06:57.900> it

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
it's it's it's a time thing isn't it

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.930 
it's it's it's a time thing isn't it
mm-hmm

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
mm-hmm

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.910 
mm-hmm
you<00:07:00.720> should<00:07:00.900> have<00:07:01.020> a<00:07:01.080> lot<00:07:01.290> of<00:07:01.380> presets<00:07:01.830> that

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
you should have a lot of presets that

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.330 
you should have a lot of presets that
you<00:07:02.070> can<00:07:02.160> get<00:07:02.400> going<00:07:02.610> with<00:07:03.500> first<00:07:04.500> really<00:07:05.190> I

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
you can get going with first really I

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.220 
you can get going with first really I
think<00:07:05.490> anyway<00:07:06.120> guys<00:07:06.270> always<00:07:06.570> enjoyed<00:07:06.990> this

think anyway guys always enjoyed this
the<00:07:07.620> whole<00:07:07.800> point<00:07:08.070> of<00:07:08.160> this<00:07:08.250> was<00:07:08.310> tansu<00:07:08.850> voice

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
the whole point of this was tansu voice

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.850 
the whole point of this was tansu voice
but<00:07:09.360> it<00:07:09.480> so<00:07:09.660> simple<00:07:09.990> it<00:07:10.110> doesn't<00:07:10.260> take<00:07:10.470> more

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
but it so simple it doesn't take more

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.310 
but it so simple it doesn't take more
than<00:07:10.920> a<00:07:11.100> few<00:07:11.130> minutes<00:07:11.400> to<00:07:11.730> to<00:07:12.450> go<00:07:12.990> through<00:07:13.200> it

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
than a few minutes to to go through it

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.410 
than a few minutes to to go through it
all<00:07:13.410> but<00:07:13.710> there<00:07:14.570> can<00:07:15.570> sue<00:07:15.780> synth<00:07:16.110> was<00:07:16.710> is<00:07:17.420> quite
