00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.140 

in<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> NBA<00:00:22.170> L<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> versatile<00:00:23.010> forward<00:00:23.550> I

in the NBA L be a versatile forward I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.839 
in the NBA L be a versatile forward I

pigeon-holed<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:27.660> bit<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
pigeon-holed a little bit I'm just a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.240 
pigeon-holed a little bit I'm just a
basketball<00:00:28.529> player<00:00:30.590> when<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.710> try<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:31.920> model

my game I just like the the offense of
the<00:00:34.170> NBA<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> lot<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.190> different

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
compound and I'm getting better at that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
compound and I'm getting better at that
what<00:01:06.390> I'm<00:01:06.510> doing<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.380> getting

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
what I'm doing with that is just getting

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020 
what I'm doing with that is just getting
the<00:01:07.650> next<00:01:07.830> play<00:01:07.979> mentality<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.820> miss<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the next play mentality and if I miss a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.230 
the next play mentality and if I miss a
shot<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.750> right<00:01:09.960> onto<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> next<00:01:10.439> shot

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
shot going right onto the next shot

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.700

another<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.630> weaknesses<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.290> free

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
another one of my weaknesses is free

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
well the most underrated part of my game

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
well the most underrated part of my game
is<00:01:40.979> dribbling<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.790> able<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> handle<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> ball

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.770 

as<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.460> shooter<00:01:51.880> right<00:01:52.030> now<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.240> think<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.630> could

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
as a shooter right now I think I could

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.870 
as a shooter right now I think I could
knock<00:01:52.930> down<00:01:52.960> shots<00:01:53.350> every<00:01:54.340> single<00:01:54.640> day<00:01:54.759> I'm

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
knock down shots every single day I'm

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.999 
knock down shots every single day I'm
improving<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.600> by<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.259> time<00:01:56.500> seasonal<00:01:56.860> rolls

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
improving and by the time seasonal rolls

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.310 
improving and by the time seasonal rolls
around<00:01:57.130> would<00:01:57.939> be<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.090> pretty<00:01:58.570> good<00:01:58.720> shooter

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.990
