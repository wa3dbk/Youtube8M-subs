 artistic gymnastics male horse 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.930
 with hoops is the hardest 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.380
 supported only with hands 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.150
 gymnasts must perform a choreography 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.289
 with circular movements of the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.969
 how impressive is that his legs 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.969
 never touch the device 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.579
 the routine should last less than a minute 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 they must touch the three areas of the horse and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.129
 make at least one movement of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.129
 scissors 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.080
 the rest of the time they should have the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.440
 legs together and they can never stop 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.440
 move 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 to practice this sport you need 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.760
 force 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.590
 Balance 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.600
 technique 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.829
 the movements reach a speed 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.109
 of 2.5 meters per second and can 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.109
 get to be up to 43 turns 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.460
 the arms carry all the weight of the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.220
 gymnast's body 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.430
 to be able to achieve it they use a force 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.409
 of 200 newtons that is the same force 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.409
 you need a car to start
