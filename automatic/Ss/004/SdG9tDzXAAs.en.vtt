hi<00:00:01.829> everyone<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.700> short<00:00:02.820> tutorial<00:00:03.419> on

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
hi everyone this is a short tutorial on

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.039 
hi everyone this is a short tutorial on
estimating<00:00:05.460> quotients<00:00:05.850> using<00:00:06.270> incompatible

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
estimating quotients using incompatible

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.080 
estimating quotients using incompatible
numbers<00:00:07.700> step<00:00:08.700> 1

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
numbers step 1

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.950 
numbers step 1
say<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:10.019> step<00:00:10.620> 2<00:00:10.920> round<00:00:11.849> 2<00:00:12.120> compatible<00:00:12.450> numbers

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
say it step 2 round 2 compatible numbers

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.999 
say it step 2 round 2 compatible numbers
and<00:00:13.170> step<00:00:13.530> 3

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
and step 3

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.109 
and step 3
divide<00:00:14.580> mentally<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.719> conquer<00:00:16.670> here<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.789> go

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
divide mentally and conquer here we go

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.679 
divide mentally and conquer here we go
the<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:18.990> gonna<00:00:19.109> try<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:20.000> 2,000<00:00:21.000> 95

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
the first one I'm gonna try is 2,000 95

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
the first one I'm gonna try is 2,000 95
divided<00:00:22.230> by<00:00:22.500> 3<00:00:23.990> step<00:00:24.990> 2<00:00:25.230> round<00:00:25.680> 2<00:00:25.800> compatible

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.490 
divided by 3 step 2 round 2 compatible
numbers<00:00:26.609> well<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.660> need<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> find<00:00:28.019> two<00:00:28.349> numbers

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
numbers well I need to find two numbers

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.640 
numbers well I need to find two numbers
that<00:00:28.710> divide<00:00:29.640> evenly<00:00:30.510> I'm<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> leave

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that divide evenly I'm going to leave

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.709 
that divide evenly I'm going to leave
that<00:00:31.679> 3<00:00:32.130> I'm<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.309> gonna<00:00:32.550> mess<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> but

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
that 3 I'm not gonna mess with it but

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
that 3 I'm not gonna mess with it but
this<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:35.570> see<00:00:36.570> something<00:00:36.960> familiar<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:37.820> 3

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
this I see something familiar here 3

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540 
this I see something familiar here 3
doesn't<00:00:39.270> go<00:00:39.300> into<00:00:39.390> 20<00:00:40.020> evenly<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.770> does<00:00:41.100> go

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
doesn't go into 20 evenly but it does go

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.150 
doesn't go into 20 evenly but it does go
into<00:00:41.579> 21<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.230> gonna<00:00:43.350> take<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.829> big

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
into 21 so I'm gonna take this big

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.220 
into 21 so I'm gonna take this big
number<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:45.210> gonna<00:00:45.329> make<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.899> bigger

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
number I'm gonna make it a little bigger

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
number I'm gonna make it a little bigger
I'm<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:47.010> gonna<00:00:47.219> change<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
I'm actually gonna change it because I

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
I'm actually gonna change it because I
can<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.079> whatever<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:52.100> number<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
can do whatever I want to a number that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.540 
can do whatever I want to a number that
is<00:00:53.550> compatible<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.239> 3<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.410> go<00:00:55.550> I'm

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
is compatible with 3 here we go I'm

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
is compatible with 3 here we go I'm
gonna<00:00:56.730> round<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> hundredths<00:00:59.370> place<00:01:00.020> by

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
gonna round to the hundredths place by

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
gonna round to the hundredths place by
looking<00:01:01.320> over<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.730> tells<00:01:02.730> me<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.940> go<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.300> I'm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
looking over here tells me to go up I'm

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289 
looking over here tells me to go up I'm
gonna<00:01:04.049> go<00:01:04.290> ahead<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.619> change<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.299> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
gonna go ahead and just change this to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.490 
gonna go ahead and just change this to
two<00:01:06.689> thousand<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:08.100> hundred<00:01:09.350> see<00:01:10.350> where

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
two thousand and one hundred see where

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.330 
two thousand and one hundred see where
I'm<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.960 

leave<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.549> 3<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:16.790> what<00:01:17.790> you'll

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
leave that 3 as it is and what you'll

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.580 
leave that 3 as it is and what you'll
see<00:01:18.979> is<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:21.060> 21<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.740> 3<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.430> very<00:01:23.939> compatible

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
see is a 21 and a 3 are very compatible

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.450 
see is a 21 and a 3 are very compatible
so<00:01:25.590> let's<00:01:25.770> divide<00:01:25.950> mentally<00:01:28.310> remember<00:01:29.310> those

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so let's divide mentally remember those

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.819 
so let's divide mentally remember those
zeros<00:01:29.759> show<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> hand<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.350> talk<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
zeros show them the hand don't talk to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.920 
zeros show them the hand don't talk to
me<00:01:31.950> zeros<00:01:33.500> 21<00:01:34.500> divided<00:01:35.070> by<00:01:35.100> 3<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:38.930> what

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
me zeros 21 divided by 3 we know is what

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.889 
me zeros 21 divided by 3 we know is what
is<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.710> 7<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:44.360> let's<00:01:45.360> take<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> look<00:01:45.840> at

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
is it it's 7 and let's take a look at

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.039 
is it it's 7 and let's take a look at
these<00:01:45.960> zeros<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.070> two<00:01:47.310> zeros<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
these zeros now we have two zeros in the

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.310 
these zeros now we have two zeros in the
dividend<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:50.100> means<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:51.240> Adam<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:52.170> add

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
dividend so that means we Adam we add

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.639 
dividend so that means we Adam we add
them<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> our<00:01:52.619> answer<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.229> done

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
them to our answer but are we done

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.639 
them to our answer but are we done
do<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.759> any<00:01:56.939> zeros<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> divisor<00:01:57.750> no<00:01:58.469> we

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
do we see any zeros in the divisor no we

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.870 
do we see any zeros in the divisor no we
don't<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
don't so

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.280 
don't so
in<00:02:00.329> fact<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.409> successfully<00:02:03.140> estimated<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
in fact we have successfully estimated a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
in fact we have successfully estimated a
quotient<00:02:04.979> using<00:02:05.219> compatible<00:02:06.000> numbers<00:02:06.329> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
quotient using compatible numbers and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.160 
quotient using compatible numbers and
our<00:02:06.930> answer<00:02:07.320> was<00:02:07.619> about<00:02:07.979> 700<00:02:08.810> let's<00:02:09.810> try<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
our answer was about 700 let's try one a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.690 
our answer was about 700 let's try one a
little<00:02:10.349> harder<00:02:10.590> here<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.640> go

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.990 

1392<00:02:16.700> /<00:02:17.420> 68<00:02:18.160> let's<00:02:19.160> find<00:02:19.400> our<00:02:19.489> compatible

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
1392 / 68 let's find our compatible

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.910 
1392 / 68 let's find our compatible
number<00:02:20.300> shall<00:02:20.569> we

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
number shall we

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.290 
number shall we
round<00:02:21.920> two<00:02:22.130> compatible<00:02:22.610> numbers<00:02:22.910> divide

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
round two compatible numbers divide

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.080 
round two compatible numbers divide
mentally<00:02:23.810> here<00:02:24.319> we<00:02:24.410> go

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
mentally here we go

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.240 
mentally here we go
well<00:02:27.459> 1392<00:02:29.380> not<00:02:30.380> seen<00:02:30.590> anything<00:02:30.739> too<00:02:31.010> familiar

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
well 1392 not seen anything too familiar

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.860 
well 1392 not seen anything too familiar
here<00:02:31.700> 68

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
here 68

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.820 
here 68
I<00:02:33.790> think<00:02:34.790> I'll<00:02:34.910> bring<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.209> 68<00:02:35.660> up<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.900> 70<00:02:36.349> and

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
I think I'll bring that 68 up to 70 and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.509 
I think I'll bring that 68 up to 70 and
see<00:02:37.040> where<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.280> takes<00:02:37.310> me<00:02:38.019> so<00:02:39.019> I<00:02:39.130> round<00:02:40.130> up<00:02:40.310> to

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
see where it takes me so I round up to

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.699 
see where it takes me so I round up to
the<00:02:40.610> tens<00:02:40.819> place<00:02:41.080> look<00:02:42.080> over<00:02:42.319> there

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
the tens place look over there

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.190 
the tens place look over there
it's<00:02:43.519> 1/8<00:02:43.790> bigger<00:02:44.150> than<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.330> 5<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.810> I'm<00:02:44.870> gonna<00:02:45.019> go

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
it's 1/8 bigger than a 5 so I'm gonna go

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.160 
it's 1/8 bigger than a 5 so I'm gonna go
to<00:02:45.260> 70<00:02:46.209> now<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.239> think<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.810> something<00:02:48.019> to

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
to 70 now I think I have something to

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.100 
to 70 now I think I have something to
work<00:02:48.290> with<00:02:48.319> here<00:02:48.500> 7<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:50.140> 13<00:02:52.450> not<00:02:53.450> evenly<00:02:53.780> but

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
work with here 7 and 13 not evenly but

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.839 
work with here 7 and 13 not evenly but
14<00:02:54.680> sure<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.690> let's<00:02:56.840> take<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:57.110> 3<00:02:57.580> it's<00:02:58.580> around

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
14 sure so let's take that 3 it's around

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.970 
14 sure so let's take that 3 it's around
to<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.120> hundredths<00:02:59.450> place<00:02:59.680> that's<00:03:00.680> gonna

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
to the hundredths place that's gonna

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.759 
to the hundredths place that's gonna
tell<00:03:01.280> us<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.519> move<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.880> up<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.239> 4<00:03:02.630> look<00:03:03.590> what

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
tell us to move that up to a 4 look what

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.460 
tell us to move that up to a 4 look what
I<00:03:03.830> have<00:03:04.010> here<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:06.700> 1,400<00:03:08.080> are<00:03:09.080> we<00:03:09.230> seeing

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
I have here I have 1,400 are we seeing

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.250 
I have here I have 1,400 are we seeing
something<00:03:09.769> familiar<00:03:10.250> oh<00:03:12.400> yeah

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
something familiar oh yeah

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.449 
something familiar oh yeah
14<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.890> 7<00:03:16.600> yes<00:03:17.600> tell<00:03:18.590> those<00:03:18.709> zeros<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.310> take

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
14 and a 7 yes tell those zeros to take

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.599 
14 and a 7 yes tell those zeros to take
a<00:03:19.489> walk<00:03:19.820> let's<00:03:20.780> look<00:03:21.019> at<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:21.200> 14<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:21.799> 714

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
a walk let's look at that 14 that 714

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.000 
a walk let's look at that 14 that 714
divided<00:03:22.970> by<00:03:23.060> 7<00:03:23.480> we<00:03:23.810> know<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.140> class<00:03:24.440> what<00:03:24.890> is

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
divided by 7 we know that class what is

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.140 
divided by 7 we know that class what is
it<00:03:25.600> you're<00:03:26.600> right<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:26.959> two<00:03:27.880> let's<00:03:28.880> look<00:03:29.030> at

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
it you're right it's two let's look at

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.770 
it you're right it's two let's look at
our<00:03:29.239> dividend<00:03:30.019> two<00:03:30.500> zeros<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:32.299> we<00:03:32.420> could<00:03:32.660> add

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
our dividend two zeros so we could add

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.660 
our dividend two zeros so we could add
two<00:03:33.079> zeros<00:03:33.380> over<00:03:33.500> here<00:03:33.769> but<00:03:34.280> look<00:03:34.400> here<00:03:34.579> we

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
two zeros over here but look here we

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.430 
two zeros over here but look here we
have<00:03:34.760> 1<00:03:34.940> 0<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.450> two<00:03:35.510> zeros<00:03:36.459> minus<00:03:37.459> one<00:03:37.670> zero<00:03:38.440> we

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
have 1 0 so two zeros minus one zero we

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.890 
have 1 0 so two zeros minus one zero we
always<00:03:39.620> subtract<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.250> zeros<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:41.420> two<00:03:41.480> minus

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
always subtract the zeros so two minus

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.379 
always subtract the zeros so two minus
one<00:03:42.200> gives<00:03:42.500> us<00:03:43.569> zero<00:03:44.920> two<00:03:45.920> zeros<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:47.269> the

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
one gives us zero two zeros to the

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.620 
one gives us zero two zeros to the
answer<00:03:47.660> -<00:03:48.410> 1<00:03:48.829> 0<00:03:48.859> from<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.489> divisor<00:03:49.819> gives<00:03:50.450> us

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
answer - 1 0 from the divisor gives us

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
answer - 1 0 from the divisor gives us
an<00:03:50.750> answer<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:51.049> 20<00:03:52.870> we<00:03:53.870> can<00:03:53.989> always<00:03:54.230> check<00:03:54.440> it

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
an answer of 20 we can always check it

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.050 
an answer of 20 we can always check it
remember<00:03:55.269> what's<00:03:56.269> 20<00:03:56.569> times<00:03:57.010> 70<00:03:58.010> should<00:03:58.910> be

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060
