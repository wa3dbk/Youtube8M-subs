00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.360
 once on one of the forums for 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
 underwater hunters 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.859
 I noticed a message in which the author 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.929
 was interested in places for underwater 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.160
 hunting in northern Italy in the area of Venice 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.980
 there were no answers to this question 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.690
 generally possible because the north of Italy 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 Russian underwater hunters are not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.150
 studied by this video i would like to reveal 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.430
 hunting theme in the north of italy based 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 personal experience do not pretend to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.599
 thorough knowledge of this question but three 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.349
 my annual trips to the north of italy on 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.300
 underwater hunting 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.930
 hopefully help make the viewer 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.930
 some conclusions 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.890
 In 2010 I was in Venice 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.210
 vacation 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.040
 shortly before that I looked 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.200
 several italian and documentary 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.540
 films about spearfishing Italians and 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.480
 was in anticipation of clear water 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.010
 good or ground raw octopus tuna and 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.830
 another not small fish 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.540
 by the way and equipment brought with 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.970
 is only lead loads 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.370
 except them in Italy all the equipment can be 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.590
 buy at prices two to three times lower than 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.119
 in Moscow 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.860
 getting the need for gear decided 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.650
 start your underwater hunt from the coast 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.550
 not far from venice we arrived at 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.830
 desert shore 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.590
 similar to the Caspian at sea and I was 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.160
 put before the fact muddyak was still 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.170
 worse than in Moscow circles through 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.330
 a couple of days with my family, I again went to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.790
 1 resort town of eastern Venice 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.060
 it is there that the water should be clean decided 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.310
 I 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.770
 the Italians themselves are going to rest there 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.200
 in fact , it turned out that transparency 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.659
 water there was no more than one or 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.980
 one and a half meters is absolutely flat 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.840
 sandy bottom and 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.110
 from the living creatures there only lapped 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.330
 having a rest a little later from the Italians I 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.729
 learned that the water in those places is not at all 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.130
 suitable for spear fishing and fish there 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.860
 for hiking underwater hunters simply 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.960
 no so for myself concluded that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 spearfishing in the adriatic sea 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.070
 the area of venice was not and will not be if 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.440
 really want to hunt in the north 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.780
 Adriatic then on the advice of local residents 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.160
 need to go to croatia there 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.680
 industrial zones and water transparency in 1 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.510
 above some time before traveling to 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.640
 Italy I read Italian forms for 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.840
 underwater hunters on one of them I 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.970
 met with nikola 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.610
 underwater hunters living in Milan and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.730
 riding on a weekend at lake garda 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.480
 to hunt he offered me a roll 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.460
 on lago di garda on a joint hunt 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.270
 Lake Garda is one of the largest lakes in 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.320
 Europe is a great tourist place 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.390
 freshwater fishing and hunting in Italy 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.220
 allowed with a license which 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.040
 numerous kiosks available 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.950
 trading in small things but in practice 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.510
 few people buy them we crossed with 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.030
 nikoloy on the track aileron landes 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.510
 exchanged a pair of gestures went to 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.250
 the point on the lake where he used to hunt 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.620
 his best trophy on this lake was pike 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.230
 weighing 5 kilograms well or 7 kilograms 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.260
 I showed you a photo with that 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.150
 Shchukin this shot here quite a lot 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.640
 In general, moral was again on horseback and 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.010
 I was ready to show Italy in the face of Nikola 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.860
 how to shoot a really big one 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.460
 pike dressed right on the beach pike 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.650
 Cafe 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.230
 I am not very comfortable preparing for 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.240
 hunting in such conditions they are accustomed 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.050
 puts a robe under him to pull the woods 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.270
 pants wetsuits and ready so go 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.400
 in the water and spreads in different directions 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.950
 Nicola's hunt is at depths from 10 to 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.490
 20 meters transparency changes from location 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.640
 in place 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.980
 but 23 meters is stable there are especially windows 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.620
 compared to medical water here 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.570
 it was even interesting to dive if not 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.580
 bevy of freshwater Russian perch then 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.420
 you could well think what you want 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.370
 camping in the sea 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.560
 perch here I must say enough 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.750
 large and a couple can take 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.000
 to cook the Italians real 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.700
 Russian ear 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.400
 diving over and over again just enjoying 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.860
 deep blue infinity and 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.170
 suddenly pike pike here you can meet 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.140
 both in algae and just lying on 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.980
 bottom I was just beside myself with misfortune 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.770
 Yes Yes 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.890
 from misfortune because this joke weighs 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.320
 9 pounds shot nikola I did 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.570
 way almost three thousand kilometers to 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.290
 see how this dude comes out 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.210
 lakes with your new record zashis to 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.310
 great surprise in 10 minutes to me 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.920
 suddenly called university familiar 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.840
 from Moscow and reported that he is in 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.220
 melanin is excellent speaking 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.110
 and I'll stand near Milan wet 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.300
 Well, approaching Milan, I drink beer 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.940
 I'll tell you where to shoot fish here 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.380
 near substitution 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.780
 gene is south of milan and 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.300
 this is where the real insight begins 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.920
 and a great sea in which numerous 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.640
 Italian streams shot and 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.080
 published their trophies next 15 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.330
 minutes i was talking to my wife and 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.090
 told how those deeply unhappy 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.120
 dirty trick came here and that's really nothing 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.120
 not because there was nowhere else but in the genome 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.210
 the outcome of the negotiations was the consent of his wife 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.950
 so I went to hell anywhere at all 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.760
 four sides because I'm already tired 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.530
 with his underwater hunt a loser 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.010
 giving nikol not held goes for 1 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.050
 perch 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.419
 and thanking for the hunt I rushed on 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.350
 coast sunny genes of course 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.350
 through Milan
