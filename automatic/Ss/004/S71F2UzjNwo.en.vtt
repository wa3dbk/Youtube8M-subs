00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.990
 hello everyone again today let's see 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.090
 one of the most anticipated smartphone and 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.790
 that was just presented in Paris or I'm going 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.230
 to this in 7 and it's expected because the 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.060
 objective of this new smartphone is 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.000
 consolidate a product idea that 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.790
 started with about 36 and that in 2014 has 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.200
 two slopes up to 6 that keeps the 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.290
 essence of its predecessor in a segment 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.419
 lower price and up to p 7 the 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.780
 maximum exponent of the p series focused 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.940
 to design and innovation 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.739
 if we start talking about design keeps 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.660
 the same lines and materials that up 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.879
 you start but with a much more appearance 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.760
 sophisticated thanks to the treatment of your 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.589
 back cover and that's seven 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.539
 overlapping glass layers that 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.670
 they get a metallic and elegant finish 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.760
 while providing protection 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.159
 front scratches and wear besides their 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.440
 6.5 millimeters thick make it 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.780
 one of the finest 4g smartphone in the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.489
 market and if we talk about innovation we 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.290
 we have to stop in their cameras and it's 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.970
 that even in p 7 is not only the first 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.700
 smartphone incorporates a front camera 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.530
 8 megapixel but it really is 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.780
 an 8 megapixel main camera 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.550
 putting front what you want to say 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.050
 this is that the size of the sensor and the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.179
 construction of the lens in five pieces 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.220
 of the front camera are the usual 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.289
 from a high quality main camera 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.869
 bringing the results of the camera 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.729
 frontal will surprise us and for 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.770
 to take advantage of it we are going to have 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.750
 new features like the 6000 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.640
 panoramic or the possibility of having 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.509
 beautification mode on video or 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.509
 even my calls 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.820
 as for its main camera 13 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.470
 megapixels what stands out is its 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.080
 speed and that is that we will be able to take 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.460
 photos in 1.5 seconds even with the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.860
 phone off by simply doing 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.690
 double click the new software version 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.250
 It also includes innovations such as 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.530
 super battery mode with which we can 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.050
 lengthen its duration up to a day with 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.700
 only 10% charge or the possibility of 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.910
 share applications in a very 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.910
 simple 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.250
 but these are just some of the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.870
 Huawei details up to 7 that 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.640

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.580
 medium-high range thanks to its proposal 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.440

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.970
