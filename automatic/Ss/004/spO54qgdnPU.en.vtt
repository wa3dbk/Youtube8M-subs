00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
think of the stage as your RAM memory

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.199 
think of the stage as your RAM memory

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
RAM memory it's a sales technique and

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.229 
RAM memory it's a sales technique and
it's<00:03:50.139> very<00:03:50.530> inexpensive<00:03:50.919> and<00:03:51.639> easy<00:03:52.090> to

it's very inexpensive and easy to

it's very inexpensive and easy to
upgrade<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.230> computer<00:03:53.859> and<00:03:54.069> add<00:03:54.669> more<00:03:55.180> ram

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
upgrade a computer and add more ram

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.309
