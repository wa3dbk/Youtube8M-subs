00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
really not a race per se and there

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
really not a race per se and there
really<00:01:16.170> aren't<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.619> many<00:01:16.830> hard<00:01:17.220> bodies<00:01:17.640> and

not everyone is young either the average

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.929 
not everyone is young either the average
age<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.450> believe<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.780> around<00:01:22.130> 47<00:01:23.130> each<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
age I believe is around 47 each of the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.820 
age I believe is around 47 each of the
some<00:01:24.180> 800<00:01:24.780> cyclists<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
some 800 cyclists was here for a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
some 800 cyclists was here for a
slightly<00:01:26.159> different<00:01:26.490> reason

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
slightly different reason

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.560 
slightly different reason
I'm<00:01:27.960> thinking<00:01:28.439> maybe<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:29.340> several<00:01:30.119> years<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I'm thinking maybe in several years of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.960 
I'm thinking maybe in several years of
possibly<00:01:31.140> retiring<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> good<00:01:32.790> way

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
possibly retiring on this is a good way

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.230 
possibly retiring on this is a good way
to<00:01:33.200> find<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.740> part<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> state<00:01:36.060> I'd

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
to find out what part of the state I'd

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.770 
to find out what part of the state I'd
like<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:38.579> freewheel<00:01:39.119> organization

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
really knows how to put a ride together

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
really knows how to put a ride together
and<00:01:41.700> each<00:01:42.240> year<00:01:42.509> they<00:01:42.689> choose<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> different

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and each year they choose a different

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.039 
and each year they choose a different
route<00:01:43.530> from<00:01:44.040> south<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.460> north<00:01:44.790> which<00:01:45.720> puts
