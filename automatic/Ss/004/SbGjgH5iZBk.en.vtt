00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:02.659
 Hello everyone, I'm Merve Ã–zkaynak. 

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:06.720
 Today, I will show you how to obtain long and fuller eyelashes. 

00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:11.184
 We did a similar application in my video "Natural Eyelashes," but ... 

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.038
 ... if you remember that video ... 

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:14.873
 ... if FLORMAR's ... 

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.326
 ... if I found some lash base, I said I wanted to use it, and I found it. 

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:22.554
 FLORMAR Crazy Look Primer mascara ... 

00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:25.181
 It will also be a first impression video of this video ... 

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:27.321
 ... because I will be using this product for the first time. 

00:00:27.914 --> 00:00:30.106
 I'm very curious, so let's get started. 

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:34.066
 I'm starting with the FLORMAR Crazy Look Primer. 

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.989
 There are no products in my eyelashes. 

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:30.500
 Wait a minute to dry with such white eyelashes. 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.268
 Yeah. I saw it once it was dry ... 

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:35.363
 ... in this product I think one floor is enough. 

00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:40.644
 I had to go twice as much as other CLINIQUE and MAC, but this is a very busy base. 

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:43.965
 I filled my lashes so well, so I'll use a coat. 

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:46.247
 If your eyelashes are thinner and shorter ... 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.332
 ... you can apply two coats, but you know, I'm going to go on a floor. 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.155
 Now let's go to the mascara application. 

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:57.659
 I will always use MAYBELLINE 'The One By One'. 

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:17.062
 At the moment, I have a floor base and a floor mascara in my eyes. 

00:03:17.424 --> 00:03:19.648
 As you've noticed, there have been contaminations. 

00:03:19.683 --> 00:03:22.345
 It's no problem you can always experience it. 

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.193
 Always use ... 

00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:27.701
 ... your eye cleaning water and one ear cotton ... 

00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:33.065
 ... to the places ... 

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:37.362
 ... especially in the interior, inside the eye and the outer part of the lash. 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.553
 In that... 

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:49.073
 ... You can clear. 

00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:54.886
 Now for you, I'm going to put one eye on one eye and the second on my other eye. 

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:57.736
 You make the decision, which one you like. 

00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:01.944
 I'm leaving this eye on the 1st floor, and I'm riding the second floor. 

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:52.732
 Now I'm going to fix this with a broken-up mascara brush. This is my clean brush. 

00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:56.085
 I'm using it for fix operations. 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.062
 As you can see, there have been contaminations again. 

00:05:36.955 --> 00:05:38.427
 Let's clear those parts right away. 

00:06:13.586 --> 00:06:16.595
 Yeah. I'm at the end of my "Long and Fuller Eyelashes" video. 

00:06:17.096 --> 00:06:18.877
 You're using the method I used ... 

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:22.008
 ... you can have such almost false eyelash effective lashes. 

00:06:22.692 --> 00:06:25.196
 My secret is to use a pre-mascara base. 

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:27.525
 As for the evaluation of the product ... 

00:06:27.916 --> 00:06:30.404
 According to the CLINIQUE and MAC I used before ... 

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:33.928
 ... the structure is much more intense. So, if you noticed ... 

00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:36.250
 ... I was a little pushed by the forming process. 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.591
 I don't know if I can buy one again. I think that ... 

00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:41.720
 I'm more satisfied with CLINIQUE and MAC, but ... 

00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:44.763
 ... still, quite a nice product in price-performance. 

00:06:45.558 --> 00:06:48.454
 If you absolutely want to try this method after this video ... 

00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:51.822
 ... don't forget to like it. If you just got into my channel, please ... 

00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:54.442
 ... watch my other videos and subscribe to my channel. 

00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:57.603
 In the meantime, I opened my new website merveozkaynak.com. 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.370
 From now on, I use all my videos, all I wear ... 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.312
 ... all the details of all the products I wear and ... 

00:07:04.884 --> 00:07:08.820
 ... I will be sharing on my website, you can see the details below. 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:10.732
 Thank you so much for watching. 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.569
 I hope you have enjoyed it and hopefully it has been helpful. 

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:15.861
 See you in new videos, bye-bye.
