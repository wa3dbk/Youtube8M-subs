00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.380 
but I prefer that it would hold one
because<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.560> only<00:02:13.800> has<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.370> rubber<00:02:14.760> strap<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
carrying bag I really don't like it very

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.800 
carrying bag I really don't like it very
much<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.890> like<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.580> because<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.420> easier

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
much but I like it because it's easier

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.220 
much but I like it because it's easier
to<00:02:36.960> hold<00:02:37.140> my<00:02:37.380> dolphin<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:39.390> had<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> hard<00:02:40.170> time

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
to hold my dolphin and I had a hard time

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.560 
to hold my dolphin and I had a hard time
putting<00:02:40.590> them<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.070> because<00:02:41.640> their<00:02:42.030> feet<00:02:42.360> get

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
putting them in because their feet get

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.300 
putting them in because their feet get
in<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.870> way<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.380> says<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.770> came<00:02:43.890> home<00:02:44.100> to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
in the way and it says it came home to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.850 
in the way and it says it came home to
dolls<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.300> think<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.990> can<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.590> only

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
dolls but I think it can really only

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.060 
dolls but I think it can really only
hold<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:49.230> other<00:02:49.470> thing<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.830> I

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
hold one and this other thing that I

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.720 
hold one and this other thing that I
like<00:02:50.430> about<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.650> as<00:02:52.920> American

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
like about it is that it's as American

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.770 
like about it is that it's as American
doll<00:02:54.270> up<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.900> bottom<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:56.820> has<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.360> little
