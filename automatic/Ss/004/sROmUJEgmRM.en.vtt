00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
 the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.380
 Just like yesterday, we just start third-class racing with cup football 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.110
 mechelen 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.319
 has another in first class from the campaign that plays 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.699
 in the eighth finals he dealt with Zulu Waregem 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.650
 pristina too have extensions and 11 and also not needed 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.770
 a deserved victory that the club won in the quarterfinals against second division 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.399
 lierse must come true 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.689
 until the 22nd penalty kick the more than 2500 spectators have to wait for the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.170
 decision about who goes to the quarterfinals 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.390
 club is has taken the penalty from bossuyt 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.500
 even inside 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.750
 the oscar vankesbeeck stadium explodes 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.500
 after the stunt victory against cherno beerschot it seems that there is now in Mechelen too 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.550
 waregem out 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 because if it feels a bit strange alone 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.550
 it is now the time to join 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770
 we are doing a problem 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.990
 great what it is like to live 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990
 the topper to be the butter in turn 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 love to come 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.430
 the regime's victory is fully deserved after a somewhat hesitant start 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.610
 played a complexless match 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.320
 and sees that ten minutes before the break the goal of marcos is wrong 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.730
 rejected 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.240
 just about the only thing that sluggish waregem lace made in regular playing time 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.600
 is a shot from ben j 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 that we are ticked over by the excellent clappers 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.720
 there is a final offensive in drachten to settle the matter within 90 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.060
 minutes what a head butt of klaasens is not powerful enough 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.450
 it remains 0 0 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.140
 the extensions do not result in any goals or dead rising the ball from 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.789
 the stumbling and alliance 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.789
 not bumped alongside 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.080
 just before the final signal, season the topper through the head of the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.250
 needle 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.200
 and then there are no fewer than 22 penalties 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 to keep it clean 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.610
 that he is against the keeper 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.430
 I had the idea that 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.290
 currently being but yes i guess 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.310
 quite a bit busy 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.970
 half of the michael clepkens signs excellently contributed to the debate 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.970
 as it turns out good at shot 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.970
 after it became known that this is not my specialty market 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.549
 you try and holland 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.519
 you do not know what we also give less power 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.069
 the score
