00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
coaster so it looks like basically yeah

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.140 
coaster so it looks like basically yeah
it's<00:02:09.840> inverted<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:10.970> starts<00:02:11.970> off

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
it's inverted as you can see starts off

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.410 
it's inverted as you can see starts off
around<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.810> top<00:02:12.959> there

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
around the top there

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.940 
around the top there
to<00:02:13.540> be<00:02:14.160> drill<00:02:15.160> powerlift<00:02:16.020> goes<00:02:17.020> up<00:02:17.349> turns

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
to be drill powerlift goes up turns

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.600 
to be drill powerlift goes up turns
around<00:02:20.040> enters<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.310> first<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:22.420> drops<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.080> and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
around enters the first it drops in and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.290 
around enters the first it drops in and
then<00:02:24.610> enters<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.180> first<00:02:25.480> element<00:02:25.810> which<00:02:26.200> is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
then enters the first element which is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.640 
then enters the first element which is
down<00:02:28.300> i<00:02:28.330> keep<00:02:28.569> on<00:02:28.690> forgetting<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.200> name<00:02:29.319> of<00:02:29.530> it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
down i keep on forgetting the name of it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.350 
down i keep on forgetting the name of it
okay<00:02:29.980> I'm<00:02:30.130> well<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.940> sort<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.239> like<00:02:31.330> a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
okay I'm well it's like sort of like a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.020 
okay I'm well it's like sort of like a
sea<00:02:31.810> serpent<00:02:32.110> roll<00:02:32.620> what's<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.640> stretched

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
sea serpent roll what's like stretched

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.550 
sea serpent roll what's like stretched
out<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.450> let's<00:02:34.569> not<00:02:34.690> put<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:34.900> nice<00:02:35.140> 45

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
out and let's not put that nice 45

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.790 
out and let's not put that nice 45
degrees<00:02:35.830> but<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:37.180> basically<00:02:37.569> you<00:02:37.780> see<00:02:38.050> this

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
degrees but it's basically you see this

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.880 
degrees but it's basically you see this
inversion<00:02:39.420> element<00:02:40.420> type<00:02:40.690> thing<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.140> like<00:02:41.650> boo

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
inversion element type thing in like boo

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.970 
inversion element type thing in like boo
coma<00:02:42.190> roller<00:02:42.640> coasters<00:02:42.730> inverted<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:44.410> say

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
coma roller coasters inverted and say

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.470 
coma roller coasters inverted and say
yeah<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.300> that's<00:02:46.450> basically<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:49.000> nice<00:02:49.239> and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
yeah so that's basically it's nice and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.910 
yeah so that's basically it's nice and
made<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.720> smooth<00:02:50.130> okay<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.690> also<00:02:52.860> after<00:02:53.860> that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
made it smooth okay and also after that

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.330 
made it smooth okay and also after that
is<00:02:54.780> going<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.959> be<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.140> reverse<00:02:56.530> side<00:02:56.890> winder

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
is going to be a reverse side winder

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.270 
is going to be a reverse side winder
which<00:02:57.790> I'm<00:02:57.970> still<00:02:58.209> building<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.980> then<00:02:59.980> from

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
which I'm still building and then from

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.009 
which I'm still building and then from
there<00:03:00.340> it's<00:03:00.790> going<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.030> come<00:03:01.180> around<00:03:01.330> and

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
there it's going to come around and
