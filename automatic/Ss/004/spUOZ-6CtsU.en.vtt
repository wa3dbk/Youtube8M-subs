00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that space anyway and then after that I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020 
that space anyway and then after that I
wanted<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.560> change<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> fight<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.460> Welbeck<00:01:38.820> I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
in this game I just think obviously is a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
in this game I just think obviously is a
very<00:01:42.750> small<00:01:42.990> player<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.710> actually<00:01:43.950> don't

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
very small player but I actually don't

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
very small player but I actually don't
feel<00:01:44.490> any<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.030> his<00:01:45.210> kind<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.540> agility<00:01:45.840> or

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
feel any of his kind of agility or

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.319 
feel any of his kind of agility or
balance<00:01:47.159> or<00:01:47.310> anything<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:48.149> he's

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
balance or anything I just think he's

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.690

perhaps<00:02:57.240> go<00:02:57.570> for<00:02:57.720> another<00:02:57.780> goal<00:02:58.110> Duff<00:02:58.710> just

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
perhaps go for another goal Duff just

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.440 
perhaps go for another goal Duff just
taken<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> shot<00:02:59.520> from<00:02:59.640> outside<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.060> box<00:03:00.270> that

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
taken a shot from outside the box that

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.300 
taken a shot from outside the box that
was<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.750> last<00:03:00.900> chance<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.470> game<00:03:02.280> was

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
was the last chance and that game was

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.420 
was the last chance and that game was
ended<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.210> jaw<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.110> we're<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.320> Division<00:03:04.710> 9<00:03:05.130> at

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
ended as a jaw so we're in Division 9 at

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.790 
ended as a jaw so we're in Division 9 at
the<00:03:05.460> moment<00:03:05.910> we<00:03:06.330> are<00:03:06.360> basically<00:03:07.290> one<00:03:07.560> winner

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
the moment we are basically one winner

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.640 
the moment we are basically one winner
away<00:03:08.220> from<00:03:09.000> getting<00:03:09.480> promoted<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.290> division

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
away from getting promoted to division

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.190 
away from getting promoted to division
nine<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.880> if<00:03:12.000> we<00:03:12.090> win<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.330> next<00:03:12.450> game<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:13.080> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
nine so if we win the next game that is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.320 
nine so if we win the next game that is
it<00:03:13.380> we're<00:03:13.530> into<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.250> yet<00:03:14.700> division<00:03:15.120> aight<00:03:15.270> i

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
it we're into so yet division aight i

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.620 
it we're into so yet division aight i
think<00:03:15.720> we<00:03:15.840> are<00:03:15.950> gonna<00:03:16.950> be<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.630> start

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
think we are gonna be in and start

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.449 
think we are gonna be in and start
building<00:03:18.930> our<00:03:19.020> second<00:03:19.470> team<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.860> as<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.340> can

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
building our second team and as you can

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.390 
building our second team and as you can
see<00:03:20.489> i<00:03:20.640> put<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.120> martin's<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.810> also<00:03:22.800> Donovan

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
see i put in martin's and also Donovan

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.420 
see i put in martin's and also Donovan
so<00:03:24.120> they're<00:03:24.270> going<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.480> get<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.980> kind<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.190> link

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
so they're going to get a kind of a link

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.040 
so they're going to get a kind of a link
but<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:26.820> got<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> weak<00:03:27.360> link<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:27.870> not

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
but it's got to be a weak link it's not

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.590 
but it's got to be a weak link it's not
going<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.350> very<00:03:28.920> good<00:03:29.310> but<00:03:29.550> I've<00:03:30.120> played

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
going to be very good but I've played

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.420 
going to be very good but I've played
with<00:03:30.690> Martin's<00:03:31.140> loads<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.650> times<00:03:31.830> before<00:03:32.040> on

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
with Martin's loads of times before on

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.640 
with Martin's loads of times before on
free<00:03:32.670> chemistry<00:03:33.120> or<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:34.230> does<00:03:34.380> pretty

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
free chemistry or and it does pretty

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.750 
free chemistry or and it does pretty
well<00:03:34.770> but<00:03:35.010> he's<00:03:35.130> actually<00:03:35.250> got<00:03:35.459> seven

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
well but he's actually got seven

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.460 
well but he's actually got seven
chemistry<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.239> game<00:03:36.420> which<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.600> okay<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
chemistry in this game which is okay and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.520 
chemistry in this game which is okay and
also<00:03:38.190> Ron<00:03:38.700> Don<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.910> actually<00:03:39.150> find<00:03:39.450> very<00:03:39.810> easy

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
also Ron Don I actually find very easy

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.979 
also Ron Don I actually find very easy
to<00:03:40.860> play<00:03:41.040> with<00:03:41.190> his<00:03:41.340> kind<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:42.150> big

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
to play with his kind of like a big

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.930 
to play with his kind of like a big
strong<00:03:43.500> player<00:03:43.739> like<00:03:43.920> Fred<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:44.730> with<00:03:44.910> a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
strong player like Fred but with a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.550 
strong player like Fred but with a
little<00:03:45.090> bit<00:03:45.300> more<00:03:45.450> pace<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.019> obviously<00:03:46.350> not

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
little bit more pace and obviously not

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.940 
little bit more pace and obviously not
any<00:03:47.340> skill<00:03:47.700> moves<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:49.260> then<00:03:49.350> obviously<00:03:49.650> you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
any skill moves and then obviously you

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.110

check that my xbox hasn't frozen but we

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.450 
check that my xbox hasn't frozen but we
get<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:39.990> win<00:04:40.110> for<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.350> game<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.770> nil<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.370> we

get the win for that game to nil and we

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.940 
get the win for that game to nil and we
are<00:04:41.550> now<00:04:41.700> fruit<00:04:42.210> too<00:04:42.600> well<00:04:43.170> we<00:04:43.560> have<00:04:43.740> one

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
divisions and now for the last game we

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.670 
divisions and now for the last game we
start<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.400> build<00:04:56.760> our<00:04:57.060> last<00:04:57.360> team<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:57.780> wanted<00:04:58.560> to

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
start to build our last team I wanted to

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.650 
start to build our last team I wanted to
use<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.980> Russian<00:04:59.280> again<00:04:59.610> actually<00:05:00.000> as<00:05:00.150> i<00:05:00.360> said

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.720 
use the Russian again actually as i said
i<00:05:00.690> love<00:05:01.080> using<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.530> Rondon<00:05:02.010> Rondon<00:05:02.550> as

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
i love using that Rondon Rondon as

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.000 
i love using that Rondon Rondon as
striker<00:05:03.510> i<00:05:03.810> think<00:05:04.020> i've<00:05:04.260> actually<00:05:04.500> got<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.770> good

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
striker i think i've actually got a good

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.440 
striker i think i've actually got a good
amount<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.460> players<00:05:05.670> now<00:05:05.880> from<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.180> Russian

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
amount of players now from the Russian

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.610 
amount of players now from the Russian
league<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.780> get<00:05:06.930> chemistry<00:05:07.350> with<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.530> other

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
league to get chemistry with the other

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.680 
league to get chemistry with the other
players<00:05:07.860> obviously<00:05:08.130> cassia<00:05:08.850> is<00:05:09.090> pretty

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
players obviously cassia is pretty

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.570 
players obviously cassia is pretty
decent<00:05:10.110> as<00:05:10.200> well<00:05:10.350> he<00:05:10.440> always<00:05:10.890> seems<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.220> score

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
decent as well he always seems to score

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.550 
decent as well he always seems to score
at<00:05:11.700> least<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:12.090> sister<00:05:12.540> goal<00:05:12.750> in<00:05:13.050> every<00:05:13.380> game

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
at least a sister goal in every game

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.800 
at least a sister goal in every game
that<00:05:13.620> he<00:05:13.830> plays<00:05:14.070> after<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:15.360> was<00:05:15.510> kind<00:05:15.720> of

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
that he plays after that was kind of

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.300 
that he plays after that was kind of
struggling<00:05:16.170> fighters<00:05:16.680> trying<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:17.010> think<00:05:17.160> of

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
struggling fighters trying to think of

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.640 
struggling fighters trying to think of
how<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:17.850> could<00:05:18.180> possibly<00:05:18.330> use<00:05:18.720> my<00:05:19.110> informed

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
how I could possibly use my informed

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.200 
how I could possibly use my informed
player<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:20.010> did<00:05:20.220> open<00:05:20.520> in<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:20.820> last<00:05:21.000> episode

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
player that did open in the last episode

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.850 
player that did open in the last episode
because<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.080> haven't<00:05:22.230> really<00:05:22.320> played<00:05:22.650> many

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
because I haven't really played many

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.380 
because I haven't really played many
games<00:05:22.920> of<00:05:23.190> him<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.820> game<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.180> did

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
games of him and the game of that did

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.450 
games of him and the game of that did
play<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:24.780> had<00:05:24.960> bronze<00:05:25.290> centre-back<00:05:25.980> so<00:05:26.190> all<00:05:26.430> I

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
play I had bronze centre-back so all I

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.330 
play I had bronze centre-back so all I
was<00:05:26.670> doing<00:05:27.270> was<00:05:27.300> defending<00:05:28.040> really<00:05:29.040> badly

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
was doing was defending really badly

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.830 
was doing was defending really badly
basically<00:05:29.970> so<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.180> wanted<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.420> give<00:05:30.510> another

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
basically so I wanted to give another

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.590 
basically so I wanted to give another
chance<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:32.010> playing<00:05:32.430> in<00:05:32.610> this<00:05:32.730> team<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.180> also

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
chance and playing in this team I also

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.150 
chance and playing in this team I also
put<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:33.960> well<00:05:34.140> back<00:05:34.320> there<00:05:34.500> with<00:05:34.650> Joe<00:05:34.800> Cole<00:05:35.010> to

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
put in well back there with Joe Cole to

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.800 
put in well back there with Joe Cole to
get<00:05:35.280> that<00:05:35.400> chemistry<00:05:35.640> so<00:05:36.390> they're<00:05:36.510> gonna<00:05:36.600> get

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
get that chemistry so they're gonna get

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.660 
get that chemistry so they're gonna get
a<00:05:36.870> nice<00:05:37.410> strong<00:05:37.740> chemistry<00:05:38.100> link<00:05:38.400> I'm<00:05:38.520> not

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
a nice strong chemistry link I'm not

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.130 
a nice strong chemistry link I'm not
sure<00:05:38.820> how<00:05:38.970> many<00:05:39.030> chemistry<00:05:39.570> how<00:05:39.990> much

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
sure how many chemistry how much

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.710 
sure how many chemistry how much

shell knee and it's obviously French so

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.040 
shell knee and it's obviously French so
he's<00:05:44.520> gonna<00:05:44.670> link<00:05:44.940> well<00:05:45.120> with<00:05:45.540> the<00:05:45.660> right<00:05:45.840> mid

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
he's gonna link well with the right mid

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.990 
he's gonna link well with the right mid
and<00:05:46.230> he's<00:05:46.860> also<00:05:47.040> gonna<00:05:47.250> link<00:05:47.490> with<00:05:47.610> subletter
