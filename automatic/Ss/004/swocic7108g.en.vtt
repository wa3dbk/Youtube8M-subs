 our means of communication which are 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.030
 the properties and characteristics of 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.010

 please susan the shawls 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.170
 Spanish companies have many 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.570
 years and are characterized by being of the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.880
 High-end range 'come from the high 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.100
 lace stitching dresses 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.320
 of a bride according to the history of our 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.170
 church have been using for more 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.470
 20 years old is a very light scarf 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.750
 soft light weight and most important 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.090
 is that it adapts to any kind of 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.670
 hair combed the company where the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.280
 we buy distribute more than 80 colors 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.350
 they sell them unicolor and also with a background 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.390
 black on the embroidered also the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.550
 they distribute the same company where 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.739
 we do our shopping 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.350
 I can say that both shawls are in 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.810
 the same job and cover the same thing is 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.300
 true that the advantages are more expensive 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.670
 for the kind of work they carry so 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.190
 otherwise the embroidery is more expensive 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.220
 economic by its way of manufacturing 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.530
 allows you to compete on the price of you know 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.450
 could you tell us which company 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.190
 you buy the shawls as well 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.080
 you said that from generation to generation 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.760
 in your family in purchase 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.580
 but for our means of communication 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.920
 which ones you refer to 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.930
 please, good sir, daniel. I know I can not 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.030
 say that they are the only ones 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.610
 they sell veils to cover the head 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.740
 because surely there will be more companies or 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.470
 people who do it but if I can 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.410
 recommend the company exclusive designs 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.020
 to which we buy this genre 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.110
 both the Spanish lace and the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.690
 embroidered are serious responsible are 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.550
 compliments are flexible at the time 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.980
 you have to modify the order or the 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.700
 delivery address to make a change 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.400
 of color and so on and what we like most 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.620
 is that they are fast we live the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.380
 experience of placing an order in another 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.290

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.630
