working out very well and he entered
some<00:00:26.890> complications<00:00:27.610> which<00:00:28.200> favored<00:00:29.200> me<00:00:29.230> and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
some complications which favored me and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
I was thinking I can play just a normal

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.200 
I was thinking I can play just a normal
game<00:00:42.130> because<00:00:42.340> I<00:00:42.399> had<00:00:42.550> all<00:00:42.640> some<00:00:42.850> ideas

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
game because I had all some ideas

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.639 
game because I had all some ideas
because<00:00:43.870> you<00:00:43.960> know<00:00:44.050> in<00:00:44.140> advance<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.470> don't

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
because you know in advance you don't

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.810 
because you know in advance you don't
know<00:00:44.770> how<00:00:45.010> you're<00:00:45.190> gonna<00:00:45.280> play<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.640> first

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
know how you're gonna play the first

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.460 
know how you're gonna play the first
game<00:00:45.880> you<00:00:46.180> don't<00:00:46.270> know<00:00:46.420> who<00:00:46.660> starts<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.320> I<00:00:47.350> had

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
game you don't know who starts to I had

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.680 
game you don't know who starts to I had
some<00:00:47.620> ideas<00:00:47.829> with<00:00:48.640> white<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.090> I<00:00:49.270> wanted<00:00:49.630> to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
some ideas with white and I wanted to

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.459 
some ideas with white and I wanted to
test<00:00:50.020> it<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:52.030> somehow<00:00:52.660> i'm<00:00:53.020> slightly

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
test it but somehow i'm slightly

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.410 
test it but somehow i'm slightly
misplayed<00:00:54.329> today<00:00:55.329> because<00:00:55.860> eventually<00:00:57.420> we

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
misplayed today because eventually we

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.569 
misplayed today because eventually we
traded<00:00:58.899> off<00:00:58.989> many<00:00:59.200> pieces<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.770> the<00:01:00.280> end<00:01:00.430> game

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
traded off many pieces and the end game

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.670 
traded off many pieces and the end game
I<00:01:01.030> thought<00:01:01.329> it's<00:01:01.510> better<00:01:01.660> for<00:01:01.899> white<00:01:02.050> but<00:01:02.379> i

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
I thought it's better for white but i

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.109 
I thought it's better for white but i
miss<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.070> concrete<00:01:03.370> idea<00:01:03.610> that<00:01:03.730> he<00:01:03.820> changes

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
miss the concrete idea that he changes

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.459 
miss the concrete idea that he changes
my<00:01:04.269> last<00:01:04.449> point<00:01:04.629> on<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.899> queenside<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.379> then

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469 
my last point on the queenside and then

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.300 
my last point on the queenside and then
it's<00:01:06.280> just<00:01:06.549> pretty<00:01:06.789> dry<00:01:07.060> so<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:08.039> guess<00:01:09.039> we<00:01:09.159> both

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
it's just pretty dry so I guess we both

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.190 
it's just pretty dry so I guess we both
can<00:01:09.549> play<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.850> but<00:01:10.060> position<00:01:10.719> should<00:01:10.810> be<00:01:10.869> equal

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
can play on but position should be equal

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.260 
can play on but position should be equal
so<00:01:11.710> okay<00:01:12.070> then<00:01:12.340> we<00:01:12.520> are<00:01:12.610> both<00:01:12.790> happy<00:01:12.970> with<00:01:13.180> that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
so okay then we are both happy with that

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.149 
so okay then we are both happy with that
wrong<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.830> do<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:14.979> think<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.220> tromsø<00:01:15.490> so<00:01:15.760> far

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.370 
doing I have some ideas in mind and I
even<00:02:24.670> know<00:02:24.819> what<00:02:25.300> if<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.780> know<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.170> pitcher

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
even know what if you know the pitcher

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.590 
even know what if you know the pitcher
liquor<00:02:26.650> qualifies<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.340> if<00:02:28.240> I'd<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.569> a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
liquor qualifies and if I'd be on a

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.140 
liquor qualifies and if I'd be on a
corona<00:02:28.930> qualifies<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:30.520> just<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:30.880> case<00:02:31.000> you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
corona qualifies so just in case you

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.900 
corona qualifies so just in case you
know<00:02:31.270> because<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:32.200> course<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.580> not<00:02:33.670> that

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
know because of course it's not that

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.190 
know because of course it's not that
likely<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.360> i<00:02:34.510> will<00:02:34.540> we<00:02:34.810> know<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:34.959> matches

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
but you know you have to suppose you you

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.090 
but you know you have to suppose you you
get<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.500> something<00:02:39.040> in
