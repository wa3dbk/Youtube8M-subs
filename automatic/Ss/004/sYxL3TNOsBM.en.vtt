00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
so all their work in math and then hide

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.560 
so all their work in math and then hide
it<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:44.680> their<00:02:45.010> final<00:02:45.280> drafts<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.970> English<00:02:46.360> I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570
