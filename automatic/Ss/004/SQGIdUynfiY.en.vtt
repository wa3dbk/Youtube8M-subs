run through everything so what happens

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
run through everything so what happens
with<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:52.860> neat

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
with that is you get this really neat

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.120 
with that is you get this really neat
of<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.630> green<00:01:54.869> being<00:01:55.080> run<00:01:55.380> through<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:55.890> in

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
of the green being run through and in

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
of the green being run through and in
some<00:01:56.310> areas<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.640> Burwood<00:01:57.210> comes<00:01:57.630> through<00:01:57.900> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
some areas the Burwood comes through and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.080 
some areas the Burwood comes through and
this<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.220> actually<00:01:59.610> midway<00:01:59.850> through<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
this is actually midway through the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.520 
this is actually midway through the
process<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.750> still<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.170> seal<00:02:01.350> this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
process we still have to seal this

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.950 
process we still have to seal this
additional<00:02:01.979> times<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.450> gives<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> good

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
additional times but it gives you a good

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.719 
additional times but it gives you a good
idea<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:05.159> we're<00:02:05.280> capable<00:02:05.400> of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
idea of what I what we're capable of

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.809 
idea of what I what we're capable of
here<00:02:05.940> with<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> two<00:02:06.299> color<00:02:06.420> drug<00:02:06.690> thriller<00:02:07.819> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
here with a two color drug thriller and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.249 
here with a two color drug thriller and
we<00:02:08.940> don't<00:02:09.090> really<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:10.140> much

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
we don't really like going that much

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.830 
we don't really like going that much
more<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.619> three<00:02:10.979> because<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:12.720> too

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
more than three because if you get too

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780 
more than three because if you get too
many<00:02:12.930> color<00:02:13.200> rub<00:02:13.410> throughs<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.280> chair<00:02:14.520> or<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
many color rub throughs the chair or the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.930 
many color rub throughs the chair or the
furniture<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.330> sets<00:02:15.569> get<00:02:15.750> too<00:02:15.930> busy<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
furniture just sets get too busy and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.880 
furniture just sets get too busy and
really<00:02:17.940> loses<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.870> lose<00:02:19.110> focus<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.680> really

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
really loses you lose focus on it really

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.890 
really loses you lose focus on it really
easily<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.370> three<00:02:20.610> color<00:02:20.730> rub<00:02:21.000> through<00:02:21.239> we

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
