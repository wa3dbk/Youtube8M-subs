00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.570
 friends of youtube here I wait for you and good 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.910
 having you are a new video and this time 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.880
 it's a mod that is the truth that is 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.840
 very cool that followed the mÃ³n more 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.320
 arcs and well you tell me you're 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:31.710
 ready to do the tutorial 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.710
 well we took the one freezer 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.340
 We went down from the hill and started 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.650
 travel getting this that too 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.190
 marked 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.840
 all these following frames 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.840
 I would miss this 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.300
 well first let's teach those that 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.360
 would be the tricks the first would be the 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 flan that is created with two lighters three 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.449
 sticks and three strings 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.760
 later it would be what would be the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.030
 explosive wow wow that is spent akon 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.320
 where dynamite three sticks and three of 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.690
 rope 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.350
 the ice bowl that is recorded as 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.159
 2 of ice 3 sticks and 3 of rope 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.740
 the sport album with two emeralds three 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:29.150
 sticks and three ropes the potato 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:34.400
 potatoes bone with two potatoes 3 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.159
 three strings and the south go go com where 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.850
 gunpowder 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.340
 three sticks and three strings 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.439
 good fear I do not think these are 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.439
 the buttons and good me some person 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.290
 first let's approve the plan 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.909
 basically basically for if they have 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.049
 that aiming have to move 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.049
 this would be 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.360
 of the spirit controls these would be this 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.360
 Let's see 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.460
 from the cones 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.460
 well there they have vulgarity 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:21.900
 dead after what would be a show 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:25.710
 although it would be the bow of the weapon 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.710
 but who wants three arrows 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.900
 Belgium 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.650
 then it would be the explosive mount that 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.650
 explode 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.900
 that explodes when he touches the floor and touches 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.959
 the module exploits 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.470
 then there would be the ice bone that when 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.070
 obviously when the driver does not 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.090
 does not throw ice but if it touches the floor 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.090
 turn the floor into ice 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.980
 and the truth is that it is very cool 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.569
 later I would give the transport though 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.129
 we know what is part of 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.910
 transport them where the date falls 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.910
 we 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.569
 and finally there would be the two powerful 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.560
 although what makes pulls explodes and pulls 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.560
 kicks on the floor 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.300
 and good friends to no and apart from that 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.490
 can graph what would be the guide that 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.310
 it is created 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.220
 that is created with four rope sticks 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.340
 the guide that would be that has 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.370
 makes you make the report mold of the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.000
 information and mode information 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.000
 the arches 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:44.000
 the forum of the creator good friends I think 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.710
 that would be all we are going to refer to in the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.870
 bed in the camera d 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.290
 until I like to dismiss massive is 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.290
 good, but 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.800
 for the sword 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.750
 we close 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.600
 ah no 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.960
 let's put a tree 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.810
 an arch the improvement of peace 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.190
 good friends I think that would be all already 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.550
 they know that if they like they can charcoal 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.740
 like comment share by subscribing 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:23.750
 that the truth is appreciated and we 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.750
 we see until a next video yo yo
