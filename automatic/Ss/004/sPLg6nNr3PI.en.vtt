00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:09.200 

so<00:01:53.250> that's

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.080

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and also an it gets later on near the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.760 
and also an it gets later on near the
chorus<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.620> that

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.710 

I'm<00:02:19.520> not<00:02:19.910> spoken<00:02:20.720> east<00:02:21.170> ring<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.510> second<00:02:23.510> fret

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
I'm not spoken east ring and second fret

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.270 
I'm not spoken east ring and second fret
a<00:02:23.840> string

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.260 

and<00:02:26.700> then<00:02:27.600> second<00:02:28.200> fret<00:02:28.470> e<00:02:28.800> string<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.610> fourth

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.080 
and then second fret e string and fourth
fret<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.840> string

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.370 

so<00:02:33.690> just

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
so just

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.370 
so just
and<00:02:35.740> play<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.390> 2nd<00:02:37.390> fret<00:02:37.510> e<00:02:37.780> string<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:38.170> few

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
and play the 2nd fret e string a few

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:47.900 
and play the 2nd fret e string a few
more<00:02:38.530> times

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.760 

and<00:02:48.030> then<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.690> last<00:02:48.720> time<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.380> does<00:02:49.560> that

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
and then the last time it does that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.630 
and then the last time it does that
before<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.190> core<00:02:50.460> as<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.850> goes

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.760 

so<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:55.330> move<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.690> power<00:02:55.870> cord<00:02:56.230> up<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.620> the

so you move the power cord up to the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.640 
so you move the power cord up to the
fifth<00:02:57.460> fret<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.300> E<00:02:58.420> string
