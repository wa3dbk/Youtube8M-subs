00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
and if you see his light it's orange and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.699 
and if you see his light it's orange and
then<00:02:24.819> when<00:02:25.819> he's<00:02:25.910> dead<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:27.050> looks<00:02:27.290> like<00:02:27.410> that

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
then when he's dead it looks like that

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.770 
then when he's dead it looks like that
and<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.040> get<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> perk<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:30.290> death<00:02:31.160> machine

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
and you get a perk and the death machine

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.360 
and you get a perk and the death machine
and<00:02:32.780> he<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:33.019> goes<00:02:33.140> under<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.410> water<00:02:33.650> keep<00:02:34.250> in

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
and he just goes under the water keep in

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.509 
and he just goes under the water keep in
mind<00:02:34.400> he<00:02:34.670> does<00:02:34.970> come<00:02:35.300> back<00:02:36.040> after<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.069> round<00:02:37.340> or

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519
