as<00:00:09.030> an<00:00:09.360> astronomer<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:14.360> blew<00:00:18.109> all<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.170> quick

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
as an astronomer I blew all the quick

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.019 
as an astronomer I blew all the quick
explanation<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:20.100> why<00:00:20.250> disguised<00:00:20.670> lose

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
explanation of why disguised lose

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.550 
explanation of why disguised lose
because<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.600> how<00:00:21.779> light<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> Sun

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
because of how light from the Sun

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.769 
because of how light from the Sun
interested<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> Earth's<00:00:23.400> atmosphere<00:00:23.779> but

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
interested in the Earth's atmosphere but

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.210 
interested in the Earth's atmosphere but
to<00:00:24.869> really<00:00:25.050> explain<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.680> beneath<00:00:25.980> know<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to really explain this beneath know a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.849 
to really explain this beneath know a
bit<00:00:26.430> more<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.820> light<00:00:27.060> itself<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:28.650> white

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
bit more about light itself the white

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.620 
bit more about light itself the white
light<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.189> our<00:00:29.369> Sun<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.880> actually<00:00:30.029> made<00:00:30.480> up

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
light from our Sun is actually made up

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
light from our Sun is actually made up
of<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.840> whole<00:00:31.050> range<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.500> different<00:00:31.560> colors

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
of a whole range of different colors

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
of a whole range of different colors
which<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.759> see<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.210> ourselves<00:00:33.300> when<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
which we see for ourselves when we see a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.680 
which we see for ourselves when we see a
rainbow<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.829> sky<00:00:35.450> scientists<00:00:36.450> call<00:00:36.570> this

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
rainbow in the sky scientists call this

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.530 
rainbow in the sky scientists call this
rainbow<00:00:37.079> spectrum<00:00:37.820> each<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.059> these<00:00:39.149> colors

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
rainbow spectrum each of these colors

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.479 
rainbow spectrum each of these colors
has<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> slightly<00:00:40.079> different<00:00:40.260> wavelength<00:00:40.980> red

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
has a slightly different wavelength red

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.979 
has a slightly different wavelength red
light<00:00:41.730> has<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> longest<00:00:42.420> wavelength<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.960> can

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
light has the longest wavelength we can

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.110 
light has the longest wavelength we can
see<00:00:43.350> while<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> way<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> blue<00:00:44.700> light<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
see while the way that the blue light is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.720 
see while the way that the blue light is
much<00:00:45.329> shorter<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> how<00:00:47.219> does<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.700> tie

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
much shorter so how does this all tie

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.240 
much shorter so how does this all tie
into<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> color<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.600> our<00:00:48.750> sky<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.770> secret<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
into the color of our sky the secret is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.040 
into the color of our sky the secret is
and<00:00:50.399> how<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> light<00:00:50.910> reacts<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> gases

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and how the light reacts to the gases

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 
and how the light reacts to the gases
that<00:00:52.140> make<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.469> our<00:00:52.559> atmosphere<00:00:52.760> mainly

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
that make up our atmosphere mainly

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.029 
that make up our atmosphere mainly
nitrogen<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.390> oxygen<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.960> molecules<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
nitrogen and oxygen the molecules of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.619 
nitrogen and oxygen the molecules of
these<00:00:56.129> gases<00:00:56.399> interfere<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> incoming

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
these gases interfere with the incoming

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
these gases interfere with the incoming
sunlight<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.530> short<00:00:58.829> wavelength<00:00:59.250> blue<00:00:59.430> light

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
sunlight the short wavelength blue light

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.160 
sunlight the short wavelength blue light
is<00:00:59.879> more<00:01:00.030> strongly<00:01:00.329> affected<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
is more strongly affected and is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.200 
is more strongly affected and is
scattered<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.829> directions<00:01:02.059> while<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
scattered in all directions while the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.240 
scattered in all directions while the
longer<00:01:03.510> wavelength<00:01:03.899> green<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.409> red<00:01:04.530> light<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
longer wavelength green and red light is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.520 
longer wavelength green and red light is
able<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.549> pass<00:01:05.640> straight<00:01:06.119> through<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.810> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
able to pass straight through as you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.929 
able to pass straight through as you
look<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> sky<00:01:08.159> you're<00:01:08.580> seeing<00:01:08.850> this

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
look at the sky you're seeing this

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.230 
look at the sky you're seeing this
scattered<00:01:09.360> light<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> sky<00:01:10.290> looks<00:01:10.500> blue

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
scattered light or so the sky looks blue

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.000 
scattered light or so the sky looks blue
so<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> atmosphere<00:01:13.140> scatters<00:01:13.320> blue<00:01:13.799> light

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
so if the atmosphere scatters blue light

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980 
so if the atmosphere scatters blue light
more<00:01:14.040> effectively<00:01:14.729> than<00:01:14.909> red<00:01:15.090> light<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.960> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
more effectively than red light then you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.219 
more effectively than red light then you
may<00:01:16.200> wonder<00:01:16.439> why<00:01:17.000> sunsets<00:01:18.000> look<00:01:18.210> red<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
may wonder why sunsets look red the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.190 
may wonder why sunsets look red the
answers<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.830> fold<00:01:20.659> firstly<00:01:21.659> when<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> look<00:01:22.110> at

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
answers to fold firstly when you look at

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
answers to fold firstly when you look at
the<00:01:22.290> sunset<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:22.920> looking<00:01:23.159> towards<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the sunset you're looking towards a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
the sunset you're looking towards a
certain<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:24.060> away<00:01:24.299> from<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.170> while<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
certain not away from it so while the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.660 
certain not away from it so while the
blue<00:01:25.619> light<00:01:25.830> has<00:01:25.860> been<00:01:26.159> scattered<00:01:26.430> away

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
blue light has been scattered away

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.580 
blue light has been scattered away
you're<00:01:27.540> looking<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> redder<00:01:28.200> light<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you're looking at the redder light the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
you're looking at the redder light the
paths<00:01:28.829> straight<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> atmosphere<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> your

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
paths straight to the atmosphere to your

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.170 
paths straight to the atmosphere to your
eyes<00:01:31.250> secondly<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> Sun<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.759> low<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> sky

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
eyes secondly the Sun is low in the sky

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.270 
eyes secondly the Sun is low in the sky
so<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> light<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> forced<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> travel<00:01:35.009> through

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so the light is forced to travel through

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.800 
so the light is forced to travel through
much<00:01:35.520> more<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> atmosphere<00:01:36.090> than<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> does

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
much more of the atmosphere than it does

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
much more of the atmosphere than it does
at<00:01:36.930> midday<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> process<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.670> passes

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
at midday in the process it passes

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.670 
at midday in the process it passes
through<00:01:39.119> far<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.630> water<00:01:39.869> vapor<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.439> dust
