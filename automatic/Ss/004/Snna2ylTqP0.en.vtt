install<00:01:53.579> your<00:01:53.729> roms<00:01:54.149> you'll<00:01:54.840> probably<00:01:55.140> want

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
install your roms you'll probably want

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.249 
install your roms you'll probably want
to<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:57.210> will<00:01:57.360> basically<00:01:57.509> backup

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
to do it and this will basically backup

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.859 
to do it and this will basically backup
my<00:01:58.439> rom<00:01:58.770> stock<00:01:59.520> rom<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.000> also<00:02:00.390> install<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
my rom stock rom and also install the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.010 
my rom stock rom and also install the
new<00:02:01.079> rom<00:02:01.460> fresh<00:02:02.460> install<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.180> me<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.719> let's<00:02:03.899> go

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
new rom fresh install for me so let's go

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.749 
new rom fresh install for me so let's go
ahead<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.259> try<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.469> reboot<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.070> install<00:02:05.399> hit

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
ahead and try it reboot and install hit

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.260 
ahead and try it reboot and install hit
OK<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.710> may<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.310> super<00:02:08.670> user<00:02:08.819> request

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
OK and you may a super user request

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.910 
OK and you may a super user request
might<00:02:09.509> pop<00:02:09.690> up<00:02:09.720> makes<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> hit<00:02:10.410> grant<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:11.310> okay

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
might pop up makes you hit grant or okay

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.400 
might pop up makes you hit grant or okay
and<00:02:12.210> hopefully<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.600> will<00:02:13.810> work<00:02:14.080> out<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.350> the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and hopefully it will work out of the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.520 
and hopefully it will work out of the
box<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.920> should<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.580> sometimes<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:17.140> method

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
box it should but sometimes this method

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.930 
box it should but sometimes this method
breaks<00:02:17.830> then<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.190> have<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.430> do<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.610> manually

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
breaks then you have to do it manually

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.000 
breaks then you have to do it manually
anyways<00:02:19.360> but<00:02:19.959> hopefully<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.590> time<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.920> will

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
anyways but hopefully this time it will

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.080 
anyways but hopefully this time it will
do<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.250> automatically<00:02:21.910> yes<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.200> worked

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
do it automatically yes it worked

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.309 
do it automatically yes it worked
sometimes<00:02:25.090> if<00:02:25.300> breaks<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:25.990> have<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.200> go

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
sometimes if breaks and you have to go

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.010 
sometimes if breaks and you have to go
in<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.770> do<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:26.980> manually<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.810> way<00:02:28.959> you

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
in and do it manually but this way you

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.590 
in and do it manually but this way you
can<00:02:29.320> let<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.280> do<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.970> can<00:02:31.120> go<00:02:31.300> have

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
can let it do it and you can go have

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.460 
can let it do it and you can go have
some<00:02:31.810> coffee

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
some coffee

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.580 
some coffee
have<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> smoke<00:02:33.610> or<00:02:33.880> something<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:35.380> know<00:02:35.470> all

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
have a smoke or something you know all

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.100 
have a smoke or something you know all
that<00:02:35.740> good<00:02:35.890> stuff<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.940> will<00:02:37.360> be<00:02:37.480> back<00:02:37.750> I'll

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
that good stuff so I will be back I'll

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:47.970 
that good stuff so I will be back I'll
actually<00:02:38.380> just<00:02:38.590> fast<00:02:38.920> forward<00:02:39.280> this

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.830 

all<00:02:48.980> right<00:02:49.220> as<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.490> can<00:02:49.610> see<00:02:49.790> backup<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.390> done

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
all right as you can see backup is done

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.350 
all right as you can see backup is done
its<00:02:51.230> formatting<00:02:51.860> data<00:02:52.160> now<00:02:52.610> installing<00:02:53.270> in

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
its formatting data now installing in

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.590 
its formatting data now installing in
ROM<00:02:53.600> arm<00:02:54.220> some<00:02:55.220> roms<00:02:55.459> have<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.700> Roma<00:02:56.060> graphical

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
ROM arm some roms have a Roma graphical

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.330 
ROM arm some roms have a Roma graphical
installer<00:02:56.959> like<00:02:57.319> this<00:02:57.560> one<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.190> actually

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
installer like this one so it's actually

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.910 
installer like this one so it's actually
not<00:02:58.610> fully<00:02:58.880> automatically<00:02:59.590> automatic<00:03:00.590> so<00:03:00.860> I'm

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
not fully automatically automatic so I'm

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.050 
not fully automatically automatic so I'm
going<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.100> just<00:03:01.250> go<00:03:01.430> ahead<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.700> go<00:03:01.790> through

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
going to just go ahead and go through

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.170 
going to just go ahead and go through
here<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.690> choose<00:03:03.470> my<00:03:03.620> options<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.489> install

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
here and choose my options and install

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.170 
here and choose my options and install
the<00:03:05.690> rom<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.650> also<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.610> removing<00:03:07.910> solar

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
the rom and also the removing solar

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.240 
the rom and also the removing solar
actually<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:09.260> do<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:10.480> full<00:03:11.480> wipe<00:03:11.660> data<00:03:11.930> part

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
actually can do a full wipe data part

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.860 
actually can do a full wipe data part
partition<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.489> I'm<00:03:13.760> doing<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.270> again<00:03:14.540> here<00:03:14.780> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
partition so I'm doing it again here it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.650 
partition so I'm doing it again here it
doesn't<00:03:15.140> really<00:03:15.230> matter<00:03:15.500> if<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:15.860> do<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.069> again

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
doesn't really matter if you do it again

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.400 
doesn't really matter if you do it again
some<00:03:17.660> options<00:03:18.170> here<00:03:18.290> for<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.950> apps<00:03:20.410> alright

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410

some options here for the apps alright
let<00:03:22.130> me<00:03:22.160> go<00:03:22.310> ahead<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.610> install<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.269> and

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
let me go ahead and install it and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.120 
let me go ahead and install it and
actually<00:03:24.680> try<00:03:24.860> this<00:03:24.920> five<00:03:25.340> camera<00:03:26.060> here<00:03:26.600> and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
actually try this five camera here and

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
let me go ahead and just install this

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.270 
let me go ahead and just install this
I've<00:03:29.870> actually<00:03:30.140> install<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.650> ROM<00:03:30.739> before<00:03:31.220> um

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
I've actually install this ROM before um

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.000 
I've actually install this ROM before um
all<00:03:34.280> right<00:03:34.459> there<00:03:34.850> we<00:03:35.030> go<00:03:35.739> some<00:03:36.739> more<00:03:36.860> options

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
all right there we go some more options

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.610 
all right there we go some more options
right<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:38.930> going<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.140> install<00:03:39.350> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
right so it's going to install the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.590 
right so it's going to install the
EEPROM<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.310> rest<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.239> should<00:03:41.510> be

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
EEPROM and rest of this should be

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.800 
EEPROM and rest of this should be
automatic<00:03:42.550> if<00:03:43.550> it<00:03:43.730> does<00:03:43.940> not<00:03:44.090> have<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.360> Roma

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
automatic if it does not have a Roma

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.570 
automatic if it does not have a Roma
installer<00:03:45.110> then<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.680> will<00:03:45.800> install<00:03:46.370> it

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
installer then it will install it

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.400 
installer then it will install it
everything<00:03:47.090> for<00:03:47.300> you<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.930> also<00:03:48.140> if<00:03:48.290> you're

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
everything for you and also if you're

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.979 
everything for you and also if you're
installing<00:03:48.680> AOSP<00:03:49.310> roms<00:03:49.700> arm<00:03:50.120> you'll<00:03:50.810> have

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
installing AOSP roms arm you'll have

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.120 
installing AOSP roms arm you'll have
additional<00:03:51.560> files

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
additional files

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.130 
additional files
I<00:03:52.160> believe<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.820> ROM<00:03:53.030> manager<00:03:53.420> actually<00:03:53.570> know

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
I believe the ROM manager actually know

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.720 
I believe the ROM manager actually know
you<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.440> get<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> pro<00:03:54.829> version<00:03:54.860> to

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
you have to get the pro version to

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.240 
you have to get the pro version to
install<00:03:55.970> multiple<00:03:56.329> files<00:03:56.860> there's<00:03:57.860> actually

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
install multiple files there's actually

you know set it and forget it
I'll<00:04:12.620> be<00:04:12.739> back<00:04:12.890> then<00:04:13.100> this<00:04:13.250> is<00:04:13.720> doing

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.629 

and<00:04:17.910> it's<00:04:18.120> almost<00:04:18.329> done<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.410> when<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.220> reboots

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
and it's almost done and when it reboots

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.120 
and it's almost done and when it reboots
I<00:04:20.910> should<00:04:21.180> have<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.690> backed-up<00:04:22.229> rom<00:04:22.740> and

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
I should have a backed-up rom and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.460 
I should have a backed-up rom and
install<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.819> new<00:04:24.000> rom<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.930> makes<00:04:25.139> it<00:04:25.319> easy

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
install the new rom that makes it easy

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.469 
install the new rom that makes it easy
now<00:04:25.919> sometimes<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.789> know<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:26.940> do<00:04:27.150> end<00:04:27.300> up<00:04:27.360> in

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
now sometimes you know you do end up in

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.409 
now sometimes you know you do end up in
a<00:04:27.539> boot<00:04:27.720> loop<00:04:27.870> then<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.259> do<00:04:28.500> have<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.830> go<00:04:29.039> into

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
a boot loop then you do have to go into

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.719 
a boot loop then you do have to go into
karma<00:04:30.419> recovery<00:04:30.990> manually<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.770> what<00:04:32.699> I

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
karma recovery manually and what I

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.960 
karma recovery manually and what I
usually<00:04:33.150> recommend<00:04:34.550> what<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.580> usually

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
usually recommend what I usually

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.200 
usually recommend what I usually
recommend<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.630> do<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.229> actually<00:04:37.849> go<00:04:38.849> back<00:04:39.030> into

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
recommend to do is actually go back into

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.990 
recommend to do is actually go back into
manually<00:04:39.720> format<00:04:40.050> system<00:04:40.800> partition<00:04:41.190> that's

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
manually format system partition that's

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.300 
manually format system partition that's
different<00:04:42.360> from<00:04:42.660> regular<00:04:43.130> factory<00:04:44.130> reset

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
different from regular factory reset

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.640 
different from regular factory reset
that<00:04:44.849> will<00:04:45.030> actually<00:04:45.210> format<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.289> system

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
that will actually format the system

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.740 
that will actually format the system
partition<00:04:46.800> which<00:04:47.669> gets<00:04:47.970> corrupted<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.599> which

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
partition which gets corrupted and which

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.499 
partition which gets corrupted and which
causes<00:04:49.199> boot<00:04:49.410> loops<00:04:49.669> but<00:04:50.669> now<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:50.940> can<00:04:51.240> see

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
causes boot loops but now you can see

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.510 
causes boot loops but now you can see
that<00:04:51.690> I've<00:04:51.840> installed<00:04:52.139> a<00:04:52.500> new<00:04:52.650> rom<00:04:52.919> backed<00:04:53.340> up

I<00:04:57.690> don't<00:04:57.810> show<00:04:58.349> you<00:04:58.409> how<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.680> do<00:04:58.919> this<00:04:59.069> in<00:04:59.310> my<00:04:59.810> my

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
I don't show you how to do this in my my

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.110 
I don't show you how to do this in my my
tutorials<00:05:01.500> is<00:05:01.650> because<00:05:02.039> you<00:05:02.580> know<00:05:02.669> sometimes

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
tutorials is because you know sometimes

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.610 
tutorials is because you know sometimes
it<00:05:03.300> breaks<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:03.810> if<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.050> breaks<00:05:04.289> then<00:05:04.500> it

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
it breaks and if it breaks then it

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.559 
it breaks and if it breaks then it
causes<00:05:05.009> more<00:05:05.159> headaches<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.970> also<00:05:06.210> it's<00:05:06.330> good

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
causes more headaches and also it's good

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.809 
causes more headaches and also it's good
to<00:05:06.720> know<00:05:06.840> how<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.050> do<00:05:07.259> it<00:05:07.349> manually<00:05:07.710> then<00:05:08.460> you

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
to know how to do it manually then you

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.490 
to know how to do it manually then you
know<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.000> have<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.270> backup<00:05:09.569> method<00:05:10.139> if<00:05:10.259> this

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
know you have a backup method if this

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.110 
know you have a backup method if this
thing<00:05:10.710> breaks<00:05:10.949> then<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:11.669> know<00:05:11.789> you<00:05:11.849> know<00:05:12.030> how

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
thing breaks then you know you know how

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.240 
thing breaks then you know you know how
to<00:05:12.210> deal<00:05:12.840> with<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:13.199> but<00:05:13.590> if<00:05:13.710> you<00:05:13.800> don't<00:05:14.039> think

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
to deal with it but if you don't think

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.710 
to deal with it but if you don't think
you're<00:05:14.340> gonna<00:05:14.430> have<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.699> relearn<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.419> just

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
you're gonna have to relearn it it just

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.540 
you're gonna have to relearn it it just
makes<00:05:15.870> everything<00:05:16.139> complicated<00:05:16.380> that's<00:05:17.280> why

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
makes everything complicated that's why

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.460 
makes everything complicated that's why
my<00:05:18.090> tutorials<00:05:18.599> have<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.870> but<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.199> can<00:05:19.380> go

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
my tutorials have it but you can go

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.080 
my tutorials have it but you can go
ahead<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:19.740> use<00:05:19.889> rom<00:05:20.130> manager<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.729> automate

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090

ahead and use rom manager to automate
your<00:05:21.120> processes<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.409> know<00:05:22.530> install<00:05:23.539> you

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
your processes and you know install you

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.480 
your processes and you know install you

different phones if you want to and let

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.240 
different phones if you want to and let
me<00:05:30.570> give<00:05:30.719> it<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.870> second<00:05:31.229> here<00:05:31.259> let's<00:05:31.979> see<00:05:32.130> if<00:05:32.190> we

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
me give it a second here let's see if we

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.170 
me give it a second here let's see if we
can<00:05:32.370> get<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.639> to<00:05:32.849> boot<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:34.830> we<00:05:35.699> should<00:05:35.880> be<00:05:35.969> done

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
can get it to boot and we should be done

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.540 
can get it to boot and we should be done
and<00:05:36.419> that's<00:05:36.539> how<00:05:36.719> you<00:05:36.810> can<00:05:36.990> install<00:05:37.289> run<00:05:37.979> up<00:05:38.219> a

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
and that's how you can install run up a

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.390 
and that's how you can install run up a
new<00:05:39.120> customer<00:05:39.479> I'm<00:05:39.780> using<00:05:39.990> rom<00:05:40.320> manager
