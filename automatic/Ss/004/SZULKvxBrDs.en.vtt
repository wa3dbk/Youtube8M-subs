the<00:02:19.500> front<00:02:19.770> because<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.250> kind<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.520> gives<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the front because it kind of gives a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.510 
the front because it kind of gives a
little<00:02:21.000> extra<00:02:21.390> sexiness<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> shoe<00:02:22.650> so

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
little extra sexiness to the shoe so

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.850
