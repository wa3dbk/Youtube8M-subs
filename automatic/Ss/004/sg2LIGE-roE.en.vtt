00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.170
 cap is very small I have for the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.000
 older than them it looks small because 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 we are far away when you 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.070
 near you will see it absolutely huge 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.070
 clear as my mom's compotes 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.310

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.360
 we will feel 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.479
 and look at that sea air 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.580
 if it's very different from the city almost 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.909
 true family good let's see what the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.520
 city â€‹â€‹offers us what we do first 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.680
 we could swim or sail or fish 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.369

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.540
 art and do some shopping 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.610
 but we're going to need a lot of energy 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.860
 for that, so we better look for something 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.020

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.950

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.420

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.860
 eat it here where it's cool to 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.630
