with many of these researchers tell us
more<00:01:08.920> about<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:09.280> work<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.490> they're<00:01:09.759> doing

more about this work that they're doing
well<00:01:10.300> certainly<00:01:10.570> this<00:01:11.020> all<00:01:11.200> started<00:01:11.650> back<00:01:12.070> in

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
well certainly this all started back in

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.480 
well certainly this all started back in
the<00:01:12.250> 70s<00:01:12.360> when<00:01:13.360> Russian<00:01:14.110> scientists<00:01:15.009> decided

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
the 70s when Russian scientists decided

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.400 
the 70s when Russian scientists decided
they<00:01:15.580> wanted<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.060> drill<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.570> do<00:01:16.690> global

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
they wanted to drill and do global

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.070 
they wanted to drill and do global
warming<00:01:17.890> core<00:01:18.100> samples<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.729> kind<00:01:18.910> of<00:01:19.030> test<00:01:19.960> the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
warming core samples to kind of test the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.700 
warming core samples to kind of test the
glacier<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.680> see<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:22.630> if<00:01:22.900> they<00:01:23.080> could<00:01:23.229> kind

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
glacier and see how if they could kind

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.650 
glacier and see how if they could kind
of<00:01:23.800> reimagine<00:01:24.040> how<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.460> earth<00:01:24.700> changed<00:01:25.360> in

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
of reimagine how the earth changed in

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.749 
of reimagine how the earth changed in
years<00:01:25.869> past<00:01:26.110> through<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.470> layers<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:26.920> ice<00:01:27.190> but

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
years past through the layers of ice but

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.180 
years past through the layers of ice but
then<00:01:27.910> they<00:01:28.000> discovered<00:01:28.479> that<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:29.200> ice<00:01:29.350> itself

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
then they discovered that the ice itself

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.650 
then they discovered that the ice itself
changed<00:01:30.729> meaning<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.149> there<00:01:31.300> was<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.450> lake

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
changed meaning that there was a lake

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.270 
changed meaning that there was a lake
down<00:01:31.899> there<00:01:32.110> they<00:01:32.530> said<00:01:32.740> wait<00:01:32.920> if<00:01:33.040> there's<00:01:33.190> a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
down there they said wait if there's a

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.249 
down there they said wait if there's a
lake<00:01:33.430> down<00:01:33.610> there<00:01:33.820> then<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.720> must<00:01:35.020> mean<00:01:35.110> that

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
lake down there then that must mean that

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.260 
lake down there then that must mean that
when<00:01:35.979> we<00:01:36.070> say<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.310> lake<00:01:36.640> are<00:01:36.790> we<00:01:36.880> talking<00:01:37.240> like

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
when we say a lake are we talking like

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.060 
when we say a lake are we talking like
actual<00:01:37.869> liquid<00:01:38.050> water<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.590> actual<00:01:38.890> liquid

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
actual liquid water the actual liquid

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.059 
actual liquid water the actual liquid
water<00:01:39.580> underneath<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.660> glacial<00:01:41.410> ice<00:01:41.590> so

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
water underneath the the glacial ice so

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.430 
water underneath the the glacial ice so
they<00:01:42.640> then<00:01:43.210> started<00:01:43.690> hey<00:01:43.990> we're<00:01:44.140> going<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.289> go

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
they then started hey we're going to go

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.719 
they then started hey we're going to go
and<00:01:44.530> see<00:01:44.679> if<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:44.770> can<00:01:44.950> actually<00:01:45.039> find<00:01:45.490> some

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
and see if we can actually find some

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.540 
and see if we can actually find some
water<00:01:45.940> they<00:01:46.119> did<00:01:46.270> some<00:01:46.710> sonic<00:01:47.710> research<00:01:48.250> and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
water they did some sonic research and

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.040 
water they did some sonic research and
said<00:01:48.880> yeah<00:01:49.090> there<00:01:49.300> is<00:01:49.390> liquid<00:01:49.690> water<00:01:49.720> down

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
said yeah there is liquid water down

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.570 
said yeah there is liquid water down
there<00:01:50.200> it's<00:01:50.319> thermally<00:01:50.890> heated<00:01:51.160> from<00:01:51.369> down

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
there it's thermally heated from down

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.460 
there it's thermally heated from down
below<00:01:51.850> if<00:01:52.060> that's<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.869> case<00:01:53.080> then<00:01:53.350> there

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
below if that's the case then there

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.410 
below if that's the case then there
might<00:01:53.590> be<00:01:53.649> life<00:01:54.009> if<00:01:54.280> there's<00:01:54.490> heat<00:01:54.729> then<00:01:55.300> there

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
might be life if there's heat then there

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.600 
might be life if there's heat then there
could<00:01:55.539> be<00:01:55.600> life<00:01:55.810> down<00:01:56.020> there<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.679> they<00:01:56.860> decided

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
could be life down there so they decided

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.070 
could be life down there so they decided
to<00:01:57.729> go<00:01:57.940> for<00:01:58.149> it<00:01:58.270> then<00:01:58.539> they<00:01:58.690> got<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.959> this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
to go for it then they got to this

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.930 
to go for it then they got to this
position<00:01:59.289> where<00:01:59.649> they<00:01:59.740> said<00:01:59.950> hey<00:02:00.160> guess<00:02:00.729> what

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
position where they said hey guess what

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.850 
position where they said hey guess what
we<00:02:01.600> can<00:02:01.810> actually<00:02:02.110> break<00:02:02.229> through<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.619> find

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
we can actually break through and find

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.559 
we can actually break through and find
out<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.220> then<00:02:03.340> there<00:02:03.429> was<00:02:03.550> an<00:02:03.789> ethical<00:02:04.090> debate

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
out and then there was an ethical debate

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.010 
out and then there was an ethical debate
do<00:02:04.869> we<00:02:05.020> introduce<00:02:05.530> this<00:02:06.190> atmosphere<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.600> this

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
do we introduce this atmosphere to this

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.840 
do we introduce this atmosphere to this
untouched<00:02:08.740> pristine<00:02:09.160> environment<00:02:09.640> which

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
untouched pristine environment which

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.980 
untouched pristine environment which
hasn't<00:02:10.030> been<00:02:10.270> touched<00:02:10.420> for<00:02:10.630> billions<00:02:10.929> of

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
hasn't been touched for billions of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.230 
hasn't been touched for billions of
years<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.440> they<00:02:12.430> were<00:02:12.490> really<00:02:12.819> excited<00:02:12.910> about

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
years and they were really excited about

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.590 
years and they were really excited about
the<00:02:13.390> prospect<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.380> finding<00:02:14.650> new<00:02:14.680> life<00:02:14.920> because

the prospect of finding new life because

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.630 
the prospect of finding new life because
if<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.290> microcosm<00:02:17.890> environment

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
if you have this microcosm environment

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.050 
if you have this microcosm environment
it<00:02:18.760> could<00:02:19.300> lead<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.470> some<00:02:20.920> discoveries<00:02:21.459> into

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
it could lead to some discoveries into

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.059 
it could lead to some discoveries into
how<00:02:22.180> we<00:02:22.240> evolved<00:02:22.870> or<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.319> could<00:02:23.530> lead<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.709> some

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
how we evolved or it could lead to some

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.949 
how we evolved or it could lead to some
medical<00:02:24.520> discoveries<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.209> well<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.630> very

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
medical discoveries as well so a very

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.260 
medical discoveries as well so a very
intense<00:02:26.800> research<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.760> then<00:02:27.849> finally<00:02:28.120> they

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
intense research and then finally they

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.140 
intense research and then finally they
broke<00:02:28.450> through<00:02:28.660> last<00:02:28.959> year<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.440> now<00:02:30.150> they're

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
broke through last year and now they're

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.280 
broke through last year and now they're
still<00:02:31.420> doing<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.630> research<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.900> find<00:02:32.080> out

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
still doing the research to find out

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.320 
still doing the research to find out
exactly<00:02:32.620> what<00:02:32.830> type<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.069> life<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:34.240> know

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
exactly what type of life it is you know

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.030 
exactly what type of life it is you know
not<00:02:34.540> much<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.990> information<00:02:35.170> has<00:02:35.620> become

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
not much of information has become

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.280 
not much of information has become
available<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.580> us<00:02:36.730> but<00:02:37.150> very<00:02:37.599> exciting<00:02:38.080> find

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
available to us but very exciting find

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.960 
available to us but very exciting find
that's<00:02:38.500> for<00:02:38.680> sure<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.459> end<00:02:39.490> it

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
that's for sure and so in the end it

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.699 
that's for sure and so in the end it
appears<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:40.690> took<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.319> risk<00:02:41.530> to

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
appears that they took the risk to

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.339 
appears that they took the risk to
actually<00:02:42.280> invade<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.270> space<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:44.019> order<00:02:44.200> to

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
actually invade that space in order to

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.589 
actually invade that space in order to
it<00:02:45.189> was<00:02:45.489> worth<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.849> see<00:02:46.000> what<00:02:46.120> was<00:02:46.269> down<00:02:46.390> there

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
it was worth to see what was down there

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.910 
it was worth to see what was down there
indeed<00:02:46.989> in<00:02:47.110> fact<00:02:47.170> there<00:02:47.470> were<00:02:47.530> some<00:02:47.560> people

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
indeed in fact there were some people

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.010 
indeed in fact there were some people
who<00:02:48.069> were<00:02:48.340> saying<00:02:48.880> we<00:02:49.030> shouldn't<00:02:49.270> we

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
who were saying we shouldn't we

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.110 
who were saying we shouldn't we
shouldn't<00:02:50.050> break<00:02:50.650> through<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.520> final

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
shouldn't break through this this final

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.250 
shouldn't break through this this final
barrier<00:02:52.450> because<00:02:52.750> what<00:02:52.990> if<00:02:53.080> there's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
barrier because what if there's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.240 
barrier because what if there's
something<00:02:53.410> down<00:02:53.590> there<00:02:53.770> that's<00:02:53.890> harmful<00:02:54.130> to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
something down there that's harmful to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.540 
something down there that's harmful to
us<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.760> we<00:02:55.319> open<00:02:56.319> Pandora's<00:02:56.680> box<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.370> will

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
us and we open Pandora's box if you will

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.490 
us and we open Pandora's box if you will
but<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.970> was<00:02:58.510> not<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.810> case<00:02:58.959> they<00:02:59.200> did<00:02:59.380> break

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
but that was not the case they did break

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.809 
but that was not the case they did break
through<00:02:59.680> there<00:02:59.800> are<00:02:59.920> also<00:03:00.100> concerns<00:03:00.640> about

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
through there are also concerns about

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.610 
through there are also concerns about
contaminating<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.840> lake<00:03:02.050> as<00:03:02.230> well<00:03:02.380> because

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
contaminating this lake as well because

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.040 
contaminating this lake as well because
they<00:03:02.740> had<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:02.920> use<00:03:03.069> this<00:03:03.660> lubricant<00:03:04.660> this

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
they had to use this lubricant this

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.220 
they had to use this lubricant this
mixture<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.560> oil<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.160> alcohol<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:07.780> some<00:03:08.140> of

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
mixture of oil and alcohol that some of

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.360 
mixture of oil and alcohol that some of
that<00:03:08.320> will<00:03:08.470> eventually<00:03:08.770> get<00:03:08.890> down<00:03:08.950> into<00:03:09.190> this

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
that will eventually get down into this

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.410 
that will eventually get down into this
lake<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.760> they<00:03:09.820> were<00:03:09.880> like<00:03:10.030> why<00:03:10.180> would<00:03:10.390> we

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
lake and they were like why would we

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.180 
lake and they were like why would we
want<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.840> damage<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.350> pristine<00:03:11.680> environment

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
want to damage this pristine environment

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.850 
want to damage this pristine environment
but<00:03:12.790> they<00:03:12.910> determined<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.860> benefits

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
but they determined that the benefits

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.680 
but they determined that the benefits
outweighed<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.310> risks<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.850> now<00:03:16.090> we<00:03:16.150> have

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
outweighed the risks and now we have

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.140 
outweighed the risks and now we have
this<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.800> new<00:03:17.980> discovery<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.670> speak<00:03:18.940> and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
this this new discovery so to speak and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.000 
this this new discovery so to speak and
speaking<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.720> risks<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:20.320> is<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.470> place<00:03:20.709> in<00:03:20.860> one

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
speaking of risks this is a place in one

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.220 
speaking of risks this is a place in one
of<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.160> most<00:03:21.340> remote<00:03:21.730> places<00:03:22.150> on<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:23.080> planet

and<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.400> do<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.520> lot<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:24.970> preparation

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.660 
and you have to do a lot of preparation
to<00:03:25.600> actually<00:03:26.019> even<00:03:26.140> go<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.920> this<00:03:27.130> place<00:03:27.430> tell
