labels because I've replaced the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.450 
labels because I've replaced the
digitizer<00:04:51.669> and<00:04:51.819> the<00:04:52.180> LCD<00:04:52.689> so<00:04:53.590> I'm<00:04:54.129> going<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.310> go

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
digitizer and the LCD so I'm going to go

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.399 
digitizer and the LCD so I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:54.789> put<00:04:55.689> that<00:04:55.719> back<00:04:56.110> down<00:04:56.319> in<00:04:56.680> there

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
which means i have a loose cable but

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.589 
which means i have a loose cable but
that's<00:06:29.110> okay<00:06:29.699> everything's<00:06:30.699> still<00:06:30.879> fine<00:06:30.939> i'm

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
that's okay everything's still fine i'm

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.959 
that's okay everything's still fine i'm
just<00:06:31.659> going<00:06:32.110> to<00:06:32.169> go<00:06:32.379> ahead<00:06:32.620> and<00:06:32.740> keep<00:06:33.639> working

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:33.969 
just going to go ahead and keep working

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.149 
just going to go ahead and keep working
on<00:06:34.089> it<00:06:34.209> we<00:06:35.110> in<00:06:35.349> the<00:06:35.560> home<00:06:35.709> button<00:06:35.919> isn't

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
on it we in the home button isn't

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:37.920 
on it we in the home button isn't
activating<00:06:36.610> it<00:06:36.729> so<00:06:36.909> i<00:06:37.180> probably<00:06:37.389> just<00:06:37.659> slipped

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
activating it so i probably just slipped

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.410 
activating it so i probably just slipped
it<00:06:38.020> in<00:06:38.110> there

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
it in there

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.120 
it in there
way<00:06:38.480> that's<00:06:38.720> why<00:06:38.840> I'm<00:06:38.960> getting<00:06:39.170> difficulty

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
way that's why I'm getting difficulty

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.130 
way that's why I'm getting difficulty
putting<00:06:40.310> it<00:06:40.460> in<00:06:40.580> but<00:06:41.210> basically<00:06:41.420> that's<00:06:41.960> how

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
putting it in but basically that's how

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.820 
putting it in but basically that's how
you<00:06:42.230> do<00:06:42.410> it<00:06:42.440> it's<00:06:43.190> not<00:06:43.400> difficult<00:06:43.670> at<00:06:44.000> all<00:06:44.150> um

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
you do it it's not difficult at all um

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.670 
you do it it's not difficult at all um
it<00:06:45.830> takes<00:06:46.100> I<00:06:46.340> did<00:06:46.940> this<00:06:47.060> video<00:06:47.360> in<00:06:47.660> I<00:06:48.140> probably

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
it takes I did this video in I probably

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.650 
it takes I did this video in I probably
did<00:06:48.890> all<00:06:49.010> this<00:06:49.160> work<00:06:49.370> in<00:06:49.670> 15<00:06:49.910> minutes<00:06:50.390> the
