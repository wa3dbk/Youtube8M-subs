put together and whatever ideas you're

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.740 
put together and whatever ideas you're
entertaining<00:01:12.500> start<00:01:13.369> with<00:01:13.580> force<00:01:13.939> that<00:01:14.450> is

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
entertaining start with force that is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.609 
entertaining start with force that is
the<00:01:15.259> edge<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.649> each<00:01:15.979> defense<00:01:17.259> so<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.289> don't<00:01:18.470> want

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
the edge of each defense so I don't want

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.350 
the edge of each defense so I don't want
to<00:01:18.680> minimize<00:01:19.039> up<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.549> middle<00:01:19.700> because<00:01:19.970> that's

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
to minimize up the middle because that's

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.620 
to minimize up the middle because that's
next<00:01:20.899> but<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:21.380> begins<00:01:21.710> for<00:01:22.100> us<00:01:22.220> with<00:01:22.430> force<00:01:22.789> who

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
next but it begins for us with force who

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.810 
next but it begins for us with force who
has<00:01:23.840> force<00:01:24.229> what's<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.159> position<00:01:25.369> like

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
has force what's the position like

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.960 
has force what's the position like
physically<00:01:26.420> what<00:01:27.289> where<00:01:27.649> are<00:01:28.039> his<00:01:28.250> eyes<00:01:28.580> where

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
physically what where are his eyes where

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.639 
physically what where are his eyes where
is<00:01:29.179> he<00:01:29.330> aligned<00:01:29.720> that<00:01:29.990> are<00:01:30.140> we<00:01:30.259> give<00:01:30.439> them<00:01:30.500> an

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
is he aligned that are we give them an

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.010 
is he aligned that are we give them an
opportunity<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.580> win<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:32.119> individual<00:01:32.810> match

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
opportunity to win that individual match

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.210 
opportunity to win that individual match
up<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.440> create<00:01:34.039> force<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.810> then<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.710> can<00:01:36.920> jump

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
up to create force and then you can jump

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.279 
up to create force and then you can jump
and<00:01:37.460> bounce<00:01:37.640> all<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.060> way<00:01:38.240> inside<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
and bounce all the way inside to the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.309 
and bounce all the way inside to the
middle<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.220> if<00:01:40.399> you<00:01:40.549> have<00:01:40.759> force<00:01:41.240> on<00:01:41.569> each<00:01:41.929> side

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
middle so if you have force on each side

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.240 
middle so if you have force on each side
and<00:01:42.679> up<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.520> middle<00:01:43.549> defense<00:01:44.209> related<00:01:44.720> to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
and up the middle defense related to

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.249 
and up the middle defense related to
those<00:01:46.250> Mike<00:01:47.470> no<00:01:48.470> middle<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.920> field<00:01:49.159> safety
