00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.949
 this sense of life 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.350
 Many people question the meaning of life 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.870
 they look for an explanation to everything that happens 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.699
 to the palabara 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.529
 day 2 because God for emits 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.440
 that the reality of AIDS such 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.849
 which 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.300
 the reality is that gods 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.109
 the synthesis 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.179
 of the populis all 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.019
 we are in a world of opposites 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.499
 there is good and there is no evil 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.530
 there is pleasure and there is the golden idol 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.530
 there is high also what low 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.270
 the small 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.340
 love hate and so on 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.050
 i are energy 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.300
 that we are within physical matter 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.370
 going through that experience 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.500
 to the extent that we are incorporating the Lebanese experiences 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.150
 we go 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.290
 segal 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.980
 to close 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.280
 circles each circle that is bouquets 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.509
 every karama that we go through or that we live 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:09.620
 each stage 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.230
 concluded makes us 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.360
 will vibrate in a state more pee not 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.270
 in short gods the tension 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.900
 in state d 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.350
 repose 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.670
 the person on a level 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.810
 low return 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.540
 they get bored that is the natural state 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.420
 and look for stimuli to be 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.970
 have fun to get free 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.410
 on a higher plane 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.010
 and to the extent that the person is gaining in depth to 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.010
 Saba leaving boredom and is connecting 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.200
 with emotional states or feelings 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.330
 deeper 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.420
 the tension in rest state 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.549
 Syria equivalent to what is called the state of grace 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.620
 peace the fullness 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.430
 that is achieved when one 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.340
 will go to that inner harmony of pruning 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.289
 complete like this without the need of the others 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.109
 there is definitely an internal world 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.209
 what is the world itself and there is a world to be not what is 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.569
 others alone others as we go 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.559
 achieving 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.280
 deepen our inner world 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.040
 the world will be starting to take that 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.959
 obviously this is achieved over many envies 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.989
 an analogy could be the water 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.989
 the water goes from this fair or when the sky 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.799
 the energy in a low vibrational state are those people who get bored 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.739
 they do not know what to do with their lives many times 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.929
 and that ultimately 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.799
 they are accumulating experience 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.629
 later, as the person goes through different experiences 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.839
 start to feel 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.969
 a vibration more gold 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.149
 and it connects with your inner being 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.730
 p then the water is would be lukewarm 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.680
 and finally the transcendence is when the water 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.850
 the embat gold becomes 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.429
 it is in another plane 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.399
 we are in a third dimension 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:28.239
 sendo makes a fourth dimension in fact the blind to people who 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.079
 they have 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.680
 some kind of connection 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.129
 it will arrive 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.129
 to that state of being in the fourth dimension 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.399
 and that is why they can have a wider division 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:41.249
 of the 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.749
 reality to 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:47.749
 So in the end, the experiences that we see 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.490
 as negatives that of course to the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.189
 we suffer class we suffer 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.799
 and no person wants to go through the pain 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.039
 are necessary make up nature 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:04.159
 from the world of the universe 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.760
 without suffering there is no evolution evolution has gavara with the process 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.269
 to leave the activity of sia in which naturally 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.689
 we would be immobilized if there was not 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:23.789
 different will try to approach micas that we have to go through in short 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.219
 when we achieve harmonize 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.190
 our nature of opposites within our 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.729
 is when we can transcend 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.310
 and a higher consciousness plane will be made 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.360
 and more gold 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.009
 where are we going to feel a fullness 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.710
 unykach maybe does not pay us to arms interest 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.699
 everything that has to do with the other renal art and music also the 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.530
 sexuality in a plane 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.730
 high vibratory 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.960
 meditation is too much for him 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.190
 otto to activities that do not 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.229
 they are connecting with ourselves 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.080
 they do not go 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.410
 for emitting 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.260
 and accessing that world to which we will finally access when finally 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.559
 let's go through all the tests that we have to go through 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.880
 so it's a mistake to think that god is may not 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.830
 why God 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.199
 all gods embrace the synthesis of everything 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.330
 and God is both the best and the most evil 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.159
 that can be lived 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.400
 even though gods good 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.909
 and that the bad guy is the devil 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.060
 simple definitions man 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.909
 in his journey on the road he has to cross in chorus for 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.990
 all states and there is nothing that is out of God 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.370
 definitely 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.300
 the universe is one only 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.740
 and we can ep / ones individually separated 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.869
 of the universe but as we evolve we live watching 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.720
 the universe in a more integrated plane more objective and superior we give ourselves 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:03.699
 account 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.270
 that we are only 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.560
 for this one of a whole 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.330
 nothing is casual 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.460
 and everything that we live 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.430
 it has a meaning
