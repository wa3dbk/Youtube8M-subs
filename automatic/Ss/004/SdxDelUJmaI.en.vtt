00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.070 

all<00:00:02.370> right<00:00:02.610> what<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.419> found<00:00:03.659> very<00:00:03.810> interesting

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
all right what I found very interesting

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.770 
all right what I found very interesting
is<00:00:04.740> first<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.580> all<00:00:07.340> when<00:00:08.340> we<00:00:08.370> say<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.210> 31

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
is first of all when we say the 31

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.030 
is first of all when we say the 31
divided<00:00:10.559> by<00:00:10.710> 2

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
divided by 2

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.890 
divided by 2
it's<00:00:11.730> kind<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> hard<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> picture<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.719> isn't

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
it's kind of hard to picture that isn't

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.829 
it's kind of hard to picture that isn't
it<00:00:13.110> but<00:00:13.980> if<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.160> said<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.630> what<00:00:15.630> if<00:00:15.719> you

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
it but if I said to you what if you

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.529 
it but if I said to you what if you
thought<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.440> way<00:00:16.650> 31<00:00:17.279> divided<00:00:18.270> evenly

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
thought of it this way 31 divided evenly

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.170 
thought of it this way 31 divided evenly
into<00:00:18.810> two<00:00:19.109> groups<00:00:19.490> can<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.580> start<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.970> picture

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
into two groups can you start to picture

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.150 
into two groups can you start to picture
that<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> little<00:00:21.750> bit<00:00:21.869> divided<00:00:22.740> evenly<00:00:23.010> into

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that a little bit divided evenly into

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.179 
that a little bit divided evenly into
two<00:00:23.369> groups<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:24.630> these<00:00:25.260> are<00:00:25.500> place<00:00:25.740> value

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
two groups so these are place value

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.490 
two groups so these are place value
discs<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.300> has<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> value<00:00:27.750> each<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.380> these

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
discs so this has a value each of these

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.339 
discs so this has a value each of these
has<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> value<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.720> in<00:00:30.720> each<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.019> these<00:00:31.140> has

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
has a value of one in each of these has

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.650 
has a value of one in each of these has
a<00:00:31.380> value<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> ask<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
a value of one I'm going to ask you to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.709 
a value of one I'm going to ask you to
help<00:00:33.809> me<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> our<00:00:36.300> dividend

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
help me so what what is our dividend

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.730 
help me so what what is our dividend
what<00:00:36.840> are<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.050> dividing

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.140 

31

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
31

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.180 
31
into<00:00:44.930> how<00:00:45.170> many<00:00:45.230> equal<00:00:45.740> groups<00:00:47.950> so<00:00:48.950> watch<00:00:49.160> it

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
into how many equal groups so watch it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.410 
into how many equal groups so watch it
we're<00:00:49.400> going<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:49.580> do

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.450 

now<00:00:56.899> what<00:00:57.200> I<00:00:57.230> noticed<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.829> did<00:00:57.980> if<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:58.280> don't

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
now what I noticed you did if you don't

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.520 
now what I noticed you did if you don't
mind<00:00:58.610> over<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.970> race<00:00:59.120> you're<00:00:59.270> great<00:00:59.630> we<00:01:00.290> work

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
mind over the race you're great we work

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.119 
mind over the race you're great we work
there<00:01:00.829> for<00:01:01.280> just<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.640> minute<00:01:01.790> here

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.490 

when<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.909> did<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.689> problem<00:01:07.140> approach

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
when you did use this problem approach

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.410 
when you did use this problem approach
you<00:01:08.070> started<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.939> tens<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
you started with the tens do you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.260 
you started with the tens do you
so<00:01:11.990> we're<00:01:12.170> ghosts<00:01:12.320> up<00:01:12.500> at<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.710> tents<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.030> I

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
so we're ghosts up at the tents so I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.390 
so we're ghosts up at the tents so I
want<00:01:14.510> you<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.630> physically<00:01:15.260> take<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.800> tens<00:01:16.190> and

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
want you to physically take the tens and

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.080 
want you to physically take the tens and
divide<00:01:16.670> them<00:01:16.820> into<00:01:16.970> two<00:01:17.180> equal<00:01:17.479> groups

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.230 

it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's
but<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:29.009> would<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.280> nice<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.820> could<00:01:29.850> split<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
but it would be nice if I could split it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
but it would be nice if I could split it
in<00:01:30.600> two<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.049> half<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.770> yeah<00:01:32.159> okay<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
in two in half right yeah okay what if I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
in two in half right yeah okay what if I
told<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.170> option<00:01:34.649> can<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> look

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
told you that not an option can you look

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.380 
told you that not an option can you look
over<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:35.670> else<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.270> we

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
over there what else do you think we

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
over there what else do you think we
might<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.750> able<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.200> change<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.830> for<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.369> can't

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
might be able to change it for you can't

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.279 
might be able to change it for you can't
change<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.119> two<00:01:39.270> fives<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.080> can

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
change it for two fives but we can

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.580 
change it for two fives but we can
change<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.899> you've<00:01:42.899> got<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.380> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
change it for what you've got it so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:54.050 
change it for what you've got it so
change<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.189> ten<00:01:44.369> ones

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.789 

bring<00:01:54.570> him<00:01:54.690> on<00:01:54.810> over<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> ones<00:01:55.530> column

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
bring him on over to the ones column

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.120 
bring him on over to the ones column
here

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.580 

okay<00:02:05.640> let's<00:02:05.880> blown<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.659> now<00:02:07.380> here's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
okay let's blown down here now here's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.990 
okay let's blown down here now here's
what<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.799> want<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.100> sure<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.550> we<00:02:08.789> still

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
what I want to be sure of that we still

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.940 
what I want to be sure of that we still
have<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.240> same<00:02:09.450> problem<00:02:09.929> which<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.350> 31

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
have the same problem which is 31

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.800 
have the same problem which is 31
divided<00:02:11.730> evenly<00:02:11.970> into<00:02:12.120> two<00:02:12.330> groups

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
divided evenly into two groups

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.530 
divided evenly into two groups
so<00:02:13.380> 1020<00:02:14.130> should<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:14.880> make<00:02:15.060> sure<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.330> still

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so 1020 should we make sure we still

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.990 
so 1020 should we make sure we still
have<00:02:15.569> 31<00:02:17.540> still<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.690> 31<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.700> now<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.910> have

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
have 31 still have 31 just now you have

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.240 
have 31 still have 31 just now you have
20<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.510> 11<00:02:21.569> months<00:02:22.080> right<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.920> now<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:23.190> do

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
20 and 11 months right so now what do

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.199 
20 and 11 months right so now what do
you<00:02:23.310> think<00:02:23.489> you're<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.819> do<00:02:26.060> except<00:02:27.060> to

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
you think you're going to do except to

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:41.450 
you think you're going to do except to

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
except Templin okay so you could do that

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.050 
except Templin okay so you could do that
in<00:02:44.700> your<00:02:44.730> head

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
in your head

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.840 
in your head
divide<00:02:45.630> them<00:02:45.810> easily<00:02:45.960> huh<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.220> we've<00:02:47.490> divided

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
divide them easily huh so we've divided

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.840 
divide them easily huh so we've divided
them<00:02:48.060> evenly<00:02:48.480> into<00:02:49.170> two<00:02:49.440> groups<00:02:49.620> yes<00:02:50.040> all

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
them evenly into two groups yes all

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.670 
them evenly into two groups yes all
right<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:51.540> watch<00:02:51.930> what<00:02:52.170> happens<00:02:52.620> here

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
right so now watch what happens here

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.410 
right so now watch what happens here
let's<00:02:53.010> take<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.220> look<00:02:53.460> at<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.610> problem<00:02:54.030> took

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
let's take a look at the problem took

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.760 
let's take a look at the problem took
some<00:02:54.660> mathematician<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> little<00:02:55.530> while<00:02:55.620> to

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
some mathematician a little while to

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.240 
some mathematician a little while to
figure<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.220> out<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:57.170> he<00:02:58.170> had<00:02:58.320> 31<00:02:58.710> just<00:02:59.100> like

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
figure this out so he had 31 just like

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.280 
figure this out so he had 31 just like
you<00:02:59.430> did<00:02:59.610> there<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.600> he<00:03:00.630> divided<00:03:01.170> it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
you did there and when he divided it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.490 
you did there and when he divided it
into<00:03:01.380> two<00:03:01.620> equal<00:03:01.650> groups<00:03:02.660> how<00:03:03.660> many<00:03:03.900> tens<00:03:04.230> in

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
into two equal groups how many tens in

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.080 
into two equal groups how many tens in
one<00:03:04.770> group<00:03:06.680> 110<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.280> why<00:03:08.520> you<00:03:08.580> put<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
one group 110 so that's why you put the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.780 
one group 110 so that's why you put the
1<00:03:10.190> over<00:03:11.190> them<00:03:11.400> let's<00:03:11.640> do<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.940> again<00:03:16.610> but<00:03:17.610> how

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
1 over them let's do it again but how

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.810 
1 over them let's do it again but how
many<00:03:17.850> tens<00:03:18.270> did<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.600> define<00:03:21.710> okay<00:03:22.710> so<00:03:22.860> now<00:03:23.430> go

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
many tens did you define okay so now go

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.050 
many tens did you define okay so now go
ahead<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.210> put<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.370> you've<00:03:26.370> divided<00:03:26.760> two

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
ahead and put the so you've divided two

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.320 
ahead and put the so you've divided two
of<00:03:27.210> your<00:03:27.390> tens<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.080> then<00:03:28.880> what<00:03:29.880> did<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.150> do

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
of your tens and then what did you do

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.620 
of your tens and then what did you do
next

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.920 

mm-hmm<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.080> then<00:03:34.230> what<00:03:34.380> did<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.530> do<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:39.420> what

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
mm-hmm and then what did you do and what

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.560 
mm-hmm and then what did you do and what
do<00:03:39.990> you<00:03:40.080> have<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.640> do<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:41.910> remember<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:42.420> we

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
do you have and do you remember what we

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.980 
do you have and do you remember what we
had<00:03:42.810> down<00:03:43.110> here<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.890> had<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> 10<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:47.370> had<00:03:47.990> and

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
had down here you had a 10 you had and

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.350 
had down here you had a 10 you had and
what<00:03:49.200> did<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.500> do<00:03:49.650> with<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.980> 11<00:03:50.250> what<00:03:51.090> did<00:03:51.240> you

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
what did you do with the 11 what did you

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.030 
what did you do with the 11 what did you
do<00:03:51.450> with<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.600> 10<00:03:54.050> would<00:03:55.050> you<00:03:55.230> trade<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.590> for

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.710 

couldn't<00:03:59.040> trade<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.340> for<00:03:59.490> fun<00:03:59.670> traded<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.570> it

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
couldn't trade it for fun traded is it

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.980 
couldn't trade it for fun traded is it
110<00:04:01.470> 110<00:04:02.130> once<00:04:02.460> then<00:04:03.450> would<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.720> do<00:04:03.840> with

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
110 110 once then would you do with

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.010 
110 110 once then would you do with
those<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.380> divide<00:04:04.740> them<00:04:04.950> evenly<00:04:05.370> into<00:04:09.020> okay

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
those you divide them evenly into okay

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.920 
those you divide them evenly into okay
how<00:04:10.380> many<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.680> each<00:04:10.800> group<00:04:11.720> where's<00:04:12.720> that

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
how many in each group where's that

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.470 
how many in each group where's that
going<00:04:14.600> how<00:04:15.600> many<00:04:15.810> groups<00:04:16.140> did<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.620> do<00:04:16.799> use<00:04:17.480> so

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
going how many groups did you do use so

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.280 
going how many groups did you do use so
you<00:04:18.780> used<00:04:19.049> up<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.260> value<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.770> what<00:04:21.020> two<00:04:22.020> groups

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
you used up a value of what two groups

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.650 
you used up a value of what two groups
of<00:04:22.410> five

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
of five

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.230 

yeah<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:26.510> 5<00:04:27.510> times<00:04:27.780> 2<00:04:28.170> is<00:04:28.350> 2<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.950> then<00:04:29.850> you<00:04:30.030> had

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
yeah so 5 times 2 is 2 and then you had

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.710 
yeah so 5 times 2 is 2 and then you had
one<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:32.630> one<00:04:33.630> remain<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.450> what<00:04:36.570> we've

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
one and one remain is that what we've

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.980 
one and one remain is that what we've
done<00:04:36.870> see<00:04:37.680> why<00:04:37.890> that<00:04:38.070> works<00:04:38.870> doesn't<00:04:39.870> that
