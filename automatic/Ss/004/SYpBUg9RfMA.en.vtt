00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
except that this is the drippy one and

except that this is the drippy one and
their<00:00:47.340> other<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.850> may<00:00:48.270> droop<00:00:48.809> over<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.170> little

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
bit that's because their leaves are

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
bit that's because their leaves are
bigger<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.059> heavier<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> let's<00:00:55.379> talk<00:00:55.590> about

when you get them so I want to show you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.760 
when you get them so I want to show you
the<00:02:21.060> easy<00:02:21.330> way<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.660> get<00:02:21.960> them<00:02:22.050> clean

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
the easy way to get them clean

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.860 
the easy way to get them clean
you<00:02:22.890> want<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.160> have<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> bowl<00:02:23.640> or<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.240> bigger<00:02:24.510> bowl

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you want to have a bowl or a bigger bowl

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
you want to have a bowl or a bigger bowl
and<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.320> just<00:02:25.530> want<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.830> lay<00:02:26.070> them<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.430> there

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and you just want to lay them in there

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.390 
and you just want to lay them in there
and<00:02:26.880> then<00:02:27.780> they<00:02:27.990> will<00:02:28.170> float<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.830> then<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and then they will float and then the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.820 
and then they will float and then the
dirt<00:02:29.670> will<00:02:30.300> fall<00:02:30.540> off<00:02:30.750> into<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.290> bottom<00:02:31.620> and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
dirt will fall off into the bottom and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.310 
dirt will fall off into the bottom and
you<00:02:32.370> usually<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.240> do<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.570> at<00:02:33.780> least<00:02:33.810> twice

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
you usually have to do it at least twice

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.640 
you usually have to do it at least twice
just<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.520> sure<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:37.080> imagine<00:02:37.320> that

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
just to be sure now you can imagine that

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.380 
just to be sure now you can imagine that
that's<00:02:37.800> pretty<00:02:38.160> easy<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.730> your<00:02:38.850> flat<00:02:39.120> ones

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
that's pretty easy with your flat ones

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.740 
that's pretty easy with your flat ones
that<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> cilantro<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:41.070> when<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
that the cilantro but when you get the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.570 
that the cilantro but when you get the
parsley<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.930> has<00:02:43.230> got<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:43.710> kinds<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.520> little

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
parsley it has got all kinds of little

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.270 
parsley it has got all kinds of little
places<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.750> dirt<00:02:45.990> can<00:02:46.020> hide<00:02:46.410> so

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
places in there that dirt can hide so

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.440 
places in there that dirt can hide so
you're<00:02:47.460> going<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.670> have<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.970> do<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.240> same

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
you're going to have to do the same

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.720 
you're going to have to do the same
thing<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.960> some<00:02:49.530> people<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:50.160> swish<00:02:50.400> them<00:02:50.580> up

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
thing and some people just swish them up

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.090 
thing and some people just swish them up
and<00:02:50.880> down<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.390> have<00:02:51.870> not<00:02:52.080> found<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.560> be<00:02:52.890> as

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
and down I have not found that to be as

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.640 
and down I have not found that to be as
efficient<00:02:53.910> as<00:02:54.000> putting<00:02:54.840> them<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.350> letting

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
efficient as putting them in and letting

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.110 
efficient as putting them in and letting
them<00:02:55.770> sit<00:02:56.040> there<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.460> little<00:02:56.640> while<00:02:56.820> and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
them sit there for a little while and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.570 
them sit there for a little while and
it'll<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:58.170> fall<00:02:58.380> off<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.130> bottom<00:02:59.310> of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
it'll just fall off and in the bottom of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.540 
it'll just fall off and in the bottom of
your<00:02:59.610> bowl<00:02:59.910> will<00:03:00.840> be<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.680> dirt<00:03:01.860> now<00:03:02.400> this

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
your bowl will be the dirt now this

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.800 
your bowl will be the dirt now this
one's<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.820> little<00:03:02.850> long<00:03:03.210> so<00:03:03.420> I'm<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.750> to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
one's a little long so I'm just going to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.170 
one's a little long so I'm just going to
pinch<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.230> off<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:05.100> that's<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.580> easy<00:03:05.820> way<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
pinch it off but that's the easy way to

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.450 
pinch it off but that's the easy way to
do<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.810> then<00:03:07.080> after<00:03:07.530> you've<00:03:07.710> gone<00:03:07.950> you

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
do it and then after you've gone you

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.640 
do it and then after you've gone you
would<00:03:08.580> take<00:03:08.790> all<00:03:08.970> these<00:03:09.120> out<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:10.200> look<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
would take all these out you look in the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.140 
would take all these out you look in the
bowl<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.130> see<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.520> dirt<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.970> course

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
bowl and you see the dirt and of course

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.940 
bowl and you see the dirt and of course
we<00:03:12.270> don't<00:03:12.330> have<00:03:12.450> time<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:13.020> all<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.170> but

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
we don't have time to do all that but

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.990 
we don't have time to do all that but
then<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.190> pick<00:03:14.430> them<00:03:14.580> up

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
then you pick them up

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.290 
then you pick them up
gently<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:16.860> do<00:03:17.160> not<00:03:17.400> pour<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.940> out<00:03:18.060> because

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
gently you do not pour it out because

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.790 
gently you do not pour it out because
then<00:03:18.570> you'll<00:03:18.720> pour<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.050> dirt<00:03:19.200> back<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.620> to

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
then you'll pour the dirt back on to

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.310 
then you'll pour the dirt back on to
your<00:03:19.830> cilantro<00:03:20.370> or<00:03:20.790> your<00:03:20.940> parsley<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.660> then

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
your cilantro or your parsley and then

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.110 
your cilantro or your parsley and then
you<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:22.710> refill<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.280> bowl<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.730> do<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.940> -<00:03:24.090> a

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
you just refill the bowl and do it - a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.090 
you just refill the bowl and do it - a
couple<00:03:24.300> more<00:03:24.570> times<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.170> then<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.800> need<00:03:25.950> to

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
couple more times and then you need to

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.440 
couple more times and then you need to
drain<00:03:26.490> them<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.830> I<00:03:28.830> do<00:03:28.890> this<00:03:29.280> when<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.580> bring<00:03:30.270> it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
much or none of this but it is very very

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.800 
much or none of this but it is very very
very<00:04:58.210> high<00:04:58.810> in<00:04:59.139> vitamin<00:04:59.379> K<00:04:59.830> two<00:05:00.729> tablespoons<00:05:01.569> I

very high in vitamin K two tablespoons I

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.680 
very high in vitamin K two tablespoons I
mean<00:05:02.020> that<00:05:02.229> is<00:05:02.469> not<00:05:02.500> much<00:05:02.979> that's<00:05:03.340> about<00:05:03.690> two

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
mean that is not much that's about two

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.129 
mean that is not much that's about two
tablespoons<00:05:05.199> that<00:05:06.190> has<00:05:06.430> 150%<00:05:07.330> of<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.750> vitamin

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
tablespoons that has 150% of the vitamin

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.709 
tablespoons that has 150% of the vitamin
K<00:05:08.379> you<00:05:08.440> need<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:09.280> also<00:05:09.460> has<00:05:09.759> the<00:05:09.969> vitamin<00:05:10.330> C<00:05:10.509> and

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 
K you need it also has the vitamin C and

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:12.779 
K you need it also has the vitamin C and
a<00:05:10.900> that<00:05:11.139> you<00:05:11.229> need<00:05:11.440> but<00:05:12.009> this<00:05:12.219> is<00:05:12.460> really

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
a that you need but this is really

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.879 
a that you need but this is really
loaded<00:05:13.240> with<00:05:13.389> that<00:05:13.569> you<00:05:13.810> don't<00:05:14.110> need<00:05:14.319> much<00:05:14.560> and

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889

loaded with that you don't need much and
I<00:05:15.250> think<00:05:15.520> some<00:05:15.699> of<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.879> people's<00:05:16.180> aversion<00:05:16.690> to

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
I think some of the people's aversion to

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.170 
I think some of the people's aversion to
parsley<00:05:17.349> has<00:05:17.949> been<00:05:18.219> that<00:05:18.400> they've<00:05:18.580> used<00:05:18.610> too

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
parsley has been that they've used too

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.990 
parsley has been that they've used too
much<00:05:19.360> in<00:05:19.659> the<00:05:19.870> recipe<00:05:20.229> so<00:05:21.009> until<00:05:21.430> you<00:05:21.580> get<00:05:21.759> used

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
much in the recipe so until you get used

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.879 
much in the recipe so until you get used
to<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.300> taste<00:05:22.539> whatever<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.379> tells<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:23.800> to

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
to the taste whatever it tells you to

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.619 
to the taste whatever it tells you to
put<00:05:24.069> into<00:05:24.219> your<00:05:24.340> recipe<00:05:24.909> I<00:05:24.939> would<00:05:25.240> put<00:05:25.419> half

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
put into your recipe I would put half

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.409 
put into your recipe I would put half
and<00:05:25.960> then<00:05:26.680> see<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.550> other<00:05:27.669> thing<00:05:27.879> I<00:05:28.029> find<00:05:28.210> with

and then see the other thing I find with
parsley<00:05:28.779> is<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.110> don't<00:05:29.259> want<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.560> put<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:29.800> in<00:05:29.919> my

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
parsley is I don't want to put it in my

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.459 
parsley is I don't want to put it in my
recipe<00:05:30.580> that's<00:05:30.789> being<00:05:30.969> cooked<00:05:31.300> until<00:05:32.139> the<00:05:32.259> end

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
recipe that's being cooked until the end

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.379 
recipe that's being cooked until the end
or<00:05:32.860> just<00:05:32.889> to<00:05:33.460> sprinkle<00:05:33.699> it<00:05:33.969> on<00:05:34.090> top

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
or just to sprinkle it on top

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.649 
or just to sprinkle it on top
it<00:05:34.960> just<00:05:35.319> it<00:05:35.620> ends<00:05:36.279> up<00:05:36.340> getting<00:05:36.520> too<00:05:36.789> soft<00:05:37.120> and

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
it just it ends up getting too soft and

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.019 
it just it ends up getting too soft and
kind<00:05:37.960> of<00:05:38.050> tough<00:05:38.289> and<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:39.159> kind<00:05:39.460> of<00:05:39.520> loses<00:05:39.699> some

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.029 
kind of tough and it kind of loses some

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.820 
kind of tough and it kind of loses some
of<00:05:40.060> its<00:05:40.270> flavor<00:05:40.569> so<00:05:40.900> I<00:05:40.930> would<00:05:41.169> just<00:05:41.199> add<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.740> at

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
of its flavor so I would just add it at

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.680 
of its flavor so I would just add it at
the<00:05:41.860> end<00:05:42.039> or<00:05:42.430> sprinkle<00:05:42.849> it<00:05:42.940> on<00:05:43.029> top<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:43.539> if<00:05:43.599> you

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
the end or sprinkle it on top and if you

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.659 
the end or sprinkle it on top and if you
notice<00:05:44.050> that's<00:05:44.620> most<00:05:44.979> of<00:05:45.099> the<00:05:45.129> time<00:05:45.219> you<00:05:45.460> see

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
notice that's most of the time you see

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.610 
notice that's most of the time you see
it<00:05:45.699> but<00:05:46.449> now<00:05:46.599> this<00:05:46.870> has<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.139> wonderful

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
it but now this has a wonderful

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.820 
it but now this has a wonderful
fragrance<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:48.759> it's<00:05:49.389> really<00:05:50.080> cut<00:05:50.319> up<00:05:50.349> small

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
fragrance and it's really cut up small

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.619 
fragrance and it's really cut up small
and<00:05:51.129> it<00:05:51.250> should<00:05:51.490> it'll<00:05:51.729> even<00:05:51.819> be<00:05:51.969> smaller<00:05:52.419> than

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
and it should it'll even be smaller than

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.350 
and it should it'll even be smaller than
that<00:05:52.690> after<00:05:53.139> it's<00:05:53.259> cooked<00:05:53.469> okay<00:05:54.219> now<00:05:55.000> when<00:05:55.270> it

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
that after it's cooked okay now when it

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.409 
that after it's cooked okay now when it
comes<00:05:55.569> to<00:05:55.779> cilantro<00:05:57.690> it<00:05:58.690> is<00:05:58.870> a<00:05:58.900> flat<00:05:59.349> leaf<00:06:00.419> it's

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
comes to cilantro it is a flat leaf it's

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.680 
comes to cilantro it is a flat leaf it's
flat<00:06:01.900> leaf<00:06:02.139> so<00:06:03.129> as<00:06:03.400> you<00:06:03.550> can<00:06:03.699> see<00:06:03.759> you<00:06:04.270> can<00:06:04.449> see

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
flat leaf so as you can see you can see

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.570 
flat leaf so as you can see you can see
more<00:06:04.930> of<00:06:05.259> it<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:06.190> cut<00:06:06.460> as<00:06:06.699> you<00:06:07.180> have<00:06:07.629> it<00:06:07.870> so<00:06:08.580> it's

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
more of it to cut as you have it so it's

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.369 
more of it to cut as you have it so it's
the<00:06:09.759> same<00:06:09.969> thing<00:06:10.029> they<00:06:10.479> say<00:06:10.659> you<00:06:10.719> have<00:06:10.810> to<00:06:11.020> mash

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
the same thing they say you have to mash

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.230 
the same thing they say you have to mash
it<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.770> get<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.039> ball<00:06:12.219> to<00:06:12.250> oils<00:06:12.789> out<00:06:12.969> of<00:06:13.120> it

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
it to get the ball to oils out of it

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.659 
it to get the ball to oils out of it
just<00:06:13.449> like<00:06:13.659> you<00:06:13.779> do<00:06:13.930> parsley<00:06:14.409> and<00:06:14.589> I<00:06:15.190> just<00:06:15.460> cut

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
just like you do parsley and I just cut

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.420 
just like you do parsley and I just cut
across<00:06:16.000> and<00:06:16.330> I<00:06:16.900> can<00:06:17.110> start<00:06:17.379> smelling<00:06:17.800> it<00:06:18.069> about

across and I can start smelling it about

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.550 
across and I can start smelling it about
two<00:06:19.029> or<00:06:19.120> three<00:06:19.150> down<00:06:19.419> I<00:06:19.659> can<00:06:20.020> just<00:06:20.259> really

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
two or three down I can just really

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.890 
two or three down I can just really
start<00:06:20.830> smelling<00:06:21.219> it<00:06:21.460> now<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.389> one<00:06:22.659> thing

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900

start smelling it now the one thing
about<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.409> stems<00:06:23.770> on<00:06:24.099> both<00:06:24.339> of<00:06:24.550> these<00:06:24.669> but

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
about the stems on both of these but

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.110 
about the stems on both of these but
particularly<00:06:25.810> on<00:06:26.020> the<00:06:26.800> parsley<00:06:27.460> is<00:06:27.639> that<00:06:28.000> to
