00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.070
 sham the speculative components 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.170
 end up creating a clandestine system 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.789
 that some agencies which copy 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.890
 works and ideas from other brands 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.989
 or by others 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.640
 agencies presenting the best 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.190
 solution for your shine 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.559

 a relationship should emerge 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.979
 with your developing agency. 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 ideas with their participation from the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.159
 principle if you are an advertiser of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.439
 design 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.540
 the photographer owns an agency the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.369
 employee simply should not 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.500
 work for free companies 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.720
 if you need to build your 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 There are other ways to create 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.450
 something for a charity 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.280
 for a friend who is setting up a 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.320
 business or simply spend your 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.509
 creating their own projects 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.460
 these competitions would be absurd 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.200
 in most other professions 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.240
 or would you ask several heads of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 prepare a meal for free and then 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.220
 You pay only for the best of them you 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.690
 would have competition gathered 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.580
 a lot of lawyers to write in 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.630
 contract and then choose and pay 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.730
 only one 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.230
 Of course, maybe it 's time to 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.250
 begin to treat the professionals of 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.470
 Communication 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.820
 Do you know how you treat others? 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.540
 professionals 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.540
 think about it
