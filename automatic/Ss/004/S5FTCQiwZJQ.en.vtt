00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Dear readers of 9 today we present you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.259
 this video in which we list the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.120
 our considerations after about four 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.790
 days use of the new samsung 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 galaxy s 4 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:18.049
 I state that the device is fantastic 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.049
 really left us stunned 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 samsung could not release in the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.750
 market with a better device than 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.399
 this is because it is to be considered the top 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.940
 the top range of samsung devices 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:40.020
 surely it ranks first together 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.480
 to the other devices of the same 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.730
 headband as htc one and iphone 5 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.129
 I state that we have used it so much 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.850
 so we always have connections 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.719
 active and gesture all active apart from the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.799
 bluetooth that we activate it only when 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.869
 we enter the only note perhaps by car 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.670
 negative of this device and the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.479
 battery 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 the battery comes down a little too much 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.740
 easily 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 we have disconnected it for about an hour and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:32.400
 half from the charger and you can see 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:36.740
 you too the away side scores 81 for 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.740
 one hundred sorry sorry news goes out 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:50.480
 it's not the best we have seen gods 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.480
 video we have published articles 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.910
 displayed web pages 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:01.650
 but not very convincing 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:07.020
 we performed about eight cycles of 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.840
 recharge 78 we can say that the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.720
 device despite the 2600 milian 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.640
 bear could do more hopefully in a 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.080
 update by samsung for 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.630
 better than this management of 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:26.640
 battery and the rest we really are 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:30.840
 glad it shows no defects yes some 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:37.410
 they talk about lag or one 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.050
 flicker in the menu when scrolling and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.160
 the thing I am not yet so minimal 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:50.519
 I can also show you it with Rimini 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:57.170
 lower brightness I believe that there is not 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:03:03.180
 are problems that can compromise 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:09.720
 use or can pass as 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.660
 these device-like speeches 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:19.850
 like a mistake or I'm not there 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:23.090
 relevant problems that we say we have 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:28.280
 we also have the new case that one 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.850
 with the hole in front that I can't remember 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.210
 never what is the name of the exhibition that it is 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:39.620
 really useful if you want to have a clip 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:44.410
 cover and answer the phone without having to 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.410
 the device or see the management 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.120
 here it is, you see the rival black screen 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.170
 when it is we press the button 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:10.850
 of ignition displayable the time la 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.370
 date notifications if if there are 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.040
 new loses excellent chance if 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.900
 a phone call comes the possibility of 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.330
 slide the finger in the display to 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.400
 answer to reject the call 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.770
 so with a single gesture yes without 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.500
 the Afrique cover can be answered 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:33.050
 phone calls but maybe useful the price 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.750
 it is not very approachable because this 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.060
 costantly at 990 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.760
 the only sore point then we also have 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:48.770
 this other that what a nice move right away 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:52.550
 of a non-production case 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.280
 samsung ever really cute is useful 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:05.560
 because it protects the edges except those 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:05.560
 higher hunters and for anterior ones, here it is 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:16.360
 not the thickness does not become is not much 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.160
 it is not very big and therefore not not 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.610
 it is also very crowded in the pocket of the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.510
 pants does not bother like in rugby 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.600
 samsung s4 by itself than with one 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.260
 reduced thickness much more carried in 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.430
 compared to 92 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:44.550
 css3 angel that he certainly greater 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:48.140
 what to say let's hope with the following ones 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:53.400
 refills made but the battery 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:58.550
 manages to improve the returns you have 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:06.360
 I show the battery 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:10.110
 here is 80 percent not in office an hour e 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.320
 29 minutes and 32 seconds with battery 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:21.830
 the screen as you see what you eat 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:21.830
 the graph consumes more this 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.750
 okay level i have i leave you and you 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.130
 I urge you to stay tuned with the 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.160
 our site 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:38.120
 a greeting from doctor the staff of 9 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.120
