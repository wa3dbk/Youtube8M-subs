to take you through some of the real
interesting<00:00:20.869> stuff<00:00:21.079> that<00:00:21.230> we're<00:00:21.349> doing<00:00:21.400> so<00:00:22.400> as

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
interesting stuff that we're doing so as

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.710 
interesting stuff that we're doing so as
you<00:00:22.579> can<00:00:22.669> see<00:00:22.849> around<00:00:22.970> you<00:00:23.239> here<00:00:23.270> we've<00:00:23.509> got<00:00:23.539> a

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
you can see around you here we've got a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.170 
you can see around you here we've got a
whole<00:00:24.649> bunch<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:25.009> guitar<00:00:25.369> amplifiers<00:00:25.879> and

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
whole bunch of guitar amplifiers and

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.209 
whole bunch of guitar amplifiers and
effects<00:00:26.809> pedals<00:00:27.110> that<00:00:27.169> we<00:00:27.320> can<00:00:27.980> make

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:28.219 
effects pedals that we can make

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:30.339 
effects pedals that we can make
ourselves<00:00:28.399> in<00:00:28.790> Sydney<00:00:29.059> Australia<00:00:29.169> the<00:00:30.169> other

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
ourselves in Sydney Australia the other

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.049 
ourselves in Sydney Australia the other
side<00:00:30.529> of<00:00:30.559> the<00:00:30.649> world<00:00:30.829> so<00:00:31.610> it's<00:00:31.759> really

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
side of the world so it's really

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.630 
side of the world so it's really
exciting<00:00:32.480> for<00:00:32.509> us<00:00:32.599> to<00:00:32.750> be<00:00:32.809> here<00:00:32.840> in<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.170> US<00:00:33.379> and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
exciting for us to be here in the US and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.830 
exciting for us to be here in the US and
showing<00:00:34.640> us<00:00:34.760> stuff<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.090> ann's<00:00:35.239> first<00:00:35.390> time<00:00:35.750> in

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
showing us stuff and ann's first time in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.840 
showing us stuff and ann's first time in
five<00:00:36.050> years<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.469> venue<00:00:36.770> but<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.820> thing

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
five years of the venue but the thing

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.209 
five years of the venue but the thing
that<00:00:38.030> we<00:00:38.210> actually<00:00:38.480> came<00:00:38.629> to<00:00:38.980> show<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.039> guys

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
that we actually came to show you guys

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.410 
that we actually came to show you guys
which<00:00:40.430> unfortunately<00:00:40.730> could<00:00:41.150> get<00:00:41.300> through

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
which unfortunately could get through

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.060 
which unfortunately could get through
customs

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
customs

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.380 
customs
it's<00:00:43.550> a<00:00:43.970> new<00:00:44.120> technology<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:44.660> we've<00:00:44.840> got<00:00:44.989> 29

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
it's a new technology that we've got 29

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.430 
it's a new technology that we've got 29
pull<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.840> flex<00:00:47.050> spot<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:47.470> technology

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
pull the flex spot and technology

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.560 
pull the flex spot and technology
now<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.550> thing<00:00:49.730> is<00:00:49.760> really<00:00:50.149> fascinating

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
now the thing is really fascinating

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.229 
now the thing is really fascinating
about<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:51.109> is<00:00:51.469> it<00:00:51.890> is<00:00:51.980> a<00:00:52.010> real<00:00:52.340> shift<00:00:52.789> it

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
about this is it is a real shift it

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.310 
about this is it is a real shift it
turns<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.570> way<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.750> guitar<00:00:54.050> arms<00:00:54.230> get<00:00:54.379> done

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
turns the way the guitar arms get done

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.050 
turns the way the guitar arms get done
leave<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.040> like<00:00:56.130> this<00:00:56.160> basically<00:00:56.670> you've<00:00:56.880> got

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
leave it like this basically you've got

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.660 
leave it like this basically you've got
black<00:00:57.690> box<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.829> contains<00:00:59.220> all<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
black box that contains all of the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.960 
black box that contains all of the
components<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.480> need<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> build

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.970 

now<00:01:03.450> none<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.080> those<00:01:04.170> components<00:01:04.500> racially

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
now none of those components racially

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.690 
now none of those components racially
hooked<00:01:05.160> up<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:06.170> themselves<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:08.400> create<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
hooked up to themselves to create a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
hooked up to themselves to create a
second<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.750> happens<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.230> you<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
second what happens is you have a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
second what happens is you have a
circuit<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:10.980> you<00:01:11.130> designer<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.700> design

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
circuit that you designer on this design

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.690 
circuit that you designer on this design
on<00:01:12.540> an<00:01:12.660> iPad<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> connect<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.190> iPad<00:01:14.550> up

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
on an iPad when you connect the iPad up

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.970 
on an iPad when you connect the iPad up
to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> box<00:01:15.540> connects<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> components

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
to the box connects all the components

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.530 
to the box connects all the components
up<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.370> create<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.730> circuit<00:01:17.910> that's<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.330> there

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
up to create the circuit that's on there

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
up to create the circuit that's on there
so<00:01:19.470> whilst<00:01:20.160> I<00:01:20.280> don't<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> amplifier

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so whilst I don't have the amplifier

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.210 
so whilst I don't have the amplifier
here<00:01:21.300> unfortunately<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.870> do<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.220> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
here unfortunately I do have the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.460 
here unfortunately I do have the
software<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.720> i<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.930> take<00:01:25.050> you<00:01:25.110> through<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
software so i can take you through that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.600 
software so i can take you through that
process

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
process

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.100 
process
so<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.240> example<00:01:27.300> you<00:01:27.690> might<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.990> an

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
so for example you might have an

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.480 
so for example you might have an
amplifier<00:01:28.500> here

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
amplifier here

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.219 
amplifier here
well<00:01:31.060> he's<00:01:31.150> an<00:01:31.270> amplifier<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.689> we<00:01:31.900> call<00:01:32.110> the

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
well he's an amplifier that we call the

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.580 
well he's an amplifier that we call the
feel<00:01:32.439> special<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.610> we'll<00:01:33.790> load<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.149> up<00:01:34.590> back

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
feel special so we'll load that up back

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.649 
feel special so we'll load that up back
here<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.549> then<00:01:36.670> what<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.000> can<00:01:37.119> actually<00:01:37.240> do

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
here and then what you can actually do

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.440 
here and then what you can actually do
is<00:01:37.990> see<00:01:38.470> inside<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.520> amplifier<00:01:39.970> now<00:01:40.149> this<00:01:40.330> is

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
is see inside the amplifier now this is

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.780 
is see inside the amplifier now this is
not<00:01:40.630> digital<00:01:40.960> modeling<00:01:41.320> this<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.189> not<00:01:42.399> you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
not digital modeling this is not you

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.520 
not digital modeling this is not you
know<00:01:42.820> solid-state<00:01:43.479> circuitry<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.289> pure

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
know solid-state circuitry this is pure

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.300 
know solid-state circuitry this is pure
valve<00:01:45.280> circuitry<00:01:46.000> so<00:01:46.750> go<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:47.439> there<00:01:47.649> and

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
valve circuitry so go in there and

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.980 
valve circuitry so go in there and
you've<00:01:48.729> got<00:01:48.850> access<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.689> actual

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
you've got access to the actual

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.800 
you've got access to the actual
components<00:01:50.380> inside<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.429> amplifier<00:01:51.880> now<00:01:52.720> if

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
components inside the amplifier now if

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.389 
components inside the amplifier now if
you<00:01:52.929> can<00:01:53.110> click<00:01:53.500> on<00:01:53.619> any<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.130> components

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
you can click on any of the components
