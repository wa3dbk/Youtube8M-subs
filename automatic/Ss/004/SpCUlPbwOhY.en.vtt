00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.849
 yes 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 in that area 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.770
 this must always be in the root 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.469
 m 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.710
 it's an irrigation technology 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.259
 although we want is to raise awareness of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.960
 the importance of rain 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.720
 harvest that of all the roofs of the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.720
 basketball courts of the streets of 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.939
 all those places where we can 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.140
 receive the rain to receive it with affection 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.590
 with love 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.350
 to understand the importance that it has 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.680
 in our lives 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.009
 harvest that rain solidify the with 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.310
 the technology that we handle from the use of 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.340
 superabsorbent polymers and once 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.940
 let's have the rain in solid we can 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.770
 save in sacks and store 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.410
 because when we want to start 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.780
 planting we already have the wetland resource 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.510
 necessary for the completion of 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.270
 seeds we prepare our land 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.850
 just as we are always going to mix the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.450
 solid rain and with this we would already have 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.420
 the moist earth needed 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.220
 for the germination of the seeds and the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.270
 growth of plants 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.650
 sow the rain is very practical not 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.960
 we have to wait to see when it's going to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.000
 start raining this allows us 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.480
 anticipate the rainy season 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 so that we achieve the germination of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.720
 seeds the growth of plants 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.120
 without a drop of rain or watering 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.000
 and when the rains arrive our 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.400
 plants already grown are in full 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.870
 development of what has been consumed 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.959
 of moisture is reloaded 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.440
 then we achieve with this that there is no 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.230
 stress and color before growth 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.450
 solid rain causes 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.150
 or propitiates a moisture reserve in the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.819
 root and consequently there is no stress 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.850
 water and crops are not lost 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.420
 although it stops raining 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.640
 and with these considerations instead of 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.250
 get in some places 600 kilos of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.470
 corn per hectare are getting 10 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.030
 tons 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.060
 commercially we call it a water silo 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.010
 that water store chemically exposes 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.650
 potassium acrylate 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.569
 Lastly, you said that lasts from 10 a 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.250
 8 years can store before it 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.329
 rot or spoil the water not 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.159
 I know not what happens is that it will absorb 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.870
 Water 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.569
 and it will be moisture is taken 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.870
 plant and that's going to be that water that 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.590
 It will solidify capture 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.760
 consuming and returns to powder 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.129
 returns to receive water and turns to 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.590
 fill and return to consume the usa 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.900
 it will fill up again for up to 8 or 10 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.200
 years 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.170
 that power because it is not a vegetable a 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.420
 way mud transforms chat and then 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.740
 all it does is retain moisture 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.900
 around the roots 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.180
 and finally over the years it 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.610
 embed with the salts of the water and 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.850
 formed a bit lost in the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.860
 land without causing damage to the earth or 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.760
 to the peoples in the fruits 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.010
 in the year 2000 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.409
 and 2005 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.639
 with a very important drought here in 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:21.489
 our state and I remember that in a 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.450
 meeting we had in serdan city 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:29.020
 a group of curators over 15 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.240
 They expressed their concern because they did not 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:37.430
 I could go out to work 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:40.490
 because we are desperate 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.480
 because the manido we want cabueñes 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.680
 we want works that allow us 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:53.020
 the impacts of the drought are reduced 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:57.190
 he remembered it now don jesús velasco us 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:01.660
 he explained in his lecture and especially 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.500
 in the last sheet where it says that the 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.560
 solid line 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.639
 can save 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.500
 of hunger to the people and we will see it in 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.710
 these demonstrations 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.620
 and I want to say that the name of the 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.910
 secretary of agriculture us 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.140
 We are very proud because it adds 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.630
 inventors because there are innovators 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.750
 because there are people like rich Jesus 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:32.260
 velasco looking for solutions to the problem 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.790
 from the drought to the problem of the supply of 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.820
 Water 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.880
 and it's very impressive like here 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.480
 then it does not come 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.940
 pony sheltered potassium the water is 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.180
 filtering and here it is retained 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.270
 completely 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.690
 it is doing its job salt gel 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.690
 the material that you no longer know written according to 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.880
 what we reach to see there are many me 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.270
 I say there are many saint tomás in the 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.280
 field until not see not believe and well then 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.590
 they are right because they can not risk 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.690
 sometimes it's a little bit heritage is a 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.780
 little capital and if we help them 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.150
 us through the programs to 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.100
 through the actions so that they know 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.009
 the technology that is available and 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.110
 can choose the one that best suits them 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.509
 agree it seems to me that we will be 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.139
 contributing very very 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.729
 important to find solutions 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.789
 we are worried because the commission 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:36.030
 National Water Agency predicts that this is 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.400
 a dry year and if it's dry it's better than 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.130
 once we go see that we are going to 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.740
 sow how we are going to sow how 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.360
 we are going to lessen the impacts of 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.639
 drought 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.560
 any parcel improvement we are going 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.620
 to do what are the species 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.439
 drought-resistant what are the 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.789
 practices that we did not do and that did not 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:00.449
 we have to do because there's going to be 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:03.870
 less water if the dashed of hopefully and 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:06.469
 bathe what good but if we are not 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.469
 preparations
