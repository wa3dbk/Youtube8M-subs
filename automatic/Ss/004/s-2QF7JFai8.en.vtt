can't find them in the packaging one

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
can't find them in the packaging one
that<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> code<00:01:26.010> when

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that is that going to see the code when

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.790 
that is that going to see the code when
I<00:01:26.640> found<00:01:26.940> this<00:01:27.210> green<00:01:27.540> marine<00:01:27.780> right<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.410> it

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
I found this green marine right here it

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.180 
I found this green marine right here it
came<00:01:28.980> with<00:01:29.160> this<00:01:29.310> figure<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.560> its<00:01:31.800> total

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
came with this figure so see its total

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
came with this figure so see its total
random<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.550> don't<00:01:32.730> know<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:32.940> you're<00:01:33.090> going

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
random you don't know when you're going

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.120 
random you don't know when you're going
to<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.230> there's<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> quote<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.950> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
to get it so there's a quote for that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.890 
to get it so there's a quote for that
one<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> by<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> way<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.180> didn't<00:01:36.480> come<00:01:36.660> with<00:01:36.690> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
one and by the way it didn't come with a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.780 
one and by the way it didn't come with a
mega<00:01:37.230> buck<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> came<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> base

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
mega buck because it came with a base

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.020 
mega buck because it came with a base
for<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.150> one<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.260> there's<00:01:40.740> there's<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.760> green

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
for this one so there's there's a green

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.980 
for this one so there's there's a green
