00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.480
 good morning internet loads here at 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.690
 claudio therefore speaking with this 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.980
 video I would like to return to the question of 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.050
 how to practice effectively that 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.280
 it is a theme that I seem to have understood 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.260
 that you find a lot of interest among people 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.510
 in the previous video we had seen how 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.689
 set up your own work routine 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.629
 how to organize your own sessions 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:39.800
 exercise today I would like to dispel some sort 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.470
 of myth or belief partially 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.680
 wrong about the effects it has 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.960
 that is, practice or practice 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 constant what types of effects such as 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.660
 types of results from the belief that 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.250
 goes for the most part is that the fact of 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.649
 practice having a practice 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 constant make improve on 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.469
 guitar and unfortunately this is not true 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.509
 in the sense that it matters a lot like the 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.880
 what the how we do is not enough 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.369
 practice to improve and then 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.049
 specifically what effects does the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.700
 practice on the bitter guitar in 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.399
 any other field 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.189
 the effect the practice has is that of 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.539
 then consolidate to consolidate both 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.469
 for better than for evil 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:27.319
 therefore it is important precisely for this 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.179
 reason to have a clear idea of ​​what it is 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.310
 correct what not so if we 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.649
 let's take an example run a 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.240
 exercise correctly and this 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.619
 exercise we insert it into ours 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.349
 routine and we do it for a long time for months 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.729
 the consolidation effect will cause that 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.990
 if the exercise had been done in 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.329
 correct way 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.829
 we will have a benefit but if the exercise is 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.999
 been done incorrectly in 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.259
 wrong way 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.020
 we will still have an effect of 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.990
 consolidation then the fact 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.029
 the reason why many people don't 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.399
 manage to improve or sometimes 

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:03.409
 they even regress and get worse 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.709
 because this phenomenon unfortunately exists 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.729
 it is indeed linked to this an effect of 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.940
 consolidation on practices that 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.370
 they are incorrect and so here it comes 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.470
 spontaneous the question is indeed fundamental 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.629
 in the question but then what is it 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.580
 corrector what not certain here 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.799
 the intervention of a teacher of one 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.379
 guide in this I would say that could 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.250
 be fundamental but we try to 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.989
 understand which are the classic elements of 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.390
 impropriety that we can assume in 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.730
 our exercises are the most classic 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.540
 fingering issues then 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.239
 choose not very rational ways to 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.040
 do what a classic does 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.470
 example is to avoid use 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.819
 of the little finger which is instead a finger 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.849
 like all areas like everyone else 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.079
 that should be used eva has developed into 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.400
 his in his work 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.000
 hence the fact of for example 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.989
 continue to repeat for weeks months 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 exercises with companies already toured e 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.310
 wrong that avoided the use of the little finger 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.629
 it is something that is consolidated and this 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.819
 typically then it is difficult to 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.980
 then correct attention that I most with 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.230
 solid and more then it will be difficult 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.510
 correct that particular practice 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.280
 so be very careful on this point 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.560
 because it's really important 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.200
 then other class issues 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.340
 classically incorrect is only in the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.090
 right hand management 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.790
 so let's say solutions of pens born 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.140
 wrong or random here typically 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.510
 false myths enter the picking suite 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.739
 or things like that you think 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.590
 can replace the alternate picking 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.849
 as I said in the other videos 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.220
 alternate picking must be ours 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.709
 engine therefore the fact for example of 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.000
 continue to practice not having well 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.280
 the braking mechanisms are clear 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.069
 alternating and using pinnates 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.190
 random both on the agreements but also on 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.780
 scalar or solo issues that cannot 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.640
 do nothing but consolidate a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.560
 wrong attitude and this there 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.170
 leads to sounding bad at playing in 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.910
 put it this way 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.890
 when there is no clarity on what 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.290
 must be there with the right hand 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.030
 the result is a way of playing 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.010
 messed up that is when we hear a 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.900
 guitarist playing dirty playing 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.459
 loosely that is that 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.379
 normally comes from very little 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.000
 clarity in what you are doing a 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.850
 right hand level 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.360
 but perhaps the real fundamental question 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.820
 it was the rigidity that is when we 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.560
 we continue to practice and not there 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.690
 we realize that we are rigid to 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.520
 level of hands but also at the level of 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.280
 other parts of the body is put on 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.789
 jaw or any other part of the 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.889
 body 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.680
 we tend to consolidate this 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.389
 rigidity and more we will exercise is more 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.650
 this rigidity will be part of ours 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.789
 way of playing every time 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.740
 we will take up the guitar again 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.410
 we will find this rigidity again so it is 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.080
 absolutely fundamental fundamental 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.270
 than in the two training sessions 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.550
 always check that you have a posture 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.910
 both with different body sleeves 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.800
 absolutely relaxed 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.930
 you will have to practice relaxing 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.450
 a consolidation effect and therefore 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.310
 will automatically cause when 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.460
 we will take to the guitar in the times 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.410
 later your body will know how to 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.050
 how to put yourself in a relaxed manner 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.830
 so I recommend maximum attention 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.010
 not to go on automatically 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.320
 proposing exercises without signing 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.520
 asked a question if this exercises 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.680
 are 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.539
 are performed correctly or 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.490
 less try to keep it under control 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:36.050
 these aspects and exploits the effect of 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.020
 consolidation given by the practice then 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.370
 the practice is not something that must 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.490
 go ahead automatically 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.470
 we always say filter through a 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.819
 brain through the ability to 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.460
 analysis that tells us what I am 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:51.349
 doing is correct or not for the reasons e 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.979
 for the effects I explained to you in 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:56.289
 this video 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.289
 at this point, good work, hello
