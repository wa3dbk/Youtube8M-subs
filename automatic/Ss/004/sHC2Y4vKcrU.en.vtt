00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
was like 12 mil to get the boat to where

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800 
was like 12 mil to get the boat to where
i<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.040> make<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> bc<00:01:08.490> my<00:01:08.880> money<00:01:09.090> slowly<00:01:09.540> going

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
i can make it bc my money slowly going

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.500 
i can make it bc my money slowly going
down<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.439> I'm<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.650> sitting<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.369> 18<00:01:12.330> mil

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
down right now I'm I sitting that 18 mil

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.760 
down right now I'm I sitting that 18 mil
and<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> ends<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> way

and I think it ends up going all the way

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.580 
and I think it ends up going all the way
down<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.310> seven<00:01:14.760> mil<00:01:15.200> before<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> end<00:01:16.500> up

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
down to about seven mil before I end up

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
down to about seven mil before I end up
getting<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> signet<00:01:17.430> no<00:01:17.610> corrupted<00:01:18.090> cigna<00:01:18.450> drop

I didn't really profit on it but of

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.470 
I didn't really profit on it but of
course<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.769> adds<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.340> kill<00:02:35.549> count<00:02:35.790> so

course it adds to the kill count so

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.000 
course it adds to the kill count so
hopefully<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.049> closer<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.650> 2k
