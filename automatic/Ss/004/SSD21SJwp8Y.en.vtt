00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
even with the sunglasses I remember her

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
even with the sunglasses I remember her
saying<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> light<00:00:54.120> would<00:00:54.239> come<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.510> from

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
saying that the light would come in from

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.080 
saying that the light would come in from
the<00:00:54.719> side<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.410> still<00:00:55.680> bother<00:00:55.920> her<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.489> these

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the side and still bother her so these

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
the side and still bother her so these
are<00:00:57.300> completely<00:00:57.750> wraparound<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:58.649> seem

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
are completely wraparound and they seem

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319 
are completely wraparound and they seem
like<00:00:59.010> they'd<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.280> designed<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.789> exactly<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like they'd be designed for exactly that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.130 
like they'd be designed for exactly that
type<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> issue<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.910> once<00:01:02.910> again<00:01:03.090> they're<00:01:03.870> not

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
type of issue so once again they're not

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
type of issue so once again they're not
something<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.129> think<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.519> would<00:01:05.700> wear<00:01:05.850> out<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
something I think I would wear out on a
date<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.869> anything<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.270> have<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> pair<00:01:09.630> of

now<00:01:57.729> I've<00:01:57.880> never<00:01:58.090> had<00:01:58.360> much<00:01:58.570> problem<00:01:58.960> with<00:01:59.110> the

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
now I've never had much problem with the

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.359 
now I've never had much problem with the
layer<00:01:59.439> so<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.770> don't<00:01:59.979> feel<00:02:00.070> like<00:02:00.220> there's

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
layer so I don't feel like there's

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.969 
layer so I don't feel like there's
something<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:00.670> really<00:02:00.700> need<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.500> it<00:02:02.619> may<00:02:02.799> be<00:02:02.860> a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
something I really need so it may be a

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.800 
something I really need so it may be a
little<00:02:03.130> bit<00:02:03.310> tougher<00:02:03.700> for<00:02:03.880> me<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:04.780> know

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
little bit tougher for me to you know

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.930 
little bit tougher for me to you know
really<00:02:05.289> be<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.440> good<00:02:05.680> judge<00:02:05.979> of<00:02:06.039> um<00:02:06.369> I'm<00:02:06.729> gonna

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
really be a good judge of um I'm gonna

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.639 
really be a good judge of um I'm gonna
try<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.240> get<00:02:07.360> my<00:02:07.479> ex-wife<00:02:07.899> who<00:02:08.229> does<00:02:08.440> have

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
try and get my ex-wife who does have

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.229 
try and get my ex-wife who does have
that<00:02:08.830> problem<00:02:09.130> driving<00:02:09.670> at<00:02:09.759> night<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.090> wear

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
that problem driving at night to wear

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.340 
that problem driving at night to wear
these<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.600> next<00:02:10.720> time<00:02:10.929> she's<00:02:11.110> gonna<00:02:11.200> be

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
these the next time she's gonna be

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.559 
these the next time she's gonna be
driving<00:02:11.739> somewhere<00:02:12.100> any<00:02:12.819> kind<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.150> distance

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
driving somewhere any kind of a distance

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.020 
driving somewhere any kind of a distance
at<00:02:13.750> night<00:02:13.959> but<00:02:14.709> my<00:02:15.040> impression<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.819> was

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
at night but my impression of it was

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.120 
at night but my impression of it was
that<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.450> does<00:02:16.660> cut<00:02:16.930> down<00:02:16.959> on<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.350> glare<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.709> bit

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
that it does cut down on the glare a bit

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.570 
that it does cut down on the glare a bit
it<00:02:18.340> actually<00:02:18.730> turns<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.780> lights<00:02:20.220> glare<00:02:21.220> from

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
it actually turns the lights glare from

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.449 
it actually turns the lights glare from
white<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.239> yellow<00:02:22.450> at<00:02:23.019> least<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:24.130> street

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
white to yellow at least on the street

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.949 
white to yellow at least on the street
lights<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.940> things<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.330> oncoming<00:02:25.660> traffic

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
lights and things and oncoming traffic

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.500 
lights and things and oncoming traffic
which<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.470> course<00:02:26.500> is<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.310> duller<00:02:27.760> light<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
which of course is a duller light you

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.570 
which of course is a duller light you
know<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.660> yet<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.200> does<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.709> could<00:02:30.100> wear<00:02:30.310> him<00:02:30.459> at

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
know and yet it does I could wear him at

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.380 
know and yet it does I could wear him at
night<00:02:30.790> but<00:02:32.790> visibility<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.940> little<00:02:34.150> dimmer

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
night but visibility is a little dimmer

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.330 
night but visibility is a little dimmer
because<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.019> does<00:02:35.200> dim<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.680> glare<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:35.980> felt

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
because it does dim the glare I felt

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.320 
because it does dim the glare I felt
like<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> street<00:02:36.790> lights<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.090> everything

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
like the street lights and everything

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.699 
like the street lights and everything
weren't<00:02:37.630> as<00:02:37.750> bright<00:02:38.019> when<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.290> was<00:02:38.500> wearing

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
weren't as bright when I was wearing

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.650 
weren't as bright when I was wearing
these<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.760> really<00:02:40.299> wouldn't<00:02:40.600> recommend

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
these so I really wouldn't recommend

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.570 
these so I really wouldn't recommend
these<00:02:41.170> probably<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.560> driving<00:02:41.860> around<00:02:42.010> town<00:02:42.310> I

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
these probably for driving around town I

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.830 
these probably for driving around town I
didn't<00:02:42.790> feel<00:02:42.940> comfortable<00:02:43.120> with<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.569> parked

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
didn't feel comfortable with the parked

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.390 
didn't feel comfortable with the parked
cars<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.170> everything<00:02:44.530> next<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.040> me<00:02:45.160> and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
cars and everything next to me and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.699 
cars and everything next to me and
trying<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.180> know<00:02:46.209> navigate<00:02:46.959> tight<00:02:47.290> stuff

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
trying to you know navigate tight stuff

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.199 
trying to you know navigate tight stuff
or<00:02:47.920> maybe<00:02:48.069> have<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> cab<00:02:48.579> or<00:02:48.820> something<00:02:48.850> right

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
or maybe have a cab or something right

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.640 
or maybe have a cab or something right
out<00:02:49.390> there<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.900> didn't<00:02:50.320> know<00:02:50.440> if<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.620> could

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
out there I didn't know if I could

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.770 
out there I didn't know if I could
necessarily<00:02:50.920> see<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.459> as<00:02:51.610> well<00:02:51.760> but<00:02:52.570> for

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
necessarily see it as well but for

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.420 
necessarily see it as well but for
driving<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> highway<00:02:53.680> or<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.920> freeway

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
driving on the highway or the freeway

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.979 
driving on the highway or the freeway
like<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.940> said<00:02:55.150> where<00:02:55.299> you're<00:02:55.390> being<00:02:55.480> blinded

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
like I said where you're being blinded

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.199 
like I said where you're being blinded
by<00:02:56.049> all<00:02:56.140> coming<00:02:56.560> traffic<00:02:57.070> then<00:02:57.880> these<00:02:58.030> might

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
by all coming traffic then these might

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.150 
by all coming traffic then these might
work<00:02:58.239> well<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.630> guess<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.290> give<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.680> maybe

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
work well I guess I can give you a maybe

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.550 
work well I guess I can give you a maybe
I<00:03:00.609> think<00:03:01.030> they<00:03:01.390> could<00:03:01.630> work<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.019> cut<00:03:02.200> down<00:03:02.380> on

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
I think they could work to cut down on

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.289 
I think they could work to cut down on
that<00:03:02.590> glare<00:03:03.070> but<00:03:03.489> I'm<00:03:03.670> gonna<00:03:03.760> have<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.000> find
