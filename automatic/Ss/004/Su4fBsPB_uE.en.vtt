the<00:07:11.920> go<00:07:12.100> the<00:07:12.280> best<00:07:12.460> thing<00:07:12.640> it<00:07:12.730> can<00:07:12.850> do<00:07:12.970> is

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
the go the best thing it can do is

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.460 
the go the best thing it can do is
actually<00:07:13.270> pinch<00:07:13.660> your<00:07:13.780> cheeks<00:07:14.050> but<00:07:14.290> if<00:07:14.380> you

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
actually pinch your cheeks but if you

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.680 
actually pinch your cheeks but if you
can't<00:07:14.710> do<00:07:14.860> that<00:07:15.240> basically<00:07:16.240> the<00:07:16.570> only

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
can't do that basically the only

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.930 
can't do that basically the only
alternative<00:07:17.410> is<00:07:17.530> to<00:07:17.710> take<00:07:17.740> your<00:07:18.220> brush<00:07:18.910> and

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
alternative is to take your brush and

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.460 
alternative is to take your brush and
just<00:07:19.300> kind<00:07:19.720> of<00:07:19.750> sweep<00:07:19.900> it<00:07:20.050> of<00:07:20.140> your<00:07:20.260> cheeks

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.470 
just kind of sweep it of your cheeks

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.230 
just kind of sweep it of your cheeks
again<00:07:20.770> and<00:07:21.010> if<00:07:21.100> this<00:07:21.250> still<00:07:21.490> has<00:07:21.670> powder<00:07:21.940> on<00:07:22.150> it

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
again and if this still has powder on it

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.180 
again and if this still has powder on it
you<00:07:22.360> don't<00:07:22.540> need<00:07:22.690> to<00:07:22.810> apply<00:07:23.020> more<00:07:23.230> powder<00:07:23.440> but

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
you don't need to apply more powder but
