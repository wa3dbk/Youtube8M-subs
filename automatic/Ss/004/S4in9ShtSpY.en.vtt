00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
then start piping on the border it's

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
then start piping on the border it's
basically<00:01:48.970> pressing<00:01:49.970> staying<00:01:50.900> in<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.320> same

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
basically pressing staying in the same

basically pressing staying in the same
spot<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.190> then<00:01:52.400> pulling<00:01:52.729> slightly<00:01:53.300> towards

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
spot and then pulling slightly towards

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.480 
spot and then pulling slightly towards
you<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.290> have<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.740> little<00:01:55.220> bit<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.340> a

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490
