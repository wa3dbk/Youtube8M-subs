 you're practically still nobody saw 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.590
 with my own eyes but about him very much 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.109
 There were a lot of rumors because the company 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.150
 yummy makes the right stuffing 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.760
 on the Internet when you need to dilute from 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 little teaser and people immediately post 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.099
 post news information news from 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.310
 phobias at least 1 6 mentioned this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.199
 phone and news were a little bit 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.180
 controversial for example one of the first 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.880
 news was so in this phone will 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.070
 stand kind processor okay this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.070
 HD screen confirmed 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.950
 Mackey water has not been confirmed in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.770
 a couple of days started writing what will stand 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.920
 only servants familiar to us full hd 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 which already costs heaps-heaps of phones 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.270
 Further they wrote that the phone will be 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 built-in heart rate monitor 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.149
 fine screen five and a half inches 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.430
 well confirmed will get highlighted 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.559
 audio chip for Wi fi sound but it 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 just super because i need something 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.460
 test headphones do yes what 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 I collect all the headphones in order to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.939
 test built-in hype and audio 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.650
 The chip in this phone is good 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.259
 8 megapixel front camera with 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.259
 flash is all news 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.479
 back camera 13 megapixels sony all 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.259
 something else so thick is the phone total 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.049
 only 7 point nine millimeters 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.900
 and the presentation was supposed to take place 23 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.210
 June 23 June is kind of a presentation 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.090
 not exactly wrong here 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.680
 telephone set 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.140
 I do not know what will be exactly there at 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.000
 buying from me so that by the way 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.380
 engineering sample immediately warn 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.509
 in order to demonstrate that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.220
 will go with him 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.409
 put let's see what not 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.630
 loaded no longer collapsible yes he 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.579
 by the way the same news was 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.420
 it is written that it is all-metal 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.399
 there is no way you can figure it out and it looks like 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.790
 the battery has sat down okay since the battery 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.450
 sat down 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.310
 Acquisition cable audigy cable 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.180
 small-to-small charger 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.920
 instruction which lists all 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.020
 technical specifications and technical 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.900
 characteristics on already known 5 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.960
 half inch full and sit and 6753 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.440
 This is a 6 4 bit eight core processor 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.030
 accelerator and 720 pray 3 gigabytes 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 RAM and a 16 GB 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.510
 drive feed about 300 3200 m plus 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.130
 minus milliampere hours set sense 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.630
 there are such accessories 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.760
 Here is such a case 1 2 I think 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.100
 just want a black move yes I 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.050
 guessed here such a case and even 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.880
 I will not open in full review more 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.470
 show in detail and 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.340
 3 all this is very reminiscent 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:58.380
 picking the previous phone yummy 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:02.280
 wait bent at her imax another 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.640
 side and safety glass on 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:11.310
 screen because here the screen is not super 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.700
 protected as he was in yume first 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.170
 impressions about the phone yummy iron before 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.950
 how to start testing i went about 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.959
 your phone clicked on updates on the system and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.590
 it turned out that there is a new firmware here 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.650
 there was a version 0. 0 1 that is one hundredth 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.320
 version 001 is of course cool and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.450
 updated to version 0 0 3 as many as 500 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.610
 megabyte downloaded update system 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.680
 it took to put the phone sd card 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.400
 supports gum or one SIM card 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.120
 microchips 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.489
 both or one sim card and one of de card 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.530
 just like in the user of this is not a chip 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.660
 as well as the power button button 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.540
 volume controls are also on their left 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.489
 although many have said many times 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.310
 people also say why not the right not 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.050
 know 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.180
 no top right connector for 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.000

 small video shot by this camera 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.530
 dual flash so colorful yet 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.680
 one microphone hole and also behind it 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.169
 have a speaker touch buttons like you 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.329

 hold ok google stage and this is a list 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.230
 latest running applications in the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.660
 the bottom right here is this this indicator 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.520
 Event Above Flash Timer Screen 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.580
 conversational speaker and he needed 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.950
 sensors worth immediately out of the box android 5 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.790
 1 antutu shows 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.040
 as many as many, many 33 thousand points 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.260
 6 four bit operating system 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.330
 while getting ready to shoot these first 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.760
 impressions they wrote to me they said that 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.650
 This kelly will report some more 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.360
 The chips that are in this phone are about 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.550
 I do not know yet which has not yet 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.350
 activated and that will only work 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.600
 after updating the next update 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.940
 firmware that is, the error will be soon more 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.419
 Lorraine waiting waiting waiting for more on this 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.210
 I did not find the phone where the heart rate monitor is where 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.729
 I do not see while this phone is worth about 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.580
 $ 180 on sale has already learned 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.650
 the first batch of phones must arrive 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.930
 something around july 10 anyway 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.520
 so promises the description there is a link to 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.580
 additional information is possible there 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.250
 which one will be more recent 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.210
 more recent news and now let's 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.550
 let's see how to shoot 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.639
 let's start the camera right in front of you 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.080
 so that the first part is so switchable 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.080
 front camera without autofocus 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.020
 so the front camera without autofocus 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.580
 we are absolutely not interested and now 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.340
 let's see how on the balcony 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.990
 This is the same camera 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.090
 half an hour nozzle for the sun was still 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.940
 testing cameras and iron 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:56.830
 this sun sunset this wall of the neighboring 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:59.490
 houses sun wall neighboring house Price 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.490
 of my balcony 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.040
 again use their camera sense 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.800
 camera application non-standard like 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.419
 removes but see of course we will see 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.520
 on the engineering version is generally difficult 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:19.960
 judge something 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:24.430
 Well, somehow it removes and let's 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:28.330
 Macro Macro is not here at all 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:32.320
 doesn't want to focus doesn't want to with 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:37.350
 macro shots farther and farther from 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.350
 I can go like this
