experience in terms of knowing the
combat<00:00:46.260> system<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.489> works<00:00:47.730> and

combat system and what really works and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299

what<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.750> doesn't<00:00:49.350> work<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.250> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
what really doesn't work so here you

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
what really doesn't work so here you
guys<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.520> first<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.600> guys<00:00:51.840> need<00:00:52.140> to

guys go first of all you guys need to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900

tweak<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.559> counter-attack<00:00:53.219> system

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
tweak the counter-attack system

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.970 
tweak the counter-attack system
personally<00:00:54.390> having<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.809> guard<00:00:55.140> looking<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
personally having my guard looking for a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.770 
personally having my guard looking for a
long<00:00:56.489> period<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.969> time<00:00:57.059> after<00:00:57.510> being

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
long period of time after being

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
long period of time after being
countered<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.739> pretty<00:00:59.129> harmful<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
countered is pretty harmful to the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.970 
countered is pretty harmful to the
fluidity<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> combat<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.800> guys

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
fluidity of the combat if you guys

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.889 
fluidity of the combat if you guys
change<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.760> pace<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> counter-attack

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
change the pace of the counter-attack

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.039 
change the pace of the counter-attack
system<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.250> more<00:01:05.580> fast<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.390> mean<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.900> would

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
system to be more fast I mean it would

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.710 
system to be more fast I mean it would
probably<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:08.100> better<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.150> guys<00:01:09.360> still

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
probably be better but if you guys still

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
probably be better but if you guys still
want<00:01:10.049> our<00:01:10.200> guard<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.770> break<00:01:11.040> while<00:01:11.520> we

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
want our guard to break while we

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.910 
want our guard to break while we
encounter<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.600> could<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.049> look<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
encounter you could actually look at a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.730 
encounter you could actually look at a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
I think it is a excellent fast-paced
guard<00:01:23.820> brake<00:01:24.090> system<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.990> allows<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.530> fight

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.069 
threes counter system because i feel
that<00:01:32.189> revolutions<00:01:32.970> counter-attack<00:01:33.689> should

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that revolutions counter-attack should

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
that revolutions counter-attack should
have<00:01:34.439> been<00:01:34.650> similar<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> PSP<00:01:35.759> games

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
counter-attack system so what i mean by
that<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.360> we're<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.900> our<00:01:39.930> guard

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
that is if we're going to have our guard

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.889 
that is if we're going to have our guard
broken<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.979> also<00:01:41.549> storm<00:01:41.850> revolution<00:01:41.970> make<00:01:42.689> it

fluidity of the fight again because it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.840 
fluidity of the fight again because it

with<00:02:18.480> defense<00:02:19.080> drive<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.800> kind<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.340> slows

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
with defense drive on it kind of slows

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.400 
with defense drive on it kind of slows
down<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.000> game<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.240> lot<00:02:21.540> because<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
down the game a lot because of the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.830 
down the game a lot because of the
constant<00:02:22.800> need<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.100> break<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.700> guard<00:02:24.090> every

constant need to break a guard every

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.780 
constant need to break a guard every
time<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.380> want<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.680> advance<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.280> opponent

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
time you want to advance on the opponent

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.180 
time you want to advance on the opponent
so<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.090> slows<00:02:27.420> down<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.110> game<00:02:28.140> when<00:02:28.770> someone

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
so it slows down the game when someone

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.670 
so it slows down the game when someone
switches<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.819> defense<00:02:30.030> drive<00:02:30.720> because<00:02:31.260> you

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
switches to defense drive because you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.250 
switches to defense drive because you
can't<00:02:32.010> even<00:02:32.459> advance<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.450> your<00:02:33.630> opponent<00:02:33.930> this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
can't even advance to your opponent this

can't even advance to your opponent this

both supposed to advance whenever we
need<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.850> really<00:02:39.060> don't<00:02:39.450> need<00:02:39.660> as

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
need to in it you really don't need as

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.900 
need to in it you really don't need as
much<00:02:39.870> technique<00:02:40.560> when<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.459> defense

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
much technique when you have a defense

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.670 
much technique when you have a defense
drive<00:02:42.209> protecting<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.140> whole<00:02:43.350> game

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
drive protecting you the whole game

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.740 
drive protecting you the whole game
making<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.580> harder<00:02:44.940> for<00:02:44.970> your<00:02:45.209> opponent<00:02:45.510> to

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
making it harder for your opponent to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.290 
making it harder for your opponent to
make<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> move<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> think<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.090> fence

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
make a move on you so I think the fence

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.640 
make a move on you so I think the fence
drive<00:02:48.600> should<00:02:48.840> be<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.230> throwing<00:02:49.500> out

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
drive should be just throwing out

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.490 
drive should be just throwing out
completely<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.520> that's<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.390> me<00:02:51.660> now<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.230> got

some miscellaneous suggestions that are
really<00:02:56.010> not<00:02:56.160> important<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.330> if<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.600> threw

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
really not important but if you threw

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
really not important but if you threw
them<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.110> there<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.440> would<00:02:58.560> be<00:02:58.680> great<00:02:59.010> all
