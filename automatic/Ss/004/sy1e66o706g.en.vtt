00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 energy report we are at the zenith of limoges with a sledge bernard 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.340
 hello hello you are the organizer of this event that is going 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.639
 open the season for single cause% the trial a request that will happen 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.160
 Friday night for this experience I know I still imagine a big 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.110
 preparation you are there a few days in five 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.800
 yes year there two days to the advanced to almost three more than the amended 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.660
 also we will work until the last minute to prepare the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.210
 course with a request that she does not receive attention 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.579
 there are around 200 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.139
 a ton of equipment to put in place and so that it asks when 

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:33.379
 not even bad at work it is quite when you yourself are you 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.730
 happy you are a motorcycle rider we played the summer but not at all the series 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.370
 bola it's mostly the experience that makes me know 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.540
 this type of course for the best drivers who is going to be the bank 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 Friday night 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.380
 h 10 when we will have the gaps and the graves the global tops what 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.240
 or just explanation because it's true that a lot of people who 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.810
 do not necessarily know the trial what is the motorcycle trial 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.360
 so a very good two neighbors who do not know at all it's of course 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.800
 the bike is the geocompare equivalent evening at the horse show there are 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189
 obstacles that the pilot must cross with her 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.659
 his bike not on the horse 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.939
 % Ouch has no bar to knock down but Pope set foot on the ground so 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.999
 the pilot told a stillbirth to walk through these obstacles there has not been 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.600
 really a kisses area a notion of speed but just a notion 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.810
 Balanced and the thrill to impose the foot on the ground 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.220
 because if one sees from time to time gold tests in limousin of 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.829
 trial 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.520
 good outdoor there I know what's the difference as between the ranks between 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.659
 both for the pilots so the difference between the two is that the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.200
 the obstacles that the world early on concrete type obstacles - 1 pallets 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.989
 wood to ddd big logs of rocks also they can find 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:39.750
 to nature 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 which is kind of the only area that finds nature after gold and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.649
 are really artificial mess 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.279
 beyond the ranks if it is nearly identical everywhere while in 

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.100
 natural environment there are differences in adhesion 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.580
 on the other hand, there is no right to the error because the obstacle t3 is mm of 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.340
 wide and two meters max and then% on heights still enough 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.440
 dizzying autumn hear motorcycles are are also different in trial 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.180
 instead of launching an extremely light motorcycle of 150 cubic centimeters 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.640
 who weighs 60 kilos and one of the pilots mostly use the first one the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.629
 second gear 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.100
 and these are the bikes that have air intakes base 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.840
 the restart with the middle ages a little particular here it is really 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.409
 one of the ten treacherous motorbikes 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.249
 the cyclical ones to do this kind of activities 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.479
 a pilot this Friday night so it's a single pilot bike driver 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.849
 detect% and that will also 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.150
 the attractions of the evening because a bello it takes pretty much the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.340
 same things that do the bikes up as for the bikes forgiveness and it's very 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.679
 very very spectacular 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.839
 what could you say to our listeners for aubin for their 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.629
 make you want to discover a little bit 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.719
 this new type of show here at oceanis so you said it's a 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.329
 real show there is no noise the bikes make very very little noise 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.459
 these very quiet motorbikes is also better 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.250
 background music to liven up the evening and a true light show 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:51.179
 behind with ideas 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.599
 now that are lit independently as a piece of 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.159
 theater with light shows 10:30 screen to see the pictures of the 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.869
 evening hardly that's why it's a real show so even 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.499
 percent see it when you do a little bit and probe a nearly 30% 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.459
 of women who like to see this type of show because it's very beautiful 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.869
 epilogues no integral helmets they have jet helmets as they say is 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.759
 so wooden their attitude to the area c a sport that really will not communicate 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.579
 thoroughly with 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.279
 for the drivers it's still only one competition in the evening yes 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.199
 disappointed elsewhere the final standings at the end of the day for the end of the 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.339
 evening so good it's a little bit of sanogo exhibition will not make it into the 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.200
 championship frame 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.590
 but of course the pilots who come to always want to watch 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.020
 from the north because it's a plus in gold 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.380
 in their career and then to win it's still win here and if 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.200
 fighters and these are really the best they are regulars what 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.919
 those who will be there Friday to Sunday 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.449
 rush absolutely ena 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.989
 for example takai schaffhouse dynamic and the japanese who was a pilot who 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.519
 is 3rd in the world championship 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.799
 the trial which is 4th champÃ©ry monoprix of the north is a boy of the peace the 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.590
 crazy gygax the basin 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.580
 sees him he gives knockouts can not surprise twice and turns 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.199
 the stormy 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.269
 he has a very strong communication and the public in majority to jarno it is a 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.799
 spanish - my name is mozart two years old and thinks so 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.019
 he has an exceptional way of flying janice davis the hamas 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.239
 but also who is champion of england and 8th in the world championship this 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.519
 year is another champion of France and junior world champion the 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.230
 french loris gubian 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.130
 who will be 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.940
 he has the challenge for him and if the landais on the podium and a bike so more 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.280
 serene cyclists wait &amp; see the icc maxime tolu who come chaos he loves 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.610
 not far off that yesterday% vice-world junior champion in 2009 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.500
 for those people who have made the fine strokes of progress lately in 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.810
 team certainly own first name thing however it goes out
