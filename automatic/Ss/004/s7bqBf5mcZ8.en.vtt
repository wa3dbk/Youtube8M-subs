00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 We have just received this personal 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.080
 blue pack here and we'll do a boxing 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.480
 It's here to know what's inside. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 I do not know why it's in here. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.660
 a lie we know it's in here 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.500
 or at least think you know, let's go there 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.480
 so let's see 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.010
 Good, then, no more curling, let's go here. 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.359
 open the box or the envelope no longer 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 I could go from one side of the ball to the other 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:34.950
 then this maxim very well play here 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.620
 in the movie and we have here a box and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.850
 boy exactly what we imagined 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.690
 A cell phone gives charm or just give me a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.110
 Brazil, right? 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.450
 Let's open here is the regime 2 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.329
 It's open to us here now, my dear. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.760
 to see what's inside that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.289
 obviously it will be the smartphone or a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.090
 gold bar is worth more than no money 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.699
 we have here 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.260
 the regime two times here in its color 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.830
 black 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830
 OK 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.750
 I will not leave that side, we'll see what 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.759
 has inside the box inside 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.360
 our looks pretty packaging of a 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:23.360
 marks another but it is not the case nor 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 Let's open here, it's difficult. 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 pine the cute little ones the user guide 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:40.350

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:46.909
 battery everything dearest customer here 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.909

00:01:48.470 --> 00:02:03.720
 Micro-USB charger and one 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:07.530
 usb charger and here in the bottom of the box 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.609
 the orange battery that looks only at the battery 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.130
 of 2,200 thousand amps of the two-stroke regime 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.630
 put here but nothing but nothing 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.340
 There's nothing left, let's clear this table. 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.500
 to put the phone battery to 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.510
 give a call he's here 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.250
 Welcome to Ami and White 6, we find that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.620
 Portuguese from Brazil in Portuguese 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.090
 brazil to advance brazil you see that you do not have 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.329
 many countries in it 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:41.340
 probably all countries that are 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.630
 covered by relaxing the mec where is that 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.940
 come your appliances 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.350
 well here we have the keyboard options not 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.739
 let swift that even that 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.220
 Slip the little fire, she's here. 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.720
 then the interface of the two regime is 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.889
 people already saw a little bit there in the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.569
 launching right 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.959
 an interface here very simple does not have 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.549
 menu is up to only these two screens or more 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.930
 but as you are adding here 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.700
 give a little thread here you can move the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.739
 things I do here or there 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.030
 you can move against the screen as well 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.000
 easily quickly 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.410
 here the least intuitive regime 2 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.290
 As you have seen, it brings a 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.530
 snapdragon 410 processor 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.500
 64- bit architecture with controllers 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.680
 giga-hertz is 1 gb of 8gb ram of 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.060
 internal memory a small screen here of 4.7 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.850
 inch HD resolution is good and the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.180
 interface, we have already said that it is 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.360
 wilson fundation me and hey six, right? 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.440
 dual sim 4 gb is here for 4g 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.200
 it if it works both chips 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.239
 4g works simultaneously then 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.320
 you can put there using the network of 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.800
 two of course not both at the same time 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:01.230
 Time is right but both support 4g 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.780
 ok the front camera has 2 here 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.440
 megapixels the front camera and the camera 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.120
 rear that is covered and secured 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.269
 I 'm not going to draw water at this time. 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.739
 The rear camera has 8 megapixels 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.989
 It's good, cell phone, fine. 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:25.930
 simple input cell up here 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:28.860
 p2p connection two up here to 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:35.229
 behind the speaker is a loud speaker. 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:39.390
 camera and flash led up here back 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:42.580
 the buttons and the ones we talked about in the beginning 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:47.470
 league shuts down here and we here 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.270
 microphone and also the micro usb connector 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.800
 We were messing around here at the interface. 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.360
 we eventually discovered that we always 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.060
 some interesting things for example 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.810
 only the touch button O prefeitinho it 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.830
 I was shaking up cute things here 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.400
 notification here is on the one hand people 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.630
 have the settings here or the shortcuts 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.970
 fast 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.960
 it's a very simple intuitive thing 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.340
 connected to the internet behind 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.080
 the tone oops something very simple some 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.169
 between settings and if you have any 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.470
 Something for us to do here, for example. 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.759
 Simplified mode for example 10 find 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.009
 There will have to be a restart. 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.310
 will see only the river galera despite being 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.289

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.580
 mounted on the android we have 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.610
 you get used to it a little because 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.979
 is a theoretically new system here 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.690
 So we have to get used to it. 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:40.660

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.180
 read the analysis of other users and
