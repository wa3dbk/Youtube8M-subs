box<00:00:54.479> and<00:00:54.839> when<00:00:55.799> you<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.399> box<00:00:56.640> it's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
box and when you get out of the box it's

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.079 
box and when you get out of the box it's
held<00:00:57.210> between<00:00:57.390> clear<00:00:57.929> plastic<00:00:58.350> formers<00:00:59.089> these

held between clear plastic formers these

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.910 
held between clear plastic formers these
are<00:01:00.299> easily<00:01:00.420> separated<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.409> then<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> model

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
are easily separated and then the model

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.700 
are easily separated and then the model
just<00:01:02.039> lifts<00:01:02.430> out<00:01:03.049> there's<00:01:04.049> no<00:01:04.199> instructions

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
just lifts out there's no instructions

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.080 
just lifts out there's no instructions
for<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:04.949> model<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.369> that's<00:01:05.519> ok<00:01:05.880> because

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
for this model but that's ok because

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.899 
for this model but that's ok because
it's<00:01:06.390> completely<00:01:06.659> assembled<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.950> box<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it's completely assembled in the box so

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.450 
it's completely assembled in the box so
there<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.149> no<00:01:09.270> parts<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.840> fit<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.979> chassis<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
there are no parts to fit the chassis is

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.340 
there are no parts to fit the chassis is
typical<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.060> nzg<00:01:18.539> model<00:01:18.569> the<00:01:19.080> rear

modelled in metal the steering is purely

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.380 
modelled in metal the steering is purely
functional<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.459> same<00:01:23.640> tyres<00:01:23.909> seem<00:01:24.179> to<00:01:24.299> be

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
functional and the same tyres seem to be

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.539 
functional and the same tyres seem to be
used<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.810> wheels<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:26.069> wheel<00:01:26.250> design

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
let's try the model out on the test

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.900 
let's try the model out on the test
track<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.740> good<00:02:17.890> news<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.640> rolls

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
track and the good news is that it rolls

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.760 
track and the good news is that it rolls
very<00:02:19.240> smoothly<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.050> straight<00:02:20.290> line<00:02:20.500> as<00:02:20.650> you

very smoothly in a straight line as you

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.550 
very smoothly in a straight line as you
would<00:02:20.890> expect<00:02:21.540> there's<00:02:22.540> no<00:02:22.750> suspension<00:02:23.200> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
would expect there's no suspension and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
steering and it's pretty stiff on the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.950 
steering and it's pretty stiff on the
review<00:02:30.250> model<00:02:30.400> but<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:31.030> reasonable<00:02:31.540> angle

raised it's on a smooth multistage
cylinder<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.850> can<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.120> posed<00:02:43.390> at<00:02:43.540> any

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
cylinder and can be posed at any

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.380 
cylinder and can be posed at any
intermediate<00:02:44.320> point<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.670> tipping<00:02:45.970> angle<00:02:46.120> is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
intermediate point the tipping angle is

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.790 
intermediate point the tipping angle is
perhaps<00:02:46.540> not<00:02:46.840> as<00:02:46.960> much<00:02:47.110> as<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.290> real<00:02:47.530> truck

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
perhaps not as much as a real truck

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.040 
perhaps not as much as a real truck
could<00:02:48.010> achieve<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.600> rear<00:02:49.750> tailgate

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
could achieve but the rear tailgate

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.690 
could achieve but the rear tailgate
works<00:02:50.470> quite<00:02:50.770> well<00:02:50.800> it's<00:02:51.160> not<00:02:51.340> completely

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
works quite well it's not completely

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.670 
works quite well it's not completely
free<00:02:52.030> swinging<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.870> does<00:02:53.020> open<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.470> close

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
free swinging but it does open and close

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.400 
free swinging but it does open and close
and<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.520> can<00:02:54.760> be<00:02:54.790> posed<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.260> main

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
and so can be posed but the main

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.900 
and so can be posed but the main
strength<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.010> model<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.550> is<00:02:57.760> to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
strength of a model like this is to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.070 
strength of a model like this is to
combine<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.390> with<00:02:58.420> others<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.960> can

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
combine it with others so you can

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.890 
combine it with others so you can
produce<00:02:59.290> some<00:02:59.620> interesting<00:02:59.650> layouts<00:03:00.900> overall

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
produce some interesting layouts overall

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.420 
produce some interesting layouts overall
this<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.290> another<00:03:02.500> good<00:03:02.680> quality<00:03:03.130> tipper

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
this is another good quality tipper

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.310 
this is another good quality tipper
model<00:03:03.700> from<00:03:03.820> nzg<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.630> looks<00:03:04.810> good<00:03:05.050> in<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
model from nzg and it looks good in the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.980 
model from nzg and it looks good in the
eurovia<00:03:05.800> livery<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:07.180> main<00:03:07.360> features<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.780> the

eurovia livery the main features of the

eurovia livery the main features of the
model<00:03:08.230> work<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.830> detailing<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.370> pretty

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
model work and the detailing is pretty

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.970 
model work and the detailing is pretty
good<00:03:09.960> it's<00:03:10.960> certainly<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.350> model<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.650> poses

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
good it's certainly a model that poses

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.800 
good it's certainly a model that poses
well<00:03:12.310> with<00:03:12.490> other<00:03:12.640> construction<00:03:13.240> models<00:03:13.390> and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
well with other construction models and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.860 
well with other construction models and
it's<00:03:14.230> recommended
