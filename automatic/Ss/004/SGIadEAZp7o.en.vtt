00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
probe scout not really worth the

probe scout not really worth the
investment<00:02:10.050> unless<00:02:10.470> you're<00:02:10.709> doing<00:02:10.830> some

on<00:02:23.120> yet<00:02:23.269> looks<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.319> probe<00:02:24.530> was<00:02:24.680> headed<00:02:24.950> out

on yet looks like a probe was headed out

on yet looks like a probe was headed out
interesting<00:02:25.939> that<00:02:26.060> probe<00:02:26.269> going<00:02:26.480> all<00:02:26.659> the<00:02:26.750> way

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
interesting that probe going all the way

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.039 
interesting that probe going all the way
around<00:02:26.959> not<00:02:27.890> sure<00:02:28.040> what<00:02:28.159> that<00:02:28.189> was<00:02:28.340> about<00:02:29.049> from

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
around not sure what that was about from

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.509 
around not sure what that was about from
cloud<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.530> we're<00:02:30.769> seeing<00:02:30.920> some<00:02:31.159> mineral

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
cloud and we're seeing some mineral

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.670 
cloud and we're seeing some mineral
steel<00:02:31.790> edge<00:02:31.909> right<00:02:32.060> there<00:02:32.139> and<00:02:33.139> first<00:02:33.560> cell

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
steel edge right there and first cell

steel edge right there and first cell
it's<00:02:33.829> been<00:02:33.980> produced<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.400> looks<00:02:34.519> like<00:02:34.639> you

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
it's been produced it looks like you

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.860 
it's been produced it looks like you
purchased<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.150> first<00:02:35.359> cell<00:02:35.510> instead<00:02:35.750> of

purchased the first cell instead of

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.839 
purchased the first cell instead of
going<00:02:36.079> with<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.230> pylon<00:02:37.189> and<00:02:37.340> my<00:02:37.549> guess<00:02:37.700> is

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
going with that pylon and my guess is

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.789 
going with that pylon and my guess is
because<00:02:38.060> he's<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:38.450> annoyed<00:02:38.900> by<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.200> probe

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
because he's just annoyed by that probe

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.679 
because he's just annoyed by that probe

little bit confusing the local because

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.949 
little bit confusing the local because
first<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.090> all<00:03:02.180> he's<00:03:02.299> running<00:03:02.510> away<00:03:02.659> from<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
seller I don't think he spotted out that

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.849 
seller I don't think he spotted out that
pylon<00:03:05.060> cybernetics<00:03:05.780> core<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.139> he's<00:03:06.260> looking

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
pylon cybernetics core so he's looking

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.199 
pylon cybernetics core so he's looking
for<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.040> second<00:03:07.280> gateway<00:03:07.489> he's<00:03:07.730> looking<00:03:08.000> for

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
for a second gateway he's looking for

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.030 
for a second gateway he's looking for
some<00:03:08.389> signs<00:03:08.599> of<00:03:08.689> tech<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:09.409> finding<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:09.829> now

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
some signs of tech not finding it now

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.559 
some signs of tech not finding it now
descending<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.639> six<00:03:10.819> o'clock<00:03:10.969> look<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.299> little

which<00:04:13.639> I<00:04:13.759> think<00:04:13.939> was<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.060> very<00:04:14.299> clever<00:04:14.449> move<00:04:14.689> by

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
which I think was a very clever move by

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.509 
which I think was a very clever move by
cloud<00:04:15.079> he<00:04:15.530> doesn't<00:04:15.769> know<00:04:15.829> if<00:04:15.889> at<00:04:16.009> cybernetics

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
cloud he doesn't know if at cybernetics

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.860 
cloud he doesn't know if at cybernetics
core<00:04:16.669> upgrades<00:04:16.940> going<00:04:17.180> or<00:04:17.299> not<00:04:17.389> so<00:04:17.599> there<00:04:17.690> is

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
core upgrades going or not so there is

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.259 
core upgrades going or not so there is
potential<00:04:18.349> for<00:04:18.620> cloud<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.639> cancel<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.239> I

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
potential for cloud to cancel that I

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.339 
potential for cloud to cancel that I
guess<00:04:20.509> and<00:04:20.719> goat<00:04:20.810> cheese<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:21.079> doesn't<00:04:21.289> look

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
guess and goat cheese it doesn't look

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:22.810 
guess and goat cheese it doesn't look
like<00:04:21.500> he's<00:04:21.620> going<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.889> but<00:04:22.130> cloud<00:04:22.669> a<00:04:22.700> little

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
like he's going to but cloud a little

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.490 
like he's going to but cloud a little
bit<00:04:23.120> in<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.300> dark<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:23.630> regard<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.169> kind<00:04:24.469> of

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
bit in the dark in that regard I kind of

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.540 
bit in the dark in that regard I kind of
heard<00:04:24.590> them<00:04:24.740> too<00:04:24.889> much<00:04:25.010> robotics<00:04:25.460> facility

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
heard them too much robotics facility

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.500 
heard them too much robotics facility
going<00:04:26.029> down

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
going down

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.030 
going down
interesting<00:04:27.320> so<00:04:27.440> we'll<00:04:27.560> see<00:04:27.680> if<00:04:27.710> he's<00:04:27.890> going

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
interesting so we'll see if he's going

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.320 
interesting so we'll see if he's going
to<00:04:28.130> robotics<00:04:28.340> facility<00:04:28.640> on<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.000> opposite

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
to robotics facility on the opposite

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.090 
to robotics facility on the opposite
side<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:30.020> question<00:04:30.350> is<00:04:30.440> is<00:04:30.560> easy<00:04:30.740> going<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.010> go

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
side the question is is easy going to go

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.500 
side the question is is easy going to go
rever<00:04:31.370> tech<00:04:31.550> is<00:04:31.730> again<00:04:31.940> just<00:04:32.180> go<00:04:32.270> for<00:04:32.450> the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
rever tech is again just go for the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.670 
rever tech is again just go for the
standard<00:04:32.810> observers<00:04:33.170> make<00:04:33.350> sure<00:04:33.440> he<00:04:33.530> doesn't

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
standard observers make sure he doesn't

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.520 
standard observers make sure he doesn't
get<00:04:33.830> DT<00:04:34.700> both<00:04:35.390> options<00:04:35.630> very<00:04:35.990> viable<00:04:36.200> for

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
get DT both options very viable for

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.630 
get DT both options very viable for
these<00:04:36.620> players<00:04:36.830> both<00:04:37.100> these<00:04:37.250> guys<00:04:37.430> have

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
these players both these guys have

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.420 
these players both these guys have
fantastic<00:04:37.970> micro<00:04:38.480> both<00:04:38.690> players<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.080> can<00:04:39.110> see

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
fantastic micro both players you can see

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.560 
fantastic micro both players you can see
concern<00:04:40.430> about<00:04:40.610> those<00:04:40.910> Weaver<00:04:41.210> drops<00:04:41.420> so

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
concern about those Weaver drops so

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.360 
concern about those Weaver drops so

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
far reaches the field I kinda I worry a

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.320 
far reaches the field I kinda I worry a
little<00:04:46.220> bit<00:04:46.340> about<00:04:46.520> this<00:04:46.700> tech<00:04:46.910> because<00:04:47.180> if

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
little bit about this tech because if

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.970 
little bit about this tech because if
there<00:04:47.480> if<00:04:48.170> there<00:04:48.260> is<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.500> Reaver<00:04:48.800> drop

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
there if there is a Reaver drop

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.920 
there if there is a Reaver drop
obviously<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:49.520> don't<00:04:49.730> usually<00:04:50.210> concentrate

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
obviously you don't usually concentrate

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.570 
obviously you don't usually concentrate
on<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.110> cybernetics<00:04:51.560> core<00:04:51.770> but<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:51.920> think<00:04:52.220> a

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
on the cybernetics core but I think a

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.090 
on the cybernetics core but I think a
single<00:04:53.270> Dragoon<00:04:53.660> or<00:04:53.840> something<00:04:54.110> here<00:04:54.380> could

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
single Dragoon or something here could

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.500 
single Dragoon or something here could
be<00:04:55.190> really<00:04:55.310> annoying<00:04:55.820> across<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.300> board

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
be really annoying across the board

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.540 
be really annoying across the board
hitting<00:04:56.960> that<00:04:57.160> cybernetics<00:04:58.160> core<00:04:58.280> if<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.460> got

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
hitting that cybernetics core if it got

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.400 
hitting that cybernetics core if it got
dropped<00:04:58.760> off<00:04:58.940> at<00:04:59.120> that<00:04:59.210> location<00:04:59.480> also<00:05:00.050> early

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
dropped off at that location also early

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.660 
dropped off at that location also early
drop<00:05:00.590> is<00:05:00.740> really<00:05:00.980> viable<00:05:01.160> in<00:05:01.430> this<00:05:01.520> map

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
drop is really viable in this map

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.800 
drop is really viable in this map
because<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:01.970> haven't<00:05:02.300> gone<00:05:02.360> over<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.630> map

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
because I haven't gone over the map

because I haven't gone over the map
that's<00:05:03.260> okay<00:05:03.530> it's<00:05:03.710> odia<00:05:03.980> key<00:05:04.160> guys<00:05:04.280> probably

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
that's okay it's odia key guys probably

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.950 
that's okay it's odia key guys probably
familiar<00:05:04.760> with<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.150> but<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.330> got<00:05:05.450> this<00:05:05.570> island

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
familiar with it but you got this island

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.080 
familiar with it but you got this island
this<00:05:06.530> island<00:05:06.710> expansion<00:05:07.250> out<00:05:07.340> here<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:07.940> has

this island expansion out here that has

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.730 
this island expansion out here that has
the<00:05:08.240> gas<00:05:08.390> which<00:05:08.600> is<00:05:08.690> fairly<00:05:08.900> protected<00:05:09.410> you

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
the gas which is fairly protected you

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.780 
the gas which is fairly protected you
want<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.010> make<00:05:10.100> sure<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:10.310> get<00:05:10.400> something<00:05:10.610> out

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
want to make sure you get something out

there<00:05:10.940> another<00:05:11.060> probe<00:05:11.300> trying<00:05:11.540> to<00:05:11.660> scoot<00:05:12.080> up

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
there another probe trying to scoot up

there another probe trying to scoot up
cloud<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.560> don't<00:05:12.800> think<00:05:12.920> this<00:05:12.980> is<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.160> same<00:05:13.370> pro

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.430 
cloud I don't think this is the same pro
books<00:05:13.850> like<00:05:13.970> it<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.300> got<00:05:14.840> killed<00:05:15.080> fairly

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
books like it I got killed fairly

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.990 
books like it I got killed fairly
quickly<00:05:15.740> they're<00:05:15.980> out<00:05:16.100> out<00:05:16.640> there<00:05:16.880> who's

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
quickly they're out out there who's

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.190 
quickly they're out out there who's
checking<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.450> see<00:05:17.540> if<00:05:17.570> there's<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:17.810> secondary

another<00:05:18.920> expansion<00:05:19.190> going<00:05:19.520> up<00:05:19.640> he's<00:05:20.090> got<00:05:20.270> a

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
another expansion going up he's got a

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.430 
another expansion going up he's got a
couple<00:05:20.630> dragons<00:05:20.960> out<00:05:21.050> here<00:05:21.170> and<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:21.320> looks

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
couple dragons out here and it looks

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.200 
couple dragons out here and it looks
like<00:05:21.500> he's<00:05:21.710> sending<00:05:21.920> a<00:05:21.980> probe<00:05:22.160> out<00:05:22.340> I'm<00:05:23.030> not

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
like he's sending a probe out I'm not

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.370 
like he's sending a probe out I'm not
sure<00:05:23.300> if<00:05:23.390> that's<00:05:23.540> a<00:05:23.630> second<00:05:23.900> scouting<00:05:24.170> probe

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
sure if that's a second scouting probe

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.780 
sure if that's a second scouting probe
he's<00:05:24.620> thinking<00:05:24.920> about<00:05:25.010> expanding<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.610> looked

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
he's thinking about expanding it looked

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.710 
he's thinking about expanding it looked
like<00:05:25.850> for<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.060> second<00:05:26.270> he<00:05:26.330> was<00:05:26.420> thinking<00:05:26.600> about

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
like for a second he was thinking about

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.910 
like for a second he was thinking about
expanding<00:05:26.960> but<00:05:27.260> now<00:05:27.350> looks<00:05:27.560> like<00:05:27.590> it's<00:05:27.800> going

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
expanding but now looks like it's going

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.590 
expanding but now looks like it's going
to<00:05:27.950> send<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.190> probe<00:05:28.970> odd<00:05:29.090> additionally<00:05:29.510> to

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
to send that probe odd additionally to

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.990 
to send that probe odd additionally to
scout<00:05:29.810> for<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:30.680> more<00:05:31.370> dragoons<00:05:31.670> on<00:05:31.850> the

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
scout for so more dragoons on the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.230 
scout for so more dragoons on the
opposite<00:05:32.390> side<00:05:32.600> for<00:05:33.350> four<00:05:34.160> local<00:05:34.400> while<00:05:35.030> knee

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
opposite side for four local while knee

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.780 
opposite side for four local while knee
and<00:05:35.630> kind<00:05:36.260> of<00:05:36.320> one<00:05:37.040> additional<00:05:37.460> zealot

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
and kind of one additional zealot

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.630 
and kind of one additional zealot
otherwise<00:05:38.860> for<00:05:39.860> cloud<00:05:40.040> and<00:05:40.220> that's<00:05:40.340> about<00:05:40.460> the

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
otherwise for cloud and that's about the

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.590 
otherwise for cloud and that's about the
only<00:05:40.670> difference<00:05:41.060> here<00:05:41.120> another<00:05:41.360> gateway

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
only difference here another gateway

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.030 
only difference here another gateway
going<00:05:41.900> down<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.410> looks<00:05:42.560> like<00:05:42.680> we<00:05:42.800> see<00:05:42.920> the

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
going down it looks like we see the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.040 
going down it looks like we see the
observatory<00:05:43.520> going<00:05:43.790> up<00:05:43.910> here<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:44.810> yeah

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
observatory going up here and yeah

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.240 
observatory going up here and yeah
Observatory<00:05:45.530> on<00:05:45.620> both<00:05:45.740> sides<00:05:45.980> so<00:05:46.100> both

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
Observatory on both sides so both

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.380 
Observatory on both sides so both
players<00:05:46.520> just<00:05:46.790> making<00:05:47.030> sure<00:05:47.150> they're<00:05:47.270> not

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
players just making sure they're not

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.150 
players just making sure they're not
going<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.570> get<00:05:47.720> dark<00:05:48.470> tampo<00:05:48.740> dropped<00:05:48.980> third

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
going to get dark tampo dropped third

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.430 
going to get dark tampo dropped third
gate<00:05:49.370> wig<00:05:49.520> I'm<00:05:50.150> sorry<00:05:50.390> sin<00:05:51.020> gateway<00:05:51.320> yeah

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
gate wig I'm sorry sin gateway yeah

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.900 
gate wig I'm sorry sin gateway yeah
second<00:05:51.770> gateway<00:05:51.920> going<00:05:52.250> down<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.520> opposite

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
second gateway going down the opposite

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.760 
second gateway going down the opposite
end<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:53.210> a<00:05:53.510> robotic<00:05:53.840> support<00:05:54.170> base<00:05:54.320> so<00:05:54.500> going

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
end and a robotic support base so going

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.800 
end and a robotic support base so going
both<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.070> observers<00:05:55.460> and<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:56.090> robotics

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
both the observers and the robotics

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.660 
both the observers and the robotics
which<00:05:56.930> support<00:05:57.710> Bay<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.010> as<00:05:58.190> you<00:05:58.340> can<00:05:58.460> see<00:05:58.490> the

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
which support Bay and as you can see the

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.860 
which support Bay and as you can see the
Dragoon<00:05:58.940> spread<00:05:59.210> to<00:05:59.330> make<00:05:59.420> sure<00:05:59.540> that<00:05:59.720> that

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
Dragoon spread to make sure that that

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.900 
Dragoon spread to make sure that that
probe<00:06:00.320> is<00:06:00.470> denied<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:00.950> an<00:06:01.220> expansion<00:06:01.670> going

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
probe is denied and an expansion going

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.210 
probe is denied and an expansion going
up<00:06:02.000> in<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.180> meantime<00:06:02.330> for<00:06:03.260> local<00:06:03.590> so<00:06:04.010> it's

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
up in the meantime for local so it's

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.500 
up in the meantime for local so it's
really<00:06:04.370> going<00:06:04.520> to<00:06:04.580> go<00:06:04.730> it's<00:06:05.030> really<00:06:05.360> going<00:06:05.450> to

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
really going to go it's really going to

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.300 
really going to go it's really going to
be<00:06:05.570> keys<00:06:05.840> this<00:06:06.050> Riva<00:06:06.710> grass<00:06:06.950> it's<00:06:07.130> going<00:06:07.250> to

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
be keys this Riva grass it's going to

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.980 
be keys this Riva grass it's going to
come<00:06:07.430> out<00:06:07.520> here<00:06:07.580> in<00:06:07.790> a<00:06:07.850> second<00:06:08.150> shuttles

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
come out here in a second shuttles

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.660 
come out here in a second shuttles
already<00:06:09.260> out<00:06:09.410> observer<00:06:10.040> actually<00:06:10.430> observe

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
already out observer actually observe

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.220 
already out observer actually observe
being<00:06:10.880> produced<00:06:11.120> along<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.480> side<00:06:11.660> so<00:06:11.960> and

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
being produced along the side so and

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.630 
being produced along the side so and
that<00:06:12.320> was<00:06:12.440> interestingly<00:06:12.620> time<00:06:13.100> it<00:06:13.490> looks

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
that was interestingly time it looks

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.960 
that was interestingly time it looks
like<00:06:14.260> also<00:06:15.260> a<00:06:15.290> little<00:06:15.650> bit<00:06:15.740> later<00:06:16.010> no<00:06:16.460> not<00:06:16.760> even

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
like also a little bit later no not even

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.400 
like also a little bit later no not even
putting<00:06:17.120> down<00:06:17.270> the<00:06:17.390> expansion<00:06:17.630> yet<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.320> looks

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
putting down the expansion yet it looks

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.870 
putting down the expansion yet it looks
like<00:06:18.650> he's<00:06:18.770> waiting<00:06:18.950> kind<00:06:19.340> of<00:06:19.400> preparation<00:06:19.640> to

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
like he's waiting kind of preparation to

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.520 
like he's waiting kind of preparation to
put<00:06:20.060> the<00:06:20.150> expansion<00:06:20.540> as<00:06:20.660> you<00:06:20.720> can<00:06:20.840> see<00:06:21.020> but<00:06:21.500> I

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
put the expansion as you can see but I

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.870 
put the expansion as you can see but I
just<00:06:21.830> kind<00:06:21.980> of<00:06:22.010> maneuvering<00:06:22.400> and<00:06:22.490> as<00:06:22.700> a<00:06:22.730> result

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
just kind of maneuvering and as a result

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.010 
just kind of maneuvering and as a result
first<00:06:23.240> of<00:06:23.300> all<00:06:23.390> I<00:06:23.420> think<00:06:23.510> he's<00:06:23.720> going<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:23.900> be<00:06:23.960> a

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
first of all I think he's going to be a

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.910 
first of all I think he's going to be a
little<00:06:24.140> bit<00:06:24.260> well<00:06:24.500> he's<00:06:24.650> going<00:06:24.770> to<00:06:24.830> be

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
little bit well he's going to be

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.680 
little bit well he's going to be
obviously<00:06:25.250> behind<00:06:25.430> in<00:06:26.240> a<00:06:26.330> distance<00:06:26.630> because

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
obviously behind in a distance because

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.820 
obviously behind in a distance because
he's<00:06:26.900> going<00:06:27.020> to<00:06:27.080> have<00:06:27.200> the<00:06:27.320> three<00:06:27.500> gateways

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
he's going to have the three gateways

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.320 
he's going to have the three gateways
but<00:06:28.010> we'll<00:06:28.100> see<00:06:28.250> if<00:06:28.310> this<00:06:28.490> I<00:06:28.790> think<00:06:29.150> another

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
but we'll see if this I think another

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.060 
but we'll see if this I think another
key<00:06:29.540> thing<00:06:29.570> is<00:06:29.750> this<00:06:29.930> observer<00:06:30.290> that's<00:06:30.530> going

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
key thing is this observer that's going

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.350 
key thing is this observer that's going
up<00:06:31.160> to<00:06:31.250> get<00:06:31.370> spotting<00:06:31.700> information<00:06:32.150> if<00:06:32.210> these

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
up to get spotting information if these

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.300 
up to get spotting information if these
observe<00:06:32.630> that<00:06:33.260> observer<00:06:33.740> can<00:06:33.890> be<00:06:34.010> caught<00:06:34.190> out

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
observe that observer can be caught out

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.190 
observe that observer can be caught out
in<00:06:34.340> the<00:06:34.430> field<00:06:34.670> if<00:06:34.910> it<00:06:35.330> can<00:06:35.480> deny<00:06:36.020> that

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
in the field if it can deny that

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.690 
in the field if it can deny that
additional<00:06:36.620> information<00:06:37.130> which<00:06:37.250> i<00:06:37.400> think<00:06:37.460> is

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
additional information which i think is

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.220 
additional information which i think is
observe<00:06:38.420> is<00:06:38.540> passing<00:06:38.810> right<00:06:38.900> there<00:06:39.050> and<00:06:39.140> not

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
observe is passing right there and not

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.330 
observe is passing right there and not
sure<00:06:39.320> yeah<00:06:39.470> see

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
sure yeah see

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.920 
sure yeah see
turning<00:06:40.610> around<00:06:40.699> spot<00:06:41.120> if<00:06:41.270> he<00:06:41.360> can<00:06:41.510> manage<00:06:41.630> to

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
turning around spot if he can manage to

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.270 
turning around spot if he can manage to
take<00:06:42.110> that<00:06:42.199> observer<00:06:42.500> out<00:06:42.680> before<00:06:43.010> it<00:06:43.100> sees

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
take that observer out before it sees

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.830 
take that observer out before it sees
the<00:06:43.699> additional<00:06:44.030> gateway<00:06:44.270> before<00:06:44.570> it<00:06:44.660> sees

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
the additional gateway before it sees

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.300 
the additional gateway before it sees
that<00:06:44.930> expansion<00:06:45.290> that<00:06:45.500> again<00:06:45.919> is<00:06:46.040> going<00:06:46.160> to<00:06:46.220> be

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
that expansion that again is going to be

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.920 
that expansion that again is going to be
a<00:06:46.340> really<00:06:46.610> big<00:06:46.730> advantage<00:06:47.150> it<00:06:47.720> looks<00:06:47.870> like

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
a really big advantage it looks like

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.510 
a really big advantage it looks like
that<00:06:48.139> is<00:06:48.320> it's<00:06:48.710> going<00:06:48.800> to<00:06:48.860> be<00:06:48.979> brought<00:06:49.160> back<00:06:49.340> so

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
that is it's going to be brought back so

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.500 
that is it's going to be brought back so
it's<00:06:49.639> going<00:06:49.729> to<00:06:49.790> be<00:06:49.880> denied<00:06:50.150> scouting

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
it's going to be denied scouting

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.730 
it's going to be denied scouting
information<00:06:50.930> but<00:06:51.050> see<00:06:51.229> if<00:06:51.290> this<00:06:51.410> probe<00:06:51.620> is

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
information but see if this probe is

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.140 
information but see if this probe is
going<00:06:51.889> to<00:06:51.949> come<00:06:52.070> in<00:06:52.160> the<00:06:52.280> front<00:06:52.400> door<00:06:52.520> now<00:06:53.000> that

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
going to come in the front door now that

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.300 
going to come in the front door now that
all<00:06:53.270> these<00:06:53.389> dragoons<00:06:53.750> are<00:06:53.840> out<00:06:53.930> of<00:06:54.020> position

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
secondary is almost up just quite a bit

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.610

ahead<00:06:57.560> on<00:06:57.949> of<00:06:58.790> clouds<00:06:59.150> I<00:06:59.449> really<00:07:00.169> in<00:07:00.260> cloud<00:07:00.500> in

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
ahead on of clouds I really in cloud in

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
the meantime has that river so a lot of

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.390 
the meantime has that river so a lot of
the<00:07:02.479> it's<00:07:03.380> really<00:07:03.710> going<00:07:03.800> to<00:07:03.860> be<00:07:03.919> important

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
the it's really going to be important

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.540 
the it's really going to be important
how<00:07:04.790> effective<00:07:05.270> this<00:07:05.360> reverb<00:07:05.720> her<00:07:05.810> ass<00:07:05.900> is

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
how effective this reverb her ass is

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.469 
how effective this reverb her ass is
servers<00:07:07.550> just<00:07:07.699> kind<00:07:07.850> of<00:07:07.880> pinned<00:07:08.090> against<00:07:08.389> each

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
servers just kind of pinned against each

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.210 
servers just kind of pinned against each
other<00:07:08.660> so<00:07:09.080> fortunately<00:07:09.650> for<00:07:09.860> cloud<00:07:10.040> though

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
other so fortunately for cloud though

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.730 
other so fortunately for cloud though
he's<00:07:10.400> he's<00:07:10.880> also<00:07:11.090> denying<00:07:11.510> information<00:07:12.080> on

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
he's he's also denying information on

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.050 
he's he's also denying information on
the<00:07:12.889> opposite<00:07:13.310> end<00:07:13.400> but<00:07:13.610> I<00:07:13.639> think<00:07:13.880> it's<00:07:14.000> a

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
the opposite end but I think it's a

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.250 
the opposite end but I think it's a
little<00:07:14.240> more<00:07:14.389> important<00:07:14.780> for<00:07:14.840> cloud<00:07:15.020> to<00:07:15.139> know

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
little more important for cloud to know

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.390 
little more important for cloud to know
what<00:07:15.470> he's<00:07:15.560> going<00:07:15.770> up<00:07:15.950> against<00:07:16.160> that<00:07:16.280> he's

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 
what he's going up against that he's

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.980 
what he's going up against that he's
going<00:07:16.610> against<00:07:16.790> the<00:07:16.880> fast<00:07:17.090> expand<00:07:17.479> but<00:07:17.900> he's

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
going against the fast expand but he's

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.210 
going against the fast expand but he's
not<00:07:18.110> facing<00:07:18.530> something<00:07:18.740> and<00:07:18.950> two<00:07:19.070> more

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
not facing something and two more

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.260 
not facing something and two more
gateways<00:07:19.370> going<00:07:19.729> down<00:07:19.850> so<00:07:20.000> we're<00:07:20.090> going<00:07:20.180> to

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
gateways going down so we're going to

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.200 
gateways going down so we're going to
see<00:07:20.419> a<00:07:20.780> macro<00:07:21.500> a<00:07:21.530> big<00:07:21.950> ground<00:07:22.460> macro<00:07:22.880> push<00:07:23.090> here

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
see a macro a big ground macro push here

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.550 
see a macro a big ground macro push here
in<00:07:23.300> a<00:07:23.330> minute<00:07:23.479> a<00:07:23.600> lot<00:07:23.750> of<00:07:23.870> dragoons<00:07:24.110> in<00:07:24.260> the

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
in a minute a lot of dragoons in the

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.680 
in a minute a lot of dragoons in the
background<00:07:24.950> here<00:07:25.130> a<00:07:25.490> probe<00:07:26.060> being<00:07:26.419> sent<00:07:26.630> out

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
background here a probe being sent out

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.480 
background here a probe being sent out
in<00:07:26.780> the<00:07:26.840> field<00:07:27.050> and<00:07:27.229> it<00:07:27.650> looks<00:07:27.800> like<00:07:27.860> yeah<00:07:28.190> and

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.490 
in the field and it looks like yeah and

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.650 
in the field and it looks like yeah and
that<00:07:28.700> observer<00:07:28.970> actually<00:07:29.270> looks<00:07:29.419> like<00:07:29.479> it's

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660 
that observer actually looks like it's

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.390 
that observer actually looks like it's
going<00:07:29.750> to<00:07:29.840> scout<00:07:30.020> and<00:07:30.139> try<00:07:30.320> to<00:07:30.380> get<00:07:30.560> a<00:07:30.590> the<00:07:31.160> end

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
going to scout and try to get a the end

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.640 
going to scout and try to get a the end
around<00:07:31.520> here<00:07:31.910> and<00:07:32.030> a<00:07:32.200> probe<00:07:33.200> getting<00:07:33.440> killed

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.650 
around here and a probe getting killed

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.170 
around here and a probe getting killed
and<00:07:33.740> it's<00:07:33.889> seeing<00:07:34.190> some<00:07:34.550> of<00:07:34.580> the<00:07:34.700> forces<00:07:35.000> from

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.180 
and it's seeing some of the forces from

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.690 
and it's seeing some of the forces from
clouds<00:07:35.479> starting<00:07:35.960> to<00:07:36.020> push<00:07:36.200> out<00:07:36.460> they<00:07:37.460> might

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:37.700 
clouds starting to push out they might

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.100 
clouds starting to push out they might
be<00:07:37.820> we'll<00:07:38.120> see<00:07:38.270> if<00:07:38.330> the<00:07:38.479> rest<00:07:38.750> of<00:07:38.840> these<00:07:38.900> forces

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
be we'll see if the rest of these forces

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.600 
be we'll see if the rest of these forces
can<00:07:39.350> get<00:07:39.530> back<00:07:39.710> in<00:07:39.860> position<00:07:39.979> in<00:07:40.310> time<00:07:40.460> I<00:07:40.490> think

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:40.610 
can get back in position in time I think

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.450 
can get back in position in time I think
they'll<00:07:40.880> be<00:07:40.910> okay<00:07:42.100> especially<00:07:43.100> these<00:07:43.250> two

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 
they'll be okay especially these two

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.560 
they'll be okay especially these two
dreams<00:07:43.760> to<00:07:43.880> hold<00:07:44.030> off<00:07:44.180> and<00:07:44.330> it<00:07:44.389> looks<00:07:44.539> like

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:44.570 
dreams to hold off and it looks like

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.750 
dreams to hold off and it looks like
that<00:07:44.780> now<00:07:45.260> that's<00:07:45.680> brilliant<00:07:45.950> by<00:07:46.520> cloud

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:46.760 
that now that's brilliant by cloud

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.850 
that now that's brilliant by cloud
bringing<00:07:47.630> the<00:07:47.750> forces<00:07:48.110> up<00:07:48.229> the<00:07:48.350> front<00:07:48.530> to<00:07:48.710> draw

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860 
bringing the forces up the front to draw

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.860 
bringing the forces up the front to draw
the<00:07:48.919> dragoons<00:07:49.280> back<00:07:49.520> and<00:07:49.760> then<00:07:50.180> dropping<00:07:50.539> back

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870 
the dragoons back and then dropping back

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.420 
the dragoons back and then dropping back
side<00:07:51.139> looks<00:07:51.800> yeah<00:07:52.039> and<00:07:52.130> that's<00:07:52.250> going<00:07:52.370> to

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:52.430 
side looks yeah and that's going to

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.070 
side looks yeah and that's going to
really<00:07:52.669> split<00:07:52.970> the<00:07:53.060> forces<00:07:53.419> unfortunately

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 
really split the forces unfortunately

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.300 
really split the forces unfortunately
for<00:07:54.200> him<00:07:54.260> not<00:07:54.410> doing<00:07:54.620> a<00:07:54.650> fantastic<00:07:54.919> job<00:07:55.160> with

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.310 
for him not doing a fantastic job with
