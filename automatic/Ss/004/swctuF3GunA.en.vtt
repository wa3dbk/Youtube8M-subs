 magician who will be showing a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.840
 being most practical way to mount the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.969
 background has six sides not all the same 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.550
 each side has a goal right 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.619
 this thing will have proposal to the other 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.330
 again all the color curves are not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.900
 so disposed 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.019
 I read the orange or yellow post opposite the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:34.200
 white as well as green or little blue 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.239

 christmas shopping blame you ride 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:51.230
 first a cross cross3 is fixed right 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:58.949
 the movement here always the pieces 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:03.059
 on one side and as I said I sit 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.060
 on mobile then always choose to ride 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:21.840
 This group is choosing white 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:24.540
 white is the most practical way there you 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 begins with the white cross, right? 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:42.360
 on this flat screen by the white cross then 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.079
 come on you have a white piece without 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.850
 put this is this and this and this white 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.920
 so where to start looking at the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.049
 parts that is in the middle of any kind 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.170
 the fear of the middle is half to that part 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.579
 half and half and this issue in the feet 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.770
 corner song does not interest us picks up 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.750
 cuba so never take anyway 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.369
 time up there than the same rate as 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.129
 you take the simple ones and you will not have 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.009
 difficulty looking up now at 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.780
 time in this vision here looking so you 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.150
 see what happens 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.200
 so that you see three sides it is 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.780
 easier 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.800
 here you see popular you in that 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.860

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:32.950
 Okay, so you just pick her up and play under her. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:42.310

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.200
 parts of the cross 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.290
 Then you're looking for a white piece of paper, right? 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.050

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.500

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:15.690
 with the vacancy 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:18.160
 I learned that the base can not right and 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:28.680

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:28.680

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.620
 I have to stay or be the part that 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:08.380
 Do you want to put it here tonight? 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:10.120
 she leaves the post or post here where the 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.790
 same way that the white conversation ac 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.140
 Her face was here and here it is. 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:21.340
 That only plays this part up goes 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.010
 want to steal time she'll find the 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.580
 mount the color white 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.980
 Okay, now you're riding the center, it's not 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.140
 the best of the fields, right? 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.710
 the four corners so it is missing the 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.710
 white part 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:46.130
 so are you have the best was mounted only 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:51.360
 missing a detail is lacking here is the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:59.420
 according to the center that has to be 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.420
 white orange and blue must also be 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.620
 if you do it is very simply and simply 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:17.580
 take the moment just get orange 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:21.720
 Low down on white orange 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:36.900
 so you're going to touch 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:51.690
 he stirred until I found a way that I 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:55.260
 I think you found the young white ac 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:06:04.460

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:07.320
 with blue look white blue and red 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.220
 and blue found better use when you 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:16.020
 found the same way 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:17.880
 so today you see that you're missing 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:22.410
 to scale this white with 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.940

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.960

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.650
 hage remembered palm tree second division 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.250
 So you're not just down. 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:39.930
 looking for who 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.920
 He does not think it's the way he is. 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.710
 like this 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:48.450
 now you will observe what all 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.090
 the middle links with the cross is 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.810
