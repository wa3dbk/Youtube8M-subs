pressure gauge reader thingy and now i

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.970 
pressure gauge reader thingy and now i
gotta<00:03:43.810> check<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.440> pressure<00:03:44.590> should<00:03:44.920> be

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
gotta check the pressure should be

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.610 
gotta check the pressure should be
around<00:03:45.280> 32<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:48.120> right<00:03:49.120> now<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.480> 25<00:03:50.020> it's

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
around 32 so right now is that 25 it's

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.990 
around 32 so right now is that 25 it's
pretty<00:03:50.770> bad<00:03:50.950> but<00:03:51.100> i<00:03:51.160> got<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.340> double<00:03:51.700> check<00:03:51.880> it

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
pretty bad but i got a double check it

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:08.000 
pretty bad but i got a double check it
just<00:03:52.150> in<00:03:52.240> case<00:03:52.270> so<00:03:53.910> yep<00:03:54.910> 25
