it to the NFR winning what I have in the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.020 
it to the NFR winning what I have in the
future<00:03:48.989> ities<00:03:49.439> and<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.769> circuit<00:03:50.219> on<00:03:50.430> my

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
future ities and in the circuit on my

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.119 
future ities and in the circuit on my
own<00:03:51.299> horses<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:52.079> i<00:03:52.139> actually<00:03:52.439> have<00:03:52.799> trained

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
own horses that i actually have trained

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.550 
own horses that i actually have trained
and<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.790> think<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.329> kind<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.659> given<00:03:55.379> me<00:03:55.469> an

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
and I I think it's kind of given me an

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.349 
and I I think it's kind of given me an
advantage<00:03:55.919> to<00:03:56.069> because<00:03:56.700> I'm<00:03:56.819> not<00:03:57.030> trying<00:03:57.329> to

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
advantage to because I'm not trying to

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.379 
advantage to because I'm not trying to
get<00:03:57.540> with<00:03:57.719> somebody<00:03:58.109> else's<00:03:59.090> trainees<00:04:00.090> I'm

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
get with somebody else's trainees I'm

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.780 
get with somebody else's trainees I'm
actually<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:00.870> know<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.379> horse<00:04:01.620> from<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.430> start

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
actually I know the horse from the start

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.429 
actually I know the horse from the start
and<00:04:02.969> I<00:04:03.090> know<00:04:03.180> exactly<00:04:03.329> what<00:04:03.930> he<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.260> do<00:04:04.409> and

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
and I know exactly what he can do and

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.439 
and I know exactly what he can do and
what<00:04:04.620> he<00:04:04.680> can't<00:04:04.980> handle<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.639> what<00:04:05.729> he<00:04:05.819> can<00:04:06.090> so

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449

level<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.280> don't<00:04:26.760> care<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:28.590> it's<00:04:29.460> an

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
level I don't care and and so it's an

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.520 
level I don't care and and so it's an
it's<00:04:29.970> an<00:04:30.120> awesome<00:04:30.270> feeling<00:04:30.539> though<00:04:31.020> honestly

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
know oh I trained my own horses and you

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.770 
know oh I trained my own horses and you
know<00:04:37.710> made<00:04:38.009> one<00:04:38.580> all<00:04:38.729> this<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.210> did<00:04:39.449> all<00:04:39.599> this

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
know made one all this and did all this

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
and everything I want it for one in the

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.719 
and everything I want it for one in the
circuit<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.389> Texas<00:04:42.780> circuit

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
circuit the Texas circuit

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.579 
circuit the Texas circuit
yeah<00:04:44.879> it's<00:04:45.509> a<00:04:45.599> little<00:04:45.659> heavy<00:04:45.930> kind<00:04:46.169> of<00:04:46.259> drags<00:04:46.469> I

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
can't jump a little bit I look at a

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.140 
can't jump a little bit I look at a
different<00:04:49.680> standpoint<00:04:50.249> I<00:04:50.580> just<00:04:50.819> look<00:04:50.969> at<00:04:51.120> it

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
different standpoint I just look at it

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.570 
different standpoint I just look at it
as<00:04:51.360> I'm<00:04:51.539> more<00:04:52.080> proud<00:04:52.349> of<00:04:52.409> my<00:04:52.680> horses<00:04:53.099> and<00:04:53.460> what

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
as I'm more proud of my horses and what

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.450 
as I'm more proud of my horses and what
they<00:04:53.759> are<00:04:53.849> accomplishing<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:54.809> and<00:04:55.460> because

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
they are accomplishing and and because

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.029 
they are accomplishing and and because
it's<00:04:56.639> not<00:04:56.819> me<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.419> much<00:04:57.479> as<00:04:57.659> is<00:04:58.050> then<00:04:58.499> all<00:04:58.770> in

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
it's not me so much as is then all in

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.679 
it's not me so much as is then all in
the<00:04:59.219> end<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.639> know<00:04:59.759> they're<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.419> ones<00:05:00.599> that

are shining I'm just kind of sitting up
there<00:05:02.550> enjoying<00:05:03.029> the<00:05:03.270> ride<00:05:03.449> I<00:05:05.689> analyze

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 
there enjoying the ride I analyze

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:11.209 
there enjoying the ride I analyze
everything<00:05:07.650> I<00:05:08.460> mean<00:05:09.300> I'm<00:05:09.539> talking<00:05:10.050> from<00:05:10.710> half

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
everything I mean I'm talking from half

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.700 
everything I mean I'm talking from half
their<00:05:11.610> foot<00:05:12.089> position<00:05:12.659> walking<00:05:13.289> around<00:05:13.529> the

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
their foot position walking around the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.219 
their foot position walking around the
barrel<00:05:14.069> from<00:05:14.639> their<00:05:15.029> foot<00:05:15.270> position<00:05:15.839> and<00:05:16.050> head

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
position eloping in a circle I mean I i

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.290 
position eloping in a circle I mean I i
I'm<00:05:19.469> so<00:05:19.860> critical<00:05:20.460> on<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.819> because<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.149> think

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
I'm so critical on that because I think

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.779 
I'm so critical on that because I think
if<00:05:21.599> it's<00:05:22.080> just<00:05:22.289> like<00:05:22.409> anything<00:05:22.559> you<00:05:22.949> do<00:05:23.099> it's

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
if it's just like anything you do it's

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.429 
if it's just like anything you do it's
muscle<00:05:24.210> memory<00:05:24.389> and<00:05:24.899> if<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.110> teach

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
muscle memory and if you teach
