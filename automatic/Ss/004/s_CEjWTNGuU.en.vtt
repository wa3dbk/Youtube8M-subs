00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.050
 Hi, I'm bonjour, these cooking 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.630
 jaizkibel hotel and today we are going to make a 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.560
 black chocolate soufflé that bases 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.590
 on a cake baked in the oven that 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.500
 inside when split it is liquid then 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.650
 for this we are going to need coverage of 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.630
 dark chocolate and butter that 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.890
 let's melt the microwave that would be 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.190
 300 grams of black coverage and 200 grams of 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:39.429
 butter to melt in the microwave 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:45.109
 then we would have an egg plus 5 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:47.510
 plus 5 yolks and 100 grams of sugar this 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.929
 we would beat everything all point to the point 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.999
 so that everything is creamy and then 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.600
 on the other hand we would have to beat 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:59.540
 snow point 5 light 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.910
 or 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.030
 and finally mix and we already for the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.400
 final 80 grams of flour we are going to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.600
 start let's put the coverage with 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.600
 the butter in the microwave 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.290
 we can at an average temperature and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.750
 as the minutes go by let's go 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.550
 turning to avoid burning in 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.420
 the cover meanwhile what we're going 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.640
 to do let's take the egg plus the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.560
 buds and we will mix it with sugar 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.570
 and we are going to beat it 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.650
 we take this time to be 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.430
 go melting the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.340
 the coverage with the butter 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.640
 after beating for a while we leave this 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.850
 creamy texture and that they are a little 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.280
 whitish the yolks good then 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.470
 we have removed the coverage and this is the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.390
 aspect that the coverage should have 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.430
 with the butter without any lumps 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.410
 all cast 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.310
 and what is very important what 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.590
 we would have to do is 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.960
 we have to leave a little time here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.509
 outside so it's tempered that I'm not 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.520
 very hot when you throw them the yolks with 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.590
 the sugar so that it does not stop them from going down 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.940
 here is fluffy now what we're going 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.690
 to do is add to the coverage the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.690
 yolks with sugar 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.150
 and we will be stirring gently 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.220
 do not keep stirring 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.250
 that to not go down the Air 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.770
 buds with sugar is worth it since we have 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.440
 mixed the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.410
 cover to butter the yolk and the 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.830
 sugar and this is the texture that should 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.770
 to have what we are going to reserve this a 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.400
 little bit in a corner because now what 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.160
 what we are going to do is the clear and the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.350
 sugar mix them at the point of snow and 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.800
 you know how is this going to do is 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.570
 take a rod we throw the sugar 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.120
 the whites and let's go and start beating 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.210
 until it is fluffy to the point of 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.370
 snow 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.830
 after a good time beating then 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.260
 this is the texture that the 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.200
 whipped cream and now what we're going to 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.960
 to do is to mix it with the previous one 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.860
 butter mixture 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.130
 the yolks and sugar as we are going to go to 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.130
 it 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.500
 let's go mixing little by little 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.210
 little by little so as not to take away the air of 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.750
 the Clares 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.910
 we have mixed all the whites in the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.800
 previous bowl that we had here we have 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:58.390
 mixed with the coverage and it's already in 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.350
 is this texture 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.780
 creamy and the last we have left is 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.810
 add the flour we are going to sift the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.069
 flour a sifting we will be adding 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.069
 the mixture little by little 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.949
 and we will continue to involve 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.350
 finished with all the sifted flour 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:24.889
 in the mix you see that now has a 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.969
 more mousse type look 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.849
 and we are going to mix it well without getting off 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.479
 being already all uniform we leave it 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.179
 rest 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.939
 let's let it rest about 5 or 10 

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:41.449
 minutes and once rested what we're going 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:44.220
 to do is put it in a metal ring 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.840
 I have it here 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.330
 we have only wrapped with a paper 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.760
 sulfurized that is a special role 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.600
 for oven 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.120
 so that when you put the mixture of the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.940
 Soufflé does not stick when baking 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.390
 and what we have left is to add 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.400
 the mixture after resting about 10 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.100
 minutes that we have had we are going to add 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.690
 mix 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.840
 long we have with the paper 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.840
 sulfurized 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.009
 let's be careful not to stain 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:21.120
 the edges and what we're going to fill it with is 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:23.520
 half and a little bit more because you have to 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.800
 realize that this is a souffle 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.050
 what this is going to inflate to rise and this 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.070
 Once cold, we can leave it in the 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:38.280
 camera for a time about two hours 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.310
 or three hours you are going to sit and then 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.440
 in the oven at about 180 degrees during 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.050
 eight minutes well we have already taken the 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.180
 oven that suffers and now what we lack 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.440
 is to tie it we usually place it 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.570
 in this way with a raspberry complexion 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.850
 a decoration of mint and tangerine and 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.479
 an ice cream ball then now it's 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.479
 comes the complicated 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.400
 that does not break the souffle what 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.400
 we do it with a knife 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:15.620
 this afternoon was used 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.620
 and now we remove the mold 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.690
 we carefully remove the paper 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.690
 sulfurized 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.550
 and we place it 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.060
 and to finish we put an ice cream 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.060
 yogurt 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.110
 Homemade 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:44.909
 that would be the super 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.669
 and now we can break it 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.320
 to see how it is and inside
