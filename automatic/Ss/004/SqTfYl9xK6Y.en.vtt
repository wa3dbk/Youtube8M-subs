00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940 
three we're gonna mix our dry
ingredients<00:01:57.360> together<00:01:57.900> so<00:01:58.470> we're<00:01:58.560> gonna<00:01:58.680> take

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
ingredients together so we're gonna take

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.000 
ingredients together so we're gonna take
our<00:01:59.310> flour<00:02:00.240> our<00:02:00.810> cocoa<00:02:01.350> powder<00:02:01.560> baking<00:02:01.860> soda

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
our flour our cocoa powder baking soda

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.969 
our flour our cocoa powder baking soda
our<00:02:02.490> baking<00:02:02.760> powder<00:02:03.030> our<00:02:03.390> salt<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.140> our

our baking powder our salt and our
crushed<00:02:05.340> Oreo<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.030> sift<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.200> all<00:02:07.380> together<00:02:07.650> so

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
crushed Oreo and sift it all together so

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.400 
crushed Oreo and sift it all together so
for<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> crushed<00:02:08.459> Oreo<00:02:08.820> before<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.780> sift<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
for the crushed Oreo before you sift it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.020 
for the crushed Oreo before you sift it
obviously<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.130> gonna<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.520> finer<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
obviously it's gonna have to be finer so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.460 
obviously it's gonna have to be finer so
we're<00:02:12.150> gonna<00:02:12.240> take<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.660> put<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.350> food

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we're gonna take that put it in a food

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.810 
we're gonna take that put it in a food
processor<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.920> plus's<00:02:14.340> until<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.610> becomes

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
processor and plus's until it becomes

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.820 
processor and plus's until it becomes
powdery<00:02:15.300> before<00:02:16.020> we<00:02:16.230> put<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
powdery before we put it in with the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.790 
powdery before we put it in with the
rest<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> ingredients<00:02:17.660> step<00:02:18.660> number<00:02:18.840> four

rest of the ingredients step number four

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.680 
rest of the ingredients step number four
now<00:02:20.790> we're<00:02:20.970> gonna<00:02:21.090> mix<00:02:21.300> our<00:02:21.510> wet<00:02:21.540> ingredients

milk our heavy cream our vegetable oil

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.400 
milk our heavy cream our vegetable oil
our<00:02:26.880> vanilla<00:02:27.120> extract<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.780> our<00:02:27.930> water<00:02:28.110> so

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
our vanilla extract and our water so

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.620 
our vanilla extract and our water so
five<00:02:28.770> things<00:02:29.160> mix<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.910> all<00:02:30.090> together<00:02:30.209> until

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
five things mix that all together until

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.720 
five things mix that all together until
it<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.110> nice<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.410> smooth<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.250> okay<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:32.610> it's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
it is nice and smooth it's okay but it's

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.820 
it is nice and smooth it's okay but it's
not<00:02:32.760> perfect<00:02:33.209> because<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.810> oil<00:02:33.989> obviously<00:02:34.650> is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
not perfect because the oil obviously is

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.870 
not perfect because the oil obviously is
in<00:02:35.040> separate<00:02:35.400> from<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.610> rest<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
in separate from the rest of the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.090 
in separate from the rest of the
ingredients<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.780> whatever<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:37.680> fine

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
ingredients so whatever it's fine

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.830 
ingredients so whatever it's fine
step<00:02:38.910> number<00:02:40.340> five<00:02:41.340> now<00:02:42.300> we're<00:02:42.540> gonna<00:02:42.630> combine

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
step number five now we're gonna combine

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.990 
step number five now we're gonna combine
all<00:02:43.140> our<00:02:43.290> ingredients<00:02:43.440> together<00:02:43.920> get<00:02:44.790> our

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
and now we're done so I don't have step

and now we're done so I don't have step
number<00:04:58.890> 10<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.400> guess<00:04:59.550> step<00:04:59.760> number<00:04:59.970> time<00:05:00.150> is

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390
