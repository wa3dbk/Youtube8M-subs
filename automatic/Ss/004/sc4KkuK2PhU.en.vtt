paper make sure you work one sheet at a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.540 
paper make sure you work one sheet at a
time<00:00:21.590> but<00:00:22.590> we're<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:22.859> gonna<00:00:22.949> use<00:00:23.160> regular

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
just going to have this lying around so

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.099 
just going to have this lying around so
here's<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> basics<00:00:30.510> we're<00:00:30.660> gonna<00:00:30.750> look<00:00:30.960> at

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
here's the basics we're gonna look at

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.959 
here's the basics we're gonna look at
perspective<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> stuff<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.369> another<00:00:32.640> video

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
perspective and stuff in another video

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.520 
perspective and stuff in another video
but<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> show<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> basic

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
but I just want to show you the basic

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.200 
but I just want to show you the basic
workflow<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.579> starting<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> design

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
workflow for starting with the design

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.330 
workflow for starting with the design
alright<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.800> usually<00:00:38.010> is

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
alright so what I like to do usually is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.700 
alright so what I like to do usually is
make<00:00:38.520> kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.270> an<00:00:39.390> oval<00:00:39.750> sort<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> 3d

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
make kind of an oval sort of like a 3d

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.650 
make kind of an oval sort of like a 3d
shape<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.280> again<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.059> harkens<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
shape and again this harkens back to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
shape and again this harkens back to
like<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.320> giant<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.489> rectangle<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> 3d

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
like a giant you know rectangle a 3d

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.029 
like a giant you know rectangle a 3d
kind<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.719> rectangle<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> start

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
kind of rectangle so I like to start

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.630 
kind of rectangle so I like to start
with<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.250> basic<00:00:51.149> look<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.079> mind<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:53.190> as

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
with that basic look in mind and then as

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.939 
with that basic look in mind and then as
I'm<00:00:53.850> sketching<00:00:54.180> I'm<00:00:55.140> sort<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
I'm sketching I'm sort of going with it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
I'm sketching I'm sort of going with it
but<00:00:56.100> uh<00:00:56.239> remember<00:00:57.239> again<00:00:57.480> draw<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.899> your

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
but uh remember again draw with your

elbow not like this this is bad
ok<00:01:01.890> keep<00:01:02.399> giant<00:01:02.699> sweeping<00:01:03.449> arcs<00:01:04.250> with<00:01:05.250> your

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
ok keep giant sweeping arcs with your

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.149 
ok keep giant sweeping arcs with your
elbow<00:01:06.570> keep<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:06.990> keep<00:01:07.409> your<00:01:07.560> wrist<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:08.010> of

elbow keep your keep your wrist kind of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.080 
elbow keep your keep your wrist kind of
locked<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> throw

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
locked and so I'm just going to throw

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.460 
locked and so I'm just going to throw
something<00:01:12.330> together<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.960> let's<00:01:13.200> say<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
something together here let's say this

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.920 
something together here let's say this
is<00:01:13.530> uh<00:01:16.909> let's<00:01:17.909> say<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.780> little

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
is uh let's say this is just a little

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.020 
is uh let's say this is just a little
sketch<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.400> together<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:20.880> whatever

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
sketch that you put together or whatever

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.929 
sketch that you put together or whatever
it<00:01:21.299> doesn't<00:01:21.479> doesn't<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.590> matter<00:01:22.939> alright

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it doesn't doesn't really matter alright

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.370 
it doesn't doesn't really matter alright
so<00:01:24.119> we've<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> basic<00:01:24.810> look<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.229> really

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so we've got a basic look it's really

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
so we've got a basic look it's really
sloppy<00:01:25.650> okay<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.520> you've<00:01:26.670> got<00:01:26.700> your

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
sloppy okay but then you've got your

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
sloppy okay but then you've got your
first<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.200> flip<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
first one what you want to do flip the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.200 
first one what you want to do flip the
page<00:01:29.509> over<00:01:31.159> okay<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
page over okay and now you can see the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.539 
page over okay and now you can see the
outline<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.470> you've<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.009> outline

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
outline now that you've got the outline

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.800 
outline now that you've got the outline
you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.820> kind<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.329> behind<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> you're

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
you can kind of see behind it you're

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749 
you can kind of see behind it you're
going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> your<00:01:37.530> errors<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.640> like

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
going to see some of your errors so like

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
going to see some of your errors so like
I<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.390> wheels<00:01:39.659> are<00:01:39.869> too<00:01:39.990> slanted<00:01:40.500> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
I can see my wheels are too slanted so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.069 
I can see my wheels are too slanted so
I'm<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> draw<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> backside<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
I'm going to draw on the backside and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.080 
I'm going to draw on the backside and
then<00:01:43.590> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.720> continue<00:01:45.720> working<00:01:46.049> with<00:01:46.380> my

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
then kind of continue working with my

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.429 
then kind of continue working with my
design<00:01:48.090> from<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> other<00:01:48.600> side<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.290> can

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
design from the other side and you can

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.859 
design from the other side and you can
see<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.579> already<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> much<00:01:51.720> cleaner

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
see I can already get a much cleaner

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.330 
see I can already get a much cleaner
cleaner<00:01:54.869> understanding<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
cleaner understanding of this of the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.450 
cleaner understanding of this of the
shape<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.820> car<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:58.040> some<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.219> lines

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
shape of this car and some of the lines

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.219 
shape of this car and some of the lines
too<00:01:59.820> when<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> draw<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:00.840> side<00:02:00.990> you're

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
too when you draw it on one side you're

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.420 
too when you draw it on one side you're
not<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.530> want<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> continue<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
not going to want to continue on the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
not going to want to continue on the
other<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.110> may<00:02:04.829> add<00:02:04.979> something

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
other so like you know may add something

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.749 
other so like you know may add something
in<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.880> some<00:02:06.090> fog<00:02:06.329> lights<00:02:07.550> some<00:02:08.550> rear

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
in here like some fog lights some rear

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.969 
in here like some fog lights some rear
views<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.319> let's<00:02:10.500> say<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> didn't<00:02:10.860> like

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
views and then let's say I didn't like

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.970 
views and then let's say I didn't like
those<00:02:11.160> rims<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> perspective<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.599> wrong

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
those rims or the perspective was wrong

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.790 
those rims or the perspective was wrong
so<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.730> may<00:02:14.239> change<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.660> up<00:02:14.780> on<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.290> side<00:02:15.560> like

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
so I may change it up on this side like

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.259 
so I may change it up on this side like
that<00:02:17.680> all<00:02:18.680> right<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.040> then<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.819> get<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.060> one

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
that all right so then you get that one

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.790 
that all right so then you get that one
you'll<00:02:20.420> be<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.540> little<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.989> little<00:02:21.319> happier<00:02:21.650> with

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
you'll be a little a little happier with

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400 
you'll be a little a little happier with
that<00:02:21.830> we'll<00:02:22.430> add<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.550> spoiler<00:02:23.060> on<00:02:23.180> here<00:02:23.420> and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
that we'll add a spoiler on here and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.140 
that we'll add a spoiler on here and
then<00:02:24.860> you're<00:02:25.069> like<00:02:25.160> okay<00:02:25.489> well<00:02:25.760> let's<00:02:26.000> keep

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
then you're like okay well let's keep

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.400 
then you're like okay well let's keep
going<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:27.069> flip<00:02:28.069> it<00:02:28.190> over<00:02:28.900> trace<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.080> top<00:02:30.260> of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
going so flip it over trace on top of

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.839 
going so flip it over trace on top of
this<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.650> all<00:02:30.800> right<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.400> process

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
this one all right this is the process

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.880 
this one all right this is the process
so<00:02:32.030> keep<00:02:32.660> going<00:02:32.690> with<00:02:33.080> your<00:02:33.200> design<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.800> now

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
so keep going with your design and now

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.100 
so keep going with your design and now
let's<00:02:34.819> say<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.090> saw<00:02:35.300> those<00:02:35.540> wheels<00:02:35.810> were

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
let's say you saw those wheels were

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.229 
let's say you saw those wheels were
still<00:02:37.010> not<00:02:37.099> looking<00:02:37.280> right<00:02:37.640> or<00:02:37.849> you<00:02:37.940> wanted<00:02:38.180> to

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
still not looking right or you wanted to

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.660 
still not looking right or you wanted to
extend<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.750> front<00:02:39.069> give<00:02:40.069> it<00:02:40.190> something<00:02:40.489> more

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
extend the front give it something more

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.979 
extend the front give it something more
like<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.849> level<00:02:41.810> point<00:02:42.670> all<00:02:43.670> right<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.810> is

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
like a level point all right so this is

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.960 
like a level point all right so this is
just<00:02:45.140> with<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:45.799> Bic<00:02:46.130> pen<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.519> know<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.730> never

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
just with a Bic pen you know you never

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.240 
just with a Bic pen you know you never
want<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.299> color<00:02:47.569> in<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.019> draw<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.890> first

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
want to color in and draw the first

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.660 
want to color in and draw the first
design<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.940> come<00:02:50.150> up<00:02:50.299> with<00:02:50.330> all<00:02:51.670> right

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
design that you come up with all right

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.610 
design that you come up with all right
so<00:02:52.940> let's<00:02:53.510> say<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.690> wanted<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.079> do<00:02:54.319> something

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
so let's say I wanted to do something

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.030 
so let's say I wanted to do something
like<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:57.700> throw<00:02:58.700> in<00:02:58.849> some<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.860> give

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
like that throw in some of that and give

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.110 
like that throw in some of that and give
it<00:03:01.160> deeper<00:03:01.700> rims<00:03:01.940> maybe<00:03:06.610> all<00:03:07.610> right<00:03:07.760> something

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
it deeper rims maybe all right something

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.979 
it deeper rims maybe all right something
like<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.450> okay

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
like that okay

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.339 
like that okay
blah<00:03:09.560> blah<00:03:09.709> blah<00:03:09.950> anyway<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:10.959> keep<00:03:11.959> doing<00:03:12.260> this

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
blah blah blah anyway so keep doing this

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.809 
blah blah blah anyway so keep doing this
you'll<00:03:12.500> probably<00:03:12.530> do<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:12.920> like<00:03:13.099> 10<00:03:13.310> or<00:03:13.430> 15

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
you'll probably do it like 10 or 15

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.699 
you'll probably do it like 10 or 15
times<00:03:14.000> but<00:03:14.390> when<00:03:14.510> you're<00:03:14.660> done<00:03:14.870> you'll<00:03:15.530> have<00:03:15.680> a

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
times but when you're done you'll have a

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.400 
times but when you're done you'll have a
final<00:03:16.130> design<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.840> actually<00:03:18.019> want<00:03:18.380> to

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
final design that you actually want to

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.620 
final design that you actually want to
work<00:03:18.470> with<00:03:18.829> so<00:03:19.819> you<00:03:20.209> know<00:03:20.299> let's<00:03:20.510> say<00:03:20.600> you

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
work with so you know let's say you

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.809 
work with so you know let's say you
trace<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:21.500> one<00:03:21.680> over<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.010> over<00:03:22.100> itself<00:03:22.519> a

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
trace this one over and over itself a

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.430 
trace this one over and over itself a
bunch<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.569> times<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.930> finally<00:03:24.260> have<00:03:24.410> the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
bunch of times I finally have the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.199 
bunch of times I finally have the
perspective<00:03:25.130> right<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.519> wheels<00:03:25.730> are<00:03:26.000> right

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
perspective right the wheels are right

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.780 
perspective right the wheels are right
and<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:27.799> is<00:03:27.950> something<00:03:28.130> I'm<00:03:28.340> happy<00:03:28.670> with

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
and this is something I'm happy with

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.580 
and this is something I'm happy with
then<00:03:29.299> what<00:03:29.450> we're<00:03:29.540> gonna<00:03:29.630> move<00:03:29.840> into<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.410> the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
then what we're gonna move into is the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.890 
then what we're gonna move into is the
beginning<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.310> do<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.579> color<00:03:31.819> and<00:03:32.090> again<00:03:32.750> this

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
beginning to do the color and again this

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.199 
beginning to do the color and again this
double-sided<00:03:33.470> process<00:03:34.130> constantly<00:03:34.819> doing<00:03:35.000> it

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
double-sided process constantly doing it

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.360 
double-sided process constantly doing it
on<00:03:35.329> both<00:03:35.510> sides<00:03:35.569> this<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.620> really<00:03:36.980> important

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
on both sides this is really important

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.979 
on both sides this is really important
when<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.760> get<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:38.030> color<00:03:38.239> because<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.810> way<00:03:38.930> to

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
when you get to color because the way to

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.379 
when you get to color because the way to
get<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.319> really<00:03:39.680> nice<00:03:40.100> realistic<00:03:40.760> coloring

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
get the really nice realistic coloring

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.240 
get the really nice realistic coloring
is<00:03:41.569> that<00:03:41.959> you're<00:03:42.109> actually<00:03:42.590> going<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.769> draw<00:03:43.069> on

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
is that you're actually going to draw on

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.729 
is that you're actually going to draw on
both<00:03:43.280> sides<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.000> paper<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:44.870> not<00:03:45.170> with<00:03:45.350> not

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
both sides of the paper so not with not

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.110 
both sides of the paper so not with not
with<00:03:45.859> this<00:03:46.010> sketch<00:03:46.340> paper<00:03:46.609> but<00:03:46.910> if<00:03:47.000> you're

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
with this sketch paper but if you're

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.030 
with this sketch paper but if you're
using<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.569> high-grade<00:03:47.930> vellum<00:03:48.410> you're<00:03:48.950> gonna
