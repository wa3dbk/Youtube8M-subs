jump right into this video so the first
week<00:00:20.310> comes<00:00:20.550> from<00:00:20.640> Jeb<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.210> he<00:00:21.480> says<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.020> he

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
week comes from Jeb and he says that he

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
week comes from Jeb and he says that he
is<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:22.830> updating<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> AI<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.970> match

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
is going to be updating the AI to match

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.349 
is going to be updating the AI to match
the<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.109> PC<00:00:25.640> basically<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.820> means<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
the one for PC basically this means that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.060 
the one for PC basically this means that
he's<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.930> try<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.230> making<00:00:28.590> hostile

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
he's going to try and making hostile

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.830 
he's going to try and making hostile
mobs<00:00:29.369> much<00:00:30.590> tougher<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:32.279> fight<00:00:32.520> because

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
mobs much tougher to fight because

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.810 
mobs much tougher to fight because
pretty<00:00:33.840> much<00:00:33.930> mobs<00:00:34.710> are<00:00:34.920> rather<00:00:35.070> easy<00:00:35.520> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
pretty much mobs are rather easy to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.950 
pretty much mobs are rather easy to
fight<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:36.750> now<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.180> basically<00:00:39.180> updating

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
fight right now so basically updating

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
fight right now so basically updating
the<00:00:40.079> AI<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.800> similar<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> PC<00:00:41.670> will

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the AI so it's similar to the PC will

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
the AI so it's similar to the PC will
make<00:00:42.480> mobs<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.620> tough<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.950> they<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.250> on

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
make mobs just as tough as they are on

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.760 
make mobs just as tough as they are on
the<00:00:44.460> computer<00:00:44.850> version<00:00:45.120> since<00:00:46.110> next<00:00:46.350> week<00:00:46.590> was

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
added to population I think that's been

working<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> AI<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.510> slimes<00:01:12.869> work

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
working on the AI to make slimes work

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.039

this<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> screenshot<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.330> test<00:01:15.750> build

and<00:01:16.430> pretty<00:01:17.430> much<00:01:17.460> slimes<00:01:17.850> appear<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.720> be

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and pretty much slimes appear to be

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
and pretty much slimes appear to be
working<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.860> I'm<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.130> entirely<00:01:20.430> sure<00:01:20.580> if

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
working now I'm not entirely sure if

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.899

right now he's holding a sheep and it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.740 
right now he's holding a sheep and it
looks<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.250> he<00:01:26.400> spawned<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.970> slime<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.600> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
looks like he spawned the slime out of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.580 
looks like he spawned the slime out of
the<00:01:27.840> sheep<00:01:28.110> egg<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:29.100> um<00:01:29.310> slimes<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the sheep egg but um slimes are in the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.039 
the sheep egg but um slimes are in the
game<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:32.100> are<00:01:32.250> working<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> most

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
game they are working or for the most

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.620 
game they are working or for the most
part<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.130> should<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.729> slimes<00:01:36.119> fully

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
part and you should see slimes fully

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.740 
part and you should see slimes fully
functioning<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.530> zero-point<00:01:38.040> 9.0<00:01:38.610> update

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
functioning in the zero-point 9.0 update

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.749 
functioning in the zero-point 9.0 update
now<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> mentioned<00:01:40.350> slimes<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> my<00:01:41.490> last

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
now I mentioned slimes in one of my last

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.260 
now I mentioned slimes in one of my last
videos<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:44.070> expected<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.909> slime

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
videos and I was expected to see slime

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.020 
videos and I was expected to see slime
center<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.200> 1.0<00:01:47.100> update<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.880> looks

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
center in the 1.0 update but it looks

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.399 
center in the 1.0 update but it looks
like<00:01:48.090> developers<00:01:48.840> caught<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.229> by<00:01:49.380> surprise

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
like developers caught me by surprise

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
like developers caught me by surprise
and<00:01:50.100> we're<00:01:50.369> getting<00:01:50.729> them<00:01:50.850> sooner<00:01:51.180> than<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.540> had

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and we're getting them sooner than I had

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.490 
and we're getting them sooner than I had
originally<00:01:51.840> expected<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.180> guess<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
originally expected so I guess is the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
originally expected so I guess is the
end<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> update<00:01:56.070> video<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:57.240> wanted<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
end of the update video I just wanted to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.389 
end of the update video I just wanted to
inform<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.869> guys<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> slimes<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:59.219> been

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
inform you guys that slimes have been
