00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
out and it's actually a good idea to do

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.339 
out and it's actually a good idea to do
it<00:02:48.390> as<00:02:48.540> soon<00:02:48.660> as<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.900> can

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.619 
it as soon as you can
especially<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.069> it's<00:02:50.190> hot<00:02:50.370> out<00:02:50.549> but<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.450> not

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
especially if it's hot out but it's not

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.270 
especially if it's hot out but it's not
always<00:02:51.840> realistic<00:02:52.110> especially<00:02:52.769> if<00:02:52.890> maybe<00:02:53.129> you

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
always realistic especially if maybe you

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.910 
always realistic especially if maybe you
can<00:02:53.459> get<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> quick<00:02:54.000> workout<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:55.590> your<00:02:55.799> lunch

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
can get a quick workout in on your lunch

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.860 
can get a quick workout in on your lunch
break<00:02:56.280> or<00:02:56.519> before<00:02:56.700> work<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.329> these<00:02:57.569> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
break or before work so these the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.960 
break or before work so these the
athletic<00:02:58.230> body<00:02:58.410> weights<00:02:58.680> take<00:02:59.489> care<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.790> that

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
athletic body weights take care of that

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.800 
athletic body weights take care of that
and<00:03:00.540> then<00:03:00.600> there's<00:03:01.380> some<00:03:02.150> vitamin<00:03:03.150> juice<00:03:03.480> in

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
and then there's some vitamin juice in

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.440 
and then there's some vitamin juice in
here<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.889> last<00:03:05.130> sample<00:03:05.430> oh<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.299> get

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
here and the last sample oh it's you get

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.539 
here and the last sample oh it's you get
to<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> bigger<00:03:07.019> base<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.829> is<00:03:07.980> also<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
to a bigger base so this is also the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.150 
to a bigger base so this is also the
defend<00:03:08.880> class<00:03:09.120> energy<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.930> then<00:03:10.470> there's<00:03:10.739> um

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
defend class energy and then there's um

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.129 
defend class energy and then there's um
I<00:03:11.459> wonder<00:03:12.359> this<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.510> kind<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.019> an

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
I wonder this is kind of like an

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.520 
I wonder this is kind of like an
all-natural<00:03:13.560> supplement<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.910> probably

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
all-natural supplement this is probably

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.620 
all-natural supplement this is probably
another<00:03:16.530> option<00:03:17.130> versus<00:03:17.609> taking<00:03:18.329> like<00:03:18.599> a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
another option versus taking like a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.490 
another option versus taking like a
sweetener<00:03:19.139> such<00:03:19.349> as<00:03:19.530> oh<00:03:21.019> what<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.290> brand

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
sweetener such as oh what is the brand

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.259 
sweetener such as oh what is the brand
I'm<00:03:22.680> thinking<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.099> I<00:03:23.190> don't<00:03:23.370> even<00:03:23.430> use<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.239> I
