00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 good the chords that we have seen until 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.609
 now they were easy chords from 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.770
 now let's start to see no chords 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.240
 difficult but intermediate therefore 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.340
 I recommend that you have well learned 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 the three previous elections and good 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.940
 without further introduction let's move on from 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.560
 make the chord of 2 major all 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 chords that we do from now 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.020
 we're going to do starting from the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.060
 the minor is worth the minor is a chord that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.769
 we are going to use as a base and from the beginning 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.599
 to go to all the others then 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.670
 I recommend that if you have not done the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.619
 three previous elections if you do not 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.620
 you have everything controlled so the re 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.450
 spend a little bit the ones you have on the blog 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.399
 well ordered, so that the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 you find easy and good I'll make you 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.870
 a short summary to see how to get there 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.969
 even the smallest since from scratch 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 from the beginning a very easy trick is 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.770
 start from the first chord from the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.969
 easier my minor that was these two 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.199
 fingers ok we added this finger to me 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.800
 greater and we would lower everything to the rope of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.339
 down is the whole block of two to the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 next rope to make the minor and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.610
 from this the minors from which 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.979
 let's go so you stay well 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.909
 with this position it's worth 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.909
 I repeat my minor my greater the minor 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.010
 be clear this way these three 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.780
 chords that we have made come and now yes 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.430
 let's see the C major chord instead 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.540
 to start putting the zero chord 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.120
 as we did in the lessons 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.880
 previous and rope by rope we are going to 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.490
 start with the base of the then from 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.200
 it's very easy to get to do it because only 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.480
 we have to change a finger from this 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.510
 position what we are going to do is this 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.040
 third finger the number 3 finger we are going to 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.650
 remove 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.710
 with which we will have this rope 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.560
 step on the fret 2 this rope to the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.350
 air and this rope stepped on the fret 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.990
 number 1 good we are left in between 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.850
 of these two an air rope and this 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.300
 finger that we have removed from here 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.210
 we are going to upload it 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.229
 here to the third fret in the fifth 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.280
 rope is a difficult position to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.500
 get you have to be careful 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.630
 because here there are many strings that pass 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.450
 below many fingers if this 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.950
 string that has to vibrate up this 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.560
 finger 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.750
 while it is vibrating it hits us in the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.040
 bottom part of this finger we're going to 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.439
 cover the sound will not sound bad 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.530
 the same thing here too many pass by 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.359
 below here the first string passes 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.760
 below this finger you have to have 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:41.129
 very careful with that is a chord like 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.989
 I tell you, it's not easy, it's worth this 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.640
 already begins to have a level a little more 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.549
 difficult let's see now what we have 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.860
 rope by rope the sixth rope is left 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.600
 in the air 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.120
 but like the thought of the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.660
 let's try to play from the fifth 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.660
 down 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.470
 the sixth string we will try not to 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.780
 touch it if we touch it, nothing happens, it's not going 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.030
 to sound bad but 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.220
 this note that we have here is the note do 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.740
 and since we are in the finger chord 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.980
 the first one that sounds the tonic note 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.550
 it has to be two we have to try 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.790
 let it be 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.980
 sixth string to the air fifth string with 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.550
 finger three on the number three fret 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.130
 fourth rope number two finger on the 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.410
 fret number two and be careful not to 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.600
 stick on the top finger when vibrating 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.510
 third string has to remain on the air 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.880
 is happening below this finger and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.280
 above this finger but it is 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.350
 the second string blowing in the air 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.810
 we are stepping on the number one fret 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.130
 with the number one finger and very careful 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.230
 of not stepping on the first string that has 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.240
 that this little finger does not sound in the air 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.100
 we are going to use it for nothing but do not 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.320
 waisters much worth having him around here 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.870
 for when we change of agreed to use 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.930
 One last tip try the fingers 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.540
 come more or less straight if you see the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.060
 guitar from the front that look straight 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.280
 the fingers are worth not, it's not things 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.680
 this guy that fingers come in 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.970
 diagonal the fingers have to come in 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.820
 the same sense as the irons 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.340
 if you see that it is hard for you to get to this 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.889
 last string is the solitude more 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.110
 problems 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.030
 reviewing the position you have in the 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.830
 hand is worth if you have the thumb up 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.840
 It's going to cost more to arrive than if 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.870
 you have here back and another thing very 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.319
 important is the palm of the hand 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.449
 people stick the palm here then that 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.219
 It limits the movement of the fingers a lot 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.819
 what you have to do is have the palm 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:45.189
 well separated from the mast so that never 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.650
 is hitting down here and almost if the 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.600
 hand instead of coming from below comes 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.610
 from the front 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.790
 easier you will reach all the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.220
 strings, well, this is the chord of 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.680
 you can memorize it remember 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.770
 by rope knowing which finger goes in each 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.569
 fret or much easier to start from the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.969
 less 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.630
 what is a simpler chord and the only 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:14.100
 difference is to remove this finger 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.100
 and upload the one above 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.500
 of that are two chords so similar 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.230
 that combine very well 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.130
 it's very common in any song that 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.500
 let's see a C major the next I agreed 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.920
 is the minor or the other way around and we have the 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.740
 less 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.960
 the next major chord then 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.080
 makes this exercise change from one to 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.080
 other 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.120
 and good the afternoon of the we did that 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.580
 it was very good with my older so 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.920
 so much we are going to use these three 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:01.760
 chords together we can do for example 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:04.160
 everything after the later my major and 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:11.740
 then the other time and we start again 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:13.900
 where the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.830
 another example of the same chords but 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.930
 just the other way around we started from my oldest 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:30.580
 the minor or greater 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:30.580
 and the smaller one and we return the 2 and the 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.400
 Well I hope you have been flat 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.840
 automobile remembered from C major see you 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.169
 in the next video with a couple of 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.169
 rhythms
