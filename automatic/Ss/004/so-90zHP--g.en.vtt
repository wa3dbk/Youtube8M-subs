00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.529
 very good in this law video is going to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.090
 do with the camera of the mobile but good 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.860
 I thought that since they lasted a little 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.400
 more than expected because I'm going to finish 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.770
 with the normal and good camera presented a 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.820
 power combat in this case it 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.620
 it's about the number one a clone of the emmy 4 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.690
 true that very nice a screen that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.480
 it looks spectacular just like this one 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.700
 is an element almost 58 and the screen is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 see that you shit like this in this huawei 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.760
 honor 4 play that comes with the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.800
 64- bit processors with the snapdragon 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 410 and good at the moment because it is a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.449
 powerful is a power test to see 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.289
 which is more powerful and let's start 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.999
 for example with the antú you see that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.650
 really they have given a number very 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.610
 looked like 19 thousand and so 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.890
 specifications for you to see 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.700
 really good 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.420
 there it is in this case it is the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.049
 he is nothing a 410 there is 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.409
 with 36 the 306 chart and processed 64 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.290
 bits 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.820
 there I am seeing it and this is the almost 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:30.530
 59 25 65 82 sorry there is there you see it 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 of 32 in the mtk since always the 82 and 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.760
 well let's try to start with it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.760
 with the cunning one tutor test like that 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.900
 that we go there 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.850
 how to do the test again 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.290
 and well it's going to take a little bit so 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.120
 I'm going to call it a fast camera so 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.270
 do not get so long, so come on 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.270
 there 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.959
 well there we see 1280 x 720 screen that 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.690
 it's just like the one you have there is the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.050
 number 14 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.390
 and let's now look at the issue of 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.590
 graphics with the graphics that usually 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.940
 continue here in the antonio and the truth 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.710
 that you also notice quite the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.960
 performance if it's too slow 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.940
 in slow motion that yes the truth that 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.650
 I realize that there you can see there 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.280
 you see exactly how it goes to the graph 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.200
 so 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.200
 let's go testing the graphs 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.499
 we'll see 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.790
 well here you see that going to small pieces 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.170
 like tironcito good here always ground 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.719
 go like this and in this terminal it looks like it's going 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.109
 to improve the graph or be brought into account 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.670
 like in the one in number one goes a lot 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.739
 better the graph looked like it was going to be 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.719
 better this graph to be a drained and 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:25.760
 but you are seeing that I take care of 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.439
 with which mounts this number one that 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.609
 it seems that it is better graphically what 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.569
 you are seeing that here it goes as more 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:35.550
 I'm hanging and dodging because it looks much better 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.440
 obviously final difference 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.540
 now we will do it now with the model 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.579
 with 4 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.490
 but beginning was the city that 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:48.390
 mounts him almost 5 82 fits me better 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.090
 there is 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.920
 and good one hundred percent to see what good 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.390
 result turns us over again we're going to 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.550
 see him 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.680
 although he has finished it a little bit 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.680
 before 19,900 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.560
 19,700 there is what it is that gives 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.050
 so good here we have taken 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.270
 we can draw the conclusions that in 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.900
 principle in power they walk the same more or 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.680
 less and maybe a tad of nothing 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.410
 I gave them some 410 but graphics seems 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.759
 be better wrong and we will give a 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.759
 return to the model with more 4 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.030
 to see how 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.430
 and well let's see now which one starts 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.430
 before the device the mobile for each 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.810
 device starts before the game 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.970
 although in this case he has performed 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.970
 before the dragon 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.590
 it's not like mail 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.930
 we give it to campaign mode 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.660
 and we give to the campaign 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.290
 I say yes 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.290
 normal 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.360
 we'll see 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.530
 two 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.550
 and well there more or less state 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.350
 and well very even the truth 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.199
 very even 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.080
 I'm going to be able to 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.040
 later 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:23.740
 it is better than better 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.220
 said retirement and we did not try the best myself 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.220
 previous 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.690
 retirement to what was said because it seems that 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.400
 here you see much better fluency with 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.699
 much better units with him 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.070
 with the mother not that I did not want you mobile 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:51.880
 fixed how fast we have seen you from 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.870
 fast the graph is much better let's 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.870
 see again here in this one 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.449
 You see that it costs more, it costs more 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.469
 move 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:06.180
 look again here in the huawei with the 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:10.020
 mother not ttia you note it shows the 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.789
 graphic of this mobile is much better 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.349
 well, little more to add is to say 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:16.889
 that are potentially very similar but 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:19.080
 the graph that mounts aladrén or 306 is 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:21.900
 superior to amal and 400 the head to see 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.990
 like me that moves spectacularly 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.300
 ok with the model with more 4 and it's going to be 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.969
 a finished right now very very 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.990
 recommended for gamers and for people 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:32.639
 Do not want to spend a lot of money either 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.659
 has a screen that's good the truth 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.939
 that the two screens look 

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:38.849
 superbly good has a good 

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:42.210
 resolution and that's it until here the 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:45.870
 power test is nothing a 410 against 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.400
 almost 5 82 winner the snapdragon 400 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:51.020
 days more than anything for the graph 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.020
 that's all friends I'll be
