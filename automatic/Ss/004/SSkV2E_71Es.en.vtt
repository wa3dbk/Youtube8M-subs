00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.400
 this new build that is the 0.9 point 5 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.710
 I know it's too late because it came out 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.720
 doing everything he does as a mere 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.490
 it's not true like two or three days 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.480
 it does not make me but well we're going to 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.020
 show here some configurations 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.630
 basic things that have not changed anything have 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.310
 changed more the aspect of what is the 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.079
 game stability the bucs all that 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.640
 let's create a world to see the 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.230
 quickly the worlds are created in 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.690
 creative 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.150
 to see it creatively I'm going to put it here 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.450
 to see and see, wait for me, wait for me 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.010
 I'm going to put 0.9 point 5 and we're going to create 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.890
 a world let's see how fast what 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.989
 believe I just say that creates the worlds of 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.600
 fart the mere truth creates us great 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.970
 we did let's see to see how the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.580
 stability let's see the distance if 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.400
 There are still books away because 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.710
 If you do not know, I also had a book that 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.619
 let's see let's see it to the top 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.660
 power and then I see that they did not correct 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.430
 that little bit of distance that good 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.789
 I would get on and the world would tire me when 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.229
 put the maximum distance we see that very 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.060
 good game stability I can 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.950
 I can play very well with the distance 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.780
 overcome I can also walk well and not 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.220
 It gives me no jerks or anything if 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.740
 I'm recording but you already know 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.770
 how is it we see the generation is normal 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.440
 everything normal and for nothing that what I 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.420
 the damn pig damn sheep troll was 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.179
 I told myself this pig that I give you another luxury 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.280
 and I was scared not for nothing that has been all 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.980
 it's more report of wuxi stability of the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.750
 game and then nothing 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.750
 Well I say goodbye goodbye
