00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
down to Ashton Gate I think it's a nice

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.270 
down to Ashton Gate I think it's a nice
big<00:02:00.540> pitch<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
big pitch I think if we if we get in a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.160 
big pitch I think if we if we get in a
rhythm<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
rhythm and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.510 
rhythm and
we're<00:02:04.259> gonna<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.500> hard<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.830> stop<00:02:05.100> no<00:02:05.400> matter
