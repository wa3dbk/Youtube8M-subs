got a very strong team there are a lot

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.240 
got a very strong team there are a lot
of<00:01:24.119> experience<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.650> they're<00:01:25.799> top<00:01:25.979> six

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
of experience you know they're top six

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
of experience you know they're top six
or<00:01:26.430> seven<00:01:26.670> batters<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.060> been<00:01:27.210> together<00:01:27.390> for

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
or seven batters have been together for

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.390 
or seven batters have been together for
a<00:01:27.810> long<00:01:27.900> period<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.189> think

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.810 
have to be our best to beat them so
everyone's<00:01:34.770> being<00:01:34.920> quoted<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.430> saying<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
everyone's being quoted as saying that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
everyone's being quoted as saying that
when<00:01:36.150> you're<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.329> home<00:01:37.320> ground<00:01:37.530> you're

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
when you're on home ground you're

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 
when you're on home ground you're
expected<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> win<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.270> Australian

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
expected to win do you think Australian

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
expected to win do you think Australian
soil<00:01:40.079> gives<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.439> an<00:01:40.590> advantage<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.310> think

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
soil gives you an advantage I think

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.249 
soil gives you an advantage I think
playing<00:01:42.180> at<00:01:42.299> home<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.630> front<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.869> family<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
playing at home in front of family and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.219 
playing at home in front of family and
friends<00:01:43.320> certainly<00:01:43.770> helps<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
friends certainly helps and we know the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.960 
friends certainly helps and we know the
conditions<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.829> gets<00:01:46.979> better<00:01:47.220> than<00:01:47.399> than<00:01:47.909> any

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
conditions are gets better than than any

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.639 
conditions are gets better than than any
other<00:01:48.240> team<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> world<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:49.590> in

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
other team in the world so I think in

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.840 
other team in the world so I think in
Australia<00:01:49.770> generally<00:01:50.310> though<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
Australia generally though the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.280 
Australia generally though the
conditions<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> lot<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> similarities<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
conditions have a lot of similarities to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.569 
conditions have a lot of similarities to
South<00:01:52.619> Africa

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
South Africa

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.630 
South Africa
like<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> say<00:01:54.350> generally<00:01:55.380> conducive<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.399> fast

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
like I say generally conducive to fast

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.130 
like I say generally conducive to fast
bowling<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.570> pretty<00:01:57.689> similar<00:01:58.110> so

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
bowling so that was pretty similar so

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.719 
bowling so that was pretty similar so
there<00:01:58.799> won't<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.189> different<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
there won't be two different to what the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.190 
there won't be two different to what the
South<00:01:59.880> African<00:02:00.149> boys<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.630> home<00:02:00.810> butter

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
South African boys get at home butter

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.780 
South African boys get at home butter
knees<00:02:01.380> locker<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:01.979> always<00:02:02.189> nice<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.610> have

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
knees locker so it's always nice to have

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
knees locker so it's always nice to have
that<00:02:02.969> support<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.570> friends<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.140> families

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
that support of friends and families

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
that support of friends and families

everyone's lips any predictions for next

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.309 
everyone's lips any predictions for next
year's<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.009> bashes<00:02:11.780> well<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> long<00:02:13.170> way

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
year's that bashes well it's a long way

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.530 
year's that bashes well it's a long way
away<00:02:13.350> at<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.770> stage<00:02:14.150> yeah<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> think<00:02:15.330> it's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
away at this stage yeah I think it's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.850 
away at this stage yeah I think it's
important<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:16.050> stay<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.470> players<00:02:16.740> we

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.590 
important that we stay as players we
stay<00:02:17.220> focus<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.880> what's<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.300> front<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.540> us
