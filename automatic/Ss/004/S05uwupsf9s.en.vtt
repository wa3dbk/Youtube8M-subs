testing out my motor idle is kind of
rough<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.760> stalling<00:00:21.660> when<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.869> try<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
rough on it and stalling when I try to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.470 
rough on it and stalling when I try to
put<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.529> gear

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
put it in gear

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.689 
put it in gear
and<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.990> I've<00:00:25.680> been<00:00:25.859> doing<00:00:26.039> some<00:00:26.189> idle

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and so I've been doing some idle

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.019 
and so I've been doing some idle
adjusting<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> always<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.609> test<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
adjusting and you always have to test it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
adjusting and you always have to test it
out<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> water<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.619> back
