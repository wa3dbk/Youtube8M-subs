00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.539 
and that is I feel the hair could be a
little<00:01:45.899> more<00:01:46.140> vivid<00:01:46.619> her<00:01:46.829> hair<00:01:47.039> is<00:01:47.130> definitely

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
little more vivid her hair is definitely

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
little more vivid her hair is definitely
one<00:01:47.700> those<00:01:47.820> aspects<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.450> stands<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
one those aspects that stands out the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.200 
one those aspects that stands out the
most<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> anime<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.280> here<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> feel<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
most in the anime and here I feel it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999 
most in the anime and here I feel it
does<00:01:51.479> look<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:52.079> bit<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> dull<00:01:52.740> side

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
does look a little bit on the dull side

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.740 
does look a little bit on the dull side
and<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.490> really<00:01:53.729> feel<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> could<00:01:54.240> benefit<00:01:54.689> from

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and I really feel it could benefit from

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
and I really feel it could benefit from
some<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.860> lighter<00:01:56.159> shade<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.729> color<00:01:57.000> or

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
some kind of lighter shade of color or

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330 
some kind of lighter shade of color or
maybe<00:01:57.570> some<00:01:57.930> kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.289> gradient<00:01:58.530> something

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
maybe some kind of gradient something

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.800 
maybe some kind of gradient something
along<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.789> lines<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.359> has<00:02:00.479> been<00:02:00.600> done

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
along the lines of what has been done

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.020 
along the lines of what has been done
here<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.409> Micah's<00:02:01.829> hair<00:02:02.070> except<00:02:02.670> fading
