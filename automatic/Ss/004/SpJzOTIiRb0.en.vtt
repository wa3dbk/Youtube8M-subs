00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.910
 hot ass from aaron pc and i welcome 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.369
 heartily to our hands on 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.029
 video this time to the samsung galaxy tab 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.810
 It's a 10 5 inch tablet and we 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.919
 now see the here once 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.199
 I've got something special 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.960
 provide the display turned on that 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.680
 display is an amoled display with a 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.089
 resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels and me 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.339
 have really rare such a good display 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:38.260
 I have to say that later 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.129
 a little bit more 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.440
 Otherwise, let's have a look at the design 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.989
 which is on the galaxy's smartphone 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.670
 oriented here with these frames of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.949
 a bit of aluminum but remembers 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.719
 made of polycarbonate then consists of 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.570
 the back also remembers this 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.100
 perforated differently s5 and feels in 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.510
 our version as if it were with 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 a kind of rubber coated coating 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.350
 league in any case very good in the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.300
 hand here scope of supply brief instruction with 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.320
 of course to recharge one 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.259
 power adapter headset including her 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.720
 plaques essays and then of course still 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.910
 a usb cable 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.520
 here again to see the back too 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.160
 I have to say it's pretty easy 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.630
 465 grams it weighs we see here the 8 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.759
 Megapixel camera with LED flash and on 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.890
 the right side are then some 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.690
 There were connections there 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.030
 on the one hand we see the one on the right 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.280
 micro-usb connection one sees also here 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.560
 samsung can be the thin of 6 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.789
 the thickness of 60 6 mm not maintained 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.819
 if we have such a bird then one 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.759
 lightweight micro SD card slot up to 128GB 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.979
 that this micro sd card capacity 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.090
 here again the back we have 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.679
 so maybe you have two points 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.450
 In short, these are like that 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.619
 pressure points so that later heights 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.979
 can be attached 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.720
 and here again an infrared transmitter 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:05.810
 and one the volume rocker and then 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.160
 the on and off switch you see yes 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.009
 again the display so I have to say 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.230
 it really works so well on the video 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.910
 over in real life very brilliant 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.450
 the whole thing just the high resolution in 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.800
 combination with the amoled technology 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.360
 we probably have many here 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.250
 already can recognize android 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.189
 pre-installed in the current version 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.890
 4.0.2 the whole course then again 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.650
 with samsung 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.330
 out of my own pocket surface me who 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.130
 the samsung specific buttons 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.420
 fight the task manager to call the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.870
 home button and then stop back 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.990
 button 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.670
 the magazine ios again with it 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.260
 so we virtually personalized again 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.620
 You can receive messages from us 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.270
 interest and the display i have to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.820
 come back soon after that really 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.650
 very nice, very independent 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.790
 we have very rich colors without that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.709
 be oversubscribed 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.510
 the maximum brightness is high 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.410
 so that we are good with it in the open air 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.180
 can work 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.640
 we'll see the minimal one now 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.989
 brightness in the video you see actually 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.459
 but nothing like she had 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.320
 still a little something but also this 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.730
 really low to go to 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.860
 example battery can save if this 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.830
 is empty and another cool feature 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.200
 away from the displays is the site sap 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.530
 but only with the galaxy note 3 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.260
 s4 and s5 works with this 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.760
 us on the content of the smartphone 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
 show our tablet 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.209
 of course, then there is the app 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.280
 be installed and even if we 15 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.900
 have calls against it 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.980
 really cool with it 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.690
 Smartphone is not always out of the bag 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.030
 we have to take and of course we can 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.060
 Again, several apps 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.079
 arrange next to each other then 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.100
 to operate effective multitasking 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.390
 otherwise I can keep coming back again 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.430
 highlight the display 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.610
 unfortunately you do not see that well in the video 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.019
 how to see it in real life but 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.820
 Also from the performance a very good 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.630
 tablet we have one if the processor 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.970
 the exynos series installed with 4 x 1 9 ghz 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.739
 and we have 1.3 gigahertz then three 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.350
 gigabyte of RAM and a battery 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.870
 with a capacity of 7900 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.600
 milliard hours otherwise, of course 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.590
 wlan with on board bluetooth 4.0 also 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.760
 and there is also a variant with lte 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.610
 otherwise the internal memory has 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.430
 this model 16 gb big not too much 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.320
 then from the 16 gb from 10.5 are free 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.989
 but we can do it as we said 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.070
 with a micro sd card for another 128 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.450
 expand gb 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.190
 Personally, I am very pleased with that 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.250
 tablet leaves you best again 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.780
 our test by the now also in the 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.979
 video description is linked to you 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.050
 to make your own picture 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.150
 otherwise feedback and happy to ask in 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.230
 the comments I'm not happy 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.580
 I want you even if you like that 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.500
 video a thumbs up if it's you 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.930
 and if we like ours 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.030
 subscribed to youtube channel that's it 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.300
 I'll be fine until the next video 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.300
 ciao
