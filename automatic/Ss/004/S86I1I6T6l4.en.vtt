 tamales that we know are a mixture 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 of inexplicable ingredients that 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.670
 any qualified nutritionist 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.890

 It is Ivan Thays in Peruvian without taste 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.790

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.159
 we had since then and by the lady 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.080
 of tables that there will be a bonus simón that 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.369
 we can take a personal life because 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.210
 we have a lot of people will suffer from my 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.210
 dream above all 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.950
 for that 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.190
 we build but it is not one 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.320
 same periods mind 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.960
 has said that Peruvian food is 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:30.470
 indigestion is simple this is what has 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.520
 written literally taiz in the diary 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.530
 the country of spain pay close attention 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.750
 I'm a lousy host I do not know 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.300
 huariques restaurants and chiringuitos 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.730
 where they prepare the best ceviche or chili 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.190
 of chicken with the recipe of the grandmother 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.790
 I intend to force any tourist to see 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.190
 inca kola between quotes the avenue of 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.100
 national flavor in a country where the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.800
 concept again with my admiration is 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.070
 an unknown or to discuss the fruits 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.950
 I've eaten more cloying never opens 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.950
 quotes under quirky names like 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.320
 sigh limeño and less still do 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.200
 proselytism in favor of Peruvian pisco 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.160
 against the Chilean pisco my 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.640
 favorite restaurants says country are of 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.120
 those of pasta and I honestly believe that the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.379
 Peruvian food is indigestible 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.379
 and unhealthy 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.840
 spectacular dishes of castilla de 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.000
 the gastronomic capital of america 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.220
 continues iván thays referring to the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.530
 Peruvian gastronomy 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.740
 almost without exception it is a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.840
 carbohydrate firecracker cube one 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.870
 inexplicable mixture of ingredients that 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.400
 Any measurement is qualified 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.310
 should ban companies 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.239
 silly stuff 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:02.090
 paris in a kind excluding in media 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.390
 when cutting a cooking and culminates the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.000
 Peruvian and writer with this dessert cited 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.849
 literary every time someone talks about 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.290
 the fame of Peruvian food in the world 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.870
 I think about the deficiencies of a country 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.470
 in need of foreign recognition 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.080
 to feel respect for yourself I 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.510
 I imagine that the day when in a 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.450
 Woody Allen movie instead of asking 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.239
 Chinese food ask for Peruvian food from a 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.019
 of free and of manhattan we can finally 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.520
 feel part of a country with a brand 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.440
 Registered 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.140
 for others it is an honor to represent 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.200
 our culture of his people through 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.530
 the kitchen contribute as chefs to 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.100
 that some day our kitchen has 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.310
 helped that Peru finally be in 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.590
 the first world 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.670
 So what has the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.000
 thays highly respected iván filleting before 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.480
 the world to Peruvian gastronomy what 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.080
 has made this peruvian writer is 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.420
 extinguish and sancochar the effort of many 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.120
 for achieving recognition of our 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.269
 culinary in the world, no, sir. 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.079
 ready to go with everything but with the food 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.289
 Peruvian ever
