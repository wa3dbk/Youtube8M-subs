00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so could check that one out and yes

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.480 
so could check that one out and yes
let's<00:01:58.530> move<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.009> I'll<00:01:59.100> tell<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.460> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
let's move on and I'll tell you what I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
let's move on and I'll tell you what I
think<00:01:59.610> about<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> product<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.600> how<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> works

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
think about the product and how it works

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.649 
think about the product and how it works
is<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> would<00:02:02.759> say<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.060> concealer<00:02:03.450> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
is that so I would say this concealer is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.310 
is that so I would say this concealer is
a<00:02:03.899> medium<00:02:04.590> coverage<00:02:04.829> concealer<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
a medium coverage concealer this is the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.169 
a medium coverage concealer this is the
consistence<00:02:07.710> consistency<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.879> liquid

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
consistence consistency is like a liquid

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.020 
consistence consistency is like a liquid
cream<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.869> guess

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
cream I guess

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.810 
cream I guess
it's<00:02:13.030> not<00:02:13.330> too<00:02:13.570> heavy<00:02:13.930> or<00:02:13.960> too<00:02:14.140> thick<00:02:14.820> really

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
it's not too heavy or too thick really

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.970 
it's not too heavy or too thick really
really<00:02:16.270> quite<00:02:16.540> nice<00:02:16.720> actually<00:02:16.960> it's<00:02:17.860> very

nice if you like me I have a lot of

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.130 
nice if you like me I have a lot of
darkness<00:02:21.250> under<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.520> eyes<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:22.600> runs<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.020> my

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
and I get the dark eyes I think it's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.840 
and I get the dark eyes I think it's
because<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:29.040> don't<00:02:30.040> get<00:02:30.250> like<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:30.700> bad
