00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
9200 and this is your evideo tripod it's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.259 
9200 and this is your evideo tripod it's
a<00:00:30.359> setup<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.779> video<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.030> seems<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.150> do<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
a setup for video and seems to do a

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.479 
a setup for video and seems to do a
pretty<00:00:33.510> good<00:00:33.600> job<00:00:33.750> I'm<00:00:34.170> actually<00:00:34.710> very

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
pretty good job I'm actually very

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.509 
pretty good job I'm actually very
impressed<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.030> far<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.199> let's<00:00:37.860> let's<00:00:38.250> go<00:00:38.370> into

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
impressed so far so let's let's go into

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.180 
impressed so far so let's let's go into
some<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> features<00:00:39.650> so<00:00:40.650> this<00:00:40.830> tripod

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
some of the features so this tripod

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.090 
some of the features so this tripod
comes<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:43.040> 7063<00:00:44.040> H<00:00:44.519> head<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
comes with the 7063 H head on it and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.520 
comes with the 7063 H head on it and
it's<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.309> true<00:00:47.729> fluid<00:00:48.119> head

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it's a true fluid head

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
it's a true fluid head
now<00:00:50.339> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> front<00:00:51.150> here<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
now you can see on the front here you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.130 
now you can see on the front here you
have<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:52.170> pan<00:00:52.860> lock<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:54.119> takes<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.989> much

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
have your pan lock just takes that much

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.280 
have your pan lock just takes that much
of<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> turn<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.680> lock<00:00:56.510> put<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.659> back<00:00:57.900> and<00:00:58.170> then

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
of a turn to lock put that back and then

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.320 
of a turn to lock put that back and then
we<00:00:58.619> have<00:00:58.769> on<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> side<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.850> rotated<00:01:00.269> a

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
we have on the side here it's rotated a

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.679 
we have on the side here it's rotated a
little<00:01:00.510> bit<00:01:00.629> your<00:01:01.409> tilt<00:01:02.040> lock<00:01:02.420> same<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:03.689 
little bit your tilt lock same kind of

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.149 
little bit your tilt lock same kind of
situation<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.260> actually<00:01:04.559> locked<00:01:04.769> already

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
situation it's actually locked already

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.000 
situation it's actually locked already
and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.670> back<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.680> right<00:01:07.680> there's<00:01:07.920> your

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and then back off right there's your

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.420 
and then back off right there's your
plate<00:01:09.000> release<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> top<00:01:10.280> keep<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
plate release for the top keep it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.569 
plate release for the top keep it
rotating<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.590> then<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.859> can<00:01:14.039> start<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> see

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
rotating and then you can start to see

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:21.440 
rotating and then you can start to see
your<00:01:15.439> tilt<00:01:17.179> fluid<00:01:19.009> adjustment<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:21.240> just

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
your tilt fluid adjustment and that just

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
your tilt fluid adjustment and that just
snaps<00:01:21.689> between<00:01:22.109> three<00:01:22.679> different<00:01:22.710> levels<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
snaps between three different levels and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.459 
snaps between three different levels and
then<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.240> also<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.689> course<00:01:24.719> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> off

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
then there's also of course in the off

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.029 
then there's also of course in the off
level<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.049> gets<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> three<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.859> your

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
level so as it gets to three that's your

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.200 
level so as it gets to three that's your
most<00:01:29.939> friction<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.619> most<00:01:31.950> restrictive<00:01:32.549> flow

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
most friction and most restrictive flow

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.749 
most friction and most restrictive flow
I<00:01:33.240> guess<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.859> have<00:01:35.070> off<00:01:35.310> which<00:01:35.579> is

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
I guess and then you have off which is

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.179 
I guess and then you have off which is
just<00:01:36.060> bearing<00:01:36.659> smooth<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.229> mean<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.799> very

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
just bearing smooth I mean very very

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.459 
just bearing smooth I mean very very
smooth<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.759> pretty<00:01:38.939> impressive<00:01:39.380> then<00:01:40.380> you

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
smooth it's pretty impressive then you

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.219 
smooth it's pretty impressive then you
can<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:41.210> centering<00:01:42.210> spring<00:01:42.630> adjustment

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
can see your centering spring adjustment

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.779 
can see your centering spring adjustment
here<00:01:44.090> two<00:01:45.090> different<00:01:45.390> levels<00:01:45.569> of<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.789> the

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
here two different levels of that the

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.929 
here two different levels of that the
two<00:01:47.999> is<00:01:48.179> actually<00:01:48.600> very<00:01:48.960> strong<00:01:49.700> really<00:01:50.700> wants

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
two is actually very strong really wants

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
two is actually very strong really wants
to<00:01:51.030> bounce<00:01:51.179> back<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.289> you<00:01:53.280> got<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.670> one

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
to bounce back and then you got your one

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.359 
to bounce back and then you got your one
of<00:01:54.299> course<00:01:54.569> much<00:01:55.289> lighter<00:01:55.560> spring<00:01:55.829> level<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
of course much lighter spring level and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.559 
of course much lighter spring level and
then<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.639> go<00:01:56.700> completely<00:01:57.030> off<00:01:57.179> it's

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
then you can go completely off it's

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:58.609 
then you can go completely off it's
going<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.749> want<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> fall<00:01:58.170> back<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
going to want to fall back because I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.219 
going to want to fall back because I
don't<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.829> any<00:01:58.979> fluid<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.659> just

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
don't have any fluid on here but it just

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.679 
don't have any fluid on here but it just
completely<00:02:01.859> smooth<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.310> mean<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.789> one<00:02:03.450> finger

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
completely smooth I mean just one finger

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.109 
completely smooth I mean just one finger
takes<00:02:04.259> nothing<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.829> lift<00:02:05.359> pretty<00:02:06.359> impressive

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
takes nothing to lift pretty impressive

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.610 
takes nothing to lift pretty impressive
on<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:10.200> pan<00:02:10.619> section<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:12.470> tripod<00:02:13.470> head

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
on the pan section of the tripod head

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.750 
on the pan section of the tripod head
here<00:02:13.910> there's<00:02:14.910> again<00:02:15.330> three<00:02:15.660> levels<00:02:15.959> of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
here there's again three levels of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.970 
here there's again three levels of
adjustment<00:02:17.760> here<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.710> being

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
adjustment here you have one being

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.339 
adjustment here you have one being
easiest

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
easiest

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.309 
easiest
or<00:02:21.469> the<00:02:22.430> least<00:02:22.670> restriction<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:24.109> it

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
or the least restriction and then it

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.750 
or the least restriction and then it
goes<00:02:24.469> all<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.650> way<00:02:24.739> up<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.040> level<00:02:25.340> three<00:02:25.579> and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
goes all the way up to level three and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.819 
goes all the way up to level three and
in<00:02:25.879> each<00:02:26.030> mode<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.780> snaps<00:02:27.019> into<00:02:27.290> place<00:02:27.379> and

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
in each mode it snaps into place and

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.920 
in each mode it snaps into place and
then<00:02:28.430> locks<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:29.060> here<00:02:30.219> just<00:02:31.219> very<00:02:32.150> very<00:02:32.269> smooth

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
then locks in here just very very smooth

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.619 
then locks in here just very very smooth
again<00:02:33.260> on<00:02:34.099> zero<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.999> can<00:02:35.120> kind<00:02:35.359> of<00:02:35.420> get<00:02:35.540> an

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
again on zero you can kind of get an

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.660 
again on zero you can kind of get an
idea<00:02:35.719> of<00:02:35.959> how<00:02:36.230> little<00:02:36.829> friction<00:02:37.040> there<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.340> if

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
idea of how little friction there is if

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.720 
idea of how little friction there is if
there's<00:02:37.879> no<00:02:37.969> fluid<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.889> wants<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.129> spin

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
there's no fluid it just wants to spin

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.509 
there's no fluid it just wants to spin
around<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.030> rotate<00:02:41.180> real<00:02:41.599> easy<00:02:42.069> if<00:02:43.069> I<00:02:43.219> just

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
around and rotate real easy if I just

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.059 
around and rotate real easy if I just
pan<00:02:44.030> down<00:02:44.239> here<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.170> can<00:02:45.319> also<00:02:45.439> see<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.920> this

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
pan down here you can also see that this

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.000 
pan down here you can also see that this
is<00:02:46.129> a<00:02:46.280> ball<00:02:46.549> head<00:02:47.049> has<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.319> adjustment<00:02:48.859> knob

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
is a ball head has the adjustment knob

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.879 
is a ball head has the adjustment knob
here<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.629> to<00:02:50.840> go<00:02:50.989> ahead<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.290> grab<00:02:51.499> on<00:02:51.680> to

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
here for you to go ahead and grab on to

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.280 
here for you to go ahead and grab on to
and<00:02:52.189> then<00:02:53.200> it'll<00:02:54.200> just<00:02:54.459> float<00:02:55.459> back<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.930> you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
and then it'll just float back and you

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.229 
and then it'll just float back and you
can<00:02:57.439> go<00:02:57.560> ahead<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.829> level<00:02:57.980> out<00:02:58.159> your<00:02:58.310> head<00:02:58.489> to

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
can go ahead and level out your head to

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.149 
can go ahead and level out your head to
whatever<00:02:59.419> position<00:02:59.689> you'd<00:03:00.079> want<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.650> tripod

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
whatever position you'd want the tripod

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.949 
whatever position you'd want the tripod
legs<00:03:04.189> are<00:03:04.699> the<00:03:05.709> 8070<00:03:06.709> 402a<00:03:07.780> they're<00:03:08.780> an

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
legs are the 8070 402a they're an

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.580 
legs are the 8070 402a they're an
aluminum<00:03:09.469> tripod<00:03:10.040> leg<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:11.230> they're<00:03:12.230> quite

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
aluminum tripod leg and they're quite

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.099 
aluminum tripod leg and they're quite
stiff<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.310> at<00:03:13.519> maximum<00:03:13.909> height<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.510> would<00:03:14.750> say

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
stiff and at maximum height I would say

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.369 
stiff and at maximum height I would say
it<00:03:15.290> does<00:03:15.500> about<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:16.069> little<00:03:16.370> over<00:03:16.639> six<00:03:16.969> feet<00:03:17.379> to

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
it does about a little over six feet to

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.879 
it does about a little over six feet to
the<00:03:18.500> actual<00:03:18.829> plate<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.930> when<00:03:21.379> your<00:03:21.500> camera<00:03:21.829> is

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
the actual plate so when your camera is

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:22.869 
the actual plate so when your camera is
on<00:03:21.980> there<00:03:22.159> it's<00:03:22.250> going<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> even<00:03:22.519> be<00:03:22.639> a<00:03:22.669> little

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
on there it's going to even be a little

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.189 
on there it's going to even be a little
bit<00:03:23.000> higher<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:23.209> it's<00:03:23.599> great<00:03:23.810> for<00:03:23.989> getting

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
bit higher so it's great for getting

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.879 
bit higher so it's great for getting
over<00:03:24.260> crowds<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:26.049> just<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.199> get<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.590> shot

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
over crowds and just to get that shot

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.659 
over crowds and just to get that shot
that<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:28.250> need<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:29.209> feet<00:03:29.540> covers<00:03:29.930> are<00:03:30.669> very

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
that you need the feet covers are very

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.969 
that you need the feet covers are very
hard<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.150> get<00:03:32.299> off<00:03:32.479> you<00:03:33.290> can<00:03:33.379> try<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.620> do<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.859> on

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:33.979 
hard to get off you can try to do it on

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.580 
hard to get off you can try to do it on
the<00:03:34.099> video<00:03:34.310> here<00:03:34.579> see<00:03:34.879> if<00:03:34.939> I<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.120> do<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.590> it's

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the video here see if I can do it it's

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.979 
the video here see if I can do it it's
all<00:03:36.829> rubber<00:03:37.189> back<00:03:37.400> in<00:03:37.579> here<00:03:37.819> and<00:03:38.060> then<00:03:38.750> you

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
all rubber back in here and then you

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.539 
all rubber back in here and then you
just<00:03:39.019> pull<00:03:40.629> yeah<00:03:41.629> there<00:03:42.139> it<00:03:42.259> goes<00:03:42.340> comes<00:03:43.340> off

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
just pull yeah there it goes comes off

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.699 
just pull yeah there it goes comes off
and<00:03:43.790> then<00:03:44.540> you're<00:03:44.989> able<00:03:45.079> just<00:03:45.290> lift<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.650> out

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
and then you're able just lift that out

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.559 
and then you're able just lift that out
a<00:03:46.489> nice<00:03:46.970> rubberized<00:03:47.389> bottom<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.970> this<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.180> I

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
a nice rubberized bottom and this is I

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.020 
a nice rubberized bottom and this is I
think<00:03:51.500> it's<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.739> looks<00:03:52.099> like<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.280> plastic<00:03:52.699> and

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
think it's a looks like a plastic and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.429 
think it's a looks like a plastic and
then<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.389> have<00:03:53.479> your<00:03:53.599> rubber<00:03:53.750> outside<00:03:54.199> here

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
then you have your rubber outside here

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.369 
then you have your rubber outside here
on<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:55.430> bottom<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:55.970> foot<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.509> have<00:03:56.720> these

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
on the bottom of the foot you have these

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.990 
on the bottom of the foot you have these
two<00:03:57.650> spikes<00:03:58.090> for<00:03:59.090> uneven<00:03:59.629> terrain<00:04:00.019> and<00:04:01.000> we

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
two spikes for uneven terrain and we

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.520 
two spikes for uneven terrain and we
probably<00:04:02.209> really<00:04:02.389> go<00:04:02.659> into<00:04:02.810> grass<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.439> other

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
probably really go into grass and other

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.209 
probably really go into grass and other
materials<00:04:04.430> software<00:04:05.209> materials<00:04:05.689> really<00:04:05.900> well

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:06.219 
materials software materials really well

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.009 
materials software materials really well
wouldn't<00:04:07.219> be<00:04:07.310> good<00:04:07.489> for<00:04:07.759> your<00:04:08.019> household

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
wouldn't be good for your household

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.649 
wouldn't be good for your household

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.820 
metal pegs those are actually included
so<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:44.960> don't<00:04:45.140> have<00:04:45.230> to<00:04:45.320> buy<00:04:45.410> them<00:04:45.530> separately

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
so you don't have to buy them separately

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.500 
so you don't have to buy them separately
but<00:04:46.160> there<00:04:46.280> are<00:04:46.370> replacements<00:04:46.790> available

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510

but there are replacements available
from<00:04:47.780> Kelly<00:04:48.200> med<00:04:48.670> but<00:04:49.670> overall<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.420> quality

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
from Kelly med but overall the quality

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.070 
from Kelly med but overall the quality
of<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.960> tripod<00:04:51.380> is<00:04:51.680> very<00:04:52.460> impressive<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.270> I

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
of the tripod is very impressive and I

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.070 
of the tripod is very impressive and I
think<00:04:54.410> it's<00:04:54.560> really<00:04:55.010> quite<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.550> good<00:04:55.790> deal<00:04:56.080> when

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
think it's really quite a good deal when

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.540 
think it's really quite a good deal when
you<00:04:57.200> compare<00:04:57.500> it<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.680> something<00:04:57.860> like<00:04:57.980> Sackler

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
you compare it to something like Sackler

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.040 
you compare it to something like Sackler
or<00:04:58.960> Manfrotto<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:01.190> is<00:05:01.370> basically<00:05:02.020> half<00:05:03.020> the

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
or Manfrotto it is basically half the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.070 
or Manfrotto it is basically half the
cost<00:05:03.530> if<00:05:03.980> not<00:05:04.280> a<00:05:04.640> quarter<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.300> cost<00:05:05.540> on<00:05:05.840> some

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
cost if not a quarter the cost on some

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.310 
cost if not a quarter the cost on some
Sackler<00:05:06.650> stuff<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:08.210> that's<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:08.720> pretty<00:05:09.110> good

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
Sackler stuff so that's a pretty good

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.720 
Sackler stuff so that's a pretty good
deal<00:05:09.500> considering<00:05:09.980> you're<00:05:10.220> getting<00:05:10.520> three

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
deal considering you're getting three

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.300 
deal considering you're getting three
fluid<00:05:11.030> levels<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.740> pretty<00:05:13.100> smooth<00:05:13.640> tripod
