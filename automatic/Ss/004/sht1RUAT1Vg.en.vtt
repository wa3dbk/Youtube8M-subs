00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.480
 Hello, Natalia Nekrasov, I 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.650
 today I'll show you how to close the needle 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.590
 gum 2 by 2 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.070
 leasing slightly otparila you to loop 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.810
 not run away I do not have a needle in the wrong 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.289
 the same color is slightly contrasting to 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.689
 see how it will look edge 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.689
 then we introduce a needle 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:34.650
 first and fasten the thread so now 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.650
 we enter the first loop out of 2 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:47.250
 neat and stretch now we enter 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:54.670
 first again and out of the wrong side already 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:57.030
 here it is purl only 1 purl 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.030
 noose 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.100
 It turns out such a small defense here 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.100
 further the last facial of which 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.650
 maybe they were racing and both faces 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:17.020
 next we enter one from the other 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.710
 go out of course gum one on one 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.720
 closed form looks prettier 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.440
 but more often use these two by two 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:33.700
 after all, so I remained there alone 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:37.960
 loop its wrong take it I enter 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.900
 She come out here and the next purl 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.900
 she turns out 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.070
 bridges kent 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.110
 do not tighten too much but do not need to 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.770
 sagged then everything is enough 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:08.270
 supple again facial for my part 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:12.200
 and the following 2 facial all just facial 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.590
 purl this here one remains the wrong side 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.590
 2 inside out 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:31.250
 so stella's face 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.250
 going matrix here 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.160
 everything 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.770
 so thus again two inside 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.660
 go two faces 2 wrong side two faces here 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.220
 this way we close to the end 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.580
 it turns out such a gum as close 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.580
 she has
