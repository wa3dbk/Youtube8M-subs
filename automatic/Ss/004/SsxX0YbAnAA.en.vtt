playing if it makes you feel kind of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 
playing if it makes you feel kind of
faster<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.369> always<00:01:08.790> keeps<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.240> on

your toes because as you can see like

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.649 
your toes because as you can see like
it's<00:01:12.720> made<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.920> upwards<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.850> usually<00:01:15.540> when

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it's made going upwards so usually when

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.090 
it's made going upwards so usually when
you're<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.930> field<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.470> usually<00:01:16.710> like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you're on the field you're usually like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.080 
you're on the field you're usually like
this<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> got<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> faster<00:01:18.630> sprint<00:01:18.930> off<00:01:20.090> one

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
