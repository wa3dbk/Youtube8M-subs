mean a lot of time shorter intuition a

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.969 
mean a lot of time shorter intuition a
lot<00:05:43.910> of<00:05:43.970> time<00:05:44.120> you<00:05:44.240> could<00:05:44.419> tell<00:05:44.889> comments<00:05:45.889> that

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
their actions and so really I was

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.129 
their actions and so really I was
thinking<00:05:53.210> about<00:05:53.270> this<00:05:53.599> because<00:05:53.810> I<00:05:53.990> was

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
thinking about this because I was

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.060 
thinking about this because I was
thinking<00:05:54.440> about<00:05:54.650> how<00:05:55.070> in<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.370> pants

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.360 
thinking about how in the pants
I<00:05:56.180> used<00:05:57.180> to<00:05:57.420> cut<00:05:58.200> people<00:05:58.410> off<00:05:58.680> but<00:05:58.860> we<00:05:58.980> got<00:05:59.130> it

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
I used to cut people off but we got it

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.860 
I used to cut people off but we got it
can<00:05:59.550> be<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.730> littlest<00:06:00.090> of<00:06:00.180> arguments<00:06:00.660> but<00:06:00.750> I'm

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
can be the littlest of arguments but I'm

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.110 
can be the littlest of arguments but I'm
like<00:06:01.050> you<00:06:01.980> don't<00:06:02.160> really<00:06:02.250> expect<00:06:02.400> again<00:06:02.970> two

arguments<00:06:03.330> with<00:06:03.630> your<00:06:03.780> friends<00:06:04.110> because<00:06:04.170> you

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
arguments with your friends because you

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.740
