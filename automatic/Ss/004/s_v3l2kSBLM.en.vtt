a lot of aluminum 80 1.96 per ton and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.190 
a lot of aluminum 80 1.96 per ton and
the<00:02:43.739> next<00:02:44.129> highest<00:02:44.459> was<00:02:47.060> iron<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.569> believe<00:02:49.049> it

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the next highest was iron I believe it

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.209 
the next highest was iron I believe it
was<00:02:49.409> which<00:02:49.889> was<00:02:50.069> 211<00:02:51.349> so<00:02:52.349> we<00:02:52.500> take<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:53.219 
was which was 211 so we take that the

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.369 
was which was 211 so we take that the
two<00:02:53.430> highest<00:02:53.909> ones<00:02:54.120> normally<00:02:54.719> or<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> three

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
two highest ones normally or a three

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.289 
two highest ones normally or a three
highest<00:02:55.769> ones<00:02:55.950> if<00:02:56.099> there's<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.400> third<00:02:57.030> but

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
highest ones if there's a third but

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.619 
highest ones if there's a third but
those<00:02:57.900> were<00:02:58.139> the<00:02:58.650> greatest<00:02:59.459> two<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
those were the greatest two in the

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.869 
those were the greatest two in the
survey<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:04.379> we<00:03:04.500> combined<00:03:04.980> those<00:03:05.189> frequencies

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
survey and we combined those frequencies

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.550 
survey and we combined those frequencies
and<00:03:06.239> that's<00:03:06.629> how<00:03:06.750> we<00:03:06.810> came<00:03:07.019> up<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.379> that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and that's how we came up with that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.710 
and that's how we came up with that
frequency<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.159> just<00:03:08.430> showed<00:03:08.609> you<00:03:08.659> now<00:03:09.659> the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
an ounce of silver per ton so we did

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.699 
an ounce of silver per ton so we did
find<00:03:43.109> silver<00:03:43.769> we<00:03:44.370> did<00:03:44.609> locate<00:03:44.819> silver<00:03:45.680> but<00:03:46.680> it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
find silver we did locate silver but it

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.740 
find silver we did locate silver but it
was<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:50.040> wrong<00:03:50.190> type<00:03:50.519> we<00:03:51.000> was<00:03:51.209> looking<00:03:51.540> for

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
was the wrong type we was looking for

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.860 
was the wrong type we was looking for
something<00:03:51.989> in<00:03:52.290> coin<00:03:52.590> form<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.870> obviously

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
something in coin form and obviously

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.199 
something in coin form and obviously
there's<00:03:55.169> no<00:03:55.379> way<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:57.109> set<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.739> unit<00:03:59.129> for<00:03:59.940> that

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
there's no way to set the unit for that

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.379 
there's no way to set the unit for that
and<00:04:00.449> if<00:04:00.540> anyone<00:04:00.900> tells<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.319> that<00:04:01.470> they<00:04:01.680> can<00:04:02.389> is

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
and if anyone tells you that they can is

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.830 
and if anyone tells you that they can is
completely<00:04:04.049> bogus<00:04:04.229> sorry

our friend Dana would geophysicists told

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.379 
our friend Dana would geophysicists told
us<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.979> it's<00:04:17.099> very<00:04:17.130> hard<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.820> cancel<00:04:18.239> this

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
us that it's very hard to cancel this

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.249 
us that it's very hard to cancel this
type<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:19.549> mineral<00:04:20.549> pockets<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.810> now<00:04:22.019> we<00:04:22.079> are

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
type of mineral pockets so now we are

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.770 
type of mineral pockets so now we are
testing<00:04:22.770> different<00:04:22.880> detectors<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.210> determine

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
if these pockets can be canceled out so

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.230 
if these pockets can be canceled out so
we<00:04:28.680> did<00:04:28.830> locate<00:04:29.009> silver<00:04:31.370> 0.897<00:04:32.370> ounce<00:04:32.700> per<00:04:32.969> ton

the report here this is a report on
anomaly<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.670> was<00:05:08.820> from<00:05:09.060> Kentucky<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:13.790> we

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
anomaly that was from Kentucky and we

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.030 
anomaly that was from Kentucky and we
always<00:05:15.180> sometimes<00:05:16.020> we'll<00:05:16.380> hit<00:05:16.500> these<00:05:16.710> large

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
always sometimes we'll hit these large

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.660 
always sometimes we'll hit these large
pockets<00:05:17.640> like<00:05:17.880> this<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:19.190> we<00:05:20.190> always<00:05:20.490> do<00:05:20.640> a

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
pockets like this and we always do a

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.710 
pockets like this and we always do a
report<00:05:21.120> on<00:05:21.270> what<00:05:21.540> we<00:05:21.660> find<00:05:21.930> when<00:05:22.920> it's<00:05:23.160> not

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
report on what we find when it's not

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.580 
report on what we find when it's not
what<00:05:24.720> we're<00:05:24.870> looking<00:05:24.900> for<00:05:25.520> so<00:05:26.520> we<00:05:26.670> can<00:05:26.700> tell

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
what we're looking for so we can tell

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.920 
what we're looking for so we can tell
what<00:05:28.590> elements<00:05:29.070> are<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:29.400> there<00:05:29.670> and<00:05:29.970> their

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
what elements are in there and their

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.720 
what elements are in there and their
combined<00:05:31.350> frequencies<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.130> make<00:05:32.160> sure<00:05:32.490> that

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
combined frequencies to make sure that

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.430 
combined frequencies to make sure that
they<00:05:32.940> are<00:05:33.150> close<00:05:33.480> to<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.780> frequency<00:05:33.990> we<00:05:34.380> were

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
they are close to the frequency we were

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.559 
they are close to the frequency we were
using

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.629
