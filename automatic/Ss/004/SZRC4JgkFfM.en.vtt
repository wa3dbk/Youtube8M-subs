one or two wood pieces in the following
way<00:02:34.900> after<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.020> door<00:02:36.230> has<00:02:36.470> been<00:02:36.500> closed<00:02:36.950> the

way after the door has been closed the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.400 
way after the door has been closed the
wood<00:02:37.670> pieces<00:02:37.970> should<00:02:38.240> start<00:02:38.630> burning<00:02:39.050> within

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
wood pieces should start burning within

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.110 
wood pieces should start burning within
a<00:02:39.620> minute<00:02:39.800> or<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:45.370> when<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.400> fires<00:02:46.760> caught

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
a minute or so when the fires caught

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.700 
a minute or so when the fires caught
hold<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.750> wood<00:02:47.900> pieces<00:02:48.290> are<00:02:48.410> burning

hold and the wood pieces are burning

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.530 
hold and the wood pieces are burning
well<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.370> could<00:02:49.550> regulate<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.150> combustion

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
well you could regulate the combustion

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.810 
well you could regulate the combustion
by<00:02:51.110> moving<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.620> combustion<00:02:52.040> air<00:02:52.400> damper

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
by moving the combustion air damper

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.480 
by moving the combustion air damper
control<00:02:53.210> to<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.630> center<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.890> reduces<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
control to the center this reduces the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.760 
control to the center this reduces the
burn<00:02:55.820> rate<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.330> your<00:02:56.750> wood<00:02:56.960> pieces<00:02:57.380> will<00:02:57.530> burn

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
burn rate and your wood pieces will burn

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.540 
burn rate and your wood pieces will burn
for<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.070> longer<00:02:58.430> time<00:02:59.800> if<00:03:00.800> you<00:03:01.010> follow<00:03:01.310> this

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
for a longer time if you follow this

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.670 
for a longer time if you follow this

simple advice every time you light the
fire<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.370> will<00:03:04.520> gain<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.730> lot<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.180> pleasure

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
fire you will gain a lot of pleasure

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.820 
fire you will gain a lot of pleasure
from<00:03:05.930> your<00:03:05.989> contourer

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
from your contourer
