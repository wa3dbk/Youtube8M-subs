woodland it's called the Dormouse and

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.319 
woodland it's called the Dormouse and
they<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> habitat<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.949> copyist<00:00:59.820> hazel

they like the habitat of a copyist hazel

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.500 
they like the habitat of a copyist hazel
which<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.750> when<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.370> cut<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> trees<00:01:02.969> down<00:01:03.210> low

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
which is when you cut the trees down low

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
which is when you cut the trees down low
and<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:03.960> come<00:01:04.140> back<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:05.070> big

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and then they come back and get big

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
and then they come back and get big
groups<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:06.990> once

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
groups like this you see here once

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.789 
groups like this you see here once
they've<00:01:08.010> grown<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:08.520> 8<00:01:08.790> years<00:01:09.090> old<00:01:09.799> then

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
they've grown to about 8 years old then

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.130 
they've grown to about 8 years old then
we<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> again<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.510> we've<00:01:12.960> got

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
we do it again and we do the we've got

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.039 
we do it again and we do the we've got
area<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> woodland<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.460> maybe<00:01:15.210> 2<00:01:15.540> acres<00:01:15.869> in

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
area of woodland that's maybe 2 acres in

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.700 
area of woodland that's maybe 2 acres in
size<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.450> cut<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.570> into<00:01:18.869> 8<00:01:18.990> sections<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
size and we cut this into 8 sections of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.330 
size and we cut this into 8 sections of
woodland<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.610> every<00:01:21.540> 8<00:01:21.720> years<00:01:22.130> every<00:01:23.130> piece<00:01:23.310> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
woodland so every 8 years every piece of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
woodland so every 8 years every piece of
the<00:01:23.520> wood<00:01:23.670> gets<00:01:23.939> cut<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.720> keep<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the wood gets cut so then we keep that

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.330 
the wood gets cut so then we keep that
rotation<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.009> we've<00:01:26.100> got<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
rotation going and we've got the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
rotation going and we've got the
different<00:01:27.110> stands<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.409> woodland<00:01:28.860> at

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
different stands of woodland at

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.440 
different stands of woodland at
different<00:01:29.310> heights<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
different heights which is what the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.060 
different heights which is what the
habitat<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> Dormouse<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.860> they're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
habitat of the Dormouse is they're

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
habitat of the Dormouse is they're
really<00:01:32.549> after<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.990> eating

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
really after because they like eating

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.770 
really after because they like eating
the<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.880> hazelnuts<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.119> there's<00:01:36.270> also<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.600> lot

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the the hazelnuts and there's also a lot

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.999 
the the hazelnuts and there's also a lot
of<00:01:36.810> honeysuckle<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.619> through<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
of honeysuckle going through here and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.590 
of honeysuckle going through here and
there's<00:01:38.220> bramble<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> background<00:01:39.390> there

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
there's bramble in the background there

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.889 
there's bramble in the background there
so<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.770> basically<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.400> good<00:01:42.240> technique<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so this is basically a good technique of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.780 
so this is basically a good technique of
managing<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> Dormouse<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.640> in

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
managing the Dormouse which is in

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.660 
managing the Dormouse which is in
decline<00:01:45.619> having<00:01:46.619> cut<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> larger<00:01:47.130> branches

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
decline having cut the larger branches

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
decline having cut the larger branches

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.410 
moves into sort of smaller branch to
