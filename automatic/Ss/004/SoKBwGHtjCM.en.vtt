gonna be very few creatures I was gonna

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.909 
gonna be very few creatures I was gonna
reshape<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.639> legs<00:03:48.879> but<00:03:49.599> this<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:50.440> my<00:03:50.650> very

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919

reshape the legs but this is my very
first<00:03:51.160> accumulating<00:03:51.970> model<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:54.010> haven't

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
first accumulating model and I haven't

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.240 
first accumulating model and I haven't
never<00:03:54.340> done<00:03:54.669> modeling<00:03:55.329> outside<00:03:56.139> of<00:03:56.470> objects

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
never done modeling outside of objects

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.220 
never done modeling outside of objects
before<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.560> this<00:04:00.190> mine<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:01.449> I<00:04:01.540> was<00:04:01.780> gonna<00:04:01.959> do

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
before so this mine so I was gonna do

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.500 
before so this mine so I was gonna do
the<00:04:02.379> legs<00:04:02.620> like<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.699> said<00:04:03.879> before<00:04:03.970> make<00:04:04.359> them

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
the legs like I said before make them

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.960 
the legs like I said before make them
different<00:04:05.579> into<00:04:06.579> like<00:04:07.199> arching<00:04:08.199> display<00:04:08.970> and

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
different into like arching display and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.319 
different into like arching display and
then<00:04:10.239> swooping<00:04:11.019> in<00:04:11.169> like<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.060> feet

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
then swooping in like that then the feet

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.030 
then swooping in like that then the feet
come<00:04:13.629> back<00:04:13.840> out<00:04:14.049> here<00:04:14.379> but

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
come back out here but

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.910 
come back out here but
shut<00:04:16.670> up<00:04:16.700> but<00:04:17.600> um<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:19.120> am<00:04:20.120> not<00:04:20.360> that<00:04:20.920> skilled

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
shut up but um I am not that skilled

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.840 
shut up but um I am not that skilled
quite<00:04:22.370> yet<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.360> haven't<00:04:23.750> been<00:04:24.020> able<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.320> work

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
quite yet so I haven't been able to work

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.900 
quite yet so I haven't been able to work
that<00:04:25.850> well<00:04:26.180> on<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:27.560> just<00:04:28.430> have<00:04:28.790> been

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
that well on it so I just have been

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.610 
that well on it so I just have been
trying<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.270> sculpt<00:04:29.720> it<00:04:29.900> trying<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.290> make<00:04:30.380> it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
trying to sculpt it trying to make it

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.820 
trying to sculpt it trying to make it
look<00:04:30.800> more<00:04:30.880> realistic<00:04:31.880> as<00:04:32.420> possible<00:04:32.500> Kim<00:04:33.500> but

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
look more realistic as possible Kim but

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.340 
look more realistic as possible Kim but
is<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:34.160> my<00:04:34.850> first<00:04:35.120> game<00:04:35.420> so<00:04:35.750> I'm<00:04:35.960> not<00:04:36.110> expecting

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
is it my first game so I'm not expecting

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.740 
is it my first game so I'm not expecting
it<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.950> be<00:04:36.980> perfect<00:04:38.470> now<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.700> would<00:04:41.330> really

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
it to be perfect now so I would really

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.250 
it to be perfect now so I would really
appreciate<00:04:41.930> all<00:04:42.680> of<00:04:42.800> your<00:04:43.660> input<00:04:44.660> on<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:45.020> I

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
appreciate all of your input on this I

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.300 
appreciate all of your input on this I
would<00:04:45.320> really<00:04:45.770> hard<00:04:46.070> this<00:04:46.250> time<00:04:48.160> it's<00:04:49.160> all<00:04:49.280> a

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
would really hard this time it's all a

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.050 
would really hard this time it's all a
little<00:04:49.400> probably<00:04:50.210> three<00:04:50.660> weeks<00:04:51.050> that's<00:04:52.060> still

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
little probably three weeks that's still

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.340 
little probably three weeks that's still
might<00:04:53.180> be<00:04:53.330> an<00:04:53.390> exaggeration<00:04:54.020> but<00:04:54.050> if<00:04:54.260> you're

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
might be an exaggeration but if you're

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.380 
might be an exaggeration but if you're
putting<00:04:54.620> all<00:04:54.770> in<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.010> hours<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.700> I<00:04:55.910> worked<00:04:56.240> on

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
putting all in the hours and I worked on

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.600 
putting all in the hours and I worked on
this<00:04:56.570> each<00:04:56.990> day

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
this each day

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.440 
this each day
not<00:04:59.300> counting<00:04:59.570> sleeping<00:05:00.230> to<00:05:00.350> know<00:05:01.450> if

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
not counting sleeping to know if

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.590 
not counting sleeping to know if
probably<00:05:02.810> took<00:05:03.020> me<00:05:03.080> 3<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:04.670> 2<00:05:04.970> weeks<00:05:06.010> so<00:05:07.600> that's

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
probably took me 3 to 2 weeks so that's

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.870 
probably took me 3 to 2 weeks so that's
still<00:05:08.900> an<00:05:09.050> exaggeration<00:05:09.740> it's<00:05:10.160> my<00:05:10.310> guess<00:05:10.550> but

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
still an exaggeration it's my guess but

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.550 
still an exaggeration it's my guess but
either<00:05:11.060> way<00:05:11.300> please<00:05:11.990> put<00:05:12.740> in<00:05:12.950> oh<00:05:14.440> what'd<00:05:15.440> you

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
either way please put in oh what'd you

either way please put in oh what'd you
think<00:05:15.710> of<00:05:15.920> it<00:05:16.070> because<00:05:16.460> I<00:05:16.490> really<00:05:16.940> need<00:05:17.150> that

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
think of it because I really need that

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.470 
think of it because I really need that
