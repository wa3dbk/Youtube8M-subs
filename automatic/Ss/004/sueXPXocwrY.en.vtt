just<00:03:01.390> kind<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.660> out<00:03:01.810> there<00:03:01.990> with<00:03:02.170> nothing<00:03:02.350> so

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
just kind of out there with nothing so

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.970 
just kind of out there with nothing so
you<00:03:02.680> want<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.950> go<00:03:03.070> on<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:04.380> three<00:03:05.380> okay<00:03:05.800> he

doesn't play that in the live recording
but<00:03:08.830> I<00:03:08.860> think<00:03:09.160> for<00:03:09.430> piano<00:03:09.700> solo<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.120> need<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.390> do

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
but I think for piano solo we need to do

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.530 
but I think for piano solo we need to do
that<00:03:10.750> for<00:03:10.930> count<00:03:11.170> two<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.500> three<00:03:11.860> one<00:03:12.540> two

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
that for count two and three one two

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.480 
that for count two and three one two
three<00:03:14.500> little<00:03:14.770> go

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
three little go

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.780 
three little go
that<00:03:17.120> pretty<00:03:17.360> hard<00:03:18.050> okay<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:18.920> that'll<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.310> F<00:03:19.520> B

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
that pretty hard okay so that'll be F B

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.930 
that pretty hard okay so that'll be F B
flat<00:03:19.820> D<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:21.020> one<00:03:21.800> three<00:03:22.070> five<00:03:22.250> let<00:03:22.550> people<00:03:22.820> do

think Lynn plays octaves here either we
need<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.520> do<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.880> because<00:03:32.210> we<00:03:32.360> don't<00:03:32.540> have<00:03:32.690> a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720
