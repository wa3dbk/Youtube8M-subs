one<00:00:26.730> thing<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.330> mean<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.960> pretty<00:00:28.199> hard

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
one thing I mean it's pretty hard

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.470 
one thing I mean it's pretty hard
because<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.400> hard<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.730> kill<00:00:29.939> Wolverine<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
because it's hard to kill Wolverine you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.330 
because it's hard to kill Wolverine you
have<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> sever<00:00:30.900> his<00:00:31.109> fucking<00:00:31.439> head<00:00:31.650> Thor's<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
god magneto can easily just rip anything

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
god magneto can easily just rip anything
apart<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.820> has<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.390> magnesium<00:00:36.840> or

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
apart that has to do with magnesium or

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.270 
apart that has to do with magnesium or
metal<00:00:37.530> Hulk<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.430> invincible<00:00:39.829> with<00:00:40.829> Captain

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
metal Hulk is invincible with Captain

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.680 
metal Hulk is invincible with Captain
America's<00:00:41.730> shield<00:00:41.760> he's<00:00:42.210> pretty<00:00:42.540> much

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
America's shield he's pretty much

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
America's shield he's pretty much
invincible<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.410> well<00:00:43.590> let's<00:00:43.829> take<00:00:44.070> away<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
invincible as well let's take away the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
invincible as well let's take away the
shield<00:00:44.750> Ironman<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.989> only<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.530> much<00:00:46.800> he'd

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
shield Ironman can only do so much he'd

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.889 
shield Ironman can only do so much he'd
probably<00:00:47.399> take<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.879> Captain<00:00:48.420> America<00:00:48.450> but

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
probably take out a Captain America but

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.369 
probably take out a Captain America but
what<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:49.590> happen<00:00:49.800> uh<00:00:50.750> I'm<00:00:51.750> pretty<00:00:52.020> sure

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
what would happen uh I'm pretty sure

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.880 
what would happen uh I'm pretty sure
Thor<00:00:52.829> Hulk<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.030> Iron<00:00:54.270> Man<00:00:54.480> would<00:00:54.780> win<00:00:55.110> but

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Thor Hulk and Iron Man would win but

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
Thor Hulk and Iron Man would win but
barely<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.760> mean<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> question<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.899> can

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
barely I mean the question is can

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
barely I mean the question is can
magneto<00:00:59.010> pick<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.640> Thor's<00:01:00.300> hammer<00:01:00.629> because

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
magneto pick up Thor's hammer because

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.329 
magneto pick up Thor's hammer because
whoever<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.520> hammer<00:01:02.760> deems<00:01:03.149> worthy<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:04.339> able

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
whoever the hammer deems worthy is able

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
whoever the hammer deems worthy is able
to<00:01:05.430> pick<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.360> magneto<00:01:06.810> worthy<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
to pick it up now is magneto worthy of

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.270 
to pick it up now is magneto worthy of
picking<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.040> don't<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.360> Iron<00:01:09.360> Man<00:01:10.280> he

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
picking it up we don't know Iron Man he

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
picking it up we don't know Iron Man he
would<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.700> crushed<00:01:12.150> by<00:01:12.420> Magneto<00:01:12.869> Hulk<00:01:13.290> would

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
would get crushed by Magneto Hulk would

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.280 
would get crushed by Magneto Hulk would
probably<00:01:13.890> rip<00:01:14.130> apart<00:01:14.250> Captain<00:01:15.060> America<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
probably rip apart Captain America and a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.320 
probably rip apart Captain America and a
magneto<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:17.070> he's<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.310> metal<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:18.000> for

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
magneto because he's not metal as for

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.870 
magneto because he's not metal as for
Wolverine<00:01:18.890> Thor<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.100> take<00:01:20.280> him<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.580> along

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Wolverine Thor can take him on along

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.429 
Wolverine Thor can take him on along
with<00:01:21.000> Hulk<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.810> wouldn't<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.140> much<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
with Hulk and it wouldn't be much of a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.210 
with Hulk and it wouldn't be much of a
problem<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
problem with that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.850 
problem with that
so<00:01:23.549> I'd<00:01:24.180> say<00:01:24.420> Iron<00:01:24.659> Man<00:01:24.930> would<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
so I'd say Iron Man would be the one of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.260 
so I'd say Iron Man would be the one of
the<00:01:25.920> first<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> die<00:01:26.520> alone<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.909> Captain

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the first to die alone with Captain

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.080 
the first to die alone with Captain
America<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.500> Thor<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.490> Hulk<00:01:29.759> would

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
America and then Thor and Hulk would

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.550 
America and then Thor and Hulk would
probably<00:01:31.020> destroy<00:01:31.759> Wolverine<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.030> uh

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
probably destroy Wolverine and uh

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.670 
probably destroy Wolverine and uh
Magneto

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
Magneto

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.929 
Magneto
look<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.220> punch<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> shadow

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
look at that you just punch the shadow

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
look at that you just punch the shadow
Wolverine<00:01:36.390> um<00:01:37.670> then<00:01:38.670> again<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.840> can't<00:01:40.170> really

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
Wolverine um then again you can't really

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
Wolverine um then again you can't really
kill<00:01:41.070> Wolverine<00:01:41.520> unless<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> rip<00:01:42.540> his<00:01:42.659> head

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
kill Wolverine unless you rip his head

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.330 
kill Wolverine unless you rip his head
off<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.470> completely<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.430> guy

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
off like just completely like this guy

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.910 
off like just completely like this guy
Magneto<00:01:47.340> take<00:01:47.909> away<00:01:48.119> his<00:01:48.329> armor<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.020> just

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
Magneto take away his armor and just

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.170 
Magneto take away his armor and just
bash<00:01:50.159> him<00:01:50.369> over<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> head<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> hammer<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
bash him over the head with the hammer I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.640 
bash him over the head with the hammer I
guess

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
guess

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.700 
guess

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
I don't know what would happen looks

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.960
