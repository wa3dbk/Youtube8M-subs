lifecycle of GTA 5 that this mask is
always<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.170> been<00:01:43.409> there<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
always just kind of been there in the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
always just kind of been there in the
center<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> especially<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:45.119> heists<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
center of it especially with heists and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
center of it especially with heists and
images<00:01:46.560> we've<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.920> enough<00:01:47.250> things<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.700> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
images we've got enough things like that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
images we've got enough things like that
this<00:01:48.329> mask<00:01:48.600> has<00:01:48.840> always<00:01:49.079> been<00:01:49.470> there<00:01:49.649> but

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
this mask has always been there but

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
this mask has always been there but
Rockstar<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.479> take<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.840> out<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> game

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
Rockstar to just take it out of the game

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.139 
Rockstar to just take it out of the game
for<00:01:52.530> no<00:01:52.680> apparent<00:01:52.799> reason<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.610> makes<00:01:53.909> no<00:01:54.119> sense

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
for no apparent reason it makes no sense

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.999 
for no apparent reason it makes no sense
now<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.930> only<00:01:55.020> speculate<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.619> maybe

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
now we can only speculate that maybe

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039 
now we can only speculate that maybe
this<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.119> removed<00:01:57.360> due<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> copyright

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this was removed due to copyright

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.130 
this was removed due to copyright
reasons<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.270> infringement<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.659> things<00:02:00.960> like

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
reasons and infringement and things like

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.749 
reasons and infringement and things like
that<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.560> wouldn't<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.189> been<00:02:02.219> taken<00:02:02.670> out

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that but wouldn't it have been taken out

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.480 
that but wouldn't it have been taken out
of<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> campaign<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.960> well<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:05.340> more

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
of the campaign as well but one more

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.709 
of the campaign as well but one more
thing<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> also<00:02:05.909> comes<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.390> mind<00:02:06.570> when

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
thing that also comes to mind when

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.330 
thing that also comes to mind when
thinking<00:02:06.869> about<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.590> maybe<00:02:07.770> Rockstar

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
thinking about this is maybe Rockstar

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.850 
thinking about this is maybe Rockstar
took<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.410> revamp<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.739> then

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
took it out to revamp it and then

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.160 
took it out to revamp it and then
release<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.520> GTA<00:02:12.060> online<00:02:12.450> heists<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
release it with GTA online heists that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.680 
release it with GTA online heists that
are<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.470> be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
are going to be

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.960 
are going to be
course<00:02:13.870> coming<00:02:14.140> out<00:02:14.350> in<00:02:14.500> early<00:02:14.650> 2015<00:02:15.550> of

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
course coming out in early 2015 of

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.710 
course coming out in early 2015 of
course<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.630> those<00:02:17.560> are<00:02:17.740> my<00:02:17.830> only<00:02:18.070> really

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
course so those are my only really

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.490 
course so those are my only really
thoughts<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.020> only<00:02:20.140> thing<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.350> could

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
thoughts and the only thing I could

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.410 
thoughts and the only thing I could
really<00:02:20.530> speculate<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.220> why<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:21.610> was<00:02:22.030> taken

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
really speculate on why this was taken

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.750 
really speculate on why this was taken
out<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.780> game<00:02:22.960> but<00:02:23.380> who<00:02:24.220> knows<00:02:24.400> we'll<00:02:24.610> just

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
