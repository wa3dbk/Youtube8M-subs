size<00:02:03.299> also<00:02:03.689> along<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.259> idea<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.950> see

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
size also along this idea you can see

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.950 
size also along this idea you can see
that<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> does<00:02:05.579> feature<00:02:05.880> some<00:02:06.060> classic<00:02:06.780> tech

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that it does feature some classic tech

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.510 
that it does feature some classic tech
tech<00:02:07.170> connector<00:02:07.619> slots<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.429> have

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
tech connector slots so if you have

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.460 
tech connector slots so if you have
other<00:02:08.700> tech<00:02:09.030> deck<00:02:09.179> ramps<00:02:09.599> like<00:02:09.780> Laki<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.319> can

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
other tech deck ramps like Laki you can

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.050 
other tech deck ramps like Laki you can
attach<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:11.039> right<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> ramps<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
attach this right to the ramps that you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.980 
attach this right to the ramps that you
already<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.510> can

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
already have you can

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.420 
already have you can
add<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.350> your<00:02:13.410> Tech<00:02:13.620> Deck<00:02:13.770> Park<00:02:14.100> whatever

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
add it to your Tech Deck Park whatever

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.010 
add it to your Tech Deck Park whatever
you<00:02:14.520> want<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.790> do<00:02:14.940> along<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.480> back<00:02:15.630> more<00:02:15.990> of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
you want to do along the back more of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.260 
you want to do along the back more of
those<00:02:16.230> slots<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.040> along<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> other<00:02:17.460> side<00:02:17.700> so

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
those slots and along the other side so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.370 
those slots and along the other side so
they<00:02:18.390> got<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.660> covered<00:02:18.870> there

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
they got you covered there

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.900 
they got you covered there
and<00:02:19.470> speaking<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.950> Tech<00:02:20.190> Deck<00:02:20.370> connectors

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
and speaking of Tech Deck connectors

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.240 
and speaking of Tech Deck connectors
this<00:02:21.210> ramp<00:02:21.510> did<00:02:21.750> come<00:02:21.990> with<00:02:22.410> too<00:02:22.650> long<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.220> too

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
this ramp did come with too long and too

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.460 
this ramp did come with too long and too
short<00:02:23.550> connectors<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> little<00:02:24.780> package<00:02:25.200> so

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
short connectors in a little package so

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.810 
short connectors in a little package so
that's<00:02:25.710> cool<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.250> never<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.520> too<00:02:26.580> many

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
that's cool you can never have too many

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.540 
that's cool you can never have too many
of<00:02:26.970> those<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.710> writing<00:02:28.890> surface<00:02:29.280> of

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
of those right so the writing surface of

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.040 
of those right so the writing surface of
the<00:02:29.640> ramp<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.970> pretty<00:02:30.210> standard<00:02:30.540> not<00:02:30.870> much

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the ramp is pretty standard not much

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.690 
the ramp is pretty standard not much
different<00:02:31.470> from<00:02:31.530> any<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.070> other<00:02:32.220> Technic

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
different from any of the other Technic

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700 
different from any of the other Technic
ramps<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.270> does<00:02:33.480> feature<00:02:33.810> some<00:02:33.990> mix-match

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
ramps it does feature some mix-match

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.160 
ramps it does feature some mix-match
lines<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.580> kind<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.940> simulate<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.510> look<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.990> a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
lines to kind of simulate the look of a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.750 
lines to kind of simulate the look of a
real<00:02:37.380> skateboard<00:02:37.950> ramp<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.400> that's<00:02:38.550> pretty

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
real skateboard ramp so that's pretty

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.040 
real skateboard ramp so that's pretty
cool<00:02:39.000> nothing<00:02:39.300> that's<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.750> make<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
cool nothing that's going to make you

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.480 
cool nothing that's going to make you
hang<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.380> your<00:02:40.410> wheels<00:02:40.710> or<00:02:40.950> anything<00:02:41.130> it's

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
hang up your wheels or anything it's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.730 
hang up your wheels or anything it's
very<00:02:41.760> smooth<00:02:42.150> there's<00:02:42.510> no<00:02:42.690> big<00:02:42.930> bump<00:02:43.200> riding

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
very smooth there's no big bump riding

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.440 
very smooth there's no big bump riding
on<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.490> they<00:02:44.610> did<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.820> good<00:02:44.940> job<00:02:45.000> there

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
on to it so they did a good job there

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.750 
on to it so they did a good job there
the<00:02:45.750> coping<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.380> made<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.770> plastic<00:02:46.920> could<00:02:47.610> be

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
the coping is made of plastic could be

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.070 
the coping is made of plastic could be
metal<00:02:47.970> die<00:02:48.210> would<00:02:48.330> be<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> little<00:02:48.720> bit<00:02:48.840> cooler

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
metal die would be a little bit cooler

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.830 
metal die would be a little bit cooler
but<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.830> smooth<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.730> no<00:02:50.940> worries<00:02:51.270> there<00:02:51.300> two

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
but it is smooth so no worries there two

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.020 
but it is smooth so no worries there two
finger<00:02:52.230> wood<00:02:52.440> Lube<00:02:52.680> come<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.220> now<00:02:53.520> as<00:02:53.730> far<00:02:53.970> as

finger wood Lube come on now as far as

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.390 
finger wood Lube come on now as far as
fingerboard<00:02:54.600> ability<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.140> would<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.280> give

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
fingerboard ability I would have to give

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.460 
fingerboard ability I would have to give
this<00:02:56.610> ramp<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:57.000> full<00:02:57.300> ten<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.810> ten<00:02:58.080> it's<00:02:58.320> got

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
this ramp a full ten out of ten it's got

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.040 
this ramp a full ten out of ten it's got
good<00:02:58.680> overall<00:02:58.980> size<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> smooth<00:03:00.120> transition<00:03:00.690> I

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
good overall size a smooth transition I

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.450 
good overall size a smooth transition I
think<00:03:01.320> it'd<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.530> great<00:03:01.800> addition<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.310> any

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
think it'd be a great addition to any

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.460 
think it'd be a great addition to any
fingerboard<00:03:03.210> Park<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.720> again<00:03:03.960> as<00:03:04.290> I
