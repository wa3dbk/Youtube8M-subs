00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
that the only thing soft point mo does

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.730 
that the only thing soft point mo does
is<00:00:11.340> lower<00:00:11.759> bullet<00:00:12.240> velocity<00:00:12.380> so<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.530> is

is lower bullet velocity so this is

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.650

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
testing to reinforce the point so we're

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.869 
testing to reinforce the point so we're
going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.480> using<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.960> vx6<00:00:43.890> tech<00:00:44.250> 7<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
going to be using the vx6 tech 7 and

that's avenue sovereign carbine that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.479 
that's avenue sovereign carbine that
deals<00:00:47.129> 100<00:00:47.579> damage<00:00:47.730> flat<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.739> 115<00:00:49.739> meters<00:00:50.280> or

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
deals 100 damage flat at 115 meters or
greater<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:52.110> means<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.410> theoretically

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
greater so this means that theoretically

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.430 
greater so this means that theoretically
it's<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.730> take<00:00:53.910> exactly<00:00:54.719> ten<00:00:54.960> shots<00:00:55.230> to

provided that all the bullets land in
the<00:01:02.969> chest<00:01:03.270> area<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.379> believe<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the chest area and I believe the the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
the chest area and I believe the the
legs<00:01:05.519> only<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:06.030> ninety<00:01:06.479> percent<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.840> normal

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
legs only get ninety percent of normal

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.770 
legs only get ninety percent of normal
damage<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.560> most<00:01:08.130> headshots<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
damage and most headshots have a a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.010 
damage and most headshots have a a
damage<00:01:10.409> multiplier<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> 1<00:01:11.189> points<00:01:12.020> 1.5

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
damage multiplier of 1 points 1.5

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560 
damage multiplier of 1 points 1.5
depending<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.460> weapon<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.270> there's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
depending on the the weapon so there's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
depending on the the weapon so there's
still<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.020> little<00:01:16.259> bit<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.590> deviation<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
still a little bit of deviation in the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.210 
still a little bit of deviation in the
accuracy<00:01:17.939> given<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> range<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> didn't

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
accuracy given the range but I didn't

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
accuracy given the range but I didn't
seem<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> hit<00:01:20.880> any<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.990> multipliers

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
seem to hit any of the the multipliers

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.219 
seem to hit any of the the multipliers
so<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> numbers<00:01:23.340> should<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.580> pretty<00:01:23.790> accurate

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
so the numbers should be pretty accurate

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.420 
so the numbers should be pretty accurate
but<00:01:25.229> what's<00:01:25.439> interesting<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.340> took

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
but what's interesting is that it took

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.030 
but what's interesting is that it took
11<00:01:26.850> shots<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> kill<00:01:27.420> instead<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> 10<00:01:28.320> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
11 shots to kill instead of the 10 that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.620 
11 shots to kill instead of the 10 that
it<00:01:29.220> technically<00:01:29.640> should<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.000> taken<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it technically should have taken and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
it technically should have taken and
this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> assuming<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.740> numbers<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.280> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
this is assuming that my numbers are of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.020 
this is assuming that my numbers are of
course<00:01:33.000> accurate<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:34.310> did<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> forward

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
course accurate I did have a forward

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.730 
course accurate I did have a forward
grip<00:01:36.210> attached<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.259> shouldn't<00:01:37.650> affect

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
grip attached but that shouldn't affect

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.890 
grip attached but that shouldn't affect
the<00:01:38.009> damage<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.490> actual<00:01:38.820> weapon<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the damage of the actual weapon so this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
the damage of the actual weapon so this
tells<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.439> either<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.280> spreadsheet

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
tells me that either a the spreadsheet

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.510 
tells me that either a the spreadsheet
is<00:01:41.939> wrong<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:42.420> likely<00:01:42.780> isn't<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.320> case<00:01:43.520> B

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
is wrong which likely isn't the case B

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.789 
is wrong which likely isn't the case B
shots<00:01:45.030> were<00:01:45.180> registering<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.869> hits<00:01:46.140> two<00:01:46.380> legs

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
into future videos if I can so as far as

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.539 
into future videos if I can so as far as
the<00:02:33.840> testing<00:02:34.019> goes<00:02:34.349> long<00:02:34.650> story<00:02:34.920> short<00:02:35.189> here's

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
the testing goes long story short here's

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.750 
the testing goes long story short here's
a<00:02:35.609> test<00:02:36.060> clip<00:02:36.420> without<00:02:36.689> soft<00:02:37.620> point<00:02:37.950> ammo<00:02:38.250> from

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
a test clip without soft point ammo from

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.879 
a test clip without soft point ammo from
125<00:02:39.569> meters<00:02:39.840> away<00:02:40.079> which<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.409> just<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.709> bit

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
125 meters away which is just a bit

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:58.909 
125 meters away which is just a bit
beyond<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.450> 115<00:02:42.450> meter<00:02:42.659> damage<00:02:43.439> minimum<00:02:57.919> so

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
beyond that 115 meter damage minimum so

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.599 
beyond that 115 meter damage minimum so
as<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.189> can<00:02:59.310> see<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.669> takes<00:02:59.819> 11<00:03:00.209> shots<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.989> kill

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
as you can see it takes 11 shots to kill

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.640 
as you can see it takes 11 shots to kill
and<00:03:02.609> here's<00:03:03.000> another<00:03:03.120> test<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:03.810> soft<00:03:04.349> point

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
and here's another test with soft point

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:20.070 
and here's another test with soft point

it<00:03:40.670> was<00:03:40.880> especially<00:03:41.870> since<00:03:42.140> soft<00:03:42.590> point<00:03:42.830> ammo

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
it was especially since soft point ammo

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.890 
it was especially since soft point ammo
is<00:03:43.220> meant<00:03:43.520> for<00:03:43.610> close<00:03:44.060> quarters<00:03:44.390> combat<00:03:44.510> and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
is meant for close quarters combat and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.330 
is meant for close quarters combat and
the<00:03:45.050> drop<00:03:45.260> in<00:03:45.410> bullet<00:03:45.710> velocity<00:03:45.800> is

the drop in bullet velocity is

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.830 
the drop in bullet velocity is
absolutely<00:03:47.210> meaningless<00:03:47.450> at<00:03:48.020> those<00:03:48.200> ranges

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
absolutely meaningless at those ranges

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.150 
absolutely meaningless at those ranges
so<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:50.990> was<00:03:51.140> really<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.470> important<00:03:51.980> part<00:03:52.010> of

so that was really the important part of

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.410 
so that was really the important part of
the<00:03:52.250> video<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.640> if<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:52.790> want<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.030> shut<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.270> off

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
the video and if you want to shut it off

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.420 
the video and if you want to shut it off
now<00:03:53.690> feel<00:03:53.959> free<00:03:54.020> but<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.709> also<00:03:54.920> wanted<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.250> talk

now feel free but I also wanted to talk

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.550 
now feel free but I also wanted to talk
about<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.820> mentalities<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.720> usefulness<00:03:57.410> of

about the mentalities and usefulness of

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.530 
about the mentalities and usefulness of
