00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
we're into three of these 1 2 with the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.860 
we're into three of these 1 2 with the
cha<00:04:03.030> cha<00:04:03.240> cha<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.660> middle<00:04:04.130> 3<00:04:05.870> cha-cha-cha

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.360 
cha cha cha in the middle 3 cha-cha-cha
then<00:04:07.500> we<00:04:07.590> both<00:04:07.800> cross<00:04:08.130> for<00:04:08.400> 2<00:04:08.550> 3<00:04:08.940> 2<00:04:09.840> 3<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:11.250> we

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
then we both cross for 2 3 2 3 and we

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.949 
then we both cross for 2 3 2 3 and we
come<00:04:11.550> back<00:04:11.580> for<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.000> four<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.540> one<00:04:13.200> two<00:04:14.190> three
