out I think should be a separate raw

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.999 
out I think should be a separate raw
stoppage<00:05:01.669> man<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.719> mean<00:05:03.080> if<00:05:03.139> even<00:05:03.650> if<00:05:03.770> eighty

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.129 
cuz cuz Santa Cruz does want to go to
126<00:06:30.080> a<00:06:30.379> favor<00:06:31.129> with<00:06:31.370> that<00:06:31.400> um<00:06:31.879> I<00:06:32.240> don't<00:06:32.629> think<00:06:33.080> I

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 
126 a favor with that um I don't think I

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.600 
126 a favor with that um I don't think I
put<00:06:33.319> him<00:06:33.469> against<00:06:33.770> a<00:06:33.800> lot<00:06:33.919> more<00:06:34.039> chambers<00:06:34.250> and

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
put him against a lot more chambers and

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.040 
put him against a lot more chambers and
even<00:06:34.819> though<00:06:34.879> longer<00:06:35.240> shake<00:06:35.449> was<00:06:35.599> really<00:06:35.839> good

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
even though longer shake was really good

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.409 
even though longer shake was really good
I<00:06:36.319> think<00:06:36.919> that<00:06:37.099> I'm<00:06:37.580> really<00:06:37.789> highly<00:06:38.209> god<00:06:38.389> I

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
I think that I'm really highly god I

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.790 
I think that I'm really highly god I
don't<00:06:38.539> think<00:06:38.839> that<00:06:39.020> this<00:06:39.169> stage<00:06:39.469> for<00:06:39.740> it

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
don't think that this stage for it

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.330 
don't think that this stage for it
either<00:06:39.949> one

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
either one

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.490 
either one
really<00:06:40.460> need<00:06:40.610> that<00:06:40.639> fight<00:06:41.000> no<00:06:41.660> not<00:06:41.960> I<00:06:41.990> think

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
really need that fight no not I think

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.409 
really need that fight no not I think
they<00:06:42.590> would<00:06:42.800> stage<00:06:43.430> that<00:06:43.639> fight<00:06:43.850> later<00:06:44.090> yeah

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
they would stage that fight later yeah

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.080 
they would stage that fight later yeah
yeah<00:06:44.690> you<00:06:45.290> two<00:06:45.500> maybe<00:06:45.680> two<00:06:45.770> years<00:06:45.919> yeah<00:06:46.370> you

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090

know<00:06:47.410> Uncle<00:06:48.410> Bob<00:06:48.560> is<00:06:48.800> very<00:06:49.070> careful<00:06:49.610> with<00:06:49.850> the

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
know Uncle Bob is very careful with the

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.590 
know Uncle Bob is very careful with the
fire<00:06:50.389> scene<00:06:50.690> matches<00:06:51.280> and<00:06:52.280> at<00:06:52.669> this<00:06:53.060> point<00:06:53.270> I

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
fire scene matches and at this point I

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.990 
fire scene matches and at this point I
think<00:06:53.780> they<00:06:54.320> see<00:06:54.830> something<00:06:55.100> within<00:06:55.430> Walters

think they see something within Walters

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.420 
think they see something within Walters
that<00:06:56.270> they<00:06:57.080> feel<00:06:57.290> like<00:06:57.320> they<00:06:57.590> can<00:06:57.740> expose<00:06:58.070> yeah
