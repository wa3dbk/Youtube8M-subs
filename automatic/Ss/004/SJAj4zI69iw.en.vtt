that we've been fed and that is that

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.650 
that we've been fed and that is that
milk<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.699> good<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.180> us<00:00:24.680> you<00:00:25.680> know<00:00:26.330> let's<00:00:27.330> look

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.130 
having access to raw milk now raw milk
might<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.860> better<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.280> us<00:00:36.140> certainly

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140

wonderful vitamins are diminished

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.650 
wonderful vitamins are diminished
through<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> pasteurization<00:00:43.290> process<00:00:44.660> so

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
through the pasteurization process so

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.740 
through the pasteurization process so
that's<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.620> thing<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.309> well<00:00:47.850> the

see<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> light<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> day<00:01:12.140> it's<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
see the light of day it's a really a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.050 
see the light of day it's a really a
miserable<00:01:14.220> situation<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:16.229> milk<00:01:16.740> is

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
miserable situation and this milk is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.679 
miserable situation and this milk is
full<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.360> bacteria<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.320> pus<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> what's

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
full of bacteria and pus so what's

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
full of bacteria and pus so what's
happening<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> reason<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> they're<00:01:23.070> having

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
happening the reason that they're having

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850 
happening the reason that they're having
so<00:01:23.640> much<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.939> these<00:01:24.060> these<00:01:24.840> antibiotics<00:01:25.290> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
so much of these these antibiotics and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
so much of these these antibiotics and
so<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.460> they<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.729> mastitis<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
so on is because they have mastitis and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.319 
so on is because they have mastitis and
so<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.229> their<00:01:28.409> udders<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:30.090> actually

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
so on in their udders so you're actually

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.679 
so on in their udders so you're actually
drinking<00:01:31.110> pus<00:01:31.939> you<00:01:32.939> know<00:01:33.060> when<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.450> think

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
drinking pus you know when you think

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.590 
drinking pus you know when you think
about<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> good<00:01:35.189> situation

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
about that that is not a good situation

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.440 
about that that is not a good situation
so<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> avoid<00:01:38.329> pasteurized<00:01:39.329> milk

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
so you want to avoid pasteurized milk

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.719 
so you want to avoid pasteurized milk
because<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> pasteurization<00:01:40.829> process<00:01:41.040> also

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
because the pasteurization process also

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.990 
because the pasteurization process also
cuts<00:01:42.420> down<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.140> lactose<00:01:43.829> which<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> very

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
cuts down on the lactose which is a very

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
cuts down on the lactose which is a very
important<00:01:45.630> enzyme<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.409> help<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.920> able<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
important enzyme to help you be able to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.789 
important enzyme to help you be able to
digest<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.939> milk<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.290> human

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
digest the milk and you know human

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.310 
digest the milk and you know human
beings<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> only<00:01:50.759> species<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.630> drink

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
beings are the only species that drink

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.940 
beings are the only species that drink
another<00:01:53.070> species<00:01:53.670> milk<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
another species milk we don't see that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.969 
another species milk we don't see that
in<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.520> animal<00:01:56.939> world<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.979> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
in the animal world at all and the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.480 
in the animal world at all and the
majority<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.490> people<00:02:00.030> after<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:00.810> reach

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
majority of people after they reach

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.389 
majority of people after they reach
finished<00:02:02.490> nursing<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.130> their<00:02:05.130> ability

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
finished nursing and so on their ability

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.999 
finished nursing and so on their ability
to<00:02:06.090> digest<00:02:06.299> milk<00:02:06.659> goes<00:02:06.899> down<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:07.469> down

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to digest milk goes down down down

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.919 
to digest milk goes down down down
down<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.420> something<00:02:09.689> that

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
down so it's really not something that

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.530 
down so it's really not something that
we<00:02:10.049> want<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.470> our<00:02:10.679> diet<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.970> lot<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.180> people

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
we want in our diet and a lot of people

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.110 
we want in our diet and a lot of people
are<00:02:12.689> dairy<00:02:12.959> sensitive<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.939> something

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
are dairy sensitive so this is something

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.270 
are dairy sensitive so this is something
that<00:02:15.299> you<00:02:15.420> want<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.659> consider<00:02:16.049> you<00:02:16.860> know<00:02:16.890> maybe

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
that you want to consider you know maybe

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.179 
that you want to consider you know maybe
you<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.060> leave<00:02:18.209> milk<00:02:18.629> aside<00:02:19.260> out<00:02:19.739> of

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
you just want to leave milk aside out of

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.390 
you just want to leave milk aside out of
your<00:02:20.370> diet<00:02:20.610> or<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.769> want<00:02:22.950> milk<00:02:23.159> go
