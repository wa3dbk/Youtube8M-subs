00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.649
 a few seconds of acrobatic pizza of 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.480
 our champion pasqualino barbasso 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.550
 after which, as promised for a long time, vi 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 I show my recipe my own 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.170
 grandmother for the pizza dough 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.150
 basic ingredients are 860 grams of 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.939
 double zero flour is a little flour 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.890
 manitoba which increases elasticity 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.880
 the mixture is half a liter of water 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.679
 warm and 4 grams of brewer's yeast 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.170
 a spoon full of salt and a 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.239
 spoon full of olive oil 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.760
 if the track is not colored enough 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.879
 also put a spoonful of sugar 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.100
 useful for caramelizing a little 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.000
 tricks in tender salt far from 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.969
 yeast therefore means that first yes 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.879
 knead the water flour and yeast later 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.860
 who went a little further with 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.860
 add the salt with the mixture 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.500
 otherwise the salt risks 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.170
 neutralize limited agents e 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.530
 we continue to knead for 15 minutes e 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.780
 however until you get a dough 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.600
 smooth and elastic and not sticky yes 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.610
 forms a dough and rests for 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.040
 around two hours 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.380
 covering with a damp cloth or with a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.579
 flat or anything for that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:34.520
 do not dry after 2 hours 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.859
 we will form the balls 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.549
 we will pull the dough down and form the 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.219
 our balls and since I'm the pizza 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.200
 like a little soft 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:48.469
 I only make two balls of about 500 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.319
 grams but you can also do four 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.799
 250 gram balls that would be the 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.799
 standard pizzas 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:07.570
 once the balls are done, we put them to limit 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:10.450
 4 5 hours up to double in volume 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.860
 always in a closed place or with a cloth 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.860
 damp not to look 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.290
 finished this operation I show you the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.730
 two techniques to spread the dough 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.060
 according to the Roman school or that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.060
 Neapolitan 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.830
 according to 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.750
 the cornice remains low and therefore yes 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.270
 part by first crushing the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.580
 cornice and leaving internally 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.930
 the dough to spread and pull with the 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.840
 hands 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.860
 according to the Neapolitan school that I love 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.890
 the cornice is no longer touched 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.640
 so that it remains full of air and therefore 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.640
 soft and extends mainly 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 internally 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.069
 pizza cooking is the most important phase 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:38.620
 important to perform in the oven from 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.629
 kitchen must preheat the oven and 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.459
 bring it to the maximum temperature for 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.010
 about 10 minutes 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.709
 in the moment of baking one can also a 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.260
 slightly lower it to 200 degrees e 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.030
 cook for about 15 20 minutes 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.480
 the track is initially held in the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.639
 lower part to cook the pizza a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.489
 half the cooking brings us to the most part 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.379
 high to give it color with the oven 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.930
 obviously the culture is much faster 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.549
 with less tommasi two minutes but also here 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.590
 you must have some precautions in 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:13.150
 especially if you have to do it 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.760
 different pizzas in this case we put a 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.720
 foil plate on flint 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.970
 so as not to overheat it 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.430
 excessively per core of the institution per 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.199
 a super pizza is obvious that the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.990
 cooking in a wood oven does not have 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:34.150
 equal where the temperature arrives 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:36.250
 even at 450 grams for the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.690
 making a furnace with the technique 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.520
 of DIY 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.789
 I advise you to follow the video 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.430
 found on my channel or in my blog 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.430
 where the procedure is more detailed 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.909
 hello to everyone next time
