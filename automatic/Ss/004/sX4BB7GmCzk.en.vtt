00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
head's top and bottom I think the kit

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.530 
head's top and bottom I think the kit
sounds<00:02:39.830> great<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.460> way<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.700> came<00:02:40.850> in<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.120> box

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
sounds great the way it came in the box

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.720 
sounds great the way it came in the box
we<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:41.900> ported<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.290> bass<00:02:42.470> head<00:02:42.740> tuned<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.640> up

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
we just ported the bass head tuned it up

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.340 
we just ported the bass head tuned it up
a<00:02:43.880> little<00:02:44.030> bit<00:02:44.270> higher<00:02:44.480> than<00:02:44.750> straight<00:02:45.230> out<00:02:45.320> of

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
a little bit higher than straight out of

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.820 
a little bit higher than straight out of
the<00:02:45.440> box<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.980> here's<00:02:46.610> what<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.880> sounds<00:02:47.000> like

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
the box and here's what it sounds like

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.170 
the box and here's what it sounds like
I'm<00:02:48.830> gonna<00:02:48.980> play<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.250> with<00:02:49.340> nothing<00:02:49.970> but<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I'm gonna play it with nothing but the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.730 
I'm gonna play it with nothing but the
condensers<00:02:50.660> on<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:50.960> a<00:02:51.020> second<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.530> can<00:02:51.650> get

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
condensers on in a second so you can get

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.810 
condensers on in a second so you can get
more<00:02:51.920> of<00:02:52.010> an<00:02:52.100> idea<00:02:52.190> what<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.610> sounds<00:02:52.790> like

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
more of an idea what it sounds like

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.690 
more of an idea what it sounds like
without<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.390> sm57<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.800> Audax<00:02:55.100> d6<00:02:55.520> we're

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
without the sm57 and the Audax d6 we're

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.640 
without the sm57 and the Audax d6 we're
using<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.750> improve<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.170> just<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.380> little<00:02:57.530> bit

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
using that improve it just a little bit

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.970 
using that improve it just a little bit
I<00:02:58.430> hope<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.150> like<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.690> 5<00:03:00.080> by<00:03:00.260> 14<00:03:00.680> for<00:03:00.920> how

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
I hope you like the 5 by 14 for how

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.370 
I hope you like the 5 by 14 for how
snappy<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.640> snares<00:03:01.910> are<00:03:02.120> how<00:03:02.630> tight<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.200> bass

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
snappy the snares are how tight the bass

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.130 
snappy the snares are how tight the bass
is<00:03:03.620> despite<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.010> fact<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.340> 24<00:03:05.270> it's<00:03:05.900> not<00:03:06.110> a

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
is despite the fact that 24 it's not a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.740 
is despite the fact that 24 it's not a
very<00:03:06.290> Bumi<00:03:06.800> 24<00:03:07.280> it's<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.520> very<00:03:07.670> tight<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.600> very

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
very Bumi 24 it's a very tight but very

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.780 
very Bumi 24 it's a very tight but very
low-frequency<00:03:09.110> 24<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.100> it's<00:03:10.220> really<00:03:10.430> punchy

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
low-frequency 24 so it's really punchy

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.360 
low-frequency 24 so it's really punchy
great<00:03:11.120> for<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.300> double<00:03:11.540> bass<00:03:11.690> or<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.800> setup<00:03:13.280> I

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
great for a double bass or the setup I

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.010 
great for a double bass or the setup I
have<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.610> is<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.820> single<00:03:14.060> pedal<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:14.630> playing

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
have here is a single pedal but playing

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.800 
have here is a single pedal but playing
diddles<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.440> it's<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.620> dream<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:17.390> TomTom

diddles on it's a dream and the TomTom
sizes<00:03:18.290> here<00:03:18.470> are<00:03:18.560> really<00:03:18.800> great<00:03:19.070> because

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
sizes here are really great because

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.920 
sizes here are really great because
they're<00:03:19.790> tonal<00:03:20.150> they<00:03:20.270> project

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
they're tonal they project

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.300 
they're tonal they project
they're<00:03:21.080> very<00:03:21.200> controlled<00:03:21.739> they're<00:03:22.190> not

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
they're very controlled they're not

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.100 
they're very controlled they're not
overly<00:03:22.640> deep<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.270> lot<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.600> Ludwig<00:03:23.900> like

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
overly deep like a lot of Ludwig like

overly deep like a lot of Ludwig like
Bonham<00:03:24.500> series<00:03:24.860> kits<00:03:25.130> are<00:03:25.310> they<00:03:26.060> sound

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
Bonham series kits are they sound

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.120 
Bonham series kits are they sound
amazing<00:03:26.780> but<00:03:27.110> they're<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:27.530> deep<00:03:27.739> it's<00:03:27.890> hard<00:03:28.040> to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
amazing but they're so deep it's hard to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.130 
amazing but they're so deep it's hard to
articulate<00:03:28.520> on<00:03:28.790> them<00:03:28.970> because<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.840> tuning

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
articulate on them because the tuning

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.360 
articulate on them because the tuning
range<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.680> heads<00:03:30.860> tend<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.220> play

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
range and that the heads tend to play

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.890 
range and that the heads tend to play
loose<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:31.880> range<00:03:32.060> where<00:03:32.180> they<00:03:32.270> sound<00:03:32.540> good

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
loose and a range where they sound good

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.690 
loose and a range where they sound good
you<00:03:33.200> can<00:03:33.320> really<00:03:33.470> crank<00:03:33.739> these<00:03:33.950> articulate<00:03:34.550> on

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
you can really crank these articulate on

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.610 
you can really crank these articulate on
them<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:34.940> they<00:03:35.000> sound<00:03:35.239> really<00:03:35.540> cool<00:03:36.140> so

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
them and they sound really cool so

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.750 
them and they sound really cool so
anyway<00:03:36.920> I'm<00:03:37.070> gonna<00:03:37.160> play<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.400> little<00:03:37.550> more<00:03:37.700> I

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
anyway I'm gonna play a little more I

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.010
