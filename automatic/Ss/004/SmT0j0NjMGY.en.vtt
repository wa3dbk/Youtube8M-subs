00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.890
 the skin on the right as short yes 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.059
 now again brain cells lost arms 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.429
 welcome to another 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.469
 questioned we have anna again 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.929
 from a kata the market goes like this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 and robert of top for some time now 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.740
 abgefuckt allege is the quiz in which the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.970
 ask are so difficult at the time of the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.949
 people do not even respond to the answers 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.140
 but it is about that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.439
 it's as creative and funny as possible and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.349
 today the loser looks at the mask 2 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.780
 the psycho of the horror mystery thriller 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.719
 by Alfred Hitchcock from the year 1960 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:47.730
 is the first movie of which for 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:48.899
 again after that what do you have so please 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.910
 I would like to ask you the sentence yet 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.600
 But before the show is the first film of the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.170
 fischer is the first one to be fully ill 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.879
 movie that got some awesome price 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.879
 Surely the first movie is something 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.400
 Surely film the theme first 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.640
 dissociative personality split 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.040
 treated bad is such a mess 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.200
 aspiring or otherwise I still have psycho 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.180
 it was filmed in 3d but was filmed 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 two de aired but in 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.430
 selected cinemas even if area 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.939
 namely, that's what Karas had on 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.439
 the 3ds 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.560
 this scene became and the knife there 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.659
 you can read it 13 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.950
 Part 3 which also turns or gives in 3d 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.329
 too many scenes wherever people like that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.710
 a camera I'm still stabbing as a camera 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.210
 third answer yes that the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.890
 first film with the alfred hitchcock 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.630
 During the shooting, cut more 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.630
 as many as 10,000 calories a day 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 Turn around in the grave not so offend the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.700
 good is right but that's me 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.619
 what I was looking for 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.390
 So I would say it the first movie 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.900
 with the people in the movie theater that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.900
 burst eardrum 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.820
 perhaps the first movie where he 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.350
 has not even been shown just in 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.910
 head shows up sometimes so she believes 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.330
 or has a fireplace on the very 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.819
 Beginning 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.080
 that was so scary that someone was in 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.030
 cinema died is not afraid 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.980
 easy but wrong psycho is the first 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.090
 movie of ever a rinse de toilette 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.430
 showed what a shit the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.380
 godfather of punk iggy pop that already 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.260
 many movies and series his voice 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.390
 lent on a tour 2006 one 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 unbelievably crazy wish to the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.890
 Organizer of individual concerts 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.019
 asked yes that should be the company so 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.610
 put the music factory or what you do 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.140
 maybe longer than that, I say 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.060
 yes iggy pop of many film and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.540
 he but it has the desire with film 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.989
 to do 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.989
 he is so good 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.819
 wanted to say here is the first here 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.989
 point that on rather than groupie 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.810
 really wanted a point after every show 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.610
 that's it so he wanted one 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.510
 have erected a statue of himself 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.060
 because he's so busy 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.140
 He wanted to have an appearance in the movie 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.230
 or he wanted to performance unfortunately 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.660
 wrong whole so i would actually 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.299
 also say that he is such a life-size 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.700
 have cardboard displays of themselves backstage 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.980
 wanted or maybe one 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.940
 so oxygen tent because it also so a 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.590
 Maybe he struck 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.090
 wanted seven dwarfs the same way 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.190
 dressed like in Disney's 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.109
 Snow White a belly dancer 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.329
 as well should be backstage room 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.859
 design of being a homosexual and 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.750
 in it newspapers are supposed to lie with 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.849
 Articles on Highly Obese 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.620
 People also have a bob hope 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.209
 Indicator behind the stage jokes 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.340
 about golf and the jazz singer bing 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.780
 crosby makes me swear exactly that 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.760
 I actually wanted to write as well 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.280
 Now it could work with lsd 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.440
 it be very funny 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.630
 the horror classic refers to halloween 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.090
 his scare especially from the mask of 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.389
 protagonist michael myers what believes 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.879
 their 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.690
 what michael myers mask is based on 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.690
 it was made 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.610
 At the beginning, the sentence was still left 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.220
 once before what Michael is based on 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.790
 myers mask is what it became 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.400
 manufactured 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.780
 in the face of the market it is probably one 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.840
 impudence and you just have it 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.930
 any disgusting pigs first 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.720
 suggestion belongs back together like that 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.670
 have or the more harmless 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.980
 Variant the face of his ex girlfriend 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.430
 everything is not right with that too 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.470
 marc and that's me too 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.010
 girlfriend of john carpenter with him 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.080
 formulated face because that's the son 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.900
 which is then dried and therefore the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.730
 mask stop or in contrast to you 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.090
 not offended it is based on the make 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.490
 So you have me up from anna robert 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.950
 just believe that the plaster 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.660
 is made 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.340
 so boring the growth in 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.870
 hospital because what is taken and that is 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.670
 unfortunately not Meyer's mask is in 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.620
 truth be a captain kirk mask 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.070
 star trek who simply painted white 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.360
 has been 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.070
 tommy lee wallace the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.930
 Production Designer had a tiny one 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.700
 budget and has the mask for one 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.280
 bought $ 98 and simply painted 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.860
 awesome 2 dollars 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.240
 ridley scott casted rodgauer in blade 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.380
 Runner without him a single time 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.480

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.050
 What did hauer do when they got together? 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.050
 met for the first time 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:56.680
 maybe he has something with him somehow 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:58.660
 a bottle of whiskey text or something like that 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.330
 drink a little courage before it starts 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.600
 maybe ne or maybe then 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.940

 what is wrong 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.070
 i loved the mask 1 with cameron 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.840
 diaz at the beginning but the mass 2 i have 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.950
 began to cry and said that 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.040
 he does not feel that way 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.870
 I need everything today 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.900
 close and special is already 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.350
 more started meeting that 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.350
 invented 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:46.990
 He completely lost his memory 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.110
 In Search of Lost Time 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:54.720
 by marcel proust recited in one 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.720
 single 180 hours 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.820
 He shook his hand 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.180
 written in the moment that is one 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:07.210
 quite as stupid as I can have done that 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.950
 00 01 points have completely written off him 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.710
 given the hand but then honors in the 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.780
 hand given the spat him apple 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.350
 or spat on her hand 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.350
 jumped directly gave all 0 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.400
 he is the correct answer 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.380
 wanted a special impression 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.900
 left and wore the first meeting 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.360
 a huge green sunglasses one 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.400
 pink dungarees and a long farther 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.290
 that counts and 2 that's what he said 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.300
 but did not do what he wore 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.849
 that's two different 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:40.030
 Two different pairs of shoes only 

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:42.009
 still wears and then he probably has him 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.470
 hand given and we go in dispute 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.389
 He never gave him the apart 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.150
 given in the hand you get 0.001 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:50.979
 I have to go see the others 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.409
 Both then still bear diverse shirt 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:54.970
 you have to get 00 02 points and 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:57.220
 So you have to be the only one the mask 

00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:01.509
 come and hope we see each other 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.039
 next week again to the next episode 

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:04.690
 I caught you again 

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.819
 few wonderful videos linked and 

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.129
 we'll see and see the mask 

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:11.940
 2 without cameras and without jim carrey 

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:11.940
 We are very happy
