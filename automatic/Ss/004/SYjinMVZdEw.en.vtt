00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
sound is really good through the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
sound is really good through the
mid-range<00:03:17.180> it's<00:03:17.480> really<00:03:17.660> very<00:03:17.810> strong<00:03:18.200> not<00:03:18.560> a

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
mid-range it's really very strong not a

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.339 
mid-range it's really very strong not a
lot<00:03:18.799> of<00:03:18.829> good<00:03:18.950> base<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.849> them<00:03:20.000> on<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.109> high<00:03:21.319> end

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
lot of good base to them on the high end

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.319 
lot of good base to them on the high end
is<00:03:21.799> fairly<00:03:22.130> good<00:03:22.489> but<00:03:22.730> there's<00:03:22.910> kind<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.209> a

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
is fairly good but there's kind of a

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.199 
is fairly good but there's kind of a
muffling<00:03:23.900> on<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.739> EQ<00:03:25.220> at<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.519> high<00:03:25.730> end<00:03:25.760> that

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
muffling on the EQ at the high end that

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.780 
muffling on the EQ at the high end that
kinda<00:03:26.510> makes<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.780> sound<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:28.190> cynically

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
kinda makes it sound like it cynically

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.170 
kinda makes it sound like it cynically
the<00:03:29.239> vocals<00:03:29.660> are<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.959> closet<00:03:30.380> if<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.919> will

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
the vocals are in a closet if you will

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.640 
the vocals are in a closet if you will
kind<00:03:32.180> of<00:03:32.209> gives<00:03:32.389> us<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.569> closeted<00:03:33.230> sort<00:03:33.530> of

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
kind of gives us a closeted sort of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.339 
kind of gives us a closeted sort of
top-end<00:03:34.130> sound<00:03:34.819> where<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.780> can<00:03:35.900> tell<00:03:36.109> high

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
top-end sound where you can tell high

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.199 
top-end sound where you can tell high
ends<00:03:36.709> there<00:03:36.980> but<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:37.370> for<00:03:37.700> some<00:03:37.849> reasons

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
ends there but it's for some reasons

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.659 
ends there but it's for some reasons
being<00:03:38.389> held<00:03:38.750> down<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:39.079> little<00:03:39.410> bit<00:03:39.669> which

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
being held down a little bit which

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.339 
being held down a little bit which
really<00:03:40.849> bothers<00:03:41.120> me<00:03:41.329> because<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.900> vocals

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
really bothers me because the vocals

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.770 
really bothers me because the vocals
should<00:03:42.530> really<00:03:42.829> shine<00:03:43.099> through<00:03:43.129> I<00:03:43.700> should<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.520 
should really shine through I should the
