00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.090
 week with the naked eye 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.880
 Early in the night the planet Jupiter 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.529
 appears northward in the constellation of 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.329
 twins and stays visible until 10:30 p.m. 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.550
 remains visible for almost 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.689
 all night like a bright star 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.579
 and reddish in the constellation of virgin 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.620
 Monday night the moon will 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.710
 stay very close to mars 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.120
 this Saturn week can be observed at 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.550
 from 19 30 in the constellation of pound 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.609
 The moon passes near him also in the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.640
 night Wednesday at dawn 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.370
 came brightest of planets Venus 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.879
 which can be seen from 3 o'clock 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.579
 to the east in the constellation of aquarium 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.220
 but this week's big attraction is 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.159
 total lunar eclipse at dawn 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.800
 Monday to Tuesday , April 15 and 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.229
 that will be visible from all over the country 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.840
 you should observe the eclipse from 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.840
 from 3 in the morning until dawn 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.590
 this week it will be possible to observe a 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.649
 of the most beautiful celestial phenomena 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.079
 a total lunar eclipse visible from all 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.979
 country at dawn from monday to tuesday 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.619
 market 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.409
 lunar eclipses happen when 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.310
 moon passes in the shadow that the earth design 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.670
 in space 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.000
 this shadow in two regions an external 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.420
 and dimmer called penumbra and the other 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.209
 center and darker called the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.590
 naked eye we only notice the passage of the moon 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.649
 by ulbra 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.590
 this particular eclipse has been targeted 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.310
 of controversies in social networks because of 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.619
 of the supposed prophecy of the bloody struggles 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.920
 the act has its origin in the pastor's book 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.530
 john rabe published in the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.049
 last year the very name of this 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.090
 prophecy is sensationalist since a 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.670
 of the main characteristics of 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.400
 lunar eclipses is precisely the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.980
 reddish color on the moon but 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.010
 appearance is caused by light rays 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.980
 that are diverted by the atmosphere 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.329
 terrestrial and occurs in all 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.569
 lunar eclipses 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.269
 a curiosity of the lunar eclipse of this 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.630
 week is that he is the first of a 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.840
 series of four total eclipses 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.959
 consecutive 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.349
 this sequence is known as tetraxim 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:52.150
 and has happened 87 times in the last two 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:54.489
 thousand years, the last one was between 2003 and 2004 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.319
 are normal events that do not 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.049
 no influence on our lives 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.630
 which caught the attention of the pastor radio 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.510
 was the fact that the dates of the next 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.849
 lunar eclipses coincide with the 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.849
 jewish holidays and easter 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.760
 feast of the tabernacle for shepherd 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.030
 this would indicate the return of the Messiah and the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.190
 doomsday is just a coincidence since 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.950
 that the Jewish calendar is based 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.470
 precisely on the moon and eventually 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.880
 dates of Jewish holidays 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.610
 with lunar eclipses 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.799
 from the beginning of the Christian era we had 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.180
 eight occasions in which the tetra 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.670
 they will not know 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.010
 holidays believing or not in the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.689
 prophecies do not miss the eclipse of 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.569
 dawn of April 15 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:43.000
 the phenomenon starts at 3 o'clock when the 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.849
 moon begins its entrance in the shadow of 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.239
 land at 4 hours and 7 minutes 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.079
 begins the total eclipse with duration of 78 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.269
 minutes 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.670
 is a spectacle that can be observed 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.129
 either with the naked eye or with binoculars or 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.439
 telescopes and unlike eclipses 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.139
 you do not need to take 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.730
 special precautions 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.069
 enjoy the occasion because the next 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.730
 total visible lunar eclipse of brazil 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.739
 will be in September 2015 only good 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.739
 observations and their books to all
