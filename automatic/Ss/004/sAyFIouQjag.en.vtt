00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
you're doing your practice test if

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.949 
you're doing your practice test if
you're<00:03:50.150> an<00:03:50.239> over-thinker

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
you're an over-thinker

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.469 
you're an over-thinker
and<00:03:51.139> you'll<00:03:51.500> go<00:03:51.650> what<00:03:51.829> but<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.370> thought<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:53.090> was

overthinking it and you'll start

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.280 
overthinking it and you'll start
training<00:03:55.489> yourself<00:03:55.879> to<00:03:56.299> not<00:03:56.449> overthink<00:03:56.870> so

best of the possible answers you aren't

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.610

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
taking a scenario ignoring the answers

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.280 
taking a scenario ignoring the answers
trying<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.489> code<00:04:13.759> it<00:04:13.939> and<00:04:14.150> see<00:04:14.629> if<00:04:14.780> your<00:04:14.989> code

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
trying to code it and see if your code

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.339 
trying to code it and see if your code
you<00:04:15.500> got<00:04:15.709> matches<00:04:16.039> one<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.120> answers<00:04:17.509> you

don't have that kind of time you need to

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.560 
don't have that kind of time you need to
look<00:04:20.720> up<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.079> answers<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:22.029> then<00:04:23.029> go<00:04:23.240> read<00:04:23.450> the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
look up the answers and then go read the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.480 
look up the answers and then go read the
scenario<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:24.349> mean<00:04:24.770> except<00:04:25.039> for<00:04:25.190> maybe<00:04:25.310> some

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
scenario I mean except for maybe some

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.709 
scenario I mean except for maybe some
medical<00:04:25.789> terminology<00:04:25.969> questions<00:04:26.599> or

whatever

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.230 
whatever
but<00:04:27.530> once<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.919> know<00:04:27.949> what<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.759> differences

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
but once you know what the differences

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.029 
but once you know what the differences
are<00:04:29.389> between<00:04:29.569> the<00:04:29.870> answers<00:04:30.199> you<00:04:30.650> know<00:04:30.770> what<00:04:30.949> to

are between the answers you know what to

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.860 
are between the answers you know what to
abstract<00:04:31.340> for<00:04:31.639> in<00:04:31.789> the<00:04:31.849> scenario<00:04:32.270> right

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
abstract for in the scenario right

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.420 
abstract for in the scenario right
because<00:04:33.560> you're<00:04:33.680> nervous<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.099> you're<00:04:34.159> taking

because you're nervous and you're taking
the<00:04:34.460> test<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.729> you're<00:04:34.819> reading<00:04:34.970> everything

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
the test and you're reading everything

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.869 
the test and you're reading everything
and<00:04:35.979> everything<00:04:36.979> seems<00:04:37.219> important<00:04:37.729> and

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:37.879 
and everything seems important and

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.730 
and everything seems important and
you're<00:04:38.240> be<00:04:38.389> circling<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.139> underlining<00:04:39.500> and

you're be circling and underlining and
highlighting<00:04:39.939> everything<00:04:40.939> and<00:04:41.300> then<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:41.509> go

highlighting everything and then you go

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:43.330 
highlighting everything and then you go
look<00:04:41.810> at<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:41.990> answers<00:04:42.319> like<00:04:42.409> oh<00:04:42.560> that<00:04:43.250> really

look at the answers like oh that really
tested<00:04:43.699> me<00:04:43.759> on<00:04:43.849> the<00:04:43.939> difference<00:04:44.210> between<00:04:44.270> a

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
tested me on the difference between a

okay so here's a method it's the the

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.089 
okay so here's a method it's the the
multiple<00:05:05.479> passes<00:05:06.229> method<00:05:06.620> we<00:05:06.710> talked<00:05:06.949> about

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
multiple passes method we talked about

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.920 
multiple passes method we talked about
the<00:05:07.340> one<00:05:07.520> hour<00:05:07.669> per<00:05:07.909> column<00:05:10.240> so<00:05:11.240> if<00:05:11.449> you<00:05:11.599> if<00:05:11.780> you

the one hour per column so if you if you

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.899 
the one hour per column so if you if you
cycle<00:05:12.259> through<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.620> whole<00:05:12.770> exam<00:05:13.129> forget

of the easy ones use the 1.2 dot for the

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.719 
of the easy ones use the 1.2 dot for the
ones<00:05:20.719> that<00:05:20.870> you're<00:05:20.990> gonna<00:05:21.110> leave<00:05:21.349> behind<00:05:21.550> okay

the<00:05:28.699> one<00:05:28.879> dot<00:05:29.090> you're<00:05:29.270> gonna<00:05:29.360> go<00:05:29.449> for<00:05:29.539> the

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
the one dot you're gonna go for the

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.719 
the one dot you're gonna go for the
medium<00:05:29.960> hard<00:05:30.169> ones<00:05:30.349> right<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:31.009> you're<00:05:31.610> gonna

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
medium hard ones right and you're gonna

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.240 
medium hard ones right and you're gonna
answer<00:05:31.940> as<00:05:32.240> many<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.509> those<00:05:32.690> as<00:05:32.930> you<00:05:32.960> can<00:05:33.250> then

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
answer as many of those as you can then

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.740 
answer as many of those as you can then
on<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.490> third<00:05:34.759> pass<00:05:35.090> you're<00:05:35.389> going<00:05:35.539> to<00:05:35.599> do

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
on the third pass you're going to do

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.589 
on the third pass you're going to do
those<00:05:35.870> two<00:05:36.139> dot<00:05:36.349> ones<00:05:37.060> until<00:05:38.060> you<00:05:38.270> run<00:05:38.419> out<00:05:38.569> of

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
those two dot ones until you run out of

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.170 
those two dot ones until you run out of
time<00:05:38.810> okay<00:05:40.629> and<00:05:41.629> then<00:05:41.779> that<00:05:41.990> way<00:05:42.199> you<00:05:42.500> are

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
time okay and then that way you are

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.790 
time okay and then that way you are
increasing<00:05:44.180> your<00:05:44.419> chances<00:05:44.930> of<00:05:44.960> success<00:05:45.409> and

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
increasing your chances of success and

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.249 
increasing your chances of success and
you're<00:05:46.339> leaving<00:05:46.729> those<00:05:46.879> 45<00:05:47.360> wrong<00:05:47.719> ones<00:05:48.020> for

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
you're leaving those 45 wrong ones for

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.249 
you're leaving those 45 wrong ones for
the<00:05:48.319> really<00:05:48.589> hard<00:05:48.620> ones<00:05:49.210> okay<00:05:50.210> a<00:05:50.419> lot<00:05:51.199> of

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
the really hard ones okay a lot of

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.439 
the really hard ones okay a lot of
people<00:05:51.440> do<00:05:51.710> have<00:05:51.889> time<00:05:52.099> left<00:05:52.279> over<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.909> you

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
people do have time left over and you

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.499 
people do have time left over and you
can<00:05:53.750> go<00:05:53.930> back<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.259> check<00:05:54.440> some<00:05:54.650> work<00:05:55.360> but<00:05:56.360> as

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
can go back and check some work but as

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.860 
can go back and check some work but as
you've<00:05:56.690> probably<00:05:56.870> heard<00:05:57.379> your<00:05:57.949> first<00:05:58.870> gut

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
you've probably heard your first gut

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.749 
you've probably heard your first gut
reaction<00:05:59.900> of<00:06:00.680> what<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:00.979> answer<00:06:01.370> is<00:06:01.400> is

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
reaction of what the answer is is

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.909 
reaction of what the answer is is
probably<00:06:02.120> right<00:06:02.659> and<00:06:02.930> if<00:06:03.349> you're<00:06:03.469> just<00:06:03.620> going

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
probably right and if you're just going

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:04.959 
probably right and if you're just going
back<00:06:04.069> because<00:06:04.159> you<00:06:04.310> have<00:06:04.430> extra<00:06:04.639> time<00:06:04.669> and

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969 
back because you have extra time and

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.300 
back because you have extra time and
you're<00:06:05.089> check-ins<00:06:05.599> don't<00:06:06.349> do<00:06:06.500> that<00:06:06.680> but<00:06:07.190> if

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
you're check-ins don't do that but if

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.619 
you're check-ins don't do that but if
you<00:06:07.430> had<00:06:07.639> one<00:06:07.849> that<00:06:07.940> you<00:06:08.060> really<00:06:08.240> want<00:06:08.479> to<00:06:08.539> go

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
you had one that you really want to go

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.290 
you had one that you really want to go
back<00:06:08.750> and<00:06:08.990> check<00:06:09.199> put<00:06:10.039> a<00:06:10.069> checkmark<00:06:10.400> on<00:06:10.879> your

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
back and check put a checkmark on your

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.659 
back and check put a checkmark on your
answer<00:06:11.690> grid<00:06:11.900> next<00:06:12.589> to<00:06:12.800> that<00:06:12.949> question<00:06:13.370> number

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
answer grid next to that question number

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.790 
answer grid next to that question number
so<00:06:14.659> you<00:06:14.750> don't<00:06:14.900> waste<00:06:15.080> time<00:06:15.229> and<00:06:15.529> start

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
so you don't waste time and start

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.290 
so you don't waste time and start
changing<00:06:16.129> things<00:06:16.520> that<00:06:16.699> were<00:06:16.789> already<00:06:16.969> right

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
changing things that were already right

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.390 
changing things that were already right
ones<00:06:17.990> that<00:06:18.139> you're<00:06:18.259> like<00:06:18.379> I'm<00:06:18.529> just<00:06:18.589> truly<00:06:19.250> not

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
ones that you're like I'm just truly not

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.740 
ones that you're like I'm just truly not
sure<00:06:19.610> and<00:06:19.879> I've<00:06:19.969> got<00:06:20.180> it<00:06:20.300> narrowed<00:06:20.419> down<00:06:20.599> to

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
sure and I've got it narrowed down to

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.409 
sure and I've got it narrowed down to
answer<00:06:21.710> a<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.039> C<00:06:22.190> but<00:06:22.819> I<00:06:22.849> got<00:06:23.029> to<00:06:23.150> come<00:06:23.270> back

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
answer a and C but I got to come back

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.909 
answer a and C but I got to come back
and<00:06:23.599> work<00:06:24.020> it<00:06:24.169> a<00:06:24.229> little<00:06:24.379> bit<00:06:24.500> but<00:06:24.589> I<00:06:24.650> want<00:06:24.860> to

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
and work it a little bit but I want to

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.110 
and work it a little bit but I want to
move<00:06:25.039> on<00:06:25.159> I<00:06:25.190> want<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.430> keep<00:06:25.550> my<00:06:25.669> speed<00:06:25.909> going

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
move on I want to keep my speed going

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.829 
move on I want to keep my speed going
okay<00:06:26.810> which<00:06:27.529> by<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:27.800> way<00:06:28.330> if<00:06:29.330> you've<00:06:29.569> narrowed

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:29.839 
okay which by the way if you've narrowed

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.869 
okay which by the way if you've narrowed
it<00:06:30.020> down<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.229> two<00:06:30.620> which<00:06:31.069> you<00:06:31.250> probably<00:06:31.460> will

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879 
it down to two which you probably will

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.600 
it down to two which you probably will
what<00:06:32.629> I<00:06:32.659> do<00:06:33.289> on<00:06:33.560> the<00:06:33.650> answer<00:06:34.009> grid<00:06:34.219> is<00:06:34.430> I<00:06:34.550> just

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
what I do on the answer grid is I just

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.579 
what I do on the answer grid is I just
do<00:06:34.940> a<00:06:34.969> light<00:06:35.270> pencil<00:06:35.750> mark<00:06:35.959> through<00:06:36.259> the<00:06:36.349> two

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
do a light pencil mark through the two

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.379 
do a light pencil mark through the two
that<00:06:36.830> I<00:06:36.889> think<00:06:36.979> are<00:06:37.279> the<00:06:37.520> possibly<00:06:38.089> correct

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
that I think are the possibly correct

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.780 
that I think are the possibly correct
answers<00:06:38.899> so<00:06:39.680> when<00:06:39.919> I'm<00:06:40.130> at<00:06:40.250> the<00:06:40.279> very

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
answers so when I'm at the very

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
you have 25% chance of getting it right

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.060 
you have 25% chance of getting it right
right<00:06:47.240> if<00:06:48.020> you've<00:06:48.200> narrowed<00:06:48.410> it<00:06:48.590> down<00:06:48.620> to<00:06:48.740> two
