00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello my dear friends and warmly 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 welcome to a little new one 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.610
 Information video re 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.700
 tanks and indeed regarding a mods it 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 is about that or models pack what i where 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.810
 I introduce you to a little innovation 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 I want the king max 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.560
 from or mortis or or yourself 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.060
 written concerning the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.109
 configuration and indeed his new 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.910
 feature which I like you very much 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.660
 want to introduce that is now too 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.179
 already set up 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.600
 I already have that in the short time 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.989
 adapted last world of tanks part 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.510
 and that it is now easy times 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.770
 to get a configuration and that 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.000
 I would like to introduce you briefly 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.190
 So if you're in the video for example 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.100
 new motto or something from me 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.649
 then you can just do that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.329
 or mortis pack and I'll load 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.789
 then always my configuration for 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 to provide 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.230
 He just makes that start 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.629
 the or mortis pack or update 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.700
 Reconfiguration or if you still have it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.030
 have not installed on it then installed 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.939
 that simply by mortis 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 installer and continues so far in 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.380
 this menu comes where you have the components 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.229
 you can select and here you click 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.540
 on this l and then there is the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.570
 profile and there I am also with it 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.909
 this is my profile what I myself almost 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.770
 So I'll show you how I care 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.119
 I do that 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.490
 clicking on it presses on ok and you 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.140
 gets the profiles, so to speak 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.670
 I'll just take that one 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.020
 caramba profiles would be the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.100
 attitude you see that now 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.930
 a little something jumped over 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.130
 I'll just load it again 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.780
 my configuration 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.020
 then everything starts again 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.210
 a bit around and a thing I want 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.500
 I'll change that very soon 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.430
 with me now just the times 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.110
 take out extreme clear icons and that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.170
 upload whole times 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.780
 so now those are my attitude 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.719
 so to speak, and you have it then 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.060
 almost exactly the same as I have 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.920
 otherwise it just goes on 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.490
 and always when I mean mine 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.840
 change components 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.660
 or a bit different to a 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.400
 mutant now and then so big change 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.550
 I rarely do but it certainly can 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.380
 for example, not me 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
 i use new crosshair cross 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.170
 Actually, we always say it myself 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.580
 use another hangarter i have 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.820
 right now in the winter on the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.470
 very last seen because they are still 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.330
 which can load quickly now 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.220
 he wants to be there he is from last time 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.270
 already seen in the mirror and you see 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.710
 then, for example, that I have one 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.000
 other hangar have such as 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:46.690
 the winter has then yes I update that 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.090
 whole again and you can do yours 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.760
 play or an aspect at too 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.260
 reconfigure and mine again 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.320
 profile and have mine again 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.240
 latest modification good otherwise 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.110
 Everything as you go on he continues 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.220
 me after my old one 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.600
 configuration files the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.320
 restore auto club 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.630
 for example, how to continue the whole 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.230
 links and then read tmn faction 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.680
 hardworking the whole packages I 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.450
 have on it 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.690
 as an engine watch you can continue us 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.400
 also based on my configuration 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.690
 then continue to do something about it 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.260
 take something away 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.050
 that is all possible, no problem 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.940
 and if you mean, for example 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.710
 my sound mod do not like you can 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.080
 scroll down to the sound mods 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.300
 mine as quasi rausnehmen and thus 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.160
 play the standard sounds or 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.070
 take very different with purely 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.020
 So that's all that's possible 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.700
 nothing fixes now 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.130
 but who might be interested 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.410
 is to play or be with my mods 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.810
 to set world of tanks like me 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.790
 set it up for me 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.190
 hopefully a relief or 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.660
 that is a very nice one very nice 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.240
 feature what he have taken since 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.800
 I think it's cool because of me 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.360
 of course that demanded more often 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.790
 must and that makes him of course 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.200
 a whole corner easier I have to 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.120
 not but somehow new update or 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.770
 do something or new new video 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.130
 turn when my needs to change 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.360
 to have 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.550
 but i can just go here 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.290
 change configuration throw high and 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.359
 You can then choose the respective 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.760
 draw configuration on your computer 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.230
 Well that should be it again for 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.080
 today or from this video 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.670
 my mods have just been 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.250
 you see that here in the 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.320
 background and we'll see you at 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.320
 Next time I wish for a lookout
