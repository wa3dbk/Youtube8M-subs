okay<00:05:59.889> and<00:06:00.279> here's<00:06:00.489> the<00:06:00.549> back<00:06:00.879> of<00:06:00.909> the<00:06:01.119> unit

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:01.679 
okay and here's the back of the unit

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:08.219 
okay and here's the back of the unit
here's<00:06:02.679> your<00:06:03.039> AC<00:06:03.549> plug<00:06:04.059> your<00:06:04.749> fuse<00:06:06.689> your<00:06:07.689> AC

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
here's your AC plug your fuse your AC

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:09.899 
here's your AC plug your fuse your AC
volt<00:06:08.589> so<00:06:08.739> you<00:06:08.829> can<00:06:08.919> go<00:06:09.039> between<00:06:09.219> like<00:06:09.549> I<00:06:09.729> guess

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
volt so you can go between like I guess

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.469 
volt so you can go between like I guess
I<00:06:10.089> think<00:06:10.359> uh<00:06:11.249> 115<00:06:12.249> I<00:06:12.309> think<00:06:12.459> I<00:06:12.489> 125<00:06:13.089> isn't<00:06:13.389> like

get<00:06:19.119> your<00:06:19.359> FX<00:06:20.199> loop<00:06:20.409> return<00:06:20.919> and<00:06:21.039> send<00:06:21.279> and

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:21.549 
get your FX loop return and send and

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:24.659 
get your FX loop return and send and
your<00:06:22.239> effects<00:06:22.479> boost<00:06:22.809> you<00:06:22.989> can<00:06:23.019> see<00:06:23.259> pull<00:06:23.669> so

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
your effects boost you can see pull so

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.629 
your effects boost you can see pull so
it<00:06:25.119> push-pull<00:06:25.599> pot<00:06:25.889> so<00:06:26.889> there's<00:06:27.489> where<00:06:27.579> the

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
it push-pull pot so there's where the

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.269 
it push-pull pot so there's where the
flips<00:06:28.029> goes<00:06:28.209> in<00:06:28.419> you<00:06:29.169> do<00:06:29.529> a<00:06:29.559> channel<00:06:30.039> switch

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
flips goes in you do a channel switch

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:33.589 
flips goes in you do a channel switch
was<00:06:30.579> right<00:06:30.819> there<00:06:31.059> um<00:06:31.679> you<00:06:32.679> got<00:06:32.829> your<00:06:32.979> speaker

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
was right there um you got your speaker

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.669 
was right there um you got your speaker
outputs<00:06:34.599> so<00:06:34.839> you<00:06:34.929> have<00:06:35.049> to<00:06:35.139> do<00:06:35.259> two<00:06:35.409> speakers

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:35.679 
outputs so you have to do two speakers

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:36.409 
outputs so you have to do two speakers
if<00:06:35.829> you<00:06:35.889> want<00:06:36.039> to

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:40.059 
there's your own slot switches and then

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:41.459 
there's your own slot switches and then
there's<00:06:40.360> your<00:06:40.479> line<00:06:40.749> out<00:06:40.929> so<00:06:41.169> if<00:06:41.229> you<00:06:41.289> can<00:06:41.409> do

cabinet or like a load box because if

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.359 
cabinet or like a load box because if
not<00:06:51.789> tube<00:06:52.179> amps<00:06:52.509> you<00:06:53.349> will<00:06:53.559> blow<00:06:53.769> something<00:06:54.189> if

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:54.369 
not tube amps you will blow something if

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:55.679 
not tube amps you will blow something if
you<00:06:54.459> don't<00:06:54.609> have<00:06:54.699> it<00:06:54.759> hooked<00:06:54.909> up<00:06:55.089> to<00:06:55.389> where<00:06:55.539> it

doesn't the tubes put the load so and

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.839 
doesn't the tubes put the load so and
then<00:06:58.769> here<00:06:59.769> is<00:07:00.129> the<00:07:01.019> tube<00:07:02.019> as<00:07:02.229> well

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:02.849 
then here is the tube as well

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:05.309 
then here is the tube as well
Kassie<00:07:03.849> tubes<00:07:04.239> kind<00:07:04.479> of<00:07:04.539> glowing<00:07:04.809> there<00:07:04.989> so

Kassie tubes kind of glowing there so

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.139 
Kassie tubes kind of glowing there so
the<00:07:06.039> tubes<00:07:06.279> are<00:07:06.429> actually<00:07:06.639> pretty<00:07:06.819> new<00:07:06.969> they
