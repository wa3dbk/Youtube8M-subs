00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.970
 they look times since upwards 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.160
 indiana jones spiderman superman and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.390
 micky mouse do not be scared i found that 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.759
 not here but just counting 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 some of the climbing routes at the wild 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.170
 emperors in tirol are on some of them 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 but no mickey mouse tours 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.360
 but are among the most difficult of the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.059
 world 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.370
 To master those needs a lot 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.989
 courage and of course you can do it all 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.730
 certain weather conditions 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.800
 what they are that they see in today 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.800
 a servus the weather on servus tv 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.660
 yes we are in the eastern part of today 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.240
 North Tyrol is recorded here schematically 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.420
 more specifically in south of the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.380
 kaiser mountains and very roughly 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.720
 is this part of the northern 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.220
 Kalkalpen between the german border 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.220
 and kitzbÃ¼hel 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.520
 so all I have to do now is the guru 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.740
 Under root find that is one 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.570
 extremely climber and he knows this 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.150
 of course here in and out 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.150
 The question is only where we depend 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.880
 is that already fix is one 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.650
 highlight good climbing weather again 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.930
 Zusagen for my for my taste 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.510
 he bisserl and indeed yes for 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.800
 the climbing routes are actually difficult routes 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.720
 rather if it is a bit cooler 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.479
 through the sunshine or us 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.729
 are or worked in the south wall of this 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.560
 the rock hoffmann could at inn 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.600
 to get my english clock is one 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.459
 pieces fill your feet bit by bit 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.420
 bloated and the same is with it 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.580
 the fingers if you then for example 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.980
 small grips we always have to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.050
 something like that, the skin is not quite like that 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.019
 hard-wearing of the will for example 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.940
 as cool 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.209
 10 12 degrees and what if it's too cold 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.860
 It is of course not optimal because 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.890
 then at some point just lose that 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.810
 feeling in the fingers and then you know 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.430
 how big the grip is or how clear you are 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.950
 You also practice free climbing and speed 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.690
 climb out what exactly does he mean 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.220
 free climbing never say now 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.650
 will probably be many people 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.570
 understand that you are unsecured in the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.880
 rocks moved it was then free is solo 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.290
 climb and free climbing or 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.180
 I'm freezing like that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.209
 Veiled water for operating that is 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.329
 with rope securing the routen processes the 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.100
 trains are rehearsed when and exercise 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.110
 only if you then the route enormous train 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.910
 Can fall through without falling through 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.079
 the hook securing points 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.510
 hold 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.980
 then this valid inspection is over 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.360
 the crazy also like a route 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.130
 Try something in stock 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.130
 be sure to patric 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.170
 very important it is the second sixth 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.569
 the topic two feet on the wall 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.760
 horstmann logically and look 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.769
 that always a focus as well as possible 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.480
 over the feet brings then pushes 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.170
 actually pretty energy saving in it 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.170
 were 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.829
 provides 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.250
 why is actually the wild emperor 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.420
 as popular with climbers as you can 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.130
 it does not climb winter either 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.110
 the reason why in winter the 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.360
 Christian simply this giant 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.730
 kessel and then she has it in winter 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.650
 on this great stone oven and it 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.570
 happens at the tents in the winter 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.400
 lead media and then 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.840
 raised in shorts and without t 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.730
 climbing shirt and this is 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.320
 veil what may actually be unique 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.450
 that the self-climbing area is that 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.940
 Climb all year if it's cool 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.100
 when it rains like music inside 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.100
 yellow wall area of the body 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.180
 Riedel here at the Veil waterfall there 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.610
 there are about 150 climbing routes but it is 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.990
 So there are always new ones 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.570
 it means exactly when you say now 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.120
 matschie closes a route if 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.220
 my route new closes you have to first 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.250
 Once you even discover the line 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.320
 must first war called logical 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.240
 Pick up in the rock recognize this needs 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.760
 you have a good eye and then you have to 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.010
 of course that's what it's all about 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.000
 Impact drill message with the hooks 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.150
 to come to it 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.730
 there will be so-called policeman 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.380
 spreads bad if so with an impact drill 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.940
 put in the wall at the right place 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.220
 put the one that the klette position 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.630
 hang well that one is secured what 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.980
 is actually when you are in the wall 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.419
 inside hangs and suddenly comes the 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.350
 winner of the title quite fast 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.480
 to record 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.280
 yes that will be very problematic if 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.290
 we did not shoot in the run about 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.700
 the weather situation informs what 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.550
 Of course you always look that one 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.930
 route to the moment where to 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.520
 for example, when he thunders for the afternoon 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.710
 enter that one up to that 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.970
 time has ended at the latest what 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.650
 makes for you actually the attraction 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.510
 So climbing out puts one 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.760
 own philosophy behind the 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.960
 fascination the attraction of climbing for 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.870
 Actually , that makes me that way 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.090
 totally at the moment could actually be 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.620
 just focus on the next one 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.460
 and hide everything there are none 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.710
 thoughts more 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.229
 there are just only the act to 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.950
 next train because it's just in here 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.930
 and now 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.690
 you are an all-rounder but you can 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.140
 also very good speed climb times 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.490
 try 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.260
 would you want to show us what 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.260
 needs like what we see in a moment 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.310
 The choir will now be under proof 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.860
 what he has as a speed ketterer on it 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.930
 He is about 28 feet below me and will 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.260
 into the climbing route number one 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.130
 enter difficulty level 9 - there 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.510
 I would after three meters 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.750
 probably failing to be secured 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.410
 now from his girlfriend the julia like 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.410
 you are ready 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:27.480
 ok then on my command 3 2 1 go 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:52.820
 wow two minutes 36 of this awesome time 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:59.240
 is satisfied with bassecourt higher where 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:07:02.090
 is usually no idea why here 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.770
 and to say the work okay, but by the way 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.700
 you can definitely learn something 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.900
 thank you very much annoying and that's it 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.890
 again from the Middle East 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.360
 rescuer on servus tv 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.800
 Of course it will be tomorrow , of course 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.190
 Then there we are only one 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.590
 stone throw away from here and that with 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.540
 a so called runner in the 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.490
 Wild Emperor's area on the way and 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.770
 we show ourselves that one is 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.450
 landscape as it can eat here 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.280
 like that possible 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.590
 that's you tomorrow if they are yours 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.770
 show again where the weather works like 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.770
 servus and brought it down
