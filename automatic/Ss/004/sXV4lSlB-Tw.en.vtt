of a very idea that you find because

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.130 
of a very idea that you find because
when<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.680> shows<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.160> solution<00:02:44.670> he<00:02:44.910> gives<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
when it shows the solution he gives the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.440 
when it shows the solution he gives the
reader<00:02:46.620> an<00:02:47.010> amount<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.490> points<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:48.150> each<00:02:48.720> each

variation or idea that if we found so

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.850 
variation or idea that if we found so
it's<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.420> think<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.750> very<00:02:54.870> good<00:02:55.140> exercise<00:02:55.410> for

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
it's I think is a very good exercise for

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.420 
it's I think is a very good exercise for
the<00:02:56.070> let's<00:02:56.580> say<00:02:56.730> more<00:02:56.970> serious<00:02:58.130> player<00:02:59.130> who

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
the let's say more serious player who

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.180 
the let's say more serious player who
wants<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.850> improve<00:03:00.530> I'm<00:03:01.530> very<00:03:01.800> happy<00:03:02.100> with

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190

on the board now is actually one of the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.730 
on the board now is actually one of the
examples<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.080> he<00:03:07.580> uses<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:09.560> explain<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
examples that he uses to explain the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.100 
examples that he uses to explain the
theme<00:03:10.980> about<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.970> combinations<00:03:12.870> that

theme about the combinations that

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.340 
theme about the combinations that
involve<00:03:13.820> promotion<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.320> know

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
involve promotion so now that you know

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.080 
involve promotion so now that you know
the<00:03:16.590> theme<00:03:16.830> maybe<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.400> would<00:03:17.550> like<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.940> have<00:03:18.060> a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
the theme maybe you would like to have a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.850 
the theme maybe you would like to have a
look<00:03:18.240> at<00:03:18.330> position<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.930> try<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.140> find<00:03:19.470> it's

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
look at position and try to find it's

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.570 
look at position and try to find it's
black<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.400> move<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:21.410> what<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:23.280> way<00:03:23.460> is<00:03:23.730> to

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
black to move and what the way is to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.360 
black to move and what the way is to
promote<00:03:26.580> with<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:27.170> past<00:03:28.170> bonus<00:03:28.560> e4<00:03:28.920> because

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
promote with this past bonus e4 because

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.910 
promote with this past bonus e4 because
that's<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.760> key<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.210> piece<00:03:30.960> of<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.350> position

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
that's the key a piece of the position

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.640 
that's the key a piece of the position
I'll<00:03:32.760> continue<00:03:33.210> explaining<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.870> solution<00:03:34.290> so

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
I'll continue explaining the solution so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.100 
I'll continue explaining the solution so
if<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.550> want<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.850> have<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> try<00:03:36.390> yourself

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
if you want to have a try yourself

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.990 
if you want to have a try yourself
pause<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.890> video

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.580 

okay<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:42.410> correct<00:03:42.770> move<00:03:42.950> here<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:44.590> Bishop

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
okay so the correct move here is Bishop

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.240 
okay so the correct move here is Bishop
to<00:03:45.740> h3<00:03:45.890> check<00:03:46.450> it's<00:03:47.450> not<00:03:47.800> very<00:03:48.800> difficult<00:03:49.190> to

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
to h3 check it's not very difficult to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.650 
to h3 check it's not very difficult to
find<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.550> one<00:03:49.730> because<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.060> bishop<00:03:50.420> cannot

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
find that one because this bishop cannot

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.320 
find that one because this bishop cannot
be<00:03:50.750> taken<00:03:51.170> if<00:03:51.500> King<00:03:51.800> takes<00:03:52.070> is<00:03:52.250> free<00:03:52.520> then<00:03:52.760> the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
be taken if King takes is free then the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.130 
be taken if King takes is free then the
Queen<00:03:53.540> false<00:03:53.780> Queen<00:03:54.230> takes<00:03:54.440> f2<00:03:55.540> but<00:03:56.540> after<00:03:57.050> you

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
Queen false Queen takes f2 but after you

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.920 
Queen false Queen takes f2 but after you
thought<00:03:57.470> about<00:03:58.340> what<00:03:58.790> happens<00:03:59.180> after<00:03:59.600> king<00:03:59.780> to

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
thought about what happens after king to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.990 
thought about what happens after king to
g1<00:04:00.910> if<00:04:01.910> you're<00:04:02.600> not<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.620> didn't<00:04:03.950> look<00:04:04.760> at<00:04:04.880> this

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
g1 if you're not you didn't look at this

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.720 
g1 if you're not you didn't look at this
with<00:04:05.300> this<00:04:05.450> possibility<00:04:06.490> pause<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.640> video

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
with this possibility pause the video

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.120 
with this possibility pause the video
again<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.150> have<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> look<00:04:08.690> at<00:04:08.810> what<00:04:08.990> can<00:04:09.560> black

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
again and have a look at what can black

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.750 
again and have a look at what can black
do<00:04:10.460> now<00:04:11.500> I'll<00:04:12.500> continue<00:04:12.860> explaining<00:04:13.490> the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
do now I'll continue explaining the

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.330 
do now I'll continue explaining the
solution<00:04:14.150> in<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.750> few<00:04:14.930> seconds<00:04:17.680> alright<00:04:18.680> so

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
solution in a few seconds alright so

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.140 
solution in a few seconds alright so
right<00:04:20.120> here<00:04:20.480> it's<00:04:20.720> not<00:04:20.959> enough<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:22.280> exchange

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
right here it's not enough to exchange

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.720 
right here it's not enough to exchange
the<00:04:23.810> queen<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.290> bishop<00:04:24.590> if<00:04:24.740> Queen<00:04:25.550> takes

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
the queen and the bishop if Queen takes

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.170 
the queen and the bishop if Queen takes
f2<00:04:26.210> King<00:04:26.720> takes<00:04:26.990> us<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.670> Bishop<00:04:28.670> checks<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:28.970> one

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
f2 King takes us to Bishop checks of one

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.450 
f2 King takes us to Bishop checks of one
King<00:04:29.780> takes<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.140> one<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.770> if<00:04:30.980> we<00:04:31.070> if<00:04:31.340> you

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
King takes of one and if we if you

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.880 
King takes of one and if we if you
advance<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.850> bones<00:04:32.030> then<00:04:32.450> then<00:04:33.110> Keeney<00:04:33.410> -<00:04:33.650> and

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
advance the bones then then Keeney - and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.560 
advance the bones then then Keeney - and
white<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.580> in<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.120> square<00:04:35.900> of<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:37.330> black<00:04:38.330> bone

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
white is in the square of the black bone

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.010 
white is in the square of the black bone
so<00:04:38.870> this<00:04:39.080> black<00:04:39.530> bone<00:04:39.770> will<00:04:40.010> be<00:04:40.250> taken<00:04:41.120> soon

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
so this black bone will be taken soon

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.680 
so this black bone will be taken soon
and<00:04:42.350> then<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:43.190> will<00:04:43.430> be<00:04:43.550> white<00:04:43.790> but<00:04:44.300> we'll<00:04:44.480> have

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
and then it will be white but we'll have

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.430 
and then it will be white but we'll have
a<00:04:44.750> winning<00:04:45.020> bone<00:04:45.680> ending<00:04:46.040> with<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.310> pawn<00:04:46.550> more

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
a winning bone ending with a pawn more

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.080 
a winning bone ending with a pawn more
but<00:04:48.440> what<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.830> possible<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:50.290> pin<00:04:51.290> the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
but what is possible is to pin the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.210 
but what is possible is to pin the
bishop<00:04:53.090> on<00:04:53.180> f1<00:04:53.480> by<00:04:53.810> moving<00:04:53.990> into<00:04:54.290> a1<00:04:54.560> that's

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
bishop on f1 by moving into a1 that's

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.280 
bishop on f1 by moving into a1 that's
what<00:04:55.340> happened<00:04:55.640> in<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:55.820> game<00:04:56.000> Queen<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.990> a-1

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
what happened in the game Queen to a-1
