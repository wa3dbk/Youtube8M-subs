video it's only for the first two hours
of<00:02:33.189> your<00:02:33.609> prestige<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.930> not<00:02:35.650> super<00:02:36.250> worth<00:02:36.430> it

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
of your prestige so not super worth it

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.940

and<00:02:39.129> this<00:02:39.250> might<00:02:39.549> be<00:02:39.819> kind<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.359> maybe<00:02:40.540> worth<00:02:40.870> it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
and this might be kind of maybe worth it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.199
