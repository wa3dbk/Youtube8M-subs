 hello to all of you delighted with you 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.090

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.129
 you submit a quote is so it's 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.509
 a fortifying oil for nails 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.490
 I hope it's worth blair and we 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.930
 start right now you'll have everything 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.210
 first need a bottle of varnish 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.430
 quickly that you will have previously 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.720
 cleaned up I then use a 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.300
 funnel for not putting all my 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.859
 products next so I place it on the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.109
 bottle of polish I will then take 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.820
 my castor oil and I will come in 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.480
 add in the bottle until around 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 half 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.240
 I will take lemon so 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.790
 a half lemon there but I'm not going 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.820
 put everything just put some 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.820
 drops 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.940
 and finally I take oil 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.200
 olive is there so I'm going to add 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.530
 until my bottle is 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.530
 filled 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.440
 so I'll then remove the funnel 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.440
 is stuffed my bottle of varnish 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.420
 and so here I am going to come help and 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.540
 energetically so that everything mixes 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.540
 well 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.670
 but once he's shaken 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.150
 geneva a power to apply it on my 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.500
 nails 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.000
 so I will apply enough 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.800
 generously on my nails and I 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.270
 do not forget especially the cuticles is 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.270
 so of course all the outline of the nail 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.680
 so once I'm fine 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.629
 applied everywhere I'm going to come massaged 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.409
 each of my nails for the project 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.409
 was full well 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.340
 enoch once I'll have mass and all 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.620
 my nails I will wait 10 minutes 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.390
 and if there is a surplus at the end it's 10 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.090
 minutes I will be able to come and try 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.650

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.330
