00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
constructed of an armoire that I bought

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.939 
constructed of an armoire that I bought
at<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.559> swap<00:00:13.860> meet<00:00:14.299> I<00:00:15.299> took<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.289> gutted<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.830> all

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
at a swap meet I took and gutted it all

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.060 
at a swap meet I took and gutted it all
out<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:19.130> filled<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:21.920> lying<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
out and filled it up with lying the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.429 
out and filled it up with lying the
walls<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:24.359> blue<00:00:24.539> insulation<00:00:25.199> board

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
walls with some blue insulation board

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.820 
walls with some blue insulation board
and<00:00:25.769> then<00:00:26.250> put<00:00:26.460> grout<00:00:26.699> all<00:00:27.000> over<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
and then put grout all over the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.839 
and then put grout all over the
insulation<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.130> kind<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.369> give<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
insulation to kind of give it like a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.319 
insulation to kind of give it like a
rock<00:00:30.210> wall<00:00:30.480> finish<00:00:31.579> you<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.730> see<00:00:32.880> there's<00:00:33.090> got

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
rock wall finish you can see there's got

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.380 
rock wall finish you can see there's got
some<00:00:33.480> texture<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:35.180> looks<00:00:36.180> pretty

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
some texture to it looks pretty

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.069 
some texture to it looks pretty
realistic<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:37.460> then<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> took<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
realistic really then I took the

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.590 
realistic really then I took the
insulation<00:00:40.079> also<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.920> made<00:00:41.340> some<00:00:41.579> ledges<00:00:42.090> they

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
insulation also it made some ledges they

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.990 
insulation also it made some ledges they
kind<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.100> protrude<00:00:44.100> off<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.550> grouted<00:00:44.850> those

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
kind of protrude off and grouted those

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.029 
kind of protrude off and grouted those
too<00:00:45.300> he's<00:00:45.960> got<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> couple<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.590> them<00:00:46.710> it's

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
too he's got a couple of them it's

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.119 
too he's got a couple of them it's
actually<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:48.450> starts<00:00:48.840> down<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.289> near

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
actually for one starts down there near

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
actually for one starts down there near
the<00:00:50.160> bottom<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.570> kind<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.840> work<00:00:52.020> their

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the bottom and they kind of work their

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.380 
the bottom and they kind of work their
way<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.350> gradually<00:00:53.160> give<00:00:53.670> them<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.059> little

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
way up gradually give them a little

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.410 
way up gradually give them a little
place<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.780> jump<00:00:54.989> around<00:00:55.879> being<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.090> close<00:00:57.120> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
place to jump around being so close to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750 
place to jump around being so close to
the<00:00:57.809> top<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.440> ledge<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.520> actually

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the top this ledge right here actually

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750 
the top this ledge right here actually
heats<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.390> from<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> lights<00:01:01.710> lights<00:01:02.489> actually

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
heats up from the lights lights actually

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.560 
heats up from the lights lights actually
warm<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.170> having<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:05.570> heat

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.139 
just nailed that to the wall to these
are<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> foal<00:01:58.950> eaves<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.700> got<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
are the foal eaves that I got at a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.500 
are the foal eaves that I got at a
Petsmart<00:02:01.340> to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
Petsmart to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.960 
Petsmart to
kind<00:02:02.660> of<00:02:02.750> put<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.680> piece<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:03.950> baling<00:02:04.760> wire

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
kind of put a piece of baling wire

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.210 
kind of put a piece of baling wire
around<00:02:05.330> those<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.020> attach<00:02:06.500> those<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.830> the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
around those and attach those to the

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.950 
around those and attach those to the
driftwood<00:02:08.000> make<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.630> little<00:02:08.840> more

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
driftwood make it a little more

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.740 
driftwood make it a little more
realistic<00:02:09.790> are<00:02:10.790> more<00:02:11.060> actually<00:02:11.420> had<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.570> hole

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
realistic are more actually had a hole

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.840 
realistic are more actually had a hole
cut<00:02:11.990> in<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.260> for<00:02:13.040> whatever<00:02:13.190> reason<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
cut in it for whatever reason in the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.560 
cut in it for whatever reason in the
side<00:02:14.090> when<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.690> got<00:02:14.960> it<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.700> put<00:02:16.700> my<00:02:17.300> fogger

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
side when I got it and I put my fogger

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.290 
side when I got it and I put my fogger
through<00:02:18.140> there<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.860> actually<00:02:19.090> fogs<00:02:20.090> up

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
through there so it actually fogs up

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.350 
through there so it actually fogs up
pretty<00:02:20.540> good<00:02:20.720> when<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.020> doors<00:02:21.230> are<00:02:21.380> shut

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
pretty good when the doors are shut

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.250 
pretty good when the doors are shut
pretty<00:02:23.360> neat<00:02:23.480> little<00:02:23.630> feature<00:02:23.720> keeps<00:02:24.140> the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
pretty neat little feature keeps the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.840 
pretty neat little feature keeps the
humidity<00:02:24.680> right<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:25.070> still<00:02:25.370> miss<00:02:25.580> them<00:02:25.730> every

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
humidity right I still miss them every

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.480 
humidity right I still miss them every
day<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:27.680> kind<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:27.950> helps<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.310> keep<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
day but that kind of helps to keep the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.580 
day but that kind of helps to keep the
humidity<00:02:28.820> at<00:02:29.120> least<00:02:29.330> around<00:02:29.480> fifty<00:02:30.350> or<00:02:30.440> sixty

at a glassmaker and had them fitted up

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.360 
at a glassmaker and had them fitted up
there's<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.989> top<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.530> actually<00:03:09.770> cut<00:03:10.190> out

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
so that he can get his ventilation and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.360
