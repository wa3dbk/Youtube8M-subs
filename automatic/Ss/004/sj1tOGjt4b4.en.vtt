00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.500
 hello guys how are you good the day of 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.730
 today we are going to be making a nail 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.639
 gel 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.860
 this and me yesterday tells me these was my 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.740
 first time that I give them to me 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.590
 I did but with gel that never have 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.919
 tried and I tell them it was a mba 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.099
 total radero this did not leave me what 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:31.270
 more beautiful and straight and so but good 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.910
 deal in was my first time and then 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.640
 here I am learning to see what ok 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.590
 then it is that I am going to be using 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.590
 This status 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.620
 and I will be using this brush that is 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:51.530
 so flat or square I do not know and it's this 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.589
 number 5 of and without achieving this I'll auvers 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.869
 ok already with a little house 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.199
 I'm going to grab the cinema the wave chip of 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.760
 organic and I'm going to clean it and with that 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.260
 same we will be removing the residue 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.380
 of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.140
 of the gel since these leave residues and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.869
 well let's start there they grab their 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.450
 want them to want it to be this 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.950
 I am using this one 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.979
 that I did it for the May swap for 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.130
 Vianey look and well this has to be 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.640
 this so raw without obvious acrylic and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.240
 well let's start 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.470
 let's grab our gel this is the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.690
 transparent and this already makes like a thousand 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.659
 years I bought it 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.500
 where they grab him and have more nothing 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.100
 as you can see, this is very, very 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.890
 thick that you and you are and half aguadito 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.110
 ok what we do is because after 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.880
 have filing pushed cuticle has put 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.399
 his first and his dehydrator as 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 always me this I'm not going to put this 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:07.229
 let's grab a droplet not very very 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.209
 not so good notes but a lot but nothing 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.340
 more than enough to cover all the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.250
 nail and give it a coat 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.470
 lightly nothing more than putting it on 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.270
 basis for what 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.870
 us so as not to put linares directly to 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:27.400
 our age so let's put 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:32.349
 that nothing else is a capita 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.319
 and this is going to heal for 60 seconds 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.959
 one minute and I go back ok 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.480
 Well, having healed, it will be like this 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.769
 as if it were wet and they already come with 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.230
 its in cinemas and huaico 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.849
 some liquid that you bring if you buy 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.629
 action packages and how those live those 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.430
 already bring this liquid to remove the 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.620
 waste d 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.650
 the gel and you can even use this 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.659
 acetone I think or alcohol thanks the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.209
 better very well what this was going to be 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.860
 well and it gave me brightness if it 's now what 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.299
 we will do will add a little 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.129
 more of him and we're going to give him another little pass 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.129
 little bit no more here we are 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.959
 so that the leader and the leader 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.019
 well obviously also taking care not to 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.610
 I'm going to touch the cuticles or anything 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.610
 because obviously they are going to get up 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.269
 and good what you can do is that with 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.060
 her same brush grabs her and they're going 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.370
 putting like this and I how did I do all the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.310
 nail for what they say that I put 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.930
 the finger here on the nail in here and 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.379
 A) Yes 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.719
 I got the glitter 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.870
 then with an orange stick or 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:53.640
 just clean the sides 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.640
 so that it does not stay like that is the cuticle 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.879
 A) Yes 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.970
 and we can even hit him some 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.510
 hearts to them 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.510
 paste 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.460
 good as you see it was already these were going to 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.470
 to be about there are half loose if 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.780
 all this because they do not need to clean them 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.760
 since the gel is below 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.769
 excuse you hear noises but it is now 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.829
 that I'm here in my book before where 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.480
 I have things and then you can hear them in 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.690
 my husband's car that gets to 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.760
 fix it and well then now 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.800
 now what they are going to do is going to grab 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.800
 a little chivas gel 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.849
 and they're going to start 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.940
 to encapsulate the dealer 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.330
 for when 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.340
 then go to encourage and all that because no 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.380
 take the glitter, do not be so 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.800
 opaque since I do not know if you have 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.889
 realized or have happened to them 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.610
 when one starts it does not encapsulate well 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:04.099
 I leave a little part simply by his side 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.510
 and usually when we're filing 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:09.250
 we filed splitter and like it is unpainted 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.370
 as it is not encapsulated as it 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.290
 we animate and it is unpainted and good this 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.390
 I'm just not like giving 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.840
 taps I'm not seeing it as 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.240
 I was doing at the beginning that I want 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.940
 that is half is success and encapsulated 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.860
 all 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.680
 so we're not going to take the 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.500
 glitter when we are cheering ok here 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.550
 is where the trick comes, I do not know if you want 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.530
 this gel that was made aguadito I do not know if 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.110
 all be like that but as it is the first 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.370
 time I'm using this gel so 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.900
 that are very watered down and to say yes 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.729
 they make their finger for one side 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.620
 since the others have already been made 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.949
 one gets you is I started the 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.190
 and it shows one of the gel 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:59.259
 run for this side and it fills everything 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.310
 what is the cuticle and everything 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:05.650
 that's the way it is, I do not know if everyone is 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.889
 well I tell you this is the first 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.030
 good second time I try this and 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.380
 that 's what happened to me yesterday with the 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.380
 nails that were improved
