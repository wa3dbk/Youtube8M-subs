00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
I would write to start off at this syrup

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.379 
I would write to start off at this syrup

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
all you need is a saucepan so eight cups

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:49.039 
all you need is a saucepan so eight cups
of<00:02:43.569> water<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:45.090> 500<00:02:46.090> grams<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:47.040> thinly<00:02:48.040> sliced

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
of water and 500 grams of thinly sliced

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.089 
of water and 500 grams of thinly sliced
peeled<00:02:50.049> ginger<00:02:51.120> pop<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.359> numb<00:02:52.630> water<00:02:53.069> put<00:02:54.069> a

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
peeled ginger pop that numb water put a

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.449 
peeled ginger pop that numb water put a
lid<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.310> free<00:02:55.269> into<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.569> boil<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:57.190> amount

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
lid on free into the boil the amount

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.089 
lid on free into the boil the amount
that<00:02:57.549> I'm<00:02:57.790> making<00:02:58.299> makes<00:02:58.900> generally<00:02:59.680> three<00:02:59.950> of

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
that I'm making makes generally three of

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.470 
that I'm making makes generally three of
these<00:03:00.280> bowls<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.579> these<00:03:03.760> bottles<00:03:04.269> of

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
these bowls and one of these bottles of

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.620 
these bowls and one of these bottles of
the<00:03:04.690> fine<00:03:04.959> degraded<00:03:05.560> crystallized<00:03:06.280> ginger<00:03:06.630> so

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
the fine degraded crystallized ginger so

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.470 
the fine degraded crystallized ginger so
the<00:03:08.560> idea<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.310> get<00:03:09.459> them<00:03:09.579> to<00:03:09.730> both<00:03:09.940> runny<00:03:10.269> at

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the idea is to get them to both runny at

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.409 
the idea is to get them to both runny at
the<00:03:10.660> same<00:03:10.900> time<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.370> all<00:03:12.669> about<00:03:12.849> left<00:03:13.239> of

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
the same time this is all about left of

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.640 
the same time this is all about left of
the<00:03:13.840> syrup<00:03:14.609> that's<00:03:15.609> all<00:03:15.940> that's<00:03:16.090> left

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
the syrup that's all that's left

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.759 
the syrup that's all that's left
MUFON<00:03:18.280> degraded<00:03:19.000> crystallized<00:03:19.629> ginger<00:03:19.769> so

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
MUFON degraded crystallized ginger so

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.390 
MUFON degraded crystallized ginger so
that<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.959> now<00:03:22.959> once<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.319> get<00:03:23.500> this<00:03:23.680> bond

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
that so now once you get this bond

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.089 
that so now once you get this bond
degraded<00:03:25.060> crystallized<00:03:25.569> ginger<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:26.680> can<00:03:26.709> use

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
degraded crystallized ginger you can use

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.170 
degraded crystallized ginger you can use
it<00:03:27.340> in<00:03:27.459> use<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.269> in<00:03:28.450> anything<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.790> can<00:03:30.940> use

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
it in use it in anything you can use

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.979 
it in use it in anything you can use
that<00:03:32.080> any<00:03:32.680> recipe<00:03:33.400> way<00:03:33.550> that<00:03:33.940> requires<00:03:34.150> ginger

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
that any recipe way that requires ginger

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.979 
that any recipe way that requires ginger
you<00:03:35.590> can<00:03:35.739> put<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.670> it's<00:03:36.970> really<00:03:37.750> good

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
you can put it in so it's really good

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:38.690 
you can put it in so it's really good
today

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
today

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.890 
today
we<00:03:39.700> bought<00:03:39.940> have<00:03:41.730> ginger<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.299> water<00:03:43.540> to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
we bought have ginger and the water to

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.650 
we bought have ginger and the water to
the<00:03:43.989> boil<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.769> it's<00:03:45.370> been<00:03:45.910> boiling<00:03:46.239> for<00:03:46.450> about

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
the boil and it's been boiling for about

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.530 
the boil and it's been boiling for about
10<00:03:47.110> minutes<00:03:47.349> so<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:48.519> strategy<00:03:49.030> now<00:03:49.239> is<00:03:49.299> it

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
10 minutes so the strategy now is it

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.870 
10 minutes so the strategy now is it
just<00:03:49.569> turn<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.110> straddles<00:03:50.590> man<00:03:51.579> what<00:03:51.760> I'm

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
just turn of straddles man what I'm

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.300 
just turn of straddles man what I'm
going<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.060> do<00:03:52.209> now<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.260> cups<00:03:53.799> of<00:03:53.950> sugar

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
going to do now is that I cups of sugar

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.150 
going to do now is that I cups of sugar
so<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.390> was<00:03:55.540> my<00:03:55.720> cups<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.530> sugar<00:03:56.709> I'm<00:03:57.099> using

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
so that was my cups of sugar I'm using

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.120 
so that was my cups of sugar I'm using
raw<00:03:57.760> sugar<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:59.019> will<00:03:59.200> cool<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.829> down

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
raw sugar is that will cool it down

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.330 
raw sugar is that will cool it down
but<00:04:00.549> Thomas<00:04:00.880> sugar<00:04:01.360> dissolves<00:04:02.069> it'll<00:04:03.069> kill<00:04:03.310> it

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
but Thomas sugar dissolves it'll kill it

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.270 
but Thomas sugar dissolves it'll kill it
down<00:04:03.730> sufficiently<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.470> can<00:04:05.769> blend<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.190> with

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
down sufficiently so I can blend it with

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.630 
down sufficiently so I can blend it with
my<00:04:06.459> hand<00:04:06.760> blender<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:08.049> then<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.069> won't<00:04:09.220> knock

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
my hand blender and then it won't knock

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.900 
my hand blender and then it won't knock
the<00:04:09.819> plastic<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.709> either<00:04:12.069> just<00:04:12.579> take<00:04:12.790> it

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
the plastic so either just take it

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.089 
the plastic so either just take it
gently<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:14.379> don't<00:04:14.590> wanted<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:14.860> stir<00:04:15.040> the

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
gently you don't wanted to stir the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.020 
gently you don't wanted to stir the
splash<00:04:15.489> over<00:04:15.760> just<00:04:16.389> just<00:04:17.109> pulse<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.620> just

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
splash over just just pulse it just

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.610 
splash over just just pulse it just
again<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.660> then<00:04:20.109> pulse<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:23.250> eventually

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
again and then pulse it and eventually

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.629 
again and then pulse it and eventually
just<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:28.510> whole<00:04:28.690> thing<00:04:28.990> will<00:04:29.110> be<00:04:29.200> seated<00:04:29.650> a

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.440 

little<00:04:33.639> stick<00:04:33.880> blender<00:04:34.270> does<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.450> good<00:04:34.690> job

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
little stick blender does a good job

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.120 
little stick blender does a good job
even<00:04:37.450> if<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.810> miss<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.110> couple<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.620> places<00:04:38.800> at

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
even if you miss a couple of places at

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.879 
even if you miss a couple of places at
all<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:40.180> doesn't<00:04:40.330> matter<00:04:40.720> because<00:04:40.900> yeah<00:04:41.289> so

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
all it doesn't matter because yeah so

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.440 
all it doesn't matter because yeah so
what<00:04:42.039> you<00:04:42.160> gotta<00:04:42.340> end<00:04:42.490> up<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.849> a<00:04:42.970> solid<00:04:43.419> piece

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
what you gotta end up is a solid piece

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.430 
what you gotta end up is a solid piece
of<00:04:43.800> crystallized<00:04:44.800> ginger<00:04:45.389> so<00:04:46.389> all<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:47.020> do<00:04:47.200> now

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
of crystallized ginger so all you do now

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.360 
of crystallized ginger so all you do now
is<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:47.860> return<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.270> stove<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:50.370> bring

gently for one hour with the uncovered

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.560 
gently for one hour with the uncovered
it's<00:04:57.220> been<00:04:57.430> simmering<00:04:57.940> for<00:04:58.150> about<00:04:58.210> an<00:04:58.479> hour

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
it's been simmering for about an hour
