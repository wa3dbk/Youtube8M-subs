after a longer break it is time for a
bug<00:00:20.100> report<00:00:20.220> video<00:00:20.730> again<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.330> time<00:00:21.570> we

bug report video again this time we

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.870 
bug report video again this time we
speak<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.350> apc's<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.189> ifes

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
speak about the apc's or ifes

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.019 
speak about the apc's or ifes
respectively<00:00:25.400> recently<00:00:26.400> I've<00:00:26.670> been<00:00:26.789> using

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
respectively recently I've been using

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.290 
respectively recently I've been using
the<00:00:27.300> APCs<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.380> ate<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.920> ate<00:00:29.070> competitive<00:00:29.880> but

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the APCs and ate and ate competitive but

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.200 
the APCs and ate and ate competitive but
also<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.840> pups<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.439> course<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.940> had<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
also on pups of course and we had to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
also on pups of course and we had to
select<00:00:33.450> some<00:00:33.780> bugs<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.320> wanted<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> show

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
select some bugs that we wanted to show

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620 
select some bugs that we wanted to show
off<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.090> quite<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> long

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
off as you can see this is quite a long

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.490 
off as you can see this is quite a long
video<00:00:36.870> again<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.890> some<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.059> not<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.960> urgent

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
video again so some of the not so urgent

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.229 
video again so some of the not so urgent
stuff<00:00:40.739> has<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.309> been<00:00:41.489> cut<00:00:41.940> out<00:00:46.910> first<00:00:47.910> thing

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
stuff has just been cut out first thing

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.560 
stuff has just been cut out first thing
you<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:48.989> Russian<00:00:49.530> BTR<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.730> its

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you see here is the Russian BTR and its

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.319 
you see here is the Russian BTR and its
crosshair<00:00:52.230> which<00:00:52.590> as<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.579> off

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
crosshair which as you can see is off

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.069 
crosshair which as you can see is off
centered<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.680> left<00:00:56.210> we're<00:00:57.210> using<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.660> APF

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
centered to the left we're using the APF

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.110 
centered to the left we're using the APF
SD<00:00:58.350> shots<00:00:58.559> here<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.219> no<00:00:59.640> spread<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
SD shots here that have no spread and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.990 
SD shots here that have no spread and
therefore<00:01:00.510> our<00:01:00.840> idea<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.129> showing<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
therefore our idea for showing this and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
therefore our idea for showing this and
you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> project<00:01:04.350> heads<00:01:04.739> landing<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you can see the project heads landing to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
you can see the project heads landing to
the<00:01:05.519> left<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> center<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> croiseur

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the left of the center of the croiseur

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
the left of the center of the croiseur
this<00:01:08.340> mal<00:01:08.790> position<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.869> process

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
this mal position of the process

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.350 
this mal position of the process
obviously<00:01:11.130> affects<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> other<00:01:11.909> weapon

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
obviously affects all the other weapon

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.859 
obviously affects all the other weapon
systems<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.930> well<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.860> show<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.580> in

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
systems as well we show that here in

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
systems as well we show that here in
fast-forward<00:01:15.869> mode<00:01:16.140> with<00:01:16.770> mg's<00:01:17.280> tow<00:01:17.820> missiles

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
fast-forward mode with mg's tow missiles

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:35.280 
fast-forward mode with mg's tow missiles
and<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.689> on

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.740 

next<00:01:36.290> up<00:01:36.409> is<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.979> American<00:01:37.009> at<00:01:37.640> AP<00:01:37.880> 25<00:01:38.270> and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
next up is the American at AP 25 and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.899 
next up is the American at AP 25 and
obviously<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.649> crosshair<00:01:40.189> positioning<00:01:40.670> here

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
obviously the crosshair positioning here

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.580 
obviously the crosshair positioning here
is<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.000> lot<00:01:41.270> better<00:01:41.509> but<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:42.079> is<00:01:42.229> still<00:01:42.409> not

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
is a lot better but it is still not

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.310 
is a lot better but it is still not
flawless<00:01:42.920> which<00:01:43.729> also<00:01:44.210> applies<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.229> the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
flawless which also applies to the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.100 
flawless which also applies to the
Chinese<00:01:45.680> that<00:01:46.280> BD<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.000> why<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.659> days<00:01:47.899> we<00:01:48.079> are

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
Chinese that BD and why the days we are

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.690 
Chinese that BD and why the days we are
going<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.530> show<00:01:48.829> in<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.159> following<00:01:51.700> when

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
going to show in the following when

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.160 
going to show in the following when
you're<00:01:52.850> using<00:01:53.030> zoom<00:01:53.420> optics<00:01:53.810> with<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
you're using zoom optics with the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.830 
you're using zoom optics with the
American<00:01:54.619> or<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.890> Chinese<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.610> PC<00:01:56.030> you'll<00:01:56.539> find

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
American or the Chinese a PC you'll find

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.319 
American or the Chinese a PC you'll find
that<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.200> gives<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.679> a<00:01:57.740> pretty

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
that that gives you a pretty

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.940 
that that gives you a pretty
inconsistent<00:01:59.329> display<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.320> bullet

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
inconsistent display of the bullet

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.880 
inconsistent display of the bullet
trajectory<00:02:01.689> if<00:02:02.689> you<00:02:02.929> look<00:02:03.079> closely<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.860> can

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
trajectory if you look closely you can

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.669 
trajectory if you look closely you can
see<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.939> bullets<00:02:05.539> are<00:02:05.750> leaving<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
see that the bullets are leaving the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.130 
see that the bullets are leaving the
barrel<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.220> are<00:02:07.549> going<00:02:08.209> towards<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.929> right

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
barrel and are going towards the right

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.350 
barrel and are going towards the right
side<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.799> crosshair<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:10.729> if<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.120> zoom

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
side of the crosshair but if you zoom

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.059 
side of the crosshair but if you zoom
into<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.900> shots<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.590> already<00:02:12.799> been

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
into the shots that have already been

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.670 
into the shots that have already been
fired<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:14.060> seems<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.959> bullets<00:02:15.410> were

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
fired it seems as if the bullets were

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.699 
fired it seems as if the bullets were
hitting<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.880> left<00:02:17.390> side<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.230> crosshair

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
hitting the left side of the crosshair

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.190 
hitting the left side of the crosshair
so<00:02:19.160> if<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:19.730> empty<00:02:20.000> your<00:02:20.150> entire<00:02:20.630> mag<00:02:20.959> and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
so if you just empty your entire mag and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.850 
so if you just empty your entire mag and
simply<00:02:21.890> zoom<00:02:22.310> in<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.970> zoom<00:02:23.239> out<00:02:23.660> on<00:02:24.019> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
simply zoom in and zoom out on the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.500 
simply zoom in and zoom out on the
bullets<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.250> have<00:02:25.430> already<00:02:25.670> been<00:02:25.910> fired<00:02:26.269> you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
bullets that have already been fired you

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.140 
bullets that have already been fired you
can<00:02:26.720> clearly<00:02:27.620> see<00:02:28.250> what<00:02:28.549> is<00:02:28.700> happening<00:02:28.730> here

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
can clearly see what is happening here

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.990 
can clearly see what is happening here
when<00:02:29.690> using<00:02:30.049> zoom<00:02:30.290> optics<00:02:30.730> what<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.760> would

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
when using zoom optics what I would

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.150 
when using zoom optics what I would
simply<00:02:32.150> like<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.450> see<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> crosshair<00:02:33.799> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
simply like to see is a crosshair that

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
overlooked obviously is that that still

overlooked obviously is that that still
