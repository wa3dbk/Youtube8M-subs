it's<00:00:03.720> safe<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.049> say<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.380> pretty<00:00:04.560> much<00:00:04.799> all<00:00:05.040> of

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
it's safe to say that pretty much all of

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.280 
it's safe to say that pretty much all of
us<00:00:05.460> watch<00:00:05.819> some<00:00:06.180> streams<00:00:06.600> from<00:00:06.870> time<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.259> time

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
us watch some streams from time to time

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.890 
us watch some streams from time to time
and<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.309> really<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.880> be<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.090> great<00:00:09.450> resource

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and it really can be a great resource

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.570 
and it really can be a great resource
and<00:00:10.200> an<00:00:10.380> awesome<00:00:10.740> way<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.920> learn<00:00:11.190> things<00:00:11.460> about

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
and an awesome way to learn things about

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.270 
and an awesome way to learn things about
the<00:00:11.820> game<00:00:12.080> but<00:00:13.080> there's<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> lot<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.070> things

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the game but there's a lot of things

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.220 
the game but there's a lot of things
that<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:14.790> go<00:00:15.000> wrong<00:00:15.299> when<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> player<00:00:15.929> makes

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
that I see go wrong when a player makes

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
that I see go wrong when a player makes
the<00:00:16.379> transition<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.340> they<00:00:17.460> saw<00:00:17.670> on

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the transition from what they saw on

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.599 
the transition from what they saw on
stream<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.359> their<00:00:18.840> actual<00:00:19.199> game<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> wanted

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
stream to their actual game so I wanted

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.160 
stream to their actual game so I wanted
to<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.029> best<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.420> clear<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:21.750> some<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
to do my best to clear up some of the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.150 
to do my best to clear up some of the
misconceptions<00:00:22.670> let's<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.850> started

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
misconceptions let's get started

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.650 
misconceptions let's get started
the<00:00:26.160> first<00:00:26.430> thing<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.609> pros<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.300> stream

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the first thing that pros do on stream

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.750 
the first thing that pros do on stream
that<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> average<00:00:28.320> player<00:00:28.590> should<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
that the average player should not is to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.299 
that the average player should not is to
treat<00:00:30.000> your<00:00:30.060> team<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.869> same<00:00:31.199> way<00:00:31.439> pros<00:00:31.920> treat

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
treat your team the same way pros treat

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
treat your team the same way pros treat
their<00:00:32.579> team's<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.239> lot<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> pros<00:00:34.050> tend<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
their team's a lot of pros tend to be a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.380 
their team's a lot of pros tend to be a
little<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:35.040> toxic<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.120> often<00:00:36.239> be

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
little bit toxic because it can often be

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.000 
little bit toxic because it can often be
pretty<00:00:36.750> funny<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> lead<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> good<00:00:37.739> viewer

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
pretty funny and lead to a good viewer

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.610 
pretty funny and lead to a good viewer
experience<00:00:38.360> but<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.690> type<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> attitude<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
experience but that type of attitude is

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
experience but that type of attitude is
not<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> translate<00:00:41.579> into<00:00:41.910> positive

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
not going to translate into positive

your team they will almost always come
across<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.710> toxic<00:01:02.609> while<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.960> okay<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.470> the

is going to be extremely dynamic and
very<00:01:32.070> tailored<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> current<00:01:33.630> game<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
very tailored to the current game that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
very tailored to the current game that
they<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.490> blindly<00:01:35.880> copy<00:01:36.210> their

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
setups you will almost always end up

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
setups you will almost always end up
with<00:01:38.310> something<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.000> fairly<00:01:39.450> suboptimal

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
with something that is fairly suboptimal

with something that is fairly suboptimal
to<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.590> situation<00:01:41.060> use<00:01:42.060> their<00:01:42.329> setups<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:42.899> a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
going to be a best option for runes and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.830 
going to be a best option for runes and
masteries<00:02:15.890> until<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.820> get<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.210> really<00:02:17.540> high

he runs through the entire enemy team

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.060 
he runs through the entire enemy team
was<00:02:55.940> realistically<00:02:56.930> only<00:02:56.960> possible<00:02:57.920> because

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
was realistically only possible because

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.790 
was realistically only possible because
he<00:02:58.370> was<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> good<00:02:59.270> enough<00:02:59.630> player<00:02:59.990> to<00:03:00.560> dodge

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
like 10 or more skill shots so if you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.990 
like 10 or more skill shots so if you
tried<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.680> do<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.010> same<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.460> will<00:03:04.580> pretty
