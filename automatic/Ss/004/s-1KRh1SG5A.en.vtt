 face masks with different designs 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.430
 but the four masks 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 each one came in a separate package the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.280
 which is very good because you will use a 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.870
 at a time 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.030
 here are two in the box it is written 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.520

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.630
 nice smell and learning to fall 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.369
 now I feel ready, little boy is with 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.909
 enough product but the picture looks like a 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.780
 gelatin has to use this to take care of the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.840
 walk 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:36.090
 My God then here it looks like a O 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:38.130
 right here because now I'm 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:49.049

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.729
 Is she looking very beautiful and yet? 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.909
 appeared 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.969
 I think you're not afraid to have fun in this 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.950
 people who are compensated in them 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.689
 not that neither of you I know that you 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.689
 they are going to have it looks like the director 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.390
 painted your face 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.460
 I already used some face masks 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.320
 I must confess that it is not from here. 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.690
 I thought it was very good on my face. 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.000
 right size is I think right're 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.130
 Taking a hair here, that's it. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.710
 she is very big she is falling here 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.390
 otta on the top of my mouth on top of 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.350
 my eye here I already have a son 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.880
 little right 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.430
 I can not keep falling here yet. 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.860
 Up that I do not see anything else 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.890
 but the feel of the product here in the face 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.930
 It is very good is well geladinho so is well 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.000
 comfortable to wear I had never used 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.850
 a face mask that first that 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.860
 I put the beginning of the video is not so 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.710
 wet as this one is such that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.600
 was the law of wet squishy well with 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.640
 the materials she should have here for 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.920
 doing well for skin is a very 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.900
 strange after I put it that I had 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.360
 this feeling a little bad so for 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.160
 cause of the product itself on the face 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.590
 kind of weird now I have a feeling 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.060
 of freshness very delicious until I think 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.140
 interesting that you got it right from my 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.610
 face is compared to an 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.230
 the back of the packaging so gave 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.200
 to see what is written that is done in the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.760
 Korea continues to take this product 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.500
 talking that she is already being born in 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.090
 my mouth is having a lot on the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.730
 Now I'm sure she's very 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.700
 heavy product has already been 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.160
 - a desk - we'll also take 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.770
 to finish here talking about what they think of 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.470
 We 're going to take off those masks that we 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.080
 we use is not just for play or for 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.120
 garnish she really has products here 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.940
 that do well for the skin has collagen 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.860
 what is the name that the seed I do not know 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.020
 Very well because it 's more for you than 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.810
 like these things they should know who 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.510
 have skin and also vitamin and we end up 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.850
 to take off the mask my face is fine 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.240
 so in fresh temptation and I think 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.400
 in this part that walks very soft beyond 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.020
 have left on the face a little white there 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.320
 I mean, looks like you've learned. 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.420
 Rest is not very good to know. 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.370
 what happens to your body with these 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.160
 things for me nothing happened everything 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.260
 It was just as cool as it had been 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.790
 so tasty the use oil the mask and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.449
 After that for me it's 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.729
 today the face with soap and water that when 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.800
 The chain woman a man never knows 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.410
 besides these models here that we use 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.660

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.820
 even anime the drawings here from japan 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.710
 precisely because of this wide range of 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.780
 drawings that drew my attention to the 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.830
 people with embers face masks and 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.880
 show you 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.680
 something else we thought was cool 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.150
 interesting you also buy these 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.889

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.840
 someone like souvenir here from japan 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.520
 In the old days we did not find tracks 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.500
 I did not think I was the one 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.759
 simple that looks like paper with 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.770
 various designs are actually getting 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.690
 in fashion here you can find 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.310

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.960
 that we bought has all the explanation 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.849
 in English so it's easy to know the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.710
 that the product offers in this package 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.800
 with four but we paid a value 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:11.610

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:13.860
