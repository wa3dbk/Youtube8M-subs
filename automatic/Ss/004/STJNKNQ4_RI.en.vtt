00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
run pretty high with this movie but in

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.040 
run pretty high with this movie but in
keeping<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> Disney<00:00:48.450> tradition<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
keeping with the Disney tradition the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.560 
keeping with the Disney tradition the
stuff<00:00:49.320> that's<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:51.210> good

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
stuff that's good is really really good

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
stuff that's good is really really good
I<00:00:51.930> guess<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> best<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:53.010> about<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
I guess the best way to go about it is

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.369 
I guess the best way to go about it is
just<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> talk<00:00:54.030> about<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.449> segments<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
just to talk about the segments it

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.779 
just to talk about the segments it
starts<00:00:55.710> off<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:55.860> Beethoven's<00:00:56.520> fifth

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
starts off with Beethoven's fifth

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.069 
starts off with Beethoven's fifth
symphony<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.390> they're<00:00:57.510> trying<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.960> what

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
symphony and they're trying to do what

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.540 
symphony and they're trying to do what
they<00:00:58.199> deal<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:58.859> Bell<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.219> having

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
they deal with the first Bell by having

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.520 
they deal with the first Bell by having
the<00:00:59.640> abstract<00:01:00.180> art<00:01:00.420> try<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.719> match<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> music

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the abstract art try to match the music

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.340 
the abstract art try to match the music
at<00:01:01.980> times<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.760> does<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.049> most<00:01:04.229> part

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
at times it does but for the most part

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890 
at times it does but for the most part
it's<00:01:04.680> trying<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.189> tell<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> story<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.510> how

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
are you trying to put a coherent

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.950

narrative to it and on top of that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.690 
narrative to it and on top of that
sometimes<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.590> coherent<00:01:19.979> narrative<00:01:20.009> doesn't

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
sometimes a coherent narrative doesn't

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.120 
sometimes a coherent narrative doesn't
match<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.210> music<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.409> doesn't<00:01:22.770> even<00:01:22.860> work

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
match the music so it doesn't even work

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.039 
match the music so it doesn't even work
in<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.430> sense<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.509> got<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> few<00:01:24.900> good

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
in that sense but it's got a few good

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
in that sense but it's got a few good
visuals<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.590> there<00:01:25.740> next<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> Pines

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970

of Rome with the flying whales this is

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.569 
of Rome with the flying whales this is
awesome<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.780> CG<00:01:31.290> makes<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> size<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.400> weight

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
awesome the CG makes the size and weight

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.940 
awesome the CG makes the size and weight
of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.909> whales<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.570> look<00:01:33.780> gigantic<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
of the whales just look gigantic it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
of the whales just look gigantic it
matches<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> music<00:01:35.939> perfectly<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.689> top

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
matches the music perfectly and on top

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.560 
matches the music perfectly and on top
of<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.710> builds<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.520> builds<00:01:38.549> at<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
of that it just builds and builds at the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.950 
of that it just builds and builds at the
end

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
end

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.359 
end
in<00:01:40.049> fact<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.680> probably<00:01:41.040> would<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.280> been

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
in fact this probably would have been

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
in fact this probably would have been
better<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> last<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.170> what

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
better as the last one but you know what

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
better as the last one but you know what
can<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.340> story<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> tin<00:01:44.939> soldier<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
can you do the story the tin soldier is

there's<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.440> sense<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.710> there<00:04:38.950> wasn't<00:04:39.130> as

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
there's a sense that there wasn't as

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.460 
there's a sense that there wasn't as
many<00:04:39.640> limitations<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.230> you<00:04:41.320> know

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
many limitations to this and you know

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.200 
many limitations to this and you know
what<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.890> really<00:04:42.070> does<00:04:42.340> show<00:04:42.400> half<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.030> time

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
what it really does show half the time

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.900 
what it really does show half the time
the<00:04:43.660> other<00:04:43.810> half<00:04:44.050> not<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:44.950> much<00:04:45.130> so<00:04:45.550> honestly

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
the other half not so much so honestly

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.730 
the other half not so much so honestly
despite<00:04:46.390> his<00:04:46.570> flaws<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:47.170> still<00:04:47.500> highly

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740
