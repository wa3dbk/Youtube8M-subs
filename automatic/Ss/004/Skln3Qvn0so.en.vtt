I'm sure you've seen my poon shirt in

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.070 
I'm sure you've seen my poon shirt in
some<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.670> videos<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.269> Salah<00:00:15.540> actually

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
some of my videos but Salah actually

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.660 
some of my videos but Salah actually
modify<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.920> I'm<00:00:16.980> actually<00:00:17.160> selling<00:00:17.609> it

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
modify this and I'm actually selling it

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.859 
modify this and I'm actually selling it
for<00:00:17.880> him<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.119> I'm<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.300> over<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> overview

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
for him and I'm going over the overview

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.210 
for him and I'm going over the overview
because<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.439> wonderfully<00:00:19.830> modified

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
because it's a wonderfully modified

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.560 
because it's a wonderfully modified
blaster<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.060> definitely<00:00:21.390> worth

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
blaster and it's definitely worth

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.880 
blaster and it's definitely worth
showcasing<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.619> go<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
showcasing so I'm going to go to the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.349 
showcasing so I'm going to go to the
internal<00:00:23.130> modifications<00:00:23.730> first<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
internal modifications first the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.790 
internal modifications first the
electronic<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.990> mechanical<00:00:25.080> locks<00:00:25.619> were

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
electronic and mechanical locks were

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.439 
electronic and mechanical locks were
removed<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.460> well<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> electronic

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
removed as well as the electronic

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.060 
removed as well as the electronic
resistance<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.199> essentially<00:00:28.650> clearing<00:00:28.980> up

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
resistance and essentially clearing up

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.679 
resistance and essentially clearing up
the<00:00:29.160> entire<00:00:29.400> circuit<00:00:29.849> he's<00:00:29.970> also<00:00:30.150> modified

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the entire circuit he's also modified

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.120 
the entire circuit he's also modified
the<00:00:30.720> trigger<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.320> operates<00:00:31.650> very<00:00:31.830> smoothly

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the trigger so it operates very smoothly

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
the trigger so it operates very smoothly
and<00:00:32.399> real<00:00:32.790> ooh<00:00:32.910> brocaded<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and real ooh brocaded it all of the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.840 
and real ooh brocaded it all of the
modifications<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.130> stripes<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
modifications I do to stripes we do the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
modifications I do to stripes we do the
same<00:00:36.000> stuff<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.480> major<00:00:36.660> difference<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.230> this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
same stuff the major difference is this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.170 
same stuff the major difference is this
is<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:37.860> gen<00:00:38.129> strife<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> blu

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
is a first gen strife not just a blu

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.760 
is a first gen strife not just a blu
strife<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> lot<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> actually<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> vast

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
strife is a lot of actually the vast

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.170 
strife is a lot of actually the vast
majority<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> blue<00:00:41.460> stripes<00:00:41.730> are<00:00:41.879> actually

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
majority of blue stripes are actually

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940 
majority of blue stripes are actually
not<00:00:42.360> first<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.170> original<00:00:43.590> stripes

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
not first in the original stripes

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.500 
not first in the original stripes
actually<00:00:44.309> had<00:00:44.430> excellent<00:00:44.850> motors<00:00:45.300> these

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
actually had excellent motors these

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.569 
actually had excellent motors these
motors<00:00:45.899> are<00:00:46.050> superior<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.739> all<00:00:46.950> their<00:00:47.280> striped

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
motors are superior to all their striped

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.709 
motors are superior to all their striped
motors<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.030> he<00:00:48.120> didn't<00:00:48.329> even<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
motors and he didn't even have to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.060 
motors and he didn't even have to
replace<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> chrono<00:00:49.590> readings<00:00:49.950> will

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
replace them the chrono readings will

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
replace them the chrono readings will
demonstrate<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.640> he<00:00:51.059> modified<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.809> few

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
demonstrate this he modified this a few

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.540 
demonstrate this he modified this a few
years<00:00:52.140> ago<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.710> he's<00:00:52.829> been<00:00:52.860> running<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> hard

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
years ago and he's been running it hard

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
years ago and he's been running it hard
in<00:00:53.789> hvz<00:00:54.300> events<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
in hvz events as you can see if the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.750 
in hvz events as you can see if the
paint<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.649> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> worn<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.610> I'll

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
paint is kind of worn down which I'll

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.459 
paint is kind of worn down which I'll
showcase<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> second<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.199> he's<00:00:58.289> been

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
showcase in a second but he's been

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.290 
showcase in a second but he's been
running<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.859> hard<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.460> three<00:00:59.699> or<00:00:59.820> four<00:01:00.030> trust

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
running it hard with three or four trust

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.700 
running it hard with three or four trust
fires<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.840> time<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.469> haven't

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
fires all the time and they haven't

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
fires all the time and they haven't
fried<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.370> he's<00:01:02.760> shooting<00:01:03.000> insanely<00:01:03.570> hard

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
fried and he's shooting insanely hard

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.299 
fried and he's shooting insanely hard
with<00:01:04.049> these<00:01:04.170> things<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.890> motors<00:01:05.189> are

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
with these things because the motors are

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.050 
with these things because the motors are
just<00:01:05.489> excellent

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
just excellent

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.640 
just excellent

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
why Hasbro decided to downgrade their

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.929 
why Hasbro decided to downgrade their
motors<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.310> month<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:08.760> into

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
motors just a month or two into

production no idea about a month or two
after<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.189> strike<00:01:11.430> came<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:11.970> actually

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
after the strike came out they actually

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.700 
after the strike came out they actually
changed<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:12.689> motors<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> couldn't<00:01:13.409> see<00:01:13.560> from

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
changed out motors you couldn't see from

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
changed out motors you couldn't see from
the<00:01:13.799> outside<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.460> hear<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> slight

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the outside but you can hear the slight

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.820 
the outside but you can hear the slight
difference<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.570> guess<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> modify<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> lot

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
difference I guess if you modify a lot

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
difference I guess if you modify a lot
you<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.189> pick<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.759> otherwise<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you you pick up on it otherwise you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.300 
you you pick up on it otherwise you
wouldn't<00:01:18.990> notice<00:01:19.110> too<00:01:19.439> much<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.799> unmodified

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
slightly Messier he modified this for

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.200 
slightly Messier he modified this for
his<00:01:53.040> own<00:01:53.100> use<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> he<00:01:53.610> actually<00:01:53.759> used<00:01:54.060> this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
his own use and he actually used this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.510 
his own use and he actually used this
for<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> few<00:01:54.630> years<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.960> always<00:01:55.259> use<00:01:55.470> hvz<00:01:56.430> up

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
for a few years that always use hvz up

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
for a few years that always use hvz up
there<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.119> his<00:01:57.360> intention<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.259> a

well is not modified in the back here so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.230 
well is not modified in the back here so
you<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.550> absolutely

I<00:02:12.300> see<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.320> lip<00:02:14.100> read<00:02:14.400> even<00:02:14.580> mags<00:02:14.820> just

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I see I have to lip read even mags just

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.090 
I see I have to lip read even mags just
because<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.720> think<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.960> looks<00:02:16.110> cool<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.620> with

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
because I think it looks cool and with

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.380 
because I think it looks cool and with
this<00:02:17.190> type<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> blaster<00:02:17.820> matching<00:02:18.210> mags

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
this type of blaster matching mags

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.460 
this type of blaster matching mags
definitely<00:02:18.780> makes<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:18.990> look<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.230> little<00:02:19.290> better

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
definitely makes it look a little better

definitely makes it look a little better
that's<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.160> modifications<00:02:20.730> going

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
that's it for the modifications going

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.130 
that's it for the modifications going
over<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.210> paint<00:02:21.390> job<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.690> started<00:02:21.990> with<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
grey vinyl dye base slash primer that's

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
grey vinyl dye base slash primer that's

the initial coat after he heavily sanded

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
the initial coat after he heavily sanded
the<00:02:26.700> blaster<00:02:27.090> which<00:02:27.780> was<00:02:27.960> applied<00:02:28.230> very<00:02:28.470> well

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
the blaster which was applied very well

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.620 
the blaster which was applied very well
next<00:02:29.100> he<00:02:29.190> has<00:02:29.220> an<00:02:29.460> acrylic<00:02:29.730> blue<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:30.330> not<00:02:30.480> sure

next he has an acrylic blue I'm not sure

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.240 
next he has an acrylic blue I'm not sure
what<00:02:30.780> brand<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.200> was<00:02:31.380> but<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.710> not<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
what brand it was but this is not a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.220 
what brand it was but this is not a
citadel<00:02:32.730> pain<00:02:33.090> or<00:02:33.300> an<00:02:33.390> enamel<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:33.990> just

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
citadel pain or an enamel it is just

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.930 
citadel pain or an enamel it is just
sort<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.440> an<00:02:34.560> off-brand<00:02:34.890> acrylic<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.760> he

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
sort of an off-brand acrylic because he

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.760 
sort of an off-brand acrylic because he
really<00:02:36.150> liked<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.450> color<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.990> think<00:02:37.680> it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
really liked this color I think it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.350 
really liked this color I think it
contrasts<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.580> well<00:02:38.760> with<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> gray<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
contrasts really well with the gray and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.880 
contrasts really well with the gray and
I<00:02:39.390> definitely<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.960> looks<00:02:40.110> nice<00:02:40.380> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
I definitely think it looks nice and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.110 
I definitely think it looks nice and
then<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.100> finish<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.430> off<00:02:41.610> with<00:02:41.970> what

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
then you finish that off with what

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
ago I believe at least a year probably

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.950 
ago I believe at least a year probably
closer<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.820> two<00:02:57.000> years<00:02:57.300> been<00:02:57.750> through

closer to two years been through
numerous<00:02:58.170> Wars<00:02:58.680> killed<00:02:59.220> tons<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.940> tons<00:02:59.970> of

numerous Wars killed tons and tons of
zombies<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.750> probably<00:03:01.080> subhumans<00:03:01.560> along<00:03:01.800> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
zombies and probably subhumans along the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.130 
zombies and probably subhumans along the
way<00:03:02.040> as<00:03:02.160> well<00:03:02.340> but<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.390> definitely<00:03:03.690> worn

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
way as well but it is definitely worn

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.990 
way as well but it is definitely worn
out<00:03:04.320> because<00:03:04.440> he<00:03:05.130> used<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.550> lot<00:03:05.640> as<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.820> can

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
out because he used it a lot as you can

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.190 
out because he used it a lot as you can
see<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.210> paint<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.510> chipping<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:07.020> that's

see the paint is chipping here that's

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.810 
see the paint is chipping here that's
just<00:03:07.470> wear<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.830> tear<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.040> shows<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
just wear and tear that shows that the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.460 
just wear and tear that shows that the
blaster<00:03:09.240> was<00:03:09.390> used<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.320> definitely

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
blaster was used and it definitely

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:27.089 
blaster was used and it definitely
wasn't<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.950> showpiece

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
when I set it per second as you can see

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.720 
when I set it per second as you can see
it's<00:03:48.870> shooting<00:03:49.050> insanely<00:03:49.500> hard<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.610> I

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
it's shooting insanely hard and like I

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.729 
it's shooting insanely hard and like I
said<00:03:50.790> that's<00:03:51.060> because<00:03:51.450> it's<00:03:51.959> using<00:03:52.140> first<00:03:52.530> gen

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
said that's because it's using first gen

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.710 
same is what I've always done with
stripes<00:03:56.040> which<00:03:56.280> always<00:03:56.849> does<00:03:57.120> on<00:03:57.269> his<00:03:57.569> other

and<00:04:00.569> with<00:04:00.720> these<00:04:00.870> motors<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.410> performing

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
and with these motors it's performing

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.100 
and with these motors it's performing
phenomenally<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:02.910> getting<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.300> velocity<00:04:03.870> on

phenomenally so getting that velocity on

phenomenally so getting that velocity on
stock<00:04:04.560> motors<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:05.040> unbelievable<00:04:05.550> especially
