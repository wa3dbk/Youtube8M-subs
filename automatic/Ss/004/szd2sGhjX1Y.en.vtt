game is not secure first of all most of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.270 
game is not secure first of all most of
the<00:01:46.899> people<00:01:47.079> who<00:01:47.200> play<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.500> game<00:01:47.740> are<00:01:47.979> very

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
the people who play this game are very

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.160 
the people who play this game are very
young<00:01:49.259> probably<00:01:50.259> around<00:01:50.560> 10<00:01:51.549> 15<00:01:52.090> years<00:01:52.960> old

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
mostly young though and I just think

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.200 
mostly young though and I just think
that<00:01:59.079> if<00:01:59.409> they<00:02:00.039> have<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.460> many<00:02:00.759> people

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
that if they have this many people

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.240 
that if they have this many people
playing<00:02:01.509> who<00:02:01.869> are<00:02:02.020> young<00:02:02.289> they<00:02:02.770> should<00:02:03.009> really

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
playing who are young they should really

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.200 
playing who are young they should really
make<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.820> game<00:02:04.000> more<00:02:04.030> secure<00:02:04.950> because<00:02:06.210> anyone

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
make the game more secure because anyone

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.150 
make the game more secure because anyone
can<00:02:07.390> get<00:02:07.539> hacked<00:02:07.780> I've<00:02:08.320> been<00:02:08.710> playing<00:02:09.010> this
