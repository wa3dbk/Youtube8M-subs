00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
then reset it since installing it and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.710 
then reset it since installing it and
I'm<00:01:49.740> gonna<00:01:49.829> see<00:01:50.159> oh<00:01:50.399> wow<00:01:50.850> yeah<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.509> lot

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I'm gonna see oh wow yeah it's a lot

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.249 
I'm gonna see oh wow yeah it's a lot
better<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:53.149> Linpack<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.780> running<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
better on the Linpack I was running in

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.340 
better on the Linpack I was running in
the<00:01:55.470> amount<00:01:56.159> i<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.579> running<00:01:56.729> about<00:01:56.880> 47<00:01:57.600> 48<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the amount i was running about 47 48 and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
the amount i was running about 47 48 and
that<00:01:58.500> last<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.070> ran<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.399> 75<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.299> was

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that last when I ran was 75 and that was

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.459 
that last when I ran was 75 and that was
48<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:02.610> sits<00:02:02.969> between<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.630> mid-40s<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
48 so it sits between the mid-40s and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.429 
48 so it sits between the mid-40s and
that<00:02:04.649> last<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.070> went<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> 70<00:02:06.000> s<00:02:06.259> I'll<00:02:07.259> go

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
that last one went up to 70 s I'll go

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.360 
that last one went up to 70 s I'll go
ahead<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.710> run<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.979> quick<00:02:09.349> quadrant<00:02:10.349> score

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.580 

the<00:02:14.370> first<00:02:14.580> quadrant<00:02:14.880> score<00:02:15.330> Iran<00:02:15.690> gave<00:02:16.530> me<00:02:16.950> a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
the first quadrant score Iran gave me a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.920 
the first quadrant score Iran gave me a
2500<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.850> I'll<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:20.970> how<00:02:21.270> well<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.600> one<00:02:21.810> this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
2500 so I'll see how well this one this

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.360 
2500 so I'll see how well this one this
one<00:02:22.140> seems<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:22.620> running<00:02:22.800> maybe<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.220> little

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
one seems to be running maybe a little

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.310 
one seems to be running maybe a little

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
before I hadn't seen it so they had a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.800 
before I hadn't seen it so they had a
version<00:02:38.220> before<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.660> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810

version before this so this is this is
even<00:02:43.080> running<00:02:43.260> better<00:02:43.530> than<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.920> first

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
even running better than the first

taking<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> quick<00:03:31.020> overlook<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.150> has<00:03:33.150> a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
taking a quick overlook of it and has a

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.330 
taking a quick overlook of it and has a
google<00:03:34.080> search<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.680> little<00:03:34.709> bit<00:03:35.010> different

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
google search a little bit different

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.910 
google search a little bit different
then<00:03:35.990> looks<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.080> little<00:03:37.200> different<00:03:37.410> than<00:03:37.800> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
then looks a little different than the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920 
then looks a little different than the
normal<00:03:38.280> they<00:03:38.730> had<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> better<00:03:39.150> background<00:03:39.420> but

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
normal they had a better background but

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.600 
normal they had a better background but
I<00:03:39.990> guess<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.290> kind<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> automatically<00:03:41.160> changed

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
I guess it kind of automatically changed

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.360 
I guess it kind of automatically changed
with<00:03:41.760> my<00:03:42.000> setup<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.840> my<00:03:43.020> login<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.620> google<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.340> i
