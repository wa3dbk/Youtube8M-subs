otk and things like that but anyway guys
enough<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:28.740> explaining<00:01:29.189> them<00:01:29.340> duck<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.759> am

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
enough about explaining them duck I am

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.460 
enough about explaining them duck I am
now<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.770> carry<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.759> profile

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
now going to carry on and do the profile

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.710 
now going to carry on and do the profile
so<00:01:34.470> obviously<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.250> morphing<00:01:35.640> jar

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
so obviously we have one morphing jar

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
so obviously we have one morphing jar
morphing<00:01:36.720> jar<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.290> main<00:01:37.470> objective<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
morphing jar is the main objective of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.069 
morphing jar is the main objective of
the<00:01:38.250> deck<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:39.720> we've<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
kneeboard needle worm needle worm just

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.450 
kneeboard needle worm needle worm just
evens<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.630> whole<00:01:42.990> factor<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
evens out the whole factor of like you

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.429 
evens out the whole factor of like you
know<00:01:44.490> you've<00:01:44.729> got<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.909> huge<00:01:45.240> draw<00:01:45.720> engine<00:01:46.170> here

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
know you've got a huge draw engine here

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.219 
know you've got a huge draw engine here
especially<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.250> morphing<00:01:47.700> jar<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.229> needle

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
especially with morphing jar and needle

worm<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> draw<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.579> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
worm this is like if you draw two you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
worm this is like if you draw two you
need<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.970> woman<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.509> he<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.689> morphing<00:01:52.110> jar<00:01:52.140> I

know<00:03:28.290> having<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.310> stupid<00:03:29.549> when<00:03:29.669> you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
know having to is just stupid when you

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.430 
know having to is just stupid when you
only<00:03:29.880> need<00:03:30.060> one<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:30.389> then<00:03:30.630> again<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.989> know<00:03:31.109> it

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
only need one but then again you know it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.110 
only need one but then again you know it
adds<00:03:31.650> more<00:03:31.919> consistency<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.910> fact<00:03:33.060> that

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
adds more consistency to the fact that

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.879 
adds more consistency to the fact that
you're<00:03:33.239> running<00:03:33.450> more<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.780> them<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.169> also<00:03:34.650> if

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
you're running more of them and also if

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.379 
you're running more of them and also if
you've<00:03:35.040> already<00:03:35.220> used<00:03:35.340> one<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.970> means<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.269> can

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
you've already used one it means you can

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.620 
you've already used one it means you can
just<00:03:36.540> use<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> tag<00:03:37.109> with<00:03:37.260> several<00:03:37.560> things

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630

far more then you just keep doing your
shenanigans<00:04:37.650> so<00:04:38.640> it<00:04:38.760> just<00:04:38.790> gets<00:04:39.090> even<00:04:39.360> better

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
shenanigans so it just gets even better

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.480
