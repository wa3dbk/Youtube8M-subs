00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:07.670
 The production body of Psycho-ri looks like this 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:15.430
 I guess it was the rest 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:15.430
 It is the production of a weapon The weapon of this neighborhood is the part behind the last house child 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.120
 But one is one long armed and this part in this part of this 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.190
 Because it sticks 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:36.550
 Those armed from this time 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.550
 I think it 's a weapon I want to go into the production of weapons 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 Hmm 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.480
 It will be the Bazooka's Parse that is lined up here 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.980
 To Zakubazuka 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.340
 3 minutes and after 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.780
 This is after Well It is part of the accessories around the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.559
 In this 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.559
 Hero's minute 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.860
 It's a two-tiered Perth, it's a part of Bazooka's bullets 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:09.299
 Mostly gray parts except this soul 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.299
 It is one color though 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.030
 You look at the design 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.050
 It feels like 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:30.280
 Well, but I think trying to make the place of parts to get back to something like 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.280
 It's an individual part, but it's yellow here, though 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.290
 The parts of this are 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.080
 It's here It's a gray part, so if you don't do this a little 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.030
 You say 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.420
 If you look at it 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.799
 Well here 6 here too yeah 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.799
 Because it is the same color 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.820
 There was 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.790
 now 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:02.100
 In the previous set is partially to next part of the octopus of this child and go in minutes was here production 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.230
 I used the same color so this color is painted with stun gold 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.990
 Also 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:11.230
 This par 2 t will go on when the roughly body is moved Well 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.330
 Also I'd be or was about to be cold 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.590
 Here is something 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.150
 It was with Tei 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.409
 This part is 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:26.600
 Because it sticks to the side rather than bazooka do when it fires the ball that magic seal 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:32.870
 Is buzzer it is or rather of momentum in the place where out parts 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:35.180
 Well Well role softening Kedomo I think that if I come out feeling of unity is also the Tteyuu paint in the same color 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:42.860
 Or not 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:46.100
 I think that I want to make the color a little different because it is a part other than the main body 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.380
 Even this little same gold is different 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.670
 gold gold leaf 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.569
 Kedomo This part is are you color spray coating of titanium gold 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.890
 Here 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.610
 I think that I might try a little painted in acrylic paint 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.600
 Well, this is another real bullet part 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.000
 Ah 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.930
 This too 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.450
 It looks like in the design drawing 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.970
 This part part that is visible a bit in this part of the child 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 But this is also Well 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.590
 buzz wondering 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.340
 It is better not the same low 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.840
 I think it is interesting here 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.840
 Well part of the bullet 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.019
 This is acrylic paint , but 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.610
 Popper is Nee yeah yeah 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.540
 It is similar 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.690
 Try painting with the theory of metal way 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.900
 Somewhat the difference is this same gold 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:55.220
 I'd metal color I think that [sure] Bana a little difference was 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.900
 Well then, first of all trying to find out 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.050
 Here's a real bullet 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.090
 part with this part 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.370
 This I 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.220
 Of the jet point behind bazooka 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.220
 I think that I would like to start from two paintings here 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:38.450
 It has been done with these two colors so I'm waiting for it to dry now 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.450
 It is a state 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.750
 During this time, I think that I would like to put somebody here 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.750
 Hmm 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:07.160
 Of this Zakubazooka 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:12.010
 The part bazooka is for three parts. The violet of this part is complete. 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.010
 Since the place to stick eh Cho seal is in one place 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:22.310
 It is this part that puts a sticker, but I think it is a part that fixes Bazooka, but 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.310
 I want to put a sticker here 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:44.119
 Well color that makes such a feeling that we were able to put a seal 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.119
 It is a seal for 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:53.650
 Because long hair here put on the back and put the seal after completion 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:06:00.570
 I think that I want to put the blood drawing play on this place map 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:04.520
 To and the Kobe leaf that the minute here painted with a brush painting in 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.520
 The amount of Kappa painted is 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:17.160
 It looks like this 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:19.100
 It there is heavy rain Dolly so here is painted N Copper 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:26.090
 It is like this 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:28.870
 Click here for roughly he and the other to completely Khan-like and also I'd think that the feeling of going 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.880
 I want to spend some time 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:38.670
 In this Well two of Well painted parts This Once completely dry 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.670
 I would like to do it with ink from above
