00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:16.470
 I think because it scored well, right? 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.470
 My life as a football player in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.430
 my career had been the conquest of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.470
 Brazilian title of 97 by the Basque 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 gamma 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.359
 confronting the palm trees in the final 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.129
 the girl had a great team one 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.540
 top team, huh? 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:40.500
 a team almost unbeatable majority player 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.440
 Brazilian selection team is then 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.190
 that marked me a lot was after all first 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.629
 we played the game of São Paulo 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.460
 we wager was zero 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.020
 the world had taken the third card 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.300
 yellow 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.520
 in that game and consequently not 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.190
 could play in the next game and was the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.070
 main player we were the top scorer 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.740
 of that competition 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.869
 supplanted the reign of the athletic 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.939
 who was the greatest scorer of 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.860
 brazilian championship went to 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.830
 then I of the world took the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.869
 third card and would not be able to play the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.009
 second game the final game in maracanã 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.100
 while the palm trees 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.460
 then he was expelled shortly after having 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.170
 taken the third card and was expelled 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 Lucky for us, right? 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.430
 the Basque was able to anticipate the trial 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.490
 he was eventually acquitted and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 playing in the last game against 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.299
 the team that scored palms that this 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.759
 situation we would be deprived of 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.399
 use the best player of ours 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.729
 and also the end we treat 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.450
 depended on the tie we hit the first 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.719
 0 to 0 and are paulo and the second was not 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.090
 0 to 0 also until the end of the game runs 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.590
 tie Basically the Basque wanted to 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.269
 champion 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.940
 and at the end a little zezé's halter 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.349
 the card amano made a save 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.269
 miraculous, right? 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.370
 we had taken that goal was 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.180
 in the end we will lose the title 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.420
 huh 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.090
 but thank god the case of amanda did 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.489
 a spectacular defense and ended up 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.379
 finishing game 0 to 0 is that being 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.950
 champion and maybe I scored a lot for 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.950
 cause of it
