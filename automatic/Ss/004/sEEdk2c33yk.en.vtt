00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 there are very good people all how are they 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.750
 echos are going them to kill a story ago 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.580
 just a few minutes on the page 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.590
 son's official bending facebook's 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.660
 the radio company of the greim pro publish 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.490
 three possible photos of what would be a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.410
 new together for the game 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 then you will see these images and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 we're going to go re talking a little bit 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.750
 bit 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.930
 in my opinion honestly not the other 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.269
 I like it differently but it's not like I 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.390
 like to the point of saying I do not want now 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.180
 It bothers me a lot where the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.550
 backpack to the right side of the manna life 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.320
 and all that I would like to be able to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.090
 exchange so much put it to the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.370
 left or right against the corner 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.340
 lower left also of the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.829
 screen but good that will be seen 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.440
 it's still not certain that I'm going 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.320
 to leave but if the radio public of the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.539
 official facebook page of them 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.690
 it will surely come out to me I would like 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.149
 a lot and I do not think I 'm the only 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.039
 what rays enable an option in which 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.260
 the summoner can choose whether to stay 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.260
 with the old hood or use this 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.330
 in the images we see many changes 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.510
 quite notorious is not that it changes a 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.660
 little bit the icon of the character is 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.860
 pretty copado the textures have a 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.320
 most alive color so to speak 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.480
 where it would be represented so to speak 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.430
 the quilas deaths the assists the 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.740
 gold and all that is quite flight not 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.080
 takes up space but is darker than the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
 previous but that's the least of it is for 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.420
 me the notion and tourist but basically 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.040
 I notice it pretty good I would like to like 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.290
 I already say change that backpack 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.180
 which is on the right side of the bar 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.190
 Manna life that they put in the past 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.830
 how it was and where it tells you all the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.600
 damage statistics or armor all that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.670
 they are a little more colorful like the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.190
 backpack basically also like as the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.600
 map so good is a news a 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.060
 little bit quick for those who are not 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.369
 so much and the next videos are waiting for us 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.369
 a big hug until next time
