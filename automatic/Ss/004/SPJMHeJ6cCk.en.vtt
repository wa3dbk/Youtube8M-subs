00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
that time period and then the dupe so

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.710 
that time period and then the dupe so
it's<00:00:26.369> only<00:00:26.490> gonna<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.789> about<00:00:26.939> five<00:00:27.269> things

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it's only gonna be about five things

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.589 
it's only gonna be about five things
each<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> couple<00:00:28.890> months<00:00:29.340> um<00:00:29.789> that

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
each you know a couple months um that

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.389 
each you know a couple months um that
way<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.410> huge<00:00:31.830> long<00:00:32.070> video

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
way it's just not one huge long video

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.069 
way it's just not one huge long video
because<00:00:32.759> i<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.940> sometimes<00:00:33.300> those<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.780> get

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
because i know sometimes those can get

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.900 
because i know sometimes those can get
overwhelming<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.640> hard<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
overwhelming and it's kind of hard to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
overwhelming and it's kind of hard to
keep<00:00:36.210> things<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:37.020> organized<00:00:37.469> when<00:00:37.800> you're

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
keep things like organized when you're

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
keep things like organized when you're
going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> go<00:00:38.250> check<00:00:38.850> something<00:00:39.090> out<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.930> i

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
going to go check something out so i

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
going to go check something out so i
think<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.620> easier<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.430> you'll

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
think this will be easier just so you'll

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.040 
think this will be easier just so you'll
only<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> five<00:00:42.510> products<00:00:42.930> i

said<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.379> Rev<00:03:31.530> 11<00:03:31.919> is<00:03:32.159> just<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.549> little<00:03:32.849> bit

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
said the Rev 11 is just a little bit

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.589 
said the Rev 11 is just a little bit
shearer<00:03:33.359> so<00:03:34.280> but<00:03:35.280> they're<00:03:35.819> basically

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
shearer so but they're basically

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.050 
shearer so but they're basically
universally<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.620> exact<00:03:38.010> same<00:03:38.310> thing<00:03:38.699> so<00:03:38.940> if

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
universally the exact same thing so if

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.789
