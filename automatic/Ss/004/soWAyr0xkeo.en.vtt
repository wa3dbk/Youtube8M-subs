00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.510
 hello friends and friends I hope you are 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:07.860
 very good today with a new recipe 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:11.050
 but this time it is not cosmetic but 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.440
 it's something medicinal I'm going to 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:18.280
 teach how to make their own supplements 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.350
 homemade and the pills are made 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.660
 at home that one can consume daily 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.850
 to make the most of 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.740
 medicinal properties of many 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.990
 components of many herbs 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.550
 we want to consume medicinal 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.140
 daily but suddenly because 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.220
 We are out of the house because it is 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.500
 uncomfortable because they have a terrible taste 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.230
 We usually tend to go out and buy 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.390
 the capsules outside so I'm going to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.450
 teach how to make their own for 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 that they avoid buying outside and we recycle 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.430
 let's occupy and do everything on its own 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 home what we need the simple re 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.890
 are the molds are going to make these 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.890
 ancient 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.460
 the tablet let's say where we have 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.649
 bought some medication or some 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.479
 supplement that we will be left was 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.339
 bandaid that will be the molds 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.549
 second ingredient is going to be gelatin 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.280
 no flavor or much better if you have agar 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 agar agar agar resists much higher 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 temperatures then the little pills 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.740
 the supplements will be with a lot 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.080
 greater stability in the event that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.560
 live in a place with a lot of heat on 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.899
 30 to 40 grams and then the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.610
 active ingredient or herbs or 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.550
 components that we want to occupy 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.090
 I'm going to make the recipe with some 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.470
 spices but you can not do with 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.149
 legs you want you can in this 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.520
 case I have ground seaweed you can 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.020
 make them with seaweed in this case also 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 you with shells already moved that you leave 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.520
 you can also do it with that if 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.799
 Do you want to ingest a quantity of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.140
 algae to provide minerals and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.390
 vitamins here I have these lists 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.480
 internal eggs that provide acid 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.320
 high hyaluronic 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.210
 and prepare them to have their properties 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 and these that I did here I did with 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.890
 aloe vera peel that are like semi 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.900
 purgatives I do not consume them daily but 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.290
 take advantage of so many careers that I have of 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.820
 consumption of aloe vera to be able to have 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.260
 also very supplements in the case of 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.790
 that requires the power to put on 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.410
 I have turmeric also that is with the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.530
 I'll now want to do the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.720
 pills because they have a high power 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.390
 antioxidant is like the spice of the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.220
 youth and the truth is that the taste of 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.080
 the turmeric for pleasant inés not the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.420
 daily consumption so I said good the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.580
 best way is to make a pill and 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.470
 every day without feeling the taste 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.120
 the volume with water or leave the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.090
 recipe I hope you like that the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.700
 practice always leave as advice 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.320
 with simple ingredients and as 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.270
 some species and things that do not 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.850
 involve too much work of molding 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.660
 prepare and dry and once you grab 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.260
 process engineering there you 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.330
 You can start 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.830
 specialize with another type of 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.360
 ingredients so good see you in 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.360
 Another video that you enjoy 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.780
 well the first thing we do to do 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.420
 our supplements in this case of 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.900
 Turmeric which is what I'm going to start 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.410
 take the next few weeks is to place 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.370
 two teaspoons of gelatin tea without 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.290
 flavor or as they say jelly 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.019
 it is also the same 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.930
 they are placed after 4 tablespoons 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.180
 of boiling water has to be fresh 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.299
 taken from the fire very well hot from 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.239
 water this so that it dissolves well 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.459
 gelatine if not not us not to dissolve 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.549
 we are not going to solidify our 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.470
 pills so well good hot if 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.659
 it will get to cool and it does not dissolve 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.180
 what they can do is put a little 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.489
 in the fire or a few seconds in the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.180
 microwave for those who will use 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.849
 agar-agar that is like gelatin that 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.680
 comes from those of the algae or 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.910
 people who are vegans who occupy 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.070
 a lot of agar-agar 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.850
 this instead of putting the water 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.820
 boiling is placed a few minutes in the 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.450
 fire so that it dissolves dissolves 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.880
 well and the amount of agar agar would be the 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.210
 half of the amount we put in 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.250
 gelatine or a teaspoon and a 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.430
 Once you have dissolved gelatin 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.950
 we place our course our turmeric 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.730
 in this case I put two 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.160
 teaspoons of tea but well- charged 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.150
 the truth that is almost three or four 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.620
 teaspoons 'the race' so they 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.090
 I recommend another thing to occupy a 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.650
 container bigger than me 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.530
 occupy the recipe because if one is not 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.840
 complicated has to mix fast 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.990
 because you have to do it fast and well 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.180
 comfortable so good do not occupy a 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.820
 container as tiny as the one I 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.260
 occupy and always containers equally 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.240
 ceramic what you have to put 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.700
 to the microwave to heat have no problem 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.700
 in occupy plastic once we mix 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.449
 what we do is directly occupy 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.289
 our 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:22.150
 display our mold container from 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.610
 old pills that we have 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.089
 medication I the truth that I ask of you 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.279
 suddenly to my neighbors that I have joined 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:32.740
 tablets of all kinds these can be 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.930
 reoccupying does not need to be not 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.240
 that we will only once and after 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.300
 boots not but washed then 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.419
 well we occupy all the mix you have to 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.580
 to do it to the shot not or at once no no 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.520
 you can leave the mixture and not make another 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.139
 thing and then come to place it in the 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.689
 molds quoted not to be done to the shot 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.610
 before it gets cold because if it does not 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:56.889
 will harden us in the container and 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.620
 reheating is not the same 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.509
 There is quite difficult to do everything not 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.270
 only last the truth is that it does not delay 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.099
 many many minutes always try 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.289
 do little amount do not go to 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.729
 place to do two or three times the 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.580
 amount of the recipe because they are going to 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.580
 cool so little and followed a 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.439
 once we fill our molds what 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.389
 What we do is place it in the 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.310
 refrigerator to cool or in a 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.020
 cool place more or less in one hour or 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.270
 a little less are already 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.950
 hard 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.320
 Y 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.570
 it is important not to place the nape of the neck 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.390
 freezer because they split and disarmed 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.990
 the gelatin is destroyed good once 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.500
 that we have the 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.980
 the 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.770
 the tablets the displays with products 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.290
 already solid the first thing we do is 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.770
 get the surplus all that was left 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:52.110
 stuck to the plastic and we have two 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:55.170
 options or we unmold them and 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.360
 we store in a bottle or directly 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.250
 we carry them on the displays 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.740
 we put a plastic or a film what 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.530
 we can carry it like that and we're taking them out 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:07.290
 measures that we are consuming it to me the 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:11.070
 I really prefer to take them out and take them 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:14.100
 in a plastic vial or in the 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.260
 portfolio for me is much more comfortable in 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.500
 this case the turmeric by recommendations 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.400
 of specialists I will consume 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.400
 one at each meal
