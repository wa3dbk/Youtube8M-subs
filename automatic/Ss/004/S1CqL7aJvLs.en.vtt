just used it right there and it's quite
difficult<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.340> use<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.450> hit<00:01:27.600> him

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
difficult to use you have to hit him

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870 
difficult to use you have to hit him
right<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> eye<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.340> look<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.700> him

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
right in the eye so if you look at him

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
right in the eye so if you look at him
you're<00:01:30.270> gonna<00:01:30.390> see<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:30.780> looks<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.079> JJ

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you're gonna see what looks like a JJ

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.590 
you're gonna see what looks like a JJ
Abrams<00:01:31.950> lens<00:01:32.280> flare<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.000> gotta<00:01:33.210> hit<00:01:33.450> them

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
Abrams lens flare and you gotta hit them

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.569 
Abrams lens flare and you gotta hit them
right<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.799> else<00:01:34.979> you're<00:01:35.130> not<00:01:35.159> gonna<00:01:35.400> do

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
right there or else you're not gonna do

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.999 
right there or else you're not gonna do
damage<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.540> difficult<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.619> you

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
damage and it's very difficult so you

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.380 
damage and it's very difficult so you
can<00:01:38.159> try<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> grenade<00:01:38.880> launcher<00:01:39.240> but

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
can try it with the grenade launcher but

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.760 
can try it with the grenade launcher but
it's<00:01:39.479> pretty<00:01:39.659> tough<00:01:39.900> another<00:01:40.290> weapon<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.619> can

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it's pretty tough another weapon you can

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's pretty tough another weapon you can
use<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.369> death<00:01:41.549> machine<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.150> when<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
use is the death machine and when you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.270 
use is the death machine and when you
get<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> death<00:01:42.689> machine<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:43.259> target<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.220> is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
get the death machine on target it is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.850 
get the death machine on target it is
usable<00:01:45.090> although<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.720> also<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.680> using

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
usable although I also don't like using

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
usable although I also don't like using
the<00:01:47.009> death<00:01:47.189> machine<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.700> find<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.180> fly<00:01:48.450> through

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the death machine I find I fly through

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.929 
the death machine I find I fly through
it<00:01:48.780> way<00:01:48.930> too<00:01:48.990> quickly<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.009> few<00:01:50.640> things<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it way too quickly so a few things I

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.399 
it way too quickly so a few things I
recommend<00:01:51.090> let's<00:01:51.600> run<00:01:51.780> through<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
recommend let's run through it you can

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.889 
recommend let's run through it you can
use<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.890> fine<00:01:53.220> quadrotor<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.509> use<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
use the fine quadrotor you can use the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899 
use the fine quadrotor you can use the
grenade<00:01:55.079> launchers<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.009> grenade<00:01:56.880> launcher

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
grenade launchers the grenade launcher
