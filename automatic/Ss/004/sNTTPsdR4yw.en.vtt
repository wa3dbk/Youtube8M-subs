of<00:00:07.559> the<00:00:07.649> things<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.979> the<00:00:08.129> customers<00:00:08.580> are

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
of the things that the customers are

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.299 
of the things that the customers are
actually<00:00:09.269> deciding<00:00:09.840> not<00:00:09.930> to<00:00:09.990> buy<00:00:10.320> SUV's<00:00:11.010> for

actually deciding not to buy SUV's for

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.269 
actually deciding not to buy SUV's for
and<00:00:11.879> that's<00:00:12.209> things<00:00:12.690> like<00:00:12.779> fuel<00:00:13.109> economy<00:00:13.650> on

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:14.279 
and that's things like fuel economy on

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.490 
and that's things like fuel economy on
road<00:00:14.609> characteristics<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:16.020> wanted<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.379> go

road characteristics we wanted to go
after<00:00:16.859> those<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.310> really<00:00:17.760> take<00:00:18.000> them<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
after those and really take them to

another level in particular fuel economy
we<00:00:20.939> made<00:00:21.179> fuel<00:00:21.419> economy<00:00:21.749> a<00:00:21.779> top<00:00:21.960> objective<00:00:22.439> of

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
we made fuel economy a top objective of

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.769 
we made fuel economy a top objective of

that<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.740> went<00:01:58.950> after<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.520> our<00:01:59.670> fraud

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that we went after for our fraud

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.539 
that we went after for our fraud
performance<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.290> deliver<00:02:01.560> capability<00:02:02.400> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
performance was to deliver capability of

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
a true SUV our customers are telling us

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.740 
a true SUV our customers are telling us
they<00:02:05.250> want<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.729> ability<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.330> off-road

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
they want that ability to go off-road

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.509 
they want that ability to go off-road
but<00:02:07.470> we<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.189> do<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> that

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
but we know they don't do it that

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.490 
but we know they don't do it that
frequently<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.840> want<00:02:10.049> to<00:02:10.140> give<00:02:10.259> them<00:02:10.379> a

there's the general feeling of the team
itself<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.350> fuel<00:03:29.070> economy<00:03:29.610> was<00:03:29.790> our<00:03:29.970> number

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
itself that fuel economy was our number

itself that fuel economy was our number
one<00:03:30.390> goal<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:31.110> delivered<00:03:31.620> significant

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
one goal and we delivered significant

one goal and we delivered significant
fuel<00:03:32.370> economy<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.239> required<00:03:33.810> not<00:03:34.560> just

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
fuel economy and that required not just

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.320 
fuel economy and that required not just
great<00:03:35.040> power<00:03:35.280> trains<00:03:35.640> as<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:36.060> would

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
great power trains as we would

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.720 
great power trains as we would

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.770 
trains plus great engineering we have
tremendous<00:03:41.700> aerodynamics<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
tremendous aerodynamics and the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.660 
tremendous aerodynamics and the
aerodynamics<00:03:43.470> team<00:03:43.650> worked<00:03:44.010> with<00:03:44.489> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
aerodynamics team worked with the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.220 
aerodynamics team worked with the
styling<00:03:45.150> team<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.510> give<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> great<00:03:45.930> looking

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
styling team to give a great looking

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.990 
styling team to give a great looking
vehicle<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:47.310> twelve<00:03:47.580> percent<00:03:47.820> improvement

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
vehicle and a twelve percent improvement

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.750 
vehicle and a twelve percent improvement
in<00:03:48.300> aerodynamics<00:03:49.250> tremendous<00:03:50.250> focus<00:03:50.430> on

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
in aerodynamics tremendous focus on

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.820 
in aerodynamics tremendous focus on
lightweight<00:03:50.970> engineering<00:03:51.750> we<00:03:52.170> are<00:03:52.380> giving

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
lightweight engineering we are giving

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.250 
lightweight engineering we are giving
the<00:03:53.010> customer<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.459> larger<00:03:54.090> Explorer<00:03:54.600> that's

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
the customer a larger Explorer that's

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.100 
the customer a larger Explorer that's
longer<00:03:55.739> wider<00:03:56.100> more<00:03:56.580> interior<00:03:57.000> room<00:03:57.420> much

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
longer wider more interior room much

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.170 
longer wider more interior room much
more<00:03:58.350> content<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.459> we've<00:03:59.610> actually<00:03:59.790> taken

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
more content but we've actually taken

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.090 
more content but we've actually taken
weight<00:04:00.570> out<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:01.110> this<00:04:01.230> vehicle<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.800> this<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.070> a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
weight out of this vehicle so this is a

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.130 
weight out of this vehicle so this is a
lighter<00:04:02.459> Explorer<00:04:03.030> than<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.840> outgoing

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
lighter Explorer than the outgoing

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.620 
lighter Explorer than the outgoing
explorer<00:04:04.860> so<00:04:05.370> it's<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.670> complete<00:04:06.269> focus

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
explorer so it's that complete focus

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.320 
explorer so it's that complete focus
from<00:04:07.080> an<00:04:07.230> entire<00:04:07.709> engineering<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.400> viewpoint

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
from an entire engineering a viewpoint

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.300 
from an entire engineering a viewpoint
to<00:04:09.480> deliver<00:04:09.750> great<00:04:09.989> fuel<00:04:10.230> economy<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:11.070> looks

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
to deliver great fuel economy it looks

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.220 
to deliver great fuel economy it looks
fantastic<00:04:11.519> we<00:04:12.180> love<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.570> style<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:13.080> got<00:04:13.200> a

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
fantastic we love the style it's got a

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.860 
fantastic we love the style it's got a
great<00:04:13.470> athletic<00:04:14.100> style<00:04:14.430> really<00:04:15.330> aggressive

great athletic style really aggressive

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.760 
great athletic style really aggressive
but<00:04:16.019> yet<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.229> modern<00:04:16.739> contemporary<00:04:17.190> look<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.640> it
