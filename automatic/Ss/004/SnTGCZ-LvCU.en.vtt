00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.660 
you don't look disappointed at all that
you<00:00:06.790> lost<00:00:07.000> you<00:00:07.690> know<00:00:13.320> no<00:00:14.320> it's<00:00:14.529> only<00:00:14.709> 14<00:00:15.340> points

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
you lost you know no it's only 14 points

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.050 
you lost you know no it's only 14 points
and<00:00:15.879> I<00:00:16.029> think<00:00:16.350> everything<00:00:17.350> is<00:00:17.470> possible<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.730> I

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
and I think everything is possible so I

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.900 
and I think everything is possible so I
have<00:00:19.330> only<00:00:19.630> 12<00:00:20.199> points<00:00:20.500> before<00:00:21.070> this<00:00:21.460> weekend

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
have only 12 points before this weekend

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.570 
have only 12 points before this weekend
and<00:00:22.119> no<00:00:22.330> she<00:00:23.169> have<00:00:23.289> 14<00:00:23.679> so<00:00:23.890> everything<00:00:24.460> is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
and no she have 14 so everything is

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.089 
and no she have 14 so everything is
possible<00:00:24.910> I<00:00:25.060> think<00:00:27.749> the<00:00:28.749> cytosine<00:00:29.380> in<00:00:29.859> the

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
possible I think the cytosine in the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.310 
possible I think the cytosine in the
fallen<00:00:30.460> it's<00:00:30.759> lots<00:00:31.029> of<00:00:31.150> points<00:00:31.480> there<00:00:31.659> so<00:00:31.900> yeah

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
fallen it's lots of points there so yeah

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.750

yeah I think it's very important for a

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.430 
yeah I think it's very important for a
sport<00:00:47.440> that's<00:00:47.650> it's<00:00:49.020> fighting<00:00:50.020> all<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.320> way

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
in the season I think it's doing the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.170 
in the season I think it's doing the
sport<00:00:52.930> more<00:00:53.110> interesting<00:00:53.770> and<00:00:53.980> we<00:00:54.820> can<00:00:54.850> see

the<00:01:13.090> toughest<00:01:13.509> of<00:01:13.990> them<00:01:14.289> there<00:01:14.799> were<00:01:14.890> great

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
the toughest of them there were great

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.730 
the toughest of them there were great
girls<00:01:15.850> yeah<00:01:16.329> it<00:01:16.539> has<00:01:16.749> been<00:01:16.990> there<00:01:17.200> many<00:01:17.409> good

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
girls yeah it has been there many good

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.849 
girls yeah it has been there many good
girls<00:01:17.979> from<00:01:18.850> here<00:01:19.450> since<00:01:19.719> I<00:01:19.869> was<00:01:20.049> in<00:01:20.259> Salt<00:01:20.619> Lake

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.440 
girls from here since I was in Salt Lake
but<00:01:21.159> I<00:01:21.700> think<00:01:22.240> every<00:01:22.689> season<00:01:23.170> have<00:01:23.469> seen<00:01:23.740> like

but I think every season have seen like

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.989 
but I think every season have seen like
their<00:01:25.450> own<00:01:25.659> history<00:01:26.319> so<00:01:26.679> it<00:01:27.340> has<00:01:27.579> been<00:01:27.789> making

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
their own history so it has been making

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.840 
their own history so it has been making
very<00:01:28.749> very<00:01:28.899> many<00:01:29.530> good<00:01:29.920> girls<00:01:30.130> here<00:01:30.340> all<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
very very many good girls here all the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.999 
very very many good girls here all the
way<00:01:30.969> so<00:01:31.030> it's<00:01:31.539> hard<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.960> say<00:01:32.139> who<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.439> there<00:01:32.710> has

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
way so it's hard to say who is there has

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.940 
way so it's hard to say who is there has
been<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.369> strongest<00:01:33.689> question<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:35.380> want
