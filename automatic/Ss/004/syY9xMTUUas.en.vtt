00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.450
 I do not know. Tomorrow 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.799
 I would make a mark I understand because 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.799
 He play's very well 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.820
 the change that I made was not because 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:20.270
 I was not playing well because I think 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.730
 that reason I think it's a novel tomorrow 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.460
 he will understand clearly committed that 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.620
 he only one rotation mom I do not 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.600
 I am 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.460
 looking at a front marks a mark 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.309
 he is looking at himself 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.930
 a team has an effective offensive solution 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.329
 when a team has it does not matter 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.219
 nothing is marked bell or ronaldo or benzema 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.219
 I think that the work that has made it sad 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.329
 against the sports one also if you have not 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.399
 marked now 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.609
 I have done it very well 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.249
 so this is why I do not care if 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.559
 has not marked no I believe that in this 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.900
 moment he does not need it because he has 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.080
 a very good run until 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:13.010
 well with the physical condition is also 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 mentally at this moment we need 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.420
 we need it to the fullest because it is in 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.510
 this moment to the 'top but the evaluation 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.159
 of the year of the first year of disc was very 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.549
 good is worth the same now 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.710
 I have not changed anything at the level of trust 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.170
 we have a lot of confidence in knowing 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.780
 we know that he is very young now 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.079
 presents as much other player the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.359
 future of real madrid, it is true that 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:48.240
 there is a lot of competitiveness in the workforce 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.240
 it's normal that you can not always 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.800
 to play 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.080
 stay to stay 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.950
 what I think is a very player 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.290
 important 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.780
 also if you do not always play 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.700
 principle I think we have to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.520
 evaluate return to a league even more 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.320
 competitive where there are teams that 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.790
 we have to evaluate in the temple in the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.670
 time because seville has started very 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.700
 well this year I think that also valencia 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.900
 has a team 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.430
 very very competitive then I think that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.940
 at the head of the table are going to be more 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.040
 open 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.520
 with more equipment comparing it to the year 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.520
 past
