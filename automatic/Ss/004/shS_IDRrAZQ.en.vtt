00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.990 

I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> dirt<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:41.310> Torchwood<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
I think the dirt actually Torchwood is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.410 
I think the dirt actually Torchwood is
is<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> kind<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.140> show<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.300> could<00:01:45.300> go

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
is a kind of a show that could go

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.870 
is a kind of a show that could go
anywhere<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:46.740> big<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.640> this

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
anywhere it's so big and this this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.610 
anywhere it's so big and this this
particular<00:01:48.240> series<00:01:48.660> is<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.230> one<00:01:50.090> huge

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
particular series is like one huge

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.110 
particular series is like one huge
hungry<00:01:52.620> film<00:01:53.070> packed<00:01:53.640> into<00:01:53.940> five<00:01:54.300> hours<00:01:54.720> so

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
hungry film packed into five hours so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.040 
hungry film packed into five hours so
absolutely<00:01:57.120> i<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.570> could<00:01:57.690> make<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
absolutely i think it could make a

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.220 
absolutely i think it could make a
translate<00:01:58.590> into<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.800> film<00:01:59.040> any<00:01:59.250> day<00:01:59.400> fantastic

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.090 

we're<00:02:05.950> considering<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.520> last<00:02:06.700> two<00:02:07.090> series

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
we're considering the last two series

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.770 
we're considering the last two series
they've<00:02:09.100> been<00:02:09.280> very<00:02:09.460> much<00:02:09.670> 26<00:02:10.330> standalone

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
they've been very much 26 standalone

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.740 
they've been very much 26 standalone
episodes<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:12.280> sometimes<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:12.880> hard<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.540> kind

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
episodes so sometimes it's hard to kind

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.890 
episodes so sometimes it's hard to kind
of<00:02:14.730> keep<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.940> touch<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.150> your<00:02:16.420> character<00:02:16.870> and
