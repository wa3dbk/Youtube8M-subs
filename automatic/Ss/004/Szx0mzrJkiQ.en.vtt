00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi guys welcome it was a bet 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.630
 of anime and manga ita io sono focus ed 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.290
 today we will talk about quota mode before 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 begin 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:24.689
 www our initials yes you look fashion is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.740
 a 2011 manga from nico tanigawa in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.769
 2013 will receive an animated version 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.620
 be animated very much discussed by itself 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.350
 we do n't know why this is all there 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.020
 criticism around at least of rome explain 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 also because I found a story 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.989
 quite pleasant 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.960
 but it also made me reflect on a 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.170
 couple of little things in my opinion is the product 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.530
 that is presented to us also needs a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.680
 paraphrase it for what you can 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.350
 let's start from the plot for what 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:10.619
 what plot is known is this little girl who 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.150
 practically a known social exclusion 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.430
 in short, a hikikomori who hates 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.119
 heavily the world that is around 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.990
 and will try in every way to be able to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.930
 get out of being able to get out of his 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.400
 condition of being able to live a life 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.409
 Quiet 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.600
 the title then comes enough 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.150
 meeting because the translation would be 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.509
 say what you want but in the end if 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.740
 They are explained and you are a marginalized 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.840
 your fault 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.759
 here from this point on 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.000
 will develop the whole story that how 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.120
 you can well understand it's a comedy 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.970
 better this definition soon there 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.260
 will show all the sides of the tome como of the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.650
 girl 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.540
 let's comment on comments here often 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.090
 and we gladly know that the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.950
 condition of some fig tree ways of some 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.020
 or Japanese taboos is to live 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.020
 inmates inside their homes 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.940
 of living together in quotation marks ai 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.340
 they animate their manias 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.670
 video games from their obsessions 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.620
 remember a little welcome to end gay for 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.810
 to make you understand a little as it is 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.980
 combined the situation or a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.480
 boy in this case we are talking about 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.040
 of nj therefore a boy who is afraid of 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.239
 go outside because he thinks there is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.280
 let it all be a conspiracy 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.170
 then the spirits magno oh well approaching but 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 all that is obviously here 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.459
 a little girl is connected to the situation 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.000
 fifteen year old who must go to 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.570
 school 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.250
 however, he feels the weight of being 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.440
 outcast here is a comedy because 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.830
 I say it is a comedy because it has anyway 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.250
 some features to make you laugh 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.860
 although it may seem cruel 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.470
 see a social outcast girl 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.280
 which is 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:16.490
 come the few occasions joined because 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.010
 he lives his life badly but one thing 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.070
 I think it should be underlined is more 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.610
 tragicomedy a little to the pirandello the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.570
 made to show intentionally so 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.010
 exaggerated 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:34.610
 a situation that on the one hand does 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.830
 laugh but the other makes you say but that 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.660
 what because we have come to this 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.070
 a good point is the black humor for 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.980
 mean here is mute quota is a manga 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.490
 flash souls that need to pray a 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.030
 little with pliers what goes 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.390
 understood is that people in quad upstream 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.870
 does not want to marginare tension and the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.360
 little girl not understanding how to live in 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.690
 world 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.400
 to be uncomfortable so much so that it says so 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.260
 the same girl in the same title 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.120
 it is as if she were talking she says useless that 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.450
 say what you want so much you are 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.170
 that you consider me unlucky instead is not 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.570
 just like that 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.609
 you have to understand a bit with the character of 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.680
 100 garments not a little to situations 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.580
 and yet it is true that at some point it will fall into 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.250
 an almost nauseating repetition 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.140
 but why this thing rockets is 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.870
 fundamental to understand the fact that 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.300
 despite being a comedy despite 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.850
 maybe the first two or three episodes will do it 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.640
 laugh then a certain point does not laugh net 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.700
 more and rooms really nauseated by the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.669
 series but in the end is what I think 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.580
 that the author thought fin 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.440
 from the beginning the thing of the provinces la 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.960
 nausea king must convince himself to make you 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.990
 to reflect must begin to make you say 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.860
 oh but why should I consider myself 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.730
 I have to limit because of opinions 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.210
 others 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.300
 and this the basic message comes out 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.100
 from your fucking house you don't 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.160
 worry about the people you are 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.850
 around you live your life quietly 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.820
 and it is something that afterwards understand 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.890
 only if a certain point she soaks in 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.260
 test a topic like that 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.300
 and here is precisely why wada mote does 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.070
 perfectly what he wants because 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.380
 all the one that binds me that bree that 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.540
 the first time they criticize three drivers 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.810
 they worshiped as comedy because they laughed 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.180
 then at some point the spark that 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.440
 he began to feel sick 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.560
 people this repetitiveness this 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.220
 monotony this tragedy 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.949
 that is, from the transition from comedy to tragedy 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.639
 this weight this losing that many 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.580
 people sometimes want to hide 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:59.430
 instead many people have some 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.620
 accepted here is one thing for me 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.770
 it is important to emphasize that this is not the case 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.500
 souls to be appreciated because many 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.349
 series are seen in this situation 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.620
 without either ridiculous for this anime 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.300
 should be appreciated for what you do 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.240
 he wants to pass for what he can 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.650
 make people think 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.400
 I repeat the limits then there are the 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.280
 repetition you see things but I repeat 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.360
 I think this repetition is also a 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.340
 sense 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.870
 let's move on to the technical apparatus 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:39.620
 technical how strange rhyme dinner that 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:43.320
 there were some good directors either 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:46.380
 excels but then why in my opinion 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.729
 this technical apparatus is beautiful 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.780
 you know they used a technique 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:54.510
 much no longer used recently that 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.289
 that of depersonalizing the person 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:02.069
 or those that are not represented 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:06.029
 in quotes people close to 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:08.069
 our protagonist are canceled 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:10.469
 that is, their face has only one mouth 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:13.110
 a sure thing as impersonal 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:15.569
 as if it meant looking at everyone 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.520
 these are all the same 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:20.069
 they are all people who judge me at 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.969
 same way but at least they represent 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:22.919
 anything 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:25.080
 here is this if I liked it in the drawing 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:28.589
 despite being a little technique 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.659
 antiquated antique and nothing 

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:33.209
 as for the colors I have them 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:37.879
 found an opening very contemptuous 

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:39.659
 a wonderful ending so so nothing by 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:41.669
 striking 

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:43.319
 I wanted to talk about this anime for per 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.990
 the organs part in the comments mine 

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.969
 always felt critical nor would I like it 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.949
 but she co submitted to leave one 

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:52.830
 discussion 

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:54.119
 having said that I thank you and the 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.659
 next review 

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:56.659
 Hello
