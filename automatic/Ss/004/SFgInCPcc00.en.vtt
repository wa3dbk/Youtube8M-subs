that<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:50.850> we're<00:01:50.970> hearing<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:51.479> let's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that that's what we're hearing now let's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.389 
that that's what we're hearing now let's
just<00:01:51.869> evaluate<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.649> face<00:01:52.799> value<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
just evaluate it at face value for a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.880 
just evaluate it at face value for a
second<00:01:53.790> do<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.689> any<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.020> us<00:01:55.140> believe<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.740> idea

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
second do do any of us believe the idea

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.609 
second do do any of us believe the idea
that<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.969> would<00:01:57.479> even<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.719> possible<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that it would even be possible for a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.709 
that it would even be possible for a
therapist<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> program<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.030> man<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.479> kill

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
therapist to program this man to kill

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.600 
therapist to program this man to kill
maybe<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.799> right<00:02:02.100> word<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.460> mean

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
maybe that's not the right word I mean

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.039 
maybe that's not the right word I mean
certainly<00:02:02.909> people<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.390> influence<00:02:03.899> over

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
certainly people have influence over

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.780 
certainly people have influence over
others<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:04.619> how<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> even<00:02:05.040> react<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> claim

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
others but how to even react to a claim

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.639 
others but how to even react to a claim
like<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.659> sounds<00:02:06.840> completely<00:02:07.170> absurd

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
like that just sounds completely absurd

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.680 
like that just sounds completely absurd
the<00:02:08.160> time<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.060> know<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the time what do you think I know the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.370 
the time what do you think I know the
Manchurian<00:02:10.200> Candidate<00:02:10.739> uh<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.550> don't<00:02:11.940> know

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
Manchurian Candidate uh I don't know

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.410 
Manchurian Candidate uh I don't know
know<00:02:12.560> if<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:12.800> really<00:02:13.040> possible<00:02:13.420> certainly

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
know if it's really possible certainly

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.890 
know if it's really possible certainly
uh<00:02:14.450> someone<00:02:15.290> who's<00:02:15.560> uh<00:02:16.100> mentally<00:02:16.910> unwell<00:02:17.270> is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
uh someone who's uh mentally unwell is

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.280 
uh someone who's uh mentally unwell is
probably<00:02:18.350> more<00:02:18.590> susceptible<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:20.290> suggestions

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
probably more susceptible to suggestions

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.260 
probably more susceptible to suggestions
like<00:02:21.590> something<00:02:22.340> like<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:22.610> if<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.910> happened

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
like something like this if it happened

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.180 
like something like this if it happened
but<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.480> don't<00:02:23.900> know<00:02:23.990> if<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.140> really<00:02:24.260> buy<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.590> well

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
but I don't know if I really buy it well

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.820 
but I don't know if I really buy it well
I<00:02:25.220> mean<00:02:25.400> we<00:02:25.700> do<00:02:25.850> know<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:26.960> program

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
I mean we do know that you can program

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.160 
I mean we do know that you can program
someone<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.550> kill<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.330> usually<00:02:29.810> starts<00:02:30.050> with

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
someone to kill it usually starts with

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.780 
someone to kill it usually starts with
getting<00:02:30.470> them<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.740> very<00:02:30.890> young<00:02:31.160> age<00:02:31.220> and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
getting them in a very young age and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.460 
getting them in a very young age and
then<00:02:31.940> they<00:02:32.120> end<00:02:32.270> up<00:02:32.420> with<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> bomb<00:02:32.930> strapped<00:02:33.320> to

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
then they end up with a bomb strapped to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.730 
then they end up with a bomb strapped to
themselves<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.790> bazaar<00:02:35.270> in<00:02:35.840> uh<00:02:35.870> in

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
themselves that at a bazaar in uh in

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.640 
themselves that at a bazaar in uh in
Kabul<00:02:37.490> uh<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.690> then<00:02:39.140> BOOM

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
Kabul uh and then BOOM

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.060 
Kabul uh and then BOOM
so<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.460> happen<00:02:40.670> but<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:42.020> this<00:02:42.800> doesn't

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
so it can happen but this this doesn't

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.860 
so it can happen but this this doesn't
sound<00:02:43.280> unlikely<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.030> therapist<00:02:44.540> who<00:02:44.660> just

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
sound unlikely that a therapist who just

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.540 
sound unlikely that a therapist who just
saw<00:02:45.020> him<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.230> few<00:02:45.320> times<00:02:45.740> in<00:02:45.920> college<00:02:46.340> would<00:02:46.490> be

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
saw him a few times in college would be

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.490 
saw him a few times in college would be
able<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.970> program<00:02:47.240> him<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.780> way<00:02:47.900> right<00:02:48.080> yeah

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
able to program him that way right yeah

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.090 
able to program him that way right yeah
interesting

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
interesting

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.730
