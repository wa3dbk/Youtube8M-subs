00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
can see how bad my aim is this one has

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.750 
can see how bad my aim is this one has
targets<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> its<00:00:49.620> own<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.640> was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
targets of its own this one I was

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.000 
targets of its own this one I was
targets<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> his<00:00:51.270> own<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.899> yadda<00:00:52.680> yadda<00:00:52.800> yadda

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
targets of his own and yadda yadda yadda

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
targets of his own and yadda yadda yadda
basically<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> first<00:00:53.879> one's<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> easiest<00:00:54.600> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
basically the first one's the easiest so

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
basically the first one's the easiest so
that's<00:00:54.989> why<00:00:55.199> he<00:00:55.500> said<00:00:55.770> 15<00:00:56.370> seconds<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.090> less

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that's why he said 15 seconds or less

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.630 
that's why he said 15 seconds or less
and<00:00:57.660> honestly<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.920> pull<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.430> off

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and honestly I think I can pull this off

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
and honestly I think I can pull this off
because<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.629> doesn't<00:01:00.930> seem<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.170> hard

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
because it really doesn't seem that hard

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.779 
because it really doesn't seem that hard
but<00:01:01.590> we're<00:01:01.770> gonna<00:01:01.859> try<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> few
