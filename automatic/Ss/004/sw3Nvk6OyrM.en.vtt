00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of construction paper we don't like to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.970 
of construction paper we don't like to
waste<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:46.829> parts<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> we're<00:00:49.649> gonna<00:00:49.770> do

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this we're gonna make a triangle we're

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.590 
this we're gonna make a triangle we're
gonna<00:00:52.860> fill<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.760> make<00:00:54.149> sure<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> it

gonna fill it in and make sure that it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.599 
gonna fill it in and make sure that it
is<00:00:55.440> nice<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.160> wide<00:00:58.190> we're<00:00:59.190> gonna<00:00:59.280> take<00:00:59.460> our

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
is nice and wide we're gonna take our

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
is nice and wide we're gonna take our
double<00:01:00.359> stick<00:01:00.570> tape<00:01:00.680> but<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.770> course<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.629> go

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
double stick tape but of course and go

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.030 
double stick tape but of course and go
from<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.439> side<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:06.500> here<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.830> we're<00:01:07.950> gonna

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
from one side of here so we're gonna

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.230 
from one side of here so we're gonna
just<00:01:08.369> connect<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.830> because<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.979> didn't<00:01:11.250> get

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just connect it because we didn't get

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
just connect it because we didn't get
our<00:01:12.330> full<00:01:12.540> piece<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.260> gonna<00:01:13.549> make

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
our full piece so we're just gonna make

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
our full piece so we're just gonna make
a<00:01:14.610> triangle<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.070> then<00:01:17.070> we're

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
a triangle here see that and then we're

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.620 
a triangle here see that and then we're
gonna<00:01:17.280> take<00:01:17.490> our<00:01:17.640> other<00:01:17.729> channel<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.360> then

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
gonna take our other channel and then

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.080 
gonna take our other channel and then
are<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> triangle<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:21.000> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
are at a triangle and that is going to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.950 
are at a triangle and that is going to
be<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.990> basis<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.710> our<00:01:22.979> hat<00:01:23.369> okay<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.869> it's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
be the basis of our hat okay so it's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.359 
be the basis of our hat okay so it's
gonna<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.590> that's<00:01:26.009> what's<00:01:26.250> gonna

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
gonna be like that that's what's gonna

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.539 
gonna be like that that's what's gonna
happen<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.869> we're<00:01:28.140> gonna<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:29.009> put

happen with it now we're gonna do is put
some<00:01:29.700> double<00:01:29.939> stick<00:01:30.030> tape<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
some double stick tape here on the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.630 
some double stick tape here on the
corner<00:01:31.850> each<00:01:32.850> connecting<00:01:33.390> corner<00:01:34.640> we're

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
corner each connecting corner we're

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.640 
corner each connecting corner we're
gonna<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> bear<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.110> here

and<00:01:55.040> it's<00:01:55.760> okay<00:01:56.030> if<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:56.240> paper<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.630> coming

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
and it's okay if this paper is coming

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.450 
and it's okay if this paper is coming
off<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.200> table<00:01:57.500> it's<00:01:57.740> completely<00:01:58.310> fine

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
off the table it's completely fine

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.680 
off the table it's completely fine
because<00:01:58.640> you're<00:01:58.790> gonna<00:01:58.910> roll<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.300> up<00:01:59.390> anyway

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
because you're gonna roll it up anyway

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.870 
because you're gonna roll it up anyway
in<00:01:59.840> fact<00:02:00.050> it's<00:02:00.200> better<00:02:00.410> if<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.650> does<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.520> we're

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
in fact it's better if it does so we're

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.090 
in fact it's better if it does so we're
gonna<00:02:01.970> take<00:02:02.270> each<00:02:02.450> corner<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.800> we're<00:02:04.010> gonna

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
gonna take each corner and we're gonna

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:22.360 
gonna take each corner and we're gonna
roll<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.550> in<00:02:04.640> like<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:08.410> see<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:21.370> and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
roll it in like so see that and that and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.550 
roll it in like so see that and that and
that<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:23.720> we're<00:02:23.870> not<00:02:23.990> done<00:02:24.110> with<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.350> one

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
that but we're not done with this one

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.290 
that but we're not done with this one
cuz<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.280> gonna<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.610> front<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.180> we're

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
cuz this is gonna be the front so we're

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.430 
cuz this is gonna be the front so we're
gonna<00:02:26.390> roll<00:02:26.840> up<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> sides<00:02:27.920> -<00:02:29.530> like<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:34.000> okay

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
gonna roll up the sides - like that okay

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.510 
gonna roll up the sides - like that okay
now<00:02:36.440> what<00:02:36.590> we're<00:02:36.680> gonna<00:02:36.740> do<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.160> take<00:02:37.340> some

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
now what we're gonna do is take some

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.360 
now what we're gonna do is take some
ribbon<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:38.060> any<00:02:38.330> color<00:02:38.770> if<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:39.830> have<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> bunch

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
ribbon of any color if you have a bunch

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.010 
ribbon of any color if you have a bunch
of<00:02:40.550> ribbon<00:02:40.850> lying<00:02:41.030> around<00:02:41.210> that's<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.720> really

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
of ribbon lying around that's a really

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.750 
of ribbon lying around that's a really
good<00:02:42.140> idea<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.730> take<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.240> use<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.630> so

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
good idea to take it and use it so

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.979 
good idea to take it and use it so
you're<00:02:46.760> gonna<00:02:46.850> wrap<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:47.270> around<00:02:47.420> your<00:02:47.750> head

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
you're gonna wrap this around your head

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.330 
you're gonna wrap this around your head
or<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.290> child's<00:02:48.650> head<00:02:48.800> or<00:02:48.950> whoever<00:02:49.160> you're

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
or the child's head or whoever you're

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.979 
or the child's head or whoever you're
