00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
out started from scratch and just built

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
possibly an ac130 answer you can people

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.350 
possibly an ac130 answer you can people
at<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.900> sky<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.760> fifth<00:01:43.940> kill<00:01:44.120> streak

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
at the sky and of the fifth kill streak

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.859 
the game we have to make sure it's fun
which<00:05:23.559> is<00:05:23.589> obvious<00:05:24.039> and<00:05:24.419> we<00:05:25.419> also<00:05:25.569> make<00:05:25.839> sure

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:25.869 
which is obvious and we also make sure

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:27.629 
which is obvious and we also make sure
that<00:05:26.169> it's<00:05:26.319> balanced<00:05:26.949> and<00:05:27.159> there<00:05:27.519> are

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
that it's balanced and there are

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.979 
that it's balanced and there are
counters<00:05:27.999> to<00:05:28.239> it<00:05:28.389> in<00:05:28.509> there<00:05:28.689> are<00:05:28.779> ways<00:05:28.959> that

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:28.989 
counters to it in there are ways that

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:30.899 
counters to it in there are ways that
this<00:05:29.979> isn't<00:05:30.249> the<00:05:30.339> thing<00:05:30.489> that's<00:05:30.699> going<00:05:30.849> to

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
this isn't the thing that's going to

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:32.790 
this isn't the thing that's going to
break<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.539> game<00:05:31.689> so<00:05:32.259> if<00:05:32.319> you<00:05:32.409> see<00:05:32.529> that<00:05:32.679> guy

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
break the game so if you see that guy

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.679 
break the game so if you see that guy
that's<00:05:32.979> using<00:05:33.279> a<00:05:33.309> tackle<00:05:33.579> insertion<00:05:33.999> you're

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689 
that's using a tackle insertion you're

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.569 
that's using a tackle insertion you're
actually<00:05:34.899> able<00:05:35.229> to<00:05:35.409> go<00:05:35.800> up<00:05:35.919> and<00:05:36.039> break<00:05:36.219> it<00:05:36.429> and

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:36.579 
actually able to go up and break it and

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:38.790 
actually able to go up and break it and
shoot<00:05:37.029> it<00:05:37.149> you<00:05:37.360> can<00:05:37.479> make<00:05:37.629> it<00:05:37.749> blow<00:05:37.869> up<00:05:37.929> or<00:05:38.559> you

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
shoot it you can make it blow up or you

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.499 
shoot it you can make it blow up or you
can<00:05:38.949> wait<00:05:39.219> behind<00:05:39.429> it<00:05:39.759> which<00:05:40.149> for<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.360> guy<00:05:40.479> to

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
can wait behind it which for the guy to

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.199 
can wait behind it which for the guy to
spawn<00:05:40.869> and<00:05:41.139> then<00:05:41.229> she<00:05:41.379> came<00:05:41.559> back<00:05:41.879> there's<00:05:42.879> all

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.209 
spawn and then she came back there's all

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.149 
spawn and then she came back there's all
these<00:05:43.419> different<00:05:43.659> balances<00:05:44.169> that<00:05:44.439> let's<00:05:44.829> see

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
these different balances that let's see

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.649 
these different balances that let's see

streets<00:06:12.459> when<00:06:13.269> months<00:06:13.539> so<00:06:14.819> for<00:06:15.819> example<00:06:15.879> the

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
streets when months so for example the

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.719 
streets when months so for example the
death<00:06:16.479> streak<00:06:16.719> is<00:06:17.619> also<00:06:17.979> a<00:06:18.009> new<00:06:18.099> concept<00:06:18.429> that

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
death streak is also a new concept that

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.359 
death streak is also a new concept that
you<00:06:18.939> choose<00:06:19.149> per<00:06:19.479> class<00:06:19.689> a<00:06:20.050> copycat<00:06:20.889> is<00:06:21.159> a<00:06:21.249> good

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:21.369 
you choose per class a copycat is a good

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:23.759 
you choose per class a copycat is a good
example<00:06:21.429> so<00:06:22.389> basically<00:06:22.659> once<00:06:23.349> you've<00:06:23.529> died

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:23.769 
example so basically once you've died

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:26.429 
example so basically once you've died
four<00:06:24.459> times<00:06:24.639> in<00:06:24.759> our<00:06:24.849> own<00:06:25.029> and<00:06:25.929> it<00:06:26.050> might<00:06:26.289> be<00:06:26.319> a

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
four times in our own and it might be a

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:28.040 
four times in our own and it might be a
little<00:06:26.679> bummed<00:06:26.919> if<00:06:27.579> you<00:06:27.699> have<00:06:27.789> enough

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
little bummed if you have enough

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.649 
little bummed if you have enough
but<00:06:28.289> then<00:06:28.409> go<00:06:28.650> but<00:06:29.610> you<00:06:29.759> get<00:06:30.090> your<00:06:30.240> copy<00:06:30.389> cat
