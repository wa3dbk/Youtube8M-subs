really<00:01:49.860> high<00:01:50.070> quality<00:01:50.100> car<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.290> I'll<00:01:52.380> carbon

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
really high quality car so I'll carbon

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.929 
really high quality car so I'll carbon
fiber<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> bottom<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> how<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> loom<00:01:56.759> in

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
fiber on the bottom so how to loom in

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.929 
fiber on the bottom so how to loom in
them<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.180> back<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:58.110> only<00:01:58.469> plastic

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
would be um can't think of them right

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.660 
would be um can't think of them right
now<00:02:02.759> butts<00:02:03.390> these<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> arms<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.170 
know what you think on it um as far as
the<00:02:26.410> drift<00:02:26.650> series<00:02:26.830> goes<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.610> know<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.820> can't

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
the drift series goes I know I can't

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.590 
the drift series goes I know I can't
finish<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.630> drift<00:02:28.960> series<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.560> pan<00:02:29.800> car

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
finish the drift series of the pan car

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.960 
finish the drift series of the pan car
and<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:31.780> either<00:02:32.290> late<00:02:33.190> March<00:02:33.490> I'm<00:02:33.820> thinking

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
and so either late March I'm thinking

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.750 
and so either late March I'm thinking
about<00:02:34.150> either<00:02:34.450> getting<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.020> plane<00:02:35.610> what's<00:02:36.610> how

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
about either getting a plane what's how

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.820 
about either getting a plane what's how
much<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.120> would<00:02:37.300> really<00:02:37.540> like<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.960> get<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.650> I'll

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
much I would really like to get it I'll

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.120 
much I would really like to get it I'll
get<00:02:39.010> simulator<00:02:40.260> flight<00:02:41.260> flight<00:02:41.650> simulator

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
get simulator flight flight simulator

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.790 
get simulator flight flight simulator
and<00:02:42.459> then<00:02:42.640> they<00:02:42.730> have<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.880> brushless<00:02:43.800> 2.44

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
and then they have a brushless 2.44

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.980 
and then they have a brushless 2.44
channel<00:02:45.330> lipo<00:02:46.330> lipo<00:02:46.660> charger<00:02:47.170> type<00:02:47.830> deal<00:02:48.990> 470

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
channel lipo lipo charger type deal 470

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.440 
channel lipo lipo charger type deal 470
it<00:02:50.680> would<00:02:50.770> be<00:02:50.860> about<00:02:51.010> 100<00:02:51.400> with<00:02:51.700> forty<00:02:52.090> dollars

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
it would be about 100 with forty dollars

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.280 
it would be about 100 with forty dollars
so<00:02:52.720> I'd<00:02:52.810> be<00:02:52.900> about<00:02:53.730> 250<00:02:54.730> which<00:02:55.420> after<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.050> Oh

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
so I'd be about 250 which after that Oh

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.560 
so I'd be about 250 which after that Oh
after<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.040> flight<00:02:57.280> simulator<00:02:57.790> back<00:02:58.090> or<00:02:58.510> I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
after the flight simulator back or I

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.570 
after the flight simulator back or I
would<00:02:59.020> get<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.290> team<00:02:59.500> associate<00:03:00.160> acting

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
would get the team associate acting
