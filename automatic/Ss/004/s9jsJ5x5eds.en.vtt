the topic for this video is H LM full
body<00:00:08.309> training<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.719> might<00:00:09.900> have<00:00:10.080> seen<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
body training you might have seen the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.640 
body training you might have seen the
term<00:00:10.830> h<00:00:11.550> LM<00:00:12.000> tossed<00:00:12.360> around<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.290> worldwide

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
term h LM tossed around on the worldwide

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.519 
term h LM tossed around on the worldwide
interwebs<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.570> might<00:00:15.750> not<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.049> sure<00:00:16.260> what

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
interwebs and you might not be sure what

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.240 
interwebs and you might not be sure what
exactly<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.640> means<00:00:18.020> it's<00:00:19.020> usually<00:00:19.320> associated

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
exactly it means it's usually associated

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.359 
exactly it means it's usually associated
with<00:00:21.020> full<00:00:22.020> body<00:00:22.230> style<00:00:22.680> training<00:00:23.160> or

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
with full body style training or

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.839 
with full body style training or
training<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.330> vein<00:00:25.609> some<00:00:26.609> type<00:00:26.820> of

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
training in that vein some type of

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.169 
training in that vein some type of
training<00:00:27.330> frequency<00:00:27.769> h<00:00:28.769> LM<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.490> basically

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
training frequency h LM is basically

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.530 
training frequency h LM is basically
basically<00:00:31.170> stands<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:31.949> heavy<00:00:32.210> light<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
basically stands for heavy light and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.209 
basically stands for heavy light and
moderate<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.469> medium

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
moderate or medium

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.520 
moderate or medium
so<00:00:36.059> you're<00:00:36.180> basically<00:00:36.410> rotating<00:00:37.410> your

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
so you're basically rotating your

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.950 
so you're basically rotating your
training<00:00:38.040> days<00:00:38.250> between<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> heavy<00:00:39.450> day<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
training days between a heavy day a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.729 
training days between a heavy day a
light<00:00:40.590> day<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.910> moderate<00:00:42.390> day<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:43.559> what

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
light day and a moderate day now what

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.250 
light day and a moderate day now what
this<00:00:43.920> might<00:00:44.160> mean<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.579> paper<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this might mean on paper is that if you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.660 
this might mean on paper is that if you
switch<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.480> full<00:00:48.480> body<00:00:48.690> workout<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:50.460> might

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
switch to a full body workout you might

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.470 
switch to a full body workout you might
do<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:50.940> heavy<00:00:51.480> day<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.199> Monday<00:00:53.129> which<00:00:54.090> means

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
do your heavy day on Monday which means

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.350 
do your heavy day on Monday which means
probably<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.440> big<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.399> big<00:00:56.640> hitters<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> big

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
probably the big the big hitters the big

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
barbell rows that sort of thing probably

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.250 
barbell rows that sort of thing probably
for<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> lower<00:01:05.100> ish<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.570> rep

have to be less intense physically and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.899 
have to be less intense physically and
from<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.619> generally<00:01:50.399> from<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> weight

back so guys that's the basic structure
of<00:04:06.489> an<00:04:06.730> HLM<00:04:07.480> approach<00:04:07.900> again<00:04:08.440> that's<00:04:09.250> it's<00:04:09.850> a

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
of an HLM approach again that's it's a

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.229 
of an HLM approach again that's it's a
rotational<00:04:10.870> scheme<00:04:11.350> that<00:04:12.220> can<00:04:12.640> be<00:04:12.790> worked<00:04:13.030> in
