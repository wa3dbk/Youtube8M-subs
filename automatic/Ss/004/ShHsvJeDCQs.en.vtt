00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.719
 how about friends from youtube greets 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:14.480
 jorge mendoza this time in this in 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.060
 this space of old but beautiful 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.439
 I want to teach a simple way 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.789
 play slave and I love it 's a song 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.910
 be that the world has become 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.150
 in a classic and surely many of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.780
 you already know more or less like that 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.780
 yes 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.379
 why 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.489
 lifetime 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.489
 s 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.550
 he also never loses 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.559
 we are going to need the following chords 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.559
 a the least 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.309
 with greater sun 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.790
 ah 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.790
 I 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.429
 I allow the minor 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.429
 greater sun 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.210
 Y 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.210
 and my greatest 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.320
 the strum with much attention 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.509
 for example I'm going to do what I'm going to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.970
 accompany with the minor with much 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.540
 Attention in strumming is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.540
 one trait down two up 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:57.820
 another down strum down if 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.820
 It's going to be long, it's strumming 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.530
 already 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.530
 all up 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.010
 and down 2 up and others 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.010
 down 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.940
 in this rhythm all the traits that you make 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.930
 down they are going to do a little bit 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.930
 elongated 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.879
 and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.879
 you notice it gives the feeling that 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.180
 last much longer if it is not so much like that 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.549
 that somehow these elongate and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.720
 they are shorter for example the features 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.720
 upwards then they would be 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.540
 ray down 2 up again 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.220
 that down 2 up and saws towards 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.350
 down 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.920
 repeat it as many times as necessary 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.230
 check this rhythm well repeat the video 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.530
 paused and until you have it more or 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.140
 less so 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.000
 ah 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.870
 ah 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.500
 ok now we are going to add this 2 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:15.410
 add the chords and soul to the verse of 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.410
 the verses ok 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.510
 at this point you should already have well 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.510
 sure the rhythm 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.849
 the youngest I do not know 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.940
 live 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.770
 I dont know 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.500
 let's go blue 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.710
 mouth 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.720
 and what not 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.720

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.490
 and here 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.110
 my greatest blood returns what 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.110
 we return to the minor 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.150
 so 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.150
 how do you have 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.810
