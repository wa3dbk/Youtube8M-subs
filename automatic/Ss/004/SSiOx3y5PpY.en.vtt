long doings to the east of the area and
it's<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.290> behind<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.739> room<00:00:41.550> where<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.180> guess

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it's just behind this room where I guess

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.740 
it's just behind this room where I guess
some<00:00:42.989> Skell<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> spawn<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
some Skell in a spawn and so just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.440 
some Skell in a spawn and so just
discover<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> map

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
discover it and it is there on the map

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.450 
discover it and it is there on the map
so<00:00:49.350> yeah<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.770> east<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.050> area<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.829> guess

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
so yeah to the east in that area I guess

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
so yeah to the east in that area I guess
I'm<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.760> would<00:00:53.969> help<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.110> most<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:57.739> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
I'm up would help the most really and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
I'm up would help the most really and
then<00:00:58.859> from<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.430> move<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.850> back<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
then from there we move on back to the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510 
then from there we move on back to the
center<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> area<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.039> hamlet<00:01:02.340> of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
center of the area to the hamlet of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.179 
center of the area to the hamlet of
Swift<00:01:03.090> passing<00:01:03.570> through<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.199> there

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
Swift passing through I think is there

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.399 
Swift passing through I think is there
were<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:05.850> skeletons<00:01:06.450> attack<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
were all these skeletons attack you and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.620 
were all these skeletons attack you and
he's<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.310> behind<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.729> building<00:01:09.090> ouch<00:01:09.360> like

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
he's just behind the building ouch like

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.080 
he's just behind the building ouch like
is<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.439> vault<00:01:10.680> sign<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> come<00:01:14.670> around<00:01:14.820> here

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
is the vault sign so come around here

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.800 
is the vault sign so come around here
and<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:17.720> right<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:20.210> boom<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.689> do

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and it is right right there boom not do

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
and it is right right there boom not do
how<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> find<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.439> you're<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.830> know<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.189> this

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
how to find if you're you know in this

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.940 
how to find if you're you know in this
area<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> middle<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
area so there is in the middle in the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.280 
area so there is in the middle in the
hamlet

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.620 

and<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.280> from<00:01:33.520> there<00:01:33.760> you<00:01:34.000> want<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.180> go<00:01:34.300> south

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
and so from there you want to go south

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.370 
and so from there you want to go south
to<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.290> little<00:01:36.100> temple<00:01:36.370> over<00:01:36.760> there<00:01:37.230> for<00:01:38.230> the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
to the little temple over there for the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.340 
to the little temple over there for the
next<00:01:38.560> vault<00:01:38.920> sign<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:41.080> is<00:01:41.170> actually

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
next vault sign and that is actually

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.640 
next vault sign and that is actually
where<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.920> spatula<00:01:42.790> car<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.300> located<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:44.170> think

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
where the spatula car is located I think

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.900 
where the spatula car is located I think
that's<00:01:44.830> what<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.100> called<00:01:45.130> spatula<00:01:45.520> calm<00:01:47.910> so

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
that's what it's called spatula calm so

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.140 
that's what it's called spatula calm so
run<00:01:49.180> along<00:01:49.270> these<00:01:49.570> shores<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.970> gum<00:01:51.970> where

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
run along these shores the gum where

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.250 
run along these shores the gum where
that's<00:01:52.300> called<00:01:52.570> too<00:01:53.050> complicated<00:01:53.440> names<00:01:53.860> and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
that's called too complicated names and

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.990 
that's called too complicated names and
you'll<00:01:56.260> get<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.620> this<00:01:56.710> lewin<00:01:57.160> bridge<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.729> think

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
you'll get to this lewin bridge I think

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.670 
you'll get to this lewin bridge I think
and<00:01:58.390> there<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.870> vault<00:01:59.080> sign<00:01:59.290> is<00:01:59.440> behind

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
and there the vault sign is behind

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.320 
and there the vault sign is behind
bridge<00:02:00.030> all<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.180> rooms<00:02:01.450> every<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.940> there<00:02:07.210> it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
bridge all the rooms every and there it

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.100 
bridge all the rooms every and there it
is<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.520> where<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.820> on<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.179> map<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
is so that is where is on the map to the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.560 
is so that is where is on the map to the
south<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.800> hamlet<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.340> Swift<00:02:13.150> passing

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
south of the hamlet of Swift passing

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.730 
south of the hamlet of Swift passing
through<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.209> for<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.840> whole<00:02:17.590> of
