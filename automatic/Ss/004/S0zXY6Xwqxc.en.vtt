00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
thing is no okay this so I may as we use

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.010

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
otherwise I'd feel the temptation to

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.879 
otherwise I'd feel the temptation to
switch<00:05:47.970> to<00:05:48.120> my<00:05:48.240> sniper<00:05:48.539> and<00:05:48.930> fail<00:05:49.470> at<00:05:49.860> getting

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
switch to my sniper and fail at getting

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:58.850 
switch to my sniper and fail at getting
a<00:05:50.190> trick<00:05:50.400> shot<00:05:57.169> because<00:05:58.169> that's<00:05:58.470> what<00:05:58.590> I<00:05:58.650> tend
