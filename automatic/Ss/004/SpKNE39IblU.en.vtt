00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
deck one more crazy shuffle the crazier

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.080 
deck one more crazy shuffle the crazier

you make the deck the more magical the
things<00:02:30.270> will<00:02:30.480> become<00:02:31.550> now<00:02:32.550> let's<00:02:32.820> see<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.150> we

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
things will become now let's see what we

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.199 
things will become now let's see what we
can<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.570> here<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.980> said<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.670> deck<00:02:35.880> was

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
can do here so like I said the deck was

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.580 
can do here so like I said the deck was
shuffled<00:02:36.660> at<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> beginning<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> trick

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
shuffled at the beginning of the trick

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.050 
shuffled at the beginning of the trick
and<00:02:37.739> could<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.010> selected<00:02:38.400> any<00:02:38.610> card<00:02:38.910> we

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and could have selected any card we

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.880 
and could have selected any card we
wanted<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:40.050> lost<00:02:40.290> back<00:02:40.560> into<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
wanted and it was lost back into the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.620 
wanted and it was lost back into the
middle<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.250> deck<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.700> then<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.360> mix<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
middle of the deck and then to mix the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.110 
middle of the deck and then to mix the
neck<00:02:42.780> up<00:02:42.930> even<00:02:43.020> further<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:44.040> did<00:02:44.610> my<00:02:44.760> crazy

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
neck up even further I did my crazy

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.630 
neck up even further I did my crazy
little<00:02:45.299> n<00:02:45.570> jog<00:02:45.810> out<00:02:46.019> jog<00:02:46.320> shuffle<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:46.980> got<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
little n jog out jog shuffle and got the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280 
little n jog out jog shuffle and got the
deck<00:02:47.850> at<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> end<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> trick<00:02:48.810> split<00:02:49.110> into

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
deck at the end of the trick split into

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.970 
deck at the end of the trick split into
four<00:02:49.620> piles<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:51.030> somehow<00:02:51.570> out<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.440> all<00:02:52.769> of

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
four piles and somehow out of all of

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.170 
four piles and somehow out of all of
this<00:02:53.130> madness<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.970> managed<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.959> find<00:02:55.350> your

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
this madness I managed to find your

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.270 
this madness I managed to find your
selected<00:02:57.180> card<00:02:57.680> now<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.709> know<00:02:58.860> you're<00:02:59.070> thinking

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
selected card now I know you're thinking

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.890 
selected card now I know you're thinking
well<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.880> know<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.239> could<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.540> been<00:03:00.660> lucky

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
well you know that could have been lucky

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.509 
well you know that could have been lucky
I<00:03:01.049> mean<00:03:01.290> how<00:03:01.440> could<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.709> possibly<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.459> done

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
I mean how could you possibly have done

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.250 
I mean how could you possibly have done
that<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.940> deck<00:03:03.120> was<00:03:03.299> completely<00:03:03.840> messed<00:03:04.080> up

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
that the deck was completely messed up

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.330 
that the deck was completely messed up
but<00:03:05.130> if<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.310> call<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.880> luck<00:03:06.380> well<00:03:07.380> then<00:03:07.560> is

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
but if you call that luck well then is

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.860 
but if you call that luck well then is
this<00:03:08.640> also<00:03:09.180> luck<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.140> real<00:03:10.910> magic<00:03:11.910> and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
this also luck or is this real magic and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.009 
this also luck or is this real magic and
that<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:14.130> what<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> coincidence<00:03:15.000> by<00:03:15.120> Mac<00:03:15.330> J<00:03:15.570> 1<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
that is what a coincidence by Mac J 1 to

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.410 
that is what a coincidence by Mac J 1 to
4<00:03:16.320> it's<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.340> simple<00:03:17.730> trick<00:03:17.970> but<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.180> think

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
4 it's it's a simple trick but I think

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.960 
4 it's it's a simple trick but I think
it's<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.810> think<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.200> really<00:03:19.470> great<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.940> I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
it's I think it's really great and so I

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.370 
it's I think it's really great and so I
really<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.360> effect<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.750> again<00:03:22.140> go

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
really like this effect so again go

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.539 
really like this effect so again go
