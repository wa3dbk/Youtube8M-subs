00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
probably one of the easiest cells on the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.580 
probably one of the easiest cells on the
game<00:00:48.480> obviously<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
game obviously because it's on the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
game obviously because it's on the
second<00:00:49.950> level<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:51.210> basically<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
second level and it's basically the

second level and it's basically the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
first level because of the fact of the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.760 
first level because of the fact of the
first<00:00:53.730> two<00:00:54.390> levels<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:56.300> introductions

though these are super basic it's still

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.679 
though these are super basic it's still
part<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> game<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.939> decided<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.539> I

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
part of the game so I decided that I

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.639 
part of the game so I decided that I
probably<00:01:31.140> included<00:01:33.020> fine<00:01:34.020> here's<00:01:34.319> a<00:01:34.380> part

that I said you have to play it toys

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.639 
that I said you have to play it toys
when<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.569> the<00:01:36.630> middle<00:01:36.899> it<00:01:37.259> drops<00:01:37.530> down

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
when you go in the middle it drops down

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.919 
when you go in the middle it drops down
and<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.399> plays<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> video<00:01:38.789> about<00:01:39.060> how<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
desk and so the carpets for basically

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.010 
desk and so the carpets for basically
you'll<00:01:53.369> die<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.569> won't<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.840> some

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
