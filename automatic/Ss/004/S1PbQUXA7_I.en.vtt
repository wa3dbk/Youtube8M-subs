00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.230
 hello dear hungry today there are times 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.610
 again a cooking tip but as it is 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.000
 one which you then eat the same 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.710
 can 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.560
 we prepare peanut butter 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.420
 I would like to comment on this myself 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.130
 the same that's not quite true 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.529
 because according to those in Germany 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.570
 regulations are only allowed as a mother 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.790
 are also referred to in the at least 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.160
 something is milk and this is true at the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.649
 here shown variant not to 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.690
 The exact name would be the peanut 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.100
 I have to have cream or peanut 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 earlier none at all 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.700
 thought and peanut butter 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.230
 I bought it until about two o'clock 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.930
 years with a friendly cook 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.730
 I have discovered this kind of preparation 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.100
 was amazed at the simplicity and 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.440
 since then, make my peanut butter almost 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.660
 always yourself and most suitable for it 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.490
 is the time before christmas because 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.340
 someday you will get that way 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.329
 inexpensive high quality fresh 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.090
 peanuts 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:09.579
 we only need the peanuts 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.460
 all other ingredients are optional 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.990
 so it can be given to oil and 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.300
 if then a taste suitable 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.060
 so peanut oil or a neutral 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.830
 Variation like sunflowers or rapeseed oil 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.080
 it can be as mentioned before 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.370
 claim to meet peanut butter 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.840
 also be added with 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.299
 and who likes something heartier 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.220
 can also add and worship salt 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.200
 nut butter or ditch it to bake 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.479
 or used as a sweet spread 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.130
 Add some icing sugar all the way 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.200
 honestly the most complicated at the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.270
 production is the peeling of peanuts 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.220
 It is not complicated 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.170
 but rather a little tedious and here 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.810
 Of course you can do the same 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.070
 well equipped and in addition 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.260
 possibly also salted peanuts 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.840
 however, take advantage of it 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.820
 frogs after our fingertips now 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.650
 bunch of damage we give the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.750
 Peanuts in a coated pan and 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.060
 arm it easily 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.950
 but only until you start 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.810
 pleasantly nutty to smell 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.090
 then we take her off the stove 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.980
 cool slightly and fill with it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.659
 mixer and it does not necessarily have one 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.330
 Mixer is a bit stronger 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.980
 Blender fulfills the purpose as well 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.569
 turn on mixer and who the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.790
 peanut butter rather roughly or 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.130
 I want to take a few samples 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.020
 seconds a part of the results 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.970
 and then at the very end under again 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.770
 I do not do that, therefore 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.630
 all peanuts in the mixer and when 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.800
 This then sometimes on the edge of the mix 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.020
 Vessel so up 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.830
 then give it with a spoon or else 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.760
 just back in the middle with it 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.860
 and you can do this process 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.790
 pursue the more there are also 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.790
 really nothing to do 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.310
 so that he can see better I have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.090
 here once again that not mixa 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.090
 affiliated 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.060
 yes and that's it for now as 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.890
 So I said quite simple fills the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.510
 Peanut trenches makes pretty glasses 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.130
 billing label on it all 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.870
 is also good as a gift and 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.400
 the refrigerator is the shelf life 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.620
 at least four weeks 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.720
 I always enjoy the park 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.830
 to prepare readers for stock and me 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.110
 Hope you are in the preparation 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.760
 just as close and very good appetite 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.740
 if you prefer the very different 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.440
 maybe dmitri would like to prepare 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.630
 this spicy aromatic Argentine 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.940
 herbal sauce or rather potato chips 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.060
 with guacamole then just look 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.440
 into these videos 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.090
 I still have to say until the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.090
 Next time bye
