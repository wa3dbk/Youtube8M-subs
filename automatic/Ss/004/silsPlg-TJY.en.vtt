00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.569
 in very young players like I do not want 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.850
 very bells and more experienced 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.379
 how will you be looking for a 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.810
 balance between youth and experience 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.340
 to not be sure 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.650
 and boys come a good projection 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 comes a U-17 championship 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.770
 as a third goalkeeper I think your 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 trends 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.650
 that cup america the base there was a future 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.829
 I'm sure that boy 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.420
 for a long time in the selection 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.880
 then it is now independent that 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.080
 I can go there 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.470
 they are going to take very talented advantage of 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.600
 that place not only by force of work 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.790
 I want them to come from projection as 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.350
 third goalkeeper 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.050
 they did not have a good year he was not a substitute and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.810
 the other had a very bad season and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.810
 they are young but to take me one 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.800
 to have a good semester for me to 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.630
 not worth me also a future and 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.829
 I think he has earned it now when 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.570
 a player who has a lot 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.409
 experience took a lot of hierarchy in the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.960
 court 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.420
 knows how these types of 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.159
 events and I'm sure with the punch 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.220
 for me it is one of the worst peeled not 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.610
 only 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.070
 america on top of the world 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.070
 his presence will always make you talk 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.110
 on the court then good 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.750
 there is how is the balance of a 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.060
 veteran and the young people he called the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.560
 selection 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.070
 with this you are looking for a spare 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 generational little by little spare parts 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.570
 they were in a way that is not 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.570
 so drastic 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.220
 boys there is a lot of youth but 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.520
 also that they come from a process 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.620
 previous and that you have to take 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.350
 to benefit 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.940
 of that process as of experience 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.950
 it is very difficult today to have 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.040
 players on your side that have a lot 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.990
 experience because that youth that goes 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.770
 growing does not have that experience and 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.770
 then we 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.170
 that we have been close to classify 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.960
 and do important things I think it 's the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.330
 time to say good 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.490
 already a lot of players that 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.710
 they have lived this kind of rest and 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.780
 another as a coach has to 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.710
 benefit from that kind of experience 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.230
 for him 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.230
 and it matches with march you said that 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.750
 you said in March that I would change two 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.880
 America's Cups by qualifying to a 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.110
 world that means that this cup 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.160
 america is a blank for the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.160
 final eliminatory 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.680
 the mountain 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.780
 One thing leads to another 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.629
 I think the confidence that you are giving is 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.400
 makes a good cup america and working 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:12.799
 that confidence that a group gives you goes away 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.080
 coupling when we feel then I 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.750
 I think that 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.760
 I said it and then we're going to have to not 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.069
 I come to win a cup america with a 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.680
 classification 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.540
 with a work plan for one year 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.660
 after six months in a work plan 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.150
 four years 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.760
 with a very clear goal to be able to 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.069
 classify the world 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.530
 in spite of it the fourth place achieved 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.170
 in the cup america argentina puts the 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.130
 very tall to see why 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.720
 first the drowned woman I do not see him 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.120
 that if he makes a sayo I think that 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.770
 fourth place yes it was very important for 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.030
 we who have not achieved anything 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.030
 for him it's not a thing either 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.820
 but like a rod that I do not come to 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.980
 compete with no coach 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.280
 Venezuelan 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.200
 I come to work to achieve things 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.140
 important 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.870
 welcome be good first performance 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.940
 in last year in the past stern but 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.650
 we want low 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.139
 but I do not come to compete with anyone 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.040
 if he asks me as a coach 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.040
 I want to be a champion 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.500
 it does not mean that I 'm not 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.660
 competing that if the other one got that 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.540
 world from the brain we give 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.310
 clear then something and that what 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.530
 We want to work to do 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.000
 happen easily and that each time the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.980
 equipment is going to fit and go to 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.200
 greater confidence and like your team 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.780
 like 9 facing the america cup 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.150
 from more to less because we have seen them in 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.920
 the friendlies insurance 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.689
 sorry less 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.989
 sometimes 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:03.989
 one how is it starting that made 

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:06.209
 all things went well but 

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:09.719
 That night do not get morning 

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:12.210
 it is achieved with work that the boy 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.830
 go grabbing in the day 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.110
 and little by little it will be strengthened 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.470
 all the senses to be able to do it 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.530
 team 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.510
 you feel confident and that within 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.270
 the court is a group of friends who 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.190
 everyone can work for 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.650
 benefit from your movement of each 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.850
 One Colombia and Brazil are in the group 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.850
 with this with all america 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.300
 for my favorites later I think the 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.449
 difference is in that 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.360
 are two teams that come global are 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:50.740
 in enough trailers 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.639
 they are going through the moments 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.280
 never give one 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.740
 with your ideas to a total change there will be 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.729
 been something a little more aggressive to the 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.710
 time to recover the ball in Colombia ' 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.020
 used to keep the ball but 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.669
 of making many associations now it 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.219
 can play when three touches do 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.169
 hurt you or they are vertical and the 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:15.870
 you can also have the ball 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:19.290
 a group of flowers pretty fast 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:23.729
 and then there is a different process like 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:26.129
 if we what webs 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.590
 we are expressing a job but every 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:32.120
 once we 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:34.100
 and take that confidence to be able to do 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.280
 a selection that can say enough 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.080
 competitive and be able to get what it is 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.830
 feasible to spend money when insurance 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.830
 very safe 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.200
 for that you have to work 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.140
 for this we are every ten days 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.180
 we know that we have everything we have 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.980
 all the players but always good 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.550
 I have one again to improve 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.010
 The origin 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.210
 and trust will stand for 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.840
 that work 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.139
 talking a little about eliminatory 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.770
 in 2002 back to 98 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.540
 venezuela was in 2002 was penultimate 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.190
 for 2006 it was antepenultimate and so has 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.380
 gone up to the last 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.140
 eliminatory that was 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.790
 a classifying step believes that for 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.780
 The next ones come to Venezuela 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.750
 very well 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.330
 I think we have been close by 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.190
 what we are working on the basis of 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.680
 that we have been very close by the 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.110
 process of richard paez afterwards with 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.729
 Cesar Farias and hopefully this is the 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.189
 blessing to get well 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:36.699
 explanation and if you do not classify yourself 

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:36.699
 he considers it a failure 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.740
 when one has a clear objective, 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.449
 it is clear what one wants 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:48.340
 I have some classification so that 

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:51.849
 things of the get I have it now 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:55.839
 same for science not so 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:59.339
 I came then for that and if you do not get 

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:59.339
 there is no where to catch 

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.930
 d 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.930
 I come back home
