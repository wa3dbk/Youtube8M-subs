jargon so like a I just want to talk

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.420 
jargon so like a I just want to talk
more<00:02:28.480> about<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.840> spirit<00:02:29.230> mage<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.799> just<00:02:30.100> made<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
more about the spirit mage I just made a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.150 
more about the spirit mage I just made a
video<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.810> sort<00:02:32.049> of<00:02:32.170> briefly<00:02:32.620> mentioned

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
video and I sort of briefly mentioned

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.720 
video and I sort of briefly mentioned
that<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.359> spirit<00:02:34.750> mage<00:02:34.930> can<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:36.609> be

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
that the spirit mage can can be

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.280 
that the spirit mage can can be
detrimental<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.480> right<00:02:37.780> because<00:02:38.260> he

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
detrimental to a right because he

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.710 
detrimental to a right because he
doesn't<00:02:38.590> have<00:02:38.739> walls<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:39.850> he<00:02:40.450> ends<00:02:40.600> up

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
doesn't have walls and so he ends up

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.690 
doesn't have walls and so he ends up
killing<00:02:40.989> more<00:02:41.290> buildings<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.010> there's<00:02:42.459> less

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
killing more buildings and there's less

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.210 
killing more buildings and there's less
things<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.090> proc<00:02:43.359> off<00:02:45.600> yeah<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:47.079> really<00:02:47.920> want<00:02:48.100> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
things to proc off yeah I really want to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.590 
things to proc off yeah I really want to
really<00:02:48.609> want<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.820> look<00:02:48.940> into<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.209> i'm<00:02:49.329> not<00:02:49.450> sure

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
really want to look into it i'm not sure

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.020 
really want to look into it i'm not sure
if<00:02:49.690> anyone<00:02:50.079> else<00:02:50.200> can<00:02:50.859> empathize<00:02:51.340> with<00:02:51.640> what

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
if anyone else can empathize with what

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.000 
if anyone else can empathize with what
i'm<00:02:52.269> saying<00:02:52.570> there<00:02:52.840> anyone<00:02:53.350> else<00:02:53.470> sort<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.739> has

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
i'm saying there anyone else sort of has

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.009 
i'm saying there anyone else sort of has
had<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> same<00:02:54.519> feeling<00:02:54.820> like<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.329> all<00:02:55.510> this

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
had the same feeling like that all this

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.370 
had the same feeling like that all this
noise<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.709> kills<00:02:56.980> buildings<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:58.380> therefore

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
noise just kills buildings and therefore

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.500 
noise just kills buildings and therefore
and<00:02:59.859> it<00:03:00.070> really<00:03:00.250> proxy<00:03:00.730> kills<00:03:00.970> buildings<00:03:01.329> to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
and it really proxy kills buildings to

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.840 
and it really proxy kills buildings to
which<00:03:01.840> eliminates<00:03:02.829> how<00:03:03.040> many<00:03:03.280> times<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.640> can

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
which eliminates how many times you can

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.569 
which eliminates how many times you can
proc<00:03:04.150> because<00:03:04.660> what<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.900> want<00:03:05.200> what<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.370> main

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
proc because what you want what the main

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.979 
proc because what you want what the main
thing<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.120> main<00:03:07.180> reason<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:07.690> want<00:03:07.870> in

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
thing the main reason you want in

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:08.880 
thing the main reason you want in
propping<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.380> because<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.620> want<00:03:08.739> them<00:03:08.799> to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
propping is because you want them to

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.349 
propping is because you want them to
kill<00:03:09.040> heroes<00:03:09.430> especially<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:10.090> danger

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
kill heroes especially in danger

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.819 
kill heroes especially in danger
netscaler<00:03:10.780> living<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.170> want<00:03:11.320> those<00:03:11.470> heroes

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
netscaler living you want those heroes

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.680 
netscaler living you want those heroes
to<00:03:11.950> die<00:03:12.100> but<00:03:12.790> if<00:03:12.850> he<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.000> propping<00:03:13.450> onto

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
to die but if he is propping onto

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.030 
to die but if he is propping onto
building<00:03:14.019> as<00:03:14.109> killing<00:03:14.319> buildings<00:03:14.829> not

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
building as killing buildings not

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.130 
building as killing buildings not
heading<00:03:15.250> walls<00:03:15.519> just<00:03:15.940> wiping<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.690> base<00:03:16.870> out

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
heading walls just wiping the base out

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.770 
heading walls just wiping the base out
then<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:18.459> lowers<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> chance<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.630> actually

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
then it lowers the chance of actually

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.979 
then it lowers the chance of actually
killing<00:03:20.290> those<00:03:20.530> heroes<00:03:20.859> so<00:03:21.299> i'm<00:03:22.299> saving<00:03:22.810> for<00:03:22.959> a

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
killing those heroes so i'm saving for a

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.720 
killing those heroes so i'm saving for a
grizzly<00:03:23.319> river<00:03:23.500> right<00:03:23.769> now<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.700> really

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
grizzly river right now and I really

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.040 
grizzly river right now and I really
sink

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
sink

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.580 
sink
might<00:03:27.010> be<00:03:27.870> hypothesized<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:28.960> he<00:03:29.110> might<00:03:29.320> be

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
might be hypothesized that he might be

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.520 
might be hypothesized that he might be
actually<00:03:29.950> better<00:03:30.490> than<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.660> spirit<00:03:31.990> mage<00:03:32.170> but

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
actually better than the spirit mage but

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.130 
actually better than the spirit mage but
that's<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.070> massive<00:03:33.640> massive<00:03:34.180> claim<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.930> make

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
that's a massive massive claim to make

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.550 
that's a massive massive claim to make
and<00:03:35.760> yeah<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:37.060> think<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:38.080> fact<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.380> the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
and yeah I think the fact that the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.740 
and yeah I think the fact that the
grizzly<00:03:38.830> river<00:03:38.980> does<00:03:39.280> has<00:03:39.700> proc<00:03:40.120> his<00:03:40.330> ability

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
grizzly river does has proc his ability

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.390 
grizzly river does has proc his ability
hits<00:03:40.960> or<00:03:41.110> lessons<00:03:41.530> for<00:03:41.740> amazed<00:03:41.980> i<00:03:42.130> think<00:03:42.310> that

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
hits or lessons for amazed i think that

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.710 
hits or lessons for amazed i think that
is<00:03:42.520> always<00:03:42.700> going<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.090> mean<00:03:43.270> this<00:03:43.450> for<00:03:43.630> a

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
is always going to mean this for a

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.590 
is always going to mean this for a
minute<00:03:43.840> better<00:03:44.230> but<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:45.760> it's<00:03:46.300> something

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
minute better but it's it's something

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
winning it because getting the shards is

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.930 
winning it because getting the shards is
the<00:04:02.710> main<00:04:02.890> reason<00:04:03.190> why<00:04:03.310> i<00:04:03.340> do<00:04:03.460> it<00:04:03.580> i<00:04:03.730> mean<00:04:03.880> i
