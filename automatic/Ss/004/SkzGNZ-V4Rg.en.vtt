00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.249 
okay just a little video here this is a
strange<00:00:04.350> concoction<00:00:05.279> that<00:00:05.310> we<00:00:05.640> had<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.270> our

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
strange concoction that we had in our

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.089 
strange concoction that we had in our
7/3<00:00:08.010> diesel<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:09.510> mixture<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.260> gasoline<00:00:10.769> and

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
7/3 diesel a mixture of gasoline and

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.850 
7/3 diesel a mixture of gasoline and
diesel<00:00:11.280> fuel<00:00:11.750> what<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.780> did<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.259> put<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> little

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
diesel fuel what I did is I put a little

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.900 
diesel fuel what I did is I put a little
bit<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.900> little<00:00:15.900> dish<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.760> here<00:00:17.760> we

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
bit here in this little dish and here we

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.650 
bit here in this little dish and here we
have<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:19.699> gold<00:00:20.699> plug<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.270> believe<00:00:21.510> this

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
have a gold plug that I believe this

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.019 
have a gold plug that I believe this
gold<00:00:21.960> plug<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> actually<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> 6-point

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
gold plug is actually for a 6-point

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.089 
gold plug is actually for a 6-point
holdy<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:25.920> demonstration

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
holdy so but just a little demonstration

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.320 
holdy so but just a little demonstration
here<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:29.160> why<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.490> never<00:00:29.849> want<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> use

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
here of why you never want to use

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.410 
here of why you never want to use
starter<00:00:30.810> fluid<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.579> a<00:00:32.579> diesel<00:00:33.059> engine<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
starter fluid and a diesel engine that

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.060 
starter fluid and a diesel engine that
has<00:00:33.690> glow<00:00:33.960> plugs<00:00:34.320> well<00:00:36.380> we've<00:00:37.380> got<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> battery

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
has glow plugs well we've got a battery

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.340 
has glow plugs well we've got a battery
jump<00:00:38.790> box<00:00:39.000> connected<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:39.989> could<00:00:40.110> see

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
jump box connected to it we could see

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.020 
jump box connected to it we could see
the<00:00:40.640> end<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> glow<00:00:42.329> plug<00:00:42.660> starting<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
the end of the glow plug starting to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.910 
the end of the glow plug starting to
turn<00:00:45.030> bright<00:00:45.360> orange<00:00:45.750> already<00:00:46.050> don't<00:00:46.680> take

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
turn bright orange already don't take

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.119 
turn bright orange already don't take
very<00:00:47.219> long<00:00:47.870> very<00:00:48.870> low<00:00:49.110> resistance<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.980> these

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
very long very low resistance in these

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.420 
very long very low resistance in these
so<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:50.520> heat<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.789> pretty<00:00:51.180> quick<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.710> answer

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
so they heat up pretty quick and answer

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
so they heat up pretty quick and answer
a<00:00:53.460> question<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.180> whether<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.140> for

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a question about whether or not this for

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
a question about whether or not this for
the<00:00:55.440> flammable<00:00:55.949> substance<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:59.480> she's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the flammable substance or not she's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
the flammable substance or not she's
starting<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> boil<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.440> cooling<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
starting to boil but cooling down it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
starting to boil but cooling down it
they<00:01:03.300> went<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> flame<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> few<00:01:04.260> times<00:01:04.500> before

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
they went to flame a few times before

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.719 
they went to flame a few times before
we'll<00:01:05.040> try<00:01:05.220> eating<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.820> again<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:07.729> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
we'll try eating this up again here that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.429 
we'll try eating this up again here that
are<00:01:08.850> good<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.180> hot<00:01:11.299> yeah<00:01:12.360> oh<00:01:12.810> she's<00:01:13.170> glowing

are good and hot yeah oh she's glowing
orange<00:01:16.549> now<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.880> guess<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.720> want<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
orange now I guess you don't want to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
orange now I guess you don't want to
blow<00:01:19.229> she<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> burn<00:01:20.520> before<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
blow she don't want to burn before it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
blow she don't want to burn before it
actually<00:01:21.299> did<00:01:21.689> throw<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> flame<00:01:22.259> she<00:01:22.560> might

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
actually did throw a flame she might

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.660 
actually did throw a flame she might
have<00:01:23.340> broke<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:25.189> Coliseum's<00:01:26.189> off<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
have broke all the Coliseum's off the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.740 
have broke all the Coliseum's off the
diesel<00:01:28.460> I'll<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.610> try<00:01:29.909> adding<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.450> more

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
diesel I'll just try adding little more

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.010 
diesel I'll just try adding little more
to<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:32.960> little<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:34.049> fuel<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.100> there

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
to it here a little more fuel in there

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.679 
to it here a little more fuel in there
the<00:01:37.020> fumes<00:01:38.000> gasoline<00:01:39.000> doesn't<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.479> burn

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the fumes gasoline doesn't really burn

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.980 
the fumes gasoline doesn't really burn
but<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.950> fumes<00:01:41.280> will<00:01:41.520> burn

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
but the the fumes will burn

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.770 
but the the fumes will burn
oh<00:01:44.899> I<00:01:46.009> guess<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.159> don't<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.630> clean<00:01:48.630> him

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
oh I guess you don't want to clean him

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.810 
oh I guess you don't want to clean him
up<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.380> did<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.979> flame<00:01:50.250> coming<00:01:50.549> out<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
up now I did have a flame coming out of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.429 
up now I did have a flame coming out of
there<00:01:50.909> before<00:01:51.270> when<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.479> touched<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.990> maybe<00:01:52.290> I'm

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
there before when I touched it maybe I'm

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.100 
there before when I touched it maybe I'm
just<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.710> getting<00:01:53.040> hot<00:01:53.340> enough<00:01:53.810> but<00:01:54.810> anyways

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
just not getting hot enough but anyways

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.539 
just not getting hot enough but anyways
you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.530> how<00:01:55.700> red-hot<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:58.250> glow<00:01:59.250> plug

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you can see how red-hot a a glow plug

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.109 
you can see how red-hot a a glow plug
will<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.990> she's<00:02:00.990> burning<00:02:01.289> an<00:02:01.409> orange<00:02:01.710> here

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.540 

yeah<00:02:06.119> she<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.659> boils<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> guess<00:02:08.399> that's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
yeah she just boils so I guess that's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.279 
yeah she just boils so I guess that's
why<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:08.970> didn't<00:02:09.209> wreck<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> engine<00:02:09.869> she's<00:02:10.080> not

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
why we didn't wreck the engine she's not

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.160 
why we didn't wreck the engine she's not
quite<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.769> flammable<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.780> they<00:02:12.780> thought<00:02:13.019> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
quite as flammable as they thought it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.240 
quite as flammable as they thought it
was<00:02:13.349> out<00:02:14.069> there<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.519> go<00:02:15.590> yeah<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:16.830> had<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> flame
