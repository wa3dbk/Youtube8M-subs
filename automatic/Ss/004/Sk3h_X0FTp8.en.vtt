00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
drive and the main reason for that is

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.840 
drive and the main reason for that is
because<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> steering<00:02:10.380> feels<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.550> bit

the small window and sloping roof does
make<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.260> feel<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.620> little<00:02:46.860> bit<00:02:47.070> more

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
make it feel a little bit more

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.400 
make it feel a little bit more
claustrophobic<00:02:48.120> than<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.660> golf<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.200> that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
claustrophobic than a golf and that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.620 
claustrophobic than a golf and that
brings<00:02:49.650> me<00:02:49.799> on<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.519> Astra's<00:02:50.850> main<00:02:51.180> problem

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
brings me on to the Astra's main problem

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.880 
brings me on to the Astra's main problem
and<00:02:51.750> that's<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.989> fact<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:52.680> more

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
and that's the fact that it's more

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.860 
and that's the fact that it's more
expensive<00:02:53.190> than<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> VW<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.390> will
