00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.710
 can be guided in the presence of new 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.770
 rollers if so here scroll here 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.199
 and say even more lines they will go 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.800
 in chronological bull chronological 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.460
 order from most recent downloads to 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.199
 the very first possible way 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.830
 track movie sequence 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:28.380
 now boot 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.500
 That means this playlist has opened 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.919
 this playlist from google is more here 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.349
 can all the video liked this about and from 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.780
 youtube this is not us created it is on 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.919
 each download channel is called and here 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.560
 see chronological 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.750
 the most recent and 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.889
 went we went we went to the beginning at the beginning 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.930
 can open open up 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.060
 infinity so I understand but the most 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.539
 first zeros so you can trace 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.849
 order downloads clips and a little bit 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.800
 be guided I we do not call videos 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.110
 on us the project was asked by one of 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.789
 subscribers name videos by dates 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.340
 call us on topics 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.370
 so it makes no sense to me recipes 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.009
 Well, a series called such a recipe 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.819
 everyone looks at the topics that him 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.800
 interesting so give no date you can 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:21.449
 track either so either if this 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.090
 our trips for example i will already 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.009
 end 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.560
 then found trouble here for example different 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.949
 life is completely different here together 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.949
 have a rest 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.160
 here you can see the sequence 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.490
 there is this latest video to 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.710

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.350
 fishing when you go to the video you can see 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.270
 when he was shot 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:58.450
 when it was uploaded we indicate 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:07:04.280
 here date 2014 video has been uploaded 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:06.590

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.660
 finish I want to say more literally in 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.840
 in short, what are we planning 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:16.960
 rather, I plan to create a new channel 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:19.310
 for our girlfriend and I will shoot a video 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.479
 consistently how to create a channel like 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.250

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.100
 for those who are not very good at 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.870
 such programs 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.510

 beautiful how to break it into such columns 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.229
 so that you can navigate it 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.830
 that everything was sort of decomposed according to 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:43.520
 shelves 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.229
