produce a breathtaking tale as it

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.080 
produce a breathtaking tale as it

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.220

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
so if ison breaks up do we have to worry

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.580 
so if ison breaks up do we have to worry
about<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.739> pieces<00:03:28.159> hitting<00:03:28.430> us<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:30.200> answer

about the pieces hitting us the answer

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.490 
about the pieces hitting us the answer
