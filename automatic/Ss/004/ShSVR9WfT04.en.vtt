00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.039
 a truck 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:16.390
 a classic gent amy intense franchise 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:49.560
 and there from the exciting clubhouse 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:49.560
 will be great here too 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.050
 nice nice place 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.829
 well that is now fine menu of a 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:01.540
 would namely the fries and that is 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:16.510
 I did not think it would be that good 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:16.510
 tastes so easy salty super 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.400
 I somehow only had a side dish 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.220
 So you wet something for everyone 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.580
 try but everything goes well without it 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.840
 great that have also this church 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.840
 monastery are already fries ground 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.890
 improve to cut up 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.070
 Information gain somehow zero 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.760
 yes I only know this microwave fries 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.110
 and they are great if you have one left 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.740
 other german product knows then 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.410
 let us know 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.790
 this is really no comparison 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:19.410
 is no comparison to the oven comes 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:24.130
 Oven pommes are like that 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:26.680
 sticky and compromised and their 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:32.340
 are not like the fries from the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:35.770
 fries but so crispy fresh 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.370
 Potato are moderately different though 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:43.300
 still good against the oven commission 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:51.760
 So a demolition is a bit 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:53.500
 also a emergency solution and that is at all 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.390
 no case a emergency solution is great 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.440
 delicious 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.700
 Well what does this want to eat my 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.210
 favorite sausage would have or so does 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.210

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.900

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.840

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.430

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.430
