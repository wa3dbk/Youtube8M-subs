00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:15.440
 it's gone between the two players have 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.440
 not go home said I leave it 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:42.649
 now she will not be very large 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:42.649
 pole he will see that it is unplayable 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:01:07.500
 this step is not just for you 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:10.910
 put a cousin always 0 0 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.620
 as and that half by carbon 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:23.010
 I call yacco and still end and 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:25.850
 even so that's where in the name of 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.850
 visas coming out of this body 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.729
 of 1 go that puts his first kill 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:51.380
 oh oh there there but it's the station 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:02:07.330
 really time I think I think 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:07.330
 that you are the holberg 4-1 his trash talk 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:21.459
 she's so strong actually is 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.459
 only 2 always to the carbon advantage 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.190
 I'll just call back 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.209
 little break if you ever want 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.510
 to ask questions to the players and 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.650
 cetera do not hesitate but yes 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.489
 Well, still happy with these you expected 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.830
 to make it a tube just after 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.180
 will take a short break and will follow 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.019
 showmatch vitality versus vitality for 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.340
 the first time since it's 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.160
 historical it has never been done since 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.750
 the dirt there was scream but here 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.040
 there was no official unemployment therefore 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.180
 very slightly in favor of rise &amp; roll 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.010
 remember that this time they are not 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.760
 accompanied by rates but we will say 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.760
 they leave with a disability 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.329
 they leave with a disability and try 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.329
 already to win crooked she 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.280
 or 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.480
 oh yes it's true and an objective is 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.180
 to put at least as much as lou 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.180
 time and I think so 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:50.620
 always 6 5 carbon benefits 7 5 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:53.849
 the gap that is widening he has co who is going 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.849
 still win the cap 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:10.379
 no, it'll come back after that will play 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:10.379
 better like that it seems complicated to me 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.430
 did so bad 8 6 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:43.080
 fo that come damage 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.460
 8This always has the advantage of carbon 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.300
 there are 5 minutes 30 left in the game 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.240
 there was a duel in a few 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.840
 seconds again reconnect with his 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.840

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.460
 9 7 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.540
 two points difference between the two 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.320
 players for the moment always a 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.320
 carbon advantage 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.550
 but we will link right after again 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:49.059

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.390
 coast will have at least won a cap 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.290
 he remains focused not joke and I 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.420

 start to become go 12 8 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.920
