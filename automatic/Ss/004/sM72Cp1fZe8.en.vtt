00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.199
 there is is from the mobile company and 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.839
 It's just and lemon made for the iphone 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.790
 5 ultra thin power and protection 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.149
 gentlemen made for what is the iphone 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.489
 this and offers us an extra 80 percent 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.229
 of what is this our phone already 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.839
 full then we're almost having the 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.000
 double capacity this 80 percent 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.869

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.789
 from standby mode it 's super thin 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.520
 at the same time it says it's loaded by 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.530
 middle of the usb cable and it brings us what 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.720
 is a indicator of how much lights 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.179
 battery is that we have gentlemen then 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.890
 let's proceed to open it let's see 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.560
 this and what do we get this 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.509
 product I'm going to say it honestly 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.270
 I think this one of the things or one of 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.280
 the covers forgiveness that are most useful in 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.170
 what is for our iphone since there are 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.730
 covers signs that are costing 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.470
 approximately 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.030
 in dollars is the average of what 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.310
 they are costing the covers now west 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.160
 for the price of 80 dollars offers us 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.620
 super thin protection and extra battery 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.690
 I think it's one of the best options 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.100
 that we can now have what it is to the 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.800
 time to have a case here brings us what 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.720
 which is a small brochure about how 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.490
 use the instructions that they do not 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.800

 can see here brings us what is this 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.120
 small adapter which allows us to 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.830
 to be able to disconnect what are our 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.840
 hearing aids I imagine it 's the gap 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.160
 down where the hearing aids go is more 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.400
 background of the normals then we 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.860
 they offer this extra adapter and they come already 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.750
 plastic on the outside we're going to 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.340
 put all this aside we will install 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.709
 the cover 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.540
 is totally plastic the part of 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.750
 drum rooms this is almost to 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.090

 which we can turn on and off gentlemen 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.590
 as you can see here it turns green it does not 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.120
 if it looks good and here it turns red 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.129
 when it's red it's just that 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.780
 we are blocking that our 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.510
 phone is carrying in itself that as 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.459

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.780
 how much do we have of battery in the part of 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.250
 down here is also what it is where it goes 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.040
 to go connected what is this case 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.319

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.980
 by one for what is the microphone and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.780
 another one for what are the speakers to the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.250
 time we're talking gentlemen what 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.269
 that we are using what is ours 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.519

 bottom part that comes out we proceed to 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.890
 put what is the cover itself which 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.140
 It's a slip-style case 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.060
 for all those who watch my videos 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.709
 for several time already more or less 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.300
 are familiar with what it is that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.100
 means a slip-style case 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.490
 we proceed to put what the part of 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.860
 look here, bring what is 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.250
 is connected gentlemen look in the part 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.200
 below identical to what is the cable d 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.300
 this to load what is our 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.900
 iphone as it is at the time of loading 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.380
 what we are going to use is a usb cable 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.380
 then we will proceed 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.319
 put what is the cover and look put 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.420
 as follows in the part of 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:06.470
 down until you make your respective click 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:11.090
 and there you can have heard and how 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.100
 70 almost 50% of double what is the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.960
 thickness of the phone if you do 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.579
 logically a little longer as 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.829
 can see now is about 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.290
 good in itself this is the longest thing that 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.820
 has made the phone the weight this if 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.380
 I grab a little bit of weight but it's not 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.300
 nothing of the other world gentlemen the truth 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.520
 that feels very good to the touch as 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.600
 you can see this the back look 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.610
 back in what is the gap for what 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.070
 is the camera the flash and also for what 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.600
 what is the microphone comes this part of 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.010
 here totally in black which 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.560
 will help us when we take 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.650
 photos with the flash will not allow 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.440
 the photos come out distorted or with a 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.030
 glow when doing a bad effect 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.220
 when we take the picture with what is the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.840
 flash in the top a hole 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.240
 for what is the home button the 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.910
 truth that is very accessible look at what 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.380
 we can easily access gentlemen and in 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.570
 the bottom as you can see bring 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.890
 what are these hollow to hear and to 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.020
 to be able to speak at the time of being using 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.400
 our phone when the network said what 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.500
 from the hole below look nothing more 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.540
 gentlemen is a bit deep then it is 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.420
 that's why they provide us with this 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.030
 which is this an adapter which 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.260
 we will put it this way and connect and 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.060
 here we can connect already what they are 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.010
 our hearing aid I think this would be a 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.840
 bad thing I do not like this in itself gentlemen 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.450
 I would like the idea of ​​power 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.040
 connect my hearing aids directly here 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.240
 without needing to be putting a 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.590
 extra adapter 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.600
 the problem of sir is that with the 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.250
 iphone 4 the iphone 4s got us the 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.350
 We connect the hearing aids in the part of 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.270
 above are why previous covers 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.220
 previous versions of this company do not 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.960
 it brought what was this adapter 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.830
 otherwise gentlemen is excellent look 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.970

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.010
 the back 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.340
 and automatically puts to load what 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.110
