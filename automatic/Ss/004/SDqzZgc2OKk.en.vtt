00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
turning I might need to put a stopper on

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.209 
turning I might need to put a stopper on
there<00:00:35.250> because<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:39.780> hit<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:43.190> need<00:00:44.190> oh

tape<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.530> i<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.039> i<00:00:53.129> might<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.329> bicycle

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
tape and i think i might get a bicycle

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.340 
tape and i think i might get a bicycle
lever<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.160> use<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> total<00:00:57.660> how

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
lever and use that for the total how

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.240 
lever and use that for the total how
much<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:59.250> i<00:01:00.440> might<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.680> pedals<00:01:02.039> i'm<00:01:02.129> not

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
much put i might just do pedals i'm not

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.750 
much put i might just do pedals i'm not
really<00:01:02.370> sure<00:01:02.489> yet<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:04.199> brakes<00:01:04.470> i'll<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.890> after

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
really sure yet the brakes i'll do after

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
really sure yet the brakes i'll do after
have<00:01:05.880> my<00:01:06.030> first<00:01:06.270> ride<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.780> didn't<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.619> my<00:01:07.650> halo

writer<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.880> backyard<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.390> an<00:01:09.510> amazing

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
writer and backyard and an amazing

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.450 
writer and backyard and an amazing
breaks<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:10.920> they'll<00:01:11.100> take<00:01:11.310> quite

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
breaks for it because they'll take quite

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.310 
breaks for it because they'll take quite
a<00:01:11.520> while<00:01:11.659> I'm<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.140> some

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
a while I'm just going to make some

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
a while I'm just going to make some
scrub<00:01:13.619> breaks<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.189> when<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> press<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> pedal

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
scrub breaks so when you press the pedal

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.330 
scrub breaks so when you press the pedal
it<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.610> pushes<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:18.530> little<00:01:19.530> metal<00:01:19.799> thing<00:01:19.979> like

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it just pushes a little metal thing like

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.140 
it just pushes a little metal thing like
this<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.880> example<00:01:22.430> when<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> break<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.820> just

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
this for example when you break it just

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.590 
this for example when you break it just
pushes<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.680> wheel<00:01:26.180> okay<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:27.420> not

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
pushes it down the wheel okay that's not

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.030 
pushes it down the wheel okay that's not
that<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> I'll<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.290> later<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:33.619> what<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> am

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that so I'll do that later on what I am

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.789 
that so I'll do that later on what I am
going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> seat<00:01:36.650> mounted<00:01:37.650> engine

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
going to do for the seat mounted engine

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
that it's a little bit bigger than the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.660 
that it's a little bit bigger than the
motor<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.560> I'm<00:03:26.889> going<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.130> raise<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.489> up<00:03:27.549> a

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
motor so I'm going to raise it up a

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.809 
motor so I'm going to raise it up a
little<00:03:27.819> bit<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.980> then<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:32.380> seat<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:33.700> know

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
little bit and then the seat you know

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.509 
little bit and then the seat you know
just<00:03:34.090> open<00:03:34.569> it<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.900> UM<00:03:35.250> started<00:03:36.250> up<00:03:36.340> you'll<00:03:36.489> be

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
just open it to UM started up you'll be

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.920 
just open it to UM started up you'll be
about<00:03:36.790> there<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:38.310> just<00:03:39.310> start<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.670> up<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:40.120> just

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
about there so just start it up I just

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.270 
about there so just start it up I just
have<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.139> take<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.440> lid<00:03:41.560> off<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.859> then<00:03:42.100> once

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
have to take the lid off and then once

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.720 
have to take the lid off and then once
it<00:03:42.430> started<00:03:42.760> up<00:03:42.880> with<00:03:43.000> lid<00:03:43.209> back<00:03:43.329> on<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.730> then

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
it started up with lid back on and then

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.690 
it started up with lid back on and then
I'll<00:03:46.569> make<00:03:46.750> little<00:03:47.190> cowlings<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.459> side

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
I'll make little cowlings on the side

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.800 
I'll make little cowlings on the side
for<00:03:49.480> airflow<00:03:49.840> for<00:03:50.139> the<00:03:50.230> engine<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:51.630> then<00:03:52.630> off

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
for airflow for the engine and then off

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.140 
for airflow for the engine and then off
the<00:03:52.989> side<00:03:53.200> I'll<00:03:53.380> cut<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.620> hole<00:03:53.859> here<00:03:54.160> for<00:03:54.940> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
the side I'll cut a hole here for the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.530 
the side I'll cut a hole here for the
chain<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.450> then<00:03:55.870> make<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.910> chain<00:03:57.910> guard<00:03:58.150> around

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
chain and then make a chain guard around

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.319 
chain and then make a chain guard around
it<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:59.709> it'll<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.730> currently<00:04:01.060> see<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
it so it'll be you currently see the

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.460 
it so it'll be you currently see the
motor<00:04:01.510> sort<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.930> thing<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:03.930> then<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.170> exhaust

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
motor sort of thing and then the exhaust

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.289 
motor sort of thing and then the exhaust
pipe<00:04:05.560> will<00:04:05.859> pop<00:04:06.340> out<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.549> back<00:04:06.819> here<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:09.299> what

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
pipe will pop out the back here and what

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.680 
pipe will pop out the back here and what
else<00:04:10.500> about<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.769> so<00:04:12.250> I'll<00:04:13.090> just<00:04:13.150> take<00:04:13.540> the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
else about it so I'll just take the

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.270 
else about it so I'll just take the
engine<00:04:13.930> off<00:04:14.109> and<00:04:14.260> then<00:04:14.470> put<00:04:14.590> s<00:04:14.739> key<00:04:14.920> there<00:04:15.069> and

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
engine off and then put s key there and

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.120 
engine off and then put s key there and
show<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.940> what's<00:04:16.090> going<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.329> cloak

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
show you so that what's going to cloak

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
show you so that what's going to cloak
so<00:04:18.130> this<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:18.400> sort<00:04:18.609> of<00:04:18.669> what<00:04:18.849> it<00:04:18.940> would<00:04:19.030> look

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
so this is sort of what it would look

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.839 
so this is sort of what it would look
like<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.560> looks<00:04:20.590> pretty<00:04:20.769> cool<00:04:20.919> um<00:04:21.370> I'll

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:27.900 
like so it looks pretty cool um I'll
just<00:04:21.910> take<00:04:22.180> this<00:04:22.300> off<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.810> arm<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:27.700> will<00:04:27.789> be

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
just take this off so arm it will be

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.320 
just take this off so arm it will be
centered<00:04:28.360> more<00:04:28.680> but<00:04:29.680> yeah

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
centered more but yeah

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:41.339 
centered more but yeah
okay<00:04:32.319> it's<00:04:33.189> pretty<00:04:33.370> cold<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:40.139> don't<00:04:41.139> know<00:04:41.259> if
