 the netherlands also won the second race after the champions trophy after 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.670
 the 3 0 victory of Saturday are again it was Sunday Germany with two in 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.550
 defeated turned orange 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.570
 carlijn welten opened the score after 25 seconds but it becomes easy on the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 Wife was in the future not sure for sure it was a tough delivery 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.140
 yes it is true and the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.150
 yes we had not really been in school as she started the game yesterday but yes 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.590
 fantastic yes 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.130
 and that is to dramatize this and how to start your game against west ham 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.160
 but yes we have and don't rush it right after that one draw 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.520
 off 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.150
 brilliant goal from kim 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.990
 but we did not really have a check against it and remains boss the boss 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.530
 know the boss axes and actually have to do it because there are simply the best 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.110
 the food from the first few minutes realizes that it is very good there we were not 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.400
 play a central role 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.150
 but that is really wonderful that really not to be believed then this is what I say it is me 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.360
 just can't be that way is the atmosphere and the people public 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.060
 yes that is so then you are just immensely happy 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.650
 for good times it is her fourth tournament with orange but she has never played before 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.000
 do you know in your own country 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.590
 it will enjoy it is really very beautiful 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.930
 I think he could not have wished for a better site and the Republic itself is present 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 in the atmosphere and all the kids everyone is happy that it delivers fantastic mixed 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.400
 really fantastic 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.270
 then the question is still a bit 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.170
 how good is this orange actually 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.090
 after they have good question i think he is capable of great things being there 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.230
 new team they have to build and 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.800
 traffic to school play well and the and that is just the beginning so I know 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.120
 sure we 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.650
 could be even better 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.150
 Monday there is a rest day when he jumps and so does 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.670
 Dutch 10 a day 4 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.250
 Germany Certainly now you have two tough games here that mark areas 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.310
 where to be 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.149
 for the competition much harder you always have a day back plc 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.479
 reports irritates it is good for the four of us and evert principal 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.600
 a day of rest 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.429
 and that is really relaxing 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.880
 we had always been wise to denounce it 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.170
 remains first also largely put back a bit with which I was too 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.979
 I actually hope to go into the work field for a little while 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.839
 Enjoy Nieuwenhoven Aquilani I know I really enjoy every player is really one 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:16.959
