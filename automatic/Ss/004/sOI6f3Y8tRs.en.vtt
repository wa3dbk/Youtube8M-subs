double<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.750> squats<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.260> didn't<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.650> like

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
double on squats I didn't really like

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.310 
double on squats I didn't really like
the<00:01:14.610> depth<00:01:15.000> i<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.420> i<00:01:15.509> could<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.869> gone

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the depth i think i could have gone

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.649 
the depth i think i could have gone
deeper<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> i<00:01:17.430> think<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> i<00:01:17.880> hesitated<00:01:18.479> in

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
deeper and i think that i hesitated in

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.899 
deeper and i think that i hesitated in
the<00:01:18.720> second<00:01:19.170> rep<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.770> frustrated<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the second rep and it frustrated me to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.749 
the second rep and it frustrated me to
no<00:01:21.030> end<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.590> i<00:01:22.619> had<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.490> solid

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
no end and then i had a pretty solid

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
no end and then i had a pretty solid
session<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.509> Thursday<00:01:25.049> where<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> felt<00:01:25.650> very

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
session on Thursday where I felt very

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.380 
session on Thursday where I felt very
happy<00:01:26.009> with<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> deadlifts<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:26.970> everything

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
happy with the deadlifts and everything

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.660 
happy with the deadlifts and everything

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
is going well and so I told myself going

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
is going well and so I told myself going
into<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.119> second<00:01:30.780> squat<00:01:31.049> workout<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
into this second squat workout of the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.240 
into this second squat workout of the
week<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.130> want<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:33.680> at<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.040> top

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
week you know I want to go at that top

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.890 
week you know I want to go at that top
set<00:01:35.490> again<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> squats<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.509> think<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
set again from the squats I think that I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.440 
set again from the squats I think that I
can<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.380> i<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> i<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.450> even

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
can do it better i think that i can even

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
can do it better i think that i can even
put<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:39.900> more<00:01:40.020> weight<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> i've<00:01:41.670> done

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
put some more weight on it and i've done

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.050 
put some more weight on it and i've done
the<00:01:42.150> work<00:01:42.299> where<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.840> should<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.200> able<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
the work where I should be able to and I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.920 
the work where I should be able to and I
figured<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.420> would<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.750> good<00:01:45.869> opportunity

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
figured this would be a good opportunity

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.889 
figured this would be a good opportunity
for<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:48.000> volume<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> week

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
for it because the volume for the week

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.410 
for it because the volume for the week
was<00:01:49.200> down<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.950> bit<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.970> was<00:01:51.149> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
was down a bit because this was I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.539 
was down a bit because this was I
dropped<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.250> let<00:01:53.399> my

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
dropped some of that to kind of let my

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.179 
dropped some of that to kind of let my
body<00:01:53.700> catch<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> fatigue<00:01:55.189> deficit

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
body catch up on the fatigue deficit

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.280 
body catch up on the fatigue deficit
that<00:01:56.310> I've<00:01:56.460> created<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.420> instead<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that I've created and so instead of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.830 
that I've created and so instead of
doing<00:01:58.439> 595<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> double<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.759> put<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.030> 600<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
doing 595 for a double I put on 600 and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.090 
doing 595 for a double I put on 600 and
the<00:02:01.380> first<00:02:01.619> set<00:02:01.890> went<00:02:02.100> pretty<00:02:02.310> well<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.689> was

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
the first set went pretty well and I was

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.760 
the first set went pretty well and I was
much<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.460> pleased<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> set<00:02:07.380> then<00:02:07.740> I

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
much more pleased with that set then I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.990 
much more pleased with that set then I
had<00:02:08.129> been

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
had been

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
for a second and really kind of claim

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.750 
for a second and really kind of claim
ownership<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.560> weight<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.130> feel<00:02:17.370> really

confident<00:02:18.180> with<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.870> went<00:02:22.320> well<00:02:22.800> also

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
confident with it and it went well also

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.090

the<00:02:24.420> first<00:02:24.660> rep<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.050> was<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.440> happy<00:02:25.620> with<00:02:25.890> I

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
the first rep I was really happy with I

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.880 
the first rep I was really happy with I
thought<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.400> was<00:02:26.490> solid<00:02:27.230> bar<00:02:28.230> speed<00:02:28.590> wasn't

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
thought it was solid bar speed wasn't

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.100 
thought it was solid bar speed wasn't
anything<00:02:29.490> crazy<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.330> at<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> same<00:02:30.690> time<00:02:30.900> this

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
anything crazy but at the same time this

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.540 
anything crazy but at the same time this
is<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.860> most<00:02:31.890> weight<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.459> I've

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
is really the most weight that I've

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.370 
is really the most weight that I've
handled<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.330> very<00:02:33.540> long<00:02:33.750> time<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.110> it's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
handled in a very long time and it's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.510 
handled in a very long time and it's
definitely<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.950> most<00:02:35.070> weight<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.459> I've

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
definitely the most weight that I've

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.449 
definitely the most weight that I've
handled<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:35.970> my<00:02:36.090> garage<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.590> second<00:02:38.010> rep<00:02:38.190> I

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
months ago when I ended up bending the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.970 
months ago when I ended up bending the
bar<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.370> here<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.989> miss<00:02:58.290> grooved<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.680> my<00:02:58.800> neck

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980

with<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> much<00:02:59.430> lighter<00:02:59.640> weight<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.300> wasn't

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
with a much lighter weight and I wasn't

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.810 
with a much lighter weight and I wasn't
able<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.140> save<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.830> dumped<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.430> over<00:03:02.520> my

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
able to save it so I dumped it over my

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.870 
able to save it so I dumped it over my
head<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:04.020> meant<00:03:04.320> my<00:03:04.500> Texas<00:03:04.950> bar<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.640> it

two<00:03:09.000> or<00:03:09.150> three<00:03:09.180> months<00:03:09.660> before<00:03:10.080> getting<00:03:10.739> this

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
two or three months before getting this

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.150 
two or three months before getting this
new<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.530> every<00:03:13.950> time<00:03:13.980> I

squatted<00:03:14.730> with<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.180> served<00:03:15.390> as<00:03:15.600> a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
squatted with that it served as a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.690 
squatted with that it served as a
reminder<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:16.519> making<00:03:17.519> sure<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:19.080> are

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
ego and it was really kind of refreshing

ego and it was really kind of refreshing
to<00:03:25.519> get<00:03:26.519> through<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:27.090> same<00:03:27.480> issue<00:03:27.900> and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
to get through that same issue and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.190 
to get through that same issue and
realize<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.480> work<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.930> I've<00:03:31.019> been

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
realize that the work that I've been

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.460 
realize that the work that I've been
putting<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.650> really<00:03:32.040> has<00:03:32.280> manifested<00:03:32.790> into

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
putting in really has manifested into

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.350 
putting in really has manifested into
progress<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.920> it's<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.370> an<00:03:35.640> exciting<00:03:36.000> thing

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
progress and it's just an exciting thing

to<00:03:36.390> see<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.019> kind<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.530> an<00:03:37.620> interesting<00:03:37.829> way<00:03:38.340> to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
to see and kind of an interesting way to

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.800 
to see and kind of an interesting way to
look<00:03:38.519> at<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.850> but<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.209> appreciated<00:03:40.110> more<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
look at it but I appreciated more the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.900 
look at it but I appreciated more the
fact<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.799> was<00:03:44.010> able<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.430> grind<00:03:44.610> through

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
fact that I was able to grind through

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.940 
fact that I was able to grind through
that<00:03:45.090> rep<00:03:45.299> because<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.200> history<00:03:46.530> kind<00:03:46.829> of

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
that rep because of the history kind of

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.740 
that rep because of the history kind of
associated<00:03:47.670> with<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.970> same<00:03:48.269> issue<00:03:50.750> moving

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
associated with that same issue moving

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.259 
associated with that same issue moving
on<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.019> bench<00:03:52.230> press<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.920> decided<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.970> keep

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
on to the bench press I decided to keep

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.030 
on to the bench press I decided to keep
my<00:03:54.450> singlet<00:03:54.720> on<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.079> I<00:03:55.140> can<00:03:55.320> make<00:03:55.500> sure<00:03:55.530> my<00:03:55.829> butt

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
my singlet on so I can make sure my butt

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.949 
my singlet on so I can make sure my butt
wasn't<00:03:56.370> lifting<00:03:56.489> sometimes<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.480> sweatpants

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
wasn't lifting sometimes the sweatpants

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.900 
wasn't lifting sometimes the sweatpants
have<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.260> tendency<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.709> hide<00:03:59.040> little<00:03:59.489> details

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
have a tendency to hide little details

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.949 
have a tendency to hide little details
like<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.510> think<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:00.810> really

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
like that and I think it's really

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.870 
like that and I think it's really
important<00:04:01.530> as<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.920> meat<00:04:02.070> approaches<00:04:02.579> that<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
important as the meat approaches that I

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.750 
important as the meat approaches that I
am<00:04:03.030> more<00:04:04.040> holding<00:04:05.040> myself<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> higher

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
am more holding myself to a higher

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.789 
am more holding myself to a higher
standard<00:04:06.150> when<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.510> comes<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.870> all<00:04:07.019> these<00:04:07.200> so

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
standard when it comes to all these so

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.350 
standard when it comes to all these so
that<00:04:08.190> when<00:04:08.459> i<00:04:08.489> get<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.910> meat<00:04:09.060> i<00:04:09.090> feel<00:04:09.329> very

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
that when i get to the meat i feel very

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.990 
that when i get to the meat i feel very
confident<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.350> very<00:04:10.440> comfortable<00:04:10.799> in<00:04:11.489> all

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
confident and very comfortable in all

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.789 
confident and very comfortable in all
those<00:04:12.180> attempt<00:04:12.480> settings<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.530> cool<00:04:13.769> thing

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
those attempt settings the cool thing

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.460 
those attempt settings the cool thing
about<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.340> session<00:04:14.790> is

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
about this session is

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.500 
about this session is
but<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.800> was<00:04:16.760> hitting<00:04:16.940> weights<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.450> are

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
but I was hitting weights that are

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.550 
but I was hitting weights that are
definitely<00:04:17.720> higher<00:04:18.170> than<00:04:18.410> my<00:04:18.530> openers<00:04:18.980> for

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
definitely higher than my openers for

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.130 
definitely higher than my openers for
the<00:04:21.560> majority<00:04:21.920> of<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.720> work<00:04:23.900> i'm

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
the majority of the of the work i'm

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.780 
the majority of the of the work i'm
planning<00:04:24.500> on<00:04:24.560> opening<00:04:24.740> my<00:04:25.130> bench<00:04:25.340> with<00:04:25.550> around

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
planning on opening my bench with around

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.140 
planning on opening my bench with around
355<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:26.810> hit<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> 370<00:04:27.680> which<00:04:27.830> is<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.250> my<00:04:28.940> mind

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
355 and I hit a 370 which is in my mind

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.360 
355 and I hit a 370 which is in my mind
right<00:04:29.480> now<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.690> conservative<00:04:30.680> second<00:04:31.100> if<00:04:31.220> my

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
right now a conservative second if my

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.280 
right now a conservative second if my
opener<00:04:31.760> feels<00:04:32.090> awful<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.960> day<00:04:33.080> if

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
opener feels awful on the day if

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.770 
opener feels awful on the day if
something<00:04:34.130> terrible<00:04:34.490> happens<00:04:34.760> moving<00:04:35.480> on<00:04:35.600> to

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
something terrible happens moving on to

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.500 
something terrible happens moving on to
the<00:04:35.810> meat<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.860> could<00:04:37.460> take<00:04:37.640> that<00:04:37.850> through<00:04:38.030> 70

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
the meat I could take that through 70

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.240 
the meat I could take that through 70
and<00:04:38.660> say<00:04:38.780> all<00:04:38.930> right<00:04:38.960> this<00:04:39.230> isn't<00:04:39.410> near<00:04:39.980> what<00:04:40.220> I

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
and say all right this isn't near what I

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.640 
and say all right this isn't near what I
was<00:04:40.490> hoping<00:04:40.640> for<00:04:40.850> but<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:42.080> still<00:04:42.440> feel

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
was hoping for but I still feel

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.980 
was hoping for but I still feel
confident<00:04:43.040> that<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.700> could<00:04:43.820> go<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.480> 600

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
confident that it could go and the 600

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.290 
confident that it could go and the 600
squat<00:04:45.320> is<00:04:45.560> somewhere<00:04:46.190> in<00:04:46.370> between<00:04:46.520> my<00:04:46.880> opener

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
squat is somewhere in between my opener

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.450 
squat is somewhere in between my opener
and<00:04:47.510> my<00:04:47.720> second<00:04:48.110> attempt<00:04:48.410> so<00:04:48.680> we'll<00:04:49.250> see<00:04:49.430> how

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
and my second attempt so we'll see how

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.740 
and my second attempt so we'll see how
that<00:04:49.880> goes<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:52.790> guys<00:04:52.910> might<00:04:53.150> notice<00:04:53.480> that<00:04:53.510> I

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
that goes you guys might notice that I

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.310 
that goes you guys might notice that I
do<00:04:53.870> have<00:04:54.580> some<00:04:55.580> new<00:04:55.760> wrist<00:04:56.000> wraps<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.570> wanted<00:04:57.230> to

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
do have some new wrist wraps I wanted to

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.990 
do have some new wrist wraps I wanted to
get<00:04:57.410> some<00:04:57.620> gangster<00:04:58.070> wraps<00:04:58.280> but<00:04:58.580> they<00:04:58.850> are

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
get some gangster wraps but they are

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.240 
get some gangster wraps but they are
pretty<00:04:59.840> much<00:05:00.080> sold<00:05:00.380> out<00:05:00.530> everywhere<00:05:00.980> that

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
pretty much sold out everywhere that

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.180 
pretty much sold out everywhere that
I've<00:05:01.340> looked<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:02.110> couldn't<00:05:03.110> find<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.710> any

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
I've looked and couldn't find the any

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.400 
I've looked and couldn't find the any
but<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.580> mini<00:05:04.820> ones<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.390> figure<00:05:05.900> you<00:05:06.320> know

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
but the mini ones and I figure you know

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.770 
but the mini ones and I figure you know
you<00:05:06.470> can<00:05:06.860> use<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.940> longer<00:05:08.300> wraps<00:05:08.540> I'd

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
you can use the the longer wraps I'd

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.510 
you can use the the longer wraps I'd
like<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.200> and<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:09.680> instead<00:05:09.860> i<00:05:10.070> got<00:05:10.160> the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
like to and so instead i got the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.620 
like to and so instead i got the
flexible<00:05:11.210> SVD<00:05:11.840> this<00:05:12.710> wraps<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.419> so<00:05:14.419> far<00:05:14.600> I

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
flexible SVD this wraps and so far I

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.360 
flexible SVD this wraps and so far I
like<00:05:14.690> them<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.169> like<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.650> thumb<00:05:15.860> loop<00:05:16.040> I<00:05:16.220> like

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
like them I like the thumb loop I like

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.370 
like them I like the thumb loop I like
the<00:05:16.580> tensile<00:05:17.480> strength<00:05:17.870> or<00:05:18.020> whatever<00:05:18.260> you

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
the tensile strength or whatever you

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.060 
the tensile strength or whatever you
call<00:05:18.560> it<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.800> like<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.160> way<00:05:19.280> they<00:05:19.430> felt<00:05:19.640> and<00:05:19.940> it

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
call it I like the way they felt and it

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.260 
call it I like the way they felt and it
was<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.100> good<00:05:22.310> first<00:05:22.490> experience<00:05:23.000> with<00:05:23.090> those

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
was a good first experience with those

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.970 
was a good first experience with those
wraps<00:05:23.540> they<00:05:23.780> are<00:05:24.110> definitely<00:05:24.290> pretty<00:05:24.710> tight

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
wraps they are definitely pretty tight

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.350 
wraps they are definitely pretty tight
but<00:05:26.410> yeah<00:05:27.410> overall<00:05:27.950> I<00:05:28.190> was<00:05:28.850> happy<00:05:29.150> with<00:05:29.240> the

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
but yeah overall I was happy with the

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.360 
but yeah overall I was happy with the
session<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:29.900> was<00:05:30.020> happy<00:05:30.740> with<00:05:30.860> how<00:05:30.979> things<00:05:31.010> are

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
session I was happy with how things are

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.570 
session I was happy with how things are
going<00:05:31.760> I'm<00:05:32.000> really<00:05:32.450> excited<00:05:33.190> moving<00:05:34.190> on<00:05:34.310> I

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
going I'm really excited moving on I

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.030 
going I'm really excited moving on I
hate<00:05:34.850> doing<00:05:35.240> sets<00:05:35.510> of<00:05:35.630> five<00:05:35.810> but<00:05:36.290> we're<00:05:36.890> going

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
hate doing sets of five but we're going

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.540 
hate doing sets of five but we're going
to<00:05:37.100> do<00:05:37.220> them<00:05:37.370> next<00:05:37.520> week<00:05:37.790> and<00:05:38.180> we're<00:05:38.780> going<00:05:38.960> to

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
to do them next week and we're going to

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.960 
to do them next week and we're going to
get<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.610> nice<00:05:41.030> big<00:05:41.360> solid<00:05:41.840> run<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:43.280> last<00:05:43.460> bit<00:05:43.760> of

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
get a nice big solid run the last bit of

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.450 
get a nice big solid run the last bit of
overreaching<00:05:44.570> before<00:05:45.380> we<00:05:45.560> do<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.979> real<00:05:46.160> taper

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
overreaching before we do the real taper

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.540 
overreaching before we do the real taper
into<00:05:46.700> the<00:05:46.850> meat<00:05:47.030> and<00:05:48.280> februari<00:05:49.280> is<00:05:49.370> going<00:05:49.490> to

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
into the meat and februari is going to

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.969 
into the meat and februari is going to
be<00:05:49.669> something<00:05:50.560> something<00:05:51.560> cool<00:05:51.770> something

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
be something something cool something
