00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.780
AS PART OF OUR ON GOING

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.010
SERIES, WE INVESTIGATE

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.710
FIREFIGHTER TRAINING.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.150
WE LEARNED THAT PENNSYLVANIA

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.520
DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY FIREFIGHTER

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.020
TRAINING.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.690
THIS IS NOT THE STANDARD

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.890
PRACTICE ELSEWHERE.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.860
NO, IOWA AND WEST VIRGINIA

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.330
REQUIRE 120 HOURS BEFORE A

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.630
FIREFIGHTER CAN SET FOOT ON A

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.700
TRUCK.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.170
IT MAKES THEM BETTER PREPARED TO

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.570
PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.170
THEMSELVES.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.510
FIREFIGHTERS PREPARED FOR AN

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.580
ATTACK.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.680
THE CREW GOES INSIDE OF A

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.980
BURNING TRAILER.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.650
QUICKLY PUTTING OUT THE FIRE.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.250
THIS FIRE WAS SET BY TRAINERS AT

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.850
THE WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.660
FIRE ACADEMY.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.890
ALL PART OF THE MANDATORY

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.030
TRAINING REQUIRED OF ALL

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.290
FIREFIGHTERS, PAID AND

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.590
VOLUNTEER, IN THE MOUNTAIN

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.600
STATE.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.950
INSIDE THE TRAILER, THEY CAN

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.430
CRANK UP THE HEAT TO ABOUT 1100

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.040
DEGREES.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.640
THAT'S ABOUT AS HOT AS IS GETS

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.480
IN A ACTUAL STRUCTURE FIRE.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.740
WE HAVE ALREADY TRAINED FOR

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.350
IT.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.650
THEY ALSO LEARN HOW TO DO

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.620
THIS -- PUT OUT A CAR FIRE.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.520
THE ECONOMY DIRECTOR SAYS

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.890
MANDATORY TRAINING IS CRITICALLY

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.290
IMPORTANT.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.860
THE PUBLIC CAN FEEL SAFE THAT

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.030
THEY HAVE AN ADEQUATELY TRAINED

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.400
FIREFIGHTER FORCE IN THEIR

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.230
COMMUNITY.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.400
AND IT HELPS KEEP

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.340
FIREFIGHTERS SAFE.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.910
IS THAT AN ASSURANCE THE

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.570
FIREFIGHTERS HERE OUGHT TO HAVE

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.640
AS WELL.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.980
IN A PERFECT WORLD, SURE,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.740
THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.560
WITH THE WAY THINGS HAVE BEEN,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.220
JUST TRYING TO GET MINIMUM

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.590
MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS, IT IS

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.990
TOUGH.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.590
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.830
THE FIREFIGHTERS SHOWING UP AT

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.160
YOUR HOUSE ARE TRAINED.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.600
I COULD HOP ON A TRUCK AND GO

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.950
TO A FIRE RIGHT NOW.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.310
IN ESSENCE, YOU COULD.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.310
THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING IS UP

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.010
TO THE CHIEF.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.150
FIREFIGHTERS ARE TRAINED AT A

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.680
SIMILAR LEVEL, BUT FEWER THAN 2%

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.580
OF DEPARTMENTS HAVE ALL OF THEIR

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.850
FIREFIGHTERS FULLY TRAINED.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.760
ONLY 15% OF THE STATE'S FIRE

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.420
DEPARTMENT EVEN PARTICIPATE IN

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.360
THE PROGRAM.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.900
IN THE DEPARTMENT, NOT PARTIES

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.300
PAINTS IS CANNONSBURG.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.330
THE CHIEF IS ALSO THE STATE FIRE

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.170
COMMISSIONER IN CHARGE OF

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.700
RUNNING THE TRAINING PROGRAM.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.000
YOU'RE THE COMMISSIONER,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.210
RIGHT?

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.170
YOU RUN THE TRAINING.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.640
I DON'T KNOW, I HAVE ONLY

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.180
BEEN HERE THREE MONTHS, GIVE ME

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.310
A CHANCE TO WORK ON IT.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.480
EVERY FIREFIGHTER THAT GETS

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.090
TRAIN KNOWS IT'S CRITICAL TO

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.450
WEAR A SELF CONTAINED BREATHING

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.160
APPARATUS.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.660
SHOULD A CREW RESPOND TO A

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.230
STRUCTURE FIRE WITHOUT THEIR

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.630
SCBA EQUIPMENT.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.400
BUT SOME OF THE FIRST CREWS

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.770
RESPONDING TO THIS FIRE EARLIER

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.170
THIS YEAR MAY NOT HAVE HAD THEIR

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.200
AIR TANKS.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.070
LISTEN TO AUDIO OF THE FIRE

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.540
OFFICIALS TELLING THEM TO SUPPLY

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.510
A MASKED CREW, OR FIREFIGHTERS

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.450
WEARING SCBAs.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.550
WE'RE GOING TO NEED LINE

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.790
PULLED, MASKED CREW INSIDE.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.620
I DON'T HAVE A MASKED CREW ON

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.590
THE TRUCK.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.630
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO GIVE

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.060
PUBLIC HIGHWAY MASKED CREW.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.260
THE FIRE QUICKLY SPREAD AND

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.160
DESTROYED THE HOUSE, THERE WAS

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.500
NO INJURED.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500
THE CHIEF WAS NOT AT THE FIRE,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.770
BUT HE SAYS HIS FIREFIGHTERS

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.010
TOLD HIM THEY DID HAVE AIR

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.170
TANKS.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.610
MANY VOLUNTEERS IN PENNSYLVANIA,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.010
INCLUDING THE HEAD OF THIS

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.380
DEPARTMENT, WANT MANDATORY

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.110
TRAINING.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.150
YOU CAN'T TRAIN ENOUGH FOR A

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.510
JOB LIKE THIS.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.020
IN WEST VIRGINIA THEY SAY

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.790
PENNSYLVANIA FIREFIGHTERS WILL

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.550
DIE ON THE JOB IF THEY DO NOT

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.260
MAKE SURE ALL FIREFIGHTERS ARE

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.430
TRAINED.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.190
I THINK THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.500
FIREFIGHTERS AT A HIGHER RISK,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.800
AND PROBABLY IT WILL CAUSE A

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.940
LINE OF DUTY DEATH.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.370
AND WE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.210
THAT WEST VIRGINIA FIREFIGHTER

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.940
SAID SO WE CHECKED WITH FEMA.

NATION IN LINE OF DUTY DEATHS.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.250
IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA, THERE

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.320
IS NO DEPARTMENTS WITH ALL

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.120
CERTIFIED FIREFIGHTERS.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.000
