00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.059 

in<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.350> last<00:00:01.560> tutorial<00:00:01.770> we<00:00:02.220> have<00:00:02.610> a

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.069 
in the last tutorial we have a

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.730 
in the last tutorial we have a
partitioned<00:00:05.069> our<00:00:05.220> second<00:00:06.000> hard<00:00:06.299> drive<00:00:06.740> into

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
partitioned our second hard drive into

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.650 
partitioned our second hard drive into
three<00:00:08.040> different<00:00:08.480> partitions<00:00:09.860> but<00:00:10.860> we

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
three different partitions but we

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.709 
three different partitions but we
haven't<00:00:12.660> formatted<00:00:13.469> them<00:00:13.650> yet<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.509> right<00:00:15.509> now

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
haven't formatted them yet so right now

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.800 
haven't formatted them yet so right now
we<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.260> format<00:00:16.650> our<00:00:16.890> partitions

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
we are going to format our partitions

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.980 
we are going to format our partitions
using<00:00:18.810> ext4<00:00:19.770> filesystem<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.150> then<00:00:21.810> we're

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
using ext4 filesystem and then we're

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.189 
using ext4 filesystem and then we're
going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.230> mount<00:00:22.529> them<00:00:22.830> mount<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.640> partitions

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
going to mount them mount the partitions

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.859 
going to mount them mount the partitions
so<00:00:25.199> let's<00:00:25.439> get<00:00:25.619> started<00:00:26.220> first<00:00:26.490> let's<00:00:26.869> see

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
so let's get started first let's see

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.190 
so let's get started first let's see
let's<00:00:28.859> look<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.570> far

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.650 

so<00:00:37.200> we're<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.710> check<00:00:37.980> our<00:00:38.219> device<00:00:38.670> sdb

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
so we're going to check our device sdb

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.560 
so we're going to check our device sdb
hard<00:00:40.110> drive<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> looks<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.120> right

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
hard drive see what it looks like right

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.360 
hard drive see what it looks like right
now

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
now

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.139 
now
we<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> enter<00:00:45.510> P<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.170> print<00:00:47.149> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
we are going to enter P to print the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.740 
we are going to enter P to print the
partition<00:00:48.750> data<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> screen<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:53.129> have

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
partition data to the screen so we have

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.880 
partition data to the screen so we have
500<00:00:54.750> gigabytes<00:00:56.449> total<00:00:57.449> size<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.469> device

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
500 gigabytes total size of this device

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.389 
500 gigabytes total size of this device
right<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.379> we<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.530> three<00:01:01.800> partitions

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
right here and we have three partitions

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.109 
right here and we have three partitions
SD<00:01:02.879> b1s<00:01:03.480> d<00:01:03.539> b2<00:01:03.930> SD<00:01:04.470> b<00:01:04.589> 3<00:01:05.780> right<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.729> we<00:01:08.729> go<00:01:08.970> into

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
SD b1s d b2 SD b 3 right so we go into

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.750 
SD b1s d b2 SD b 3 right so we go into
format<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:11.220> first<00:01:11.400> partition<00:01:12.920> using<00:01:13.920> ext4

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
format the first partition using ext4

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.810 
format the first partition using ext4
filesystem

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
filesystem

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:31.000 
filesystem
so<00:01:17.820> we're<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> type<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.930> command

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.590 

now<00:01:31.580> when<00:01:31.760> you<00:01:31.880> type<00:01:32.320> mkfs<00:01:34.570> dot<00:01:35.570> ext4<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:38.030> will

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
now when you type mkfs dot ext4 it will

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.150 
now when you type mkfs dot ext4 it will
format<00:01:39.290> your<00:01:39.530> partition<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.460> make<00:01:41.120> sure<00:01:42.160> you

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
format your partition so make sure you

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.670 
format your partition so make sure you
type<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:44.240> device<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:44.810> partition<00:01:45.350> name<00:01:45.500> that

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
type the device and partition name that

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.210 
type the device and partition name that
you<00:01:45.830> really<00:01:46.220> want<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.520> format<00:01:47.140> because<00:01:48.220> this

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
you really want to format because this

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.250 
you really want to format because this
command<00:01:49.640> will<00:01:49.880> erase<00:01:50.180> all<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.720> data<00:01:50.750> on<00:01:51.140> your

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
command will erase all the data on your

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.060 
command will erase all the data on your
partition<00:01:52.780> now<00:01:53.780> luckily<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.380> will<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.800> will

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
partition now luckily it will it will

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.220 
partition now luckily it will it will
not<00:01:55.250> allow<00:01:55.400> you<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.850> format<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.780> partition

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
not allow you to format the partition

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.930 
not allow you to format the partition
that's<00:01:57.770> already<00:01:58.190> mounted<00:01:58.780> like<00:01:59.780> for<00:01:59.990> example

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
that's already mounted like for example

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.500 
that's already mounted like for example
SDA<00:02:02.980> but<00:02:03.980> if<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.430> have<00:02:04.640> any<00:02:04.790> partition<00:02:05.210> that's

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
SDA but if you have any partition that's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.930 
SDA but if you have any partition that's
unmounted<00:02:06.380> but<00:02:06.650> has<00:02:06.860> data<00:02:07.160> on<00:02:07.370> it<00:02:07.550> this

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
unmounted but has data on it this

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.090 
unmounted but has data on it this
comment<00:02:08.300> will<00:02:08.450> erase<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.020> be<00:02:09.350> careful<00:02:09.830> type

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
comment will erase it so be careful type

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.820 
comment will erase it so be careful type
exactly<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:11.210> partition<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.290> want<00:02:12.440> to

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
exactly the partition that you want to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.910 
exactly the partition that you want to
format<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.830> we're<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.070> press<00:02:16.280> Enter

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:42.890 

okay

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.000 

so<00:02:43.349> this<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:46.670> large<00:02:47.670> partition<00:02:48.510> 400<00:02:49.319> gigs<00:02:49.590> so

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
so this is a large partition 400 gigs so

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.630 
so this is a large partition 400 gigs so
it<00:02:50.099> may<00:02:50.250> take<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> while<00:02:51.319> but<00:02:52.319> overall<00:02:52.739> it's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it may take a while but overall it's

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.440 
it may take a while but overall it's
going<00:02:53.790> pretty<00:02:54.090> quickly<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:56.420> we'll<00:02:57.420> just

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
going pretty quickly and so we'll just

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.330 
going pretty quickly and so we'll just
wait<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:58.230> few<00:02:58.319> seconds<00:02:59.040> and<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:01.190> then<00:03:02.190> our

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
wait a few seconds and and then our

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.759 
wait a few seconds and and then our
second<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.000> third<00:03:03.030> partitions<00:03:03.930> are<00:03:04.140> smaller

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
second and third partitions are smaller

00:03:04.769 --> 00:04:03.290 
second and third partitions are smaller
so<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:06.360> will<00:03:06.569> not<00:03:06.750> take<00:03:06.959> as<00:03:07.170> long

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.380 

okay<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.770> first<00:04:05.010> partition<00:04:05.490> is<00:04:05.850> done

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
okay so the first partition is done

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.860 
okay so the first partition is done
formatting<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:09.000> we're<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.360> repeat<00:04:09.690> this

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
formatting so we're going to repeat this

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.830 
formatting so we're going to repeat this
for<00:04:09.930> second<00:04:10.470> one<00:04:10.620> which<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:11.700> much<00:04:11.880> smaller<00:04:12.090> so

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
for second one which is much smaller so

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.900 
for second one which is much smaller so
will<00:04:13.110> not<00:04:13.260> take<00:04:13.470> as<00:04:13.650> long<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.100> then<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.670> third

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
will not take as long and then the third

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:49.189 
will not take as long and then the third
one<00:04:15.120> which<00:04:15.270> is<00:04:15.330> really<00:04:15.720> small

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:05:01.709 

okay<00:04:50.009> second<00:04:50.490> is<00:04:50.610> done<00:04:51.349> now<00:04:52.349> last<00:04:52.770> one<00:04:52.979> is<00:04:53.189> db3

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:05.309 

done<00:05:02.409> now<00:05:03.330> we're<00:05:04.330> going<00:05:04.509> to<00:05:04.599> have<00:05:04.809> to<00:05:04.959> mount

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
done now we're going to have to mount

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.570 
done now we're going to have to mount
those<00:05:06.149> new<00:05:07.149> partitions<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.830> first<00:05:09.189> we<00:05:09.429> have<00:05:09.549> to

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
those new partitions so first we have to

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.969 
those new partitions so first we have to
create<00:05:09.879> mount<00:05:10.599> points<00:05:11.199> which<00:05:11.379> are<00:05:11.619> just

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
create mount points which are just

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:18.179 
create mount points which are just
regular<00:05:12.699> directories<00:05:15.899> I'm<00:05:16.899> going<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.199> call

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
regular directories I'm going to call

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:32.519 
regular directories I'm going to call
the<00:05:18.339> first<00:05:18.849> one<00:05:19.209> data<00:05:22.860> beta<00:05:23.860> 2<00:05:27.149> and<00:05:31.529> temporary

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:32.529 
the first one data beta 2 and temporary

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:36.779 
the first one data beta 2 and temporary
directory<00:05:33.399> TMP<00:05:34.119> 2<00:05:34.389> which<00:05:35.039> is<00:05:36.039> going<00:05:36.309> to<00:05:36.459> be<00:05:36.639> our

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
directory TMP 2 which is going to be our

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.769 
directory TMP 2 which is going to be our
smallest<00:05:36.999> partition<00:05:37.869> mounted<00:05:38.319> as<00:05:38.499> TMP<00:05:39.129> to

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:39.779 
smallest partition mounted as TMP to

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:51.029 
smallest partition mounted as TMP to
okay<00:05:40.779> and<00:05:42.029> now<00:05:43.029> we<00:05:43.089> can<00:05:43.539> mount<00:05:49.289> like<00:05:50.289> so<00:05:50.559> now

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
okay and now we can mount like so now

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.029 
okay and now we can mount like so now
let's<00:05:51.279> see

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
let's see

00:05:53.039 --> 00:06:01.019 
let's see
as<00:05:54.989> you<00:05:55.989> can<00:05:56.169> see<00:05:57.449> Deb<00:05:58.449> s<00:05:58.689> DB<00:05:58.989> 1<00:05:59.849> formatted<00:06:00.849> with

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:01.029 
as you can see Deb s DB 1 formatted with

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:06.059 
as you can see Deb s DB 1 formatted with
ext<00:06:01.479> for<00:06:02.429> this<00:06:03.429> is<00:06:03.549> the<00:06:03.669> size<00:06:03.909> and<00:06:05.069> it's

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
ext for this is the size and it's

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:12.439 
ext for this is the size and it's
mounted<00:06:06.550> as<00:06:06.699> data<00:06:09.719> this<00:06:10.719> is<00:06:10.869> all<00:06:11.019> good<00:06:11.259> except

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
mounted as data this is all good except

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:18.659 
mounted as data this is all good except
that<00:06:14.399> when<00:06:15.399> a<00:06:15.429> system<00:06:15.969> reboots<00:06:16.419> s<00:06:17.069> DB<00:06:18.069> 1<00:06:18.459> will

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
that when a system reboots s DB 1 will

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.889 
that when a system reboots s DB 1 will
not<00:06:18.909> be<00:06:18.969> automatically<00:06:19.929> mounted<00:06:20.469> as<00:06:20.619> data

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:21.899 
not be automatically mounted as data

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:25.469 
not be automatically mounted as data
which<00:06:22.899> is<00:06:23.110> not<00:06:23.139> a<00:06:24.029> good<00:06:25.029> thing<00:06:25.239> actually

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
which is not a good thing actually

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:31.339 
which is not a good thing actually
because<00:06:25.869> if<00:06:26.589> we<00:06:27.129> use<00:06:27.339> data<00:06:27.879> directory<00:06:28.509> for<00:06:28.989> our

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
because if we use data directory for our

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:37.649 
because if we use data directory for our
database<00:06:35.249> then<00:06:36.249> the<00:06:36.519> database<00:06:36.999> will<00:06:37.239> not<00:06:37.419> be

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
database then the database will not be

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:41.069 
database then the database will not be
able<00:06:38.469> to<00:06:38.589> see<00:06:39.039> our<00:06:39.369> data<00:06:39.909> directory<00:06:40.509> and<00:06:40.749> will

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:41.079 
able to see our data directory and will

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:45.659 
able to see our data directory and will
not<00:06:41.229> be<00:06:41.379> able<00:06:41.439> to<00:06:41.589> write<00:06:41.889> to<00:06:42.099> it<00:06:44.159> what<00:06:45.159> we<00:06:45.399> need

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
not be able to write to it what we need

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.189 
not be able to write to it what we need
is<00:06:45.999> to<00:06:46.419> add<00:06:46.929> our<00:06:48.149> mount<00:06:49.149> information<00:06:49.929> to

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
is to add our mount information to

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:56.279 
is to add our mount information to
systems<00:06:50.769> FS<00:06:51.279> tab<00:06:51.579> file<00:06:52.509> and<00:06:52.949> save<00:06:53.949> it<00:06:54.129> and<00:06:55.289> we

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
systems FS tab file and save it and we

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:00.460 
systems FS tab file and save it and we
will<00:06:56.439> do<00:06:56.589> it<00:06:56.619> in<00:06:56.829> our<00:06:56.979> next<00:06:57.279> tutorial
