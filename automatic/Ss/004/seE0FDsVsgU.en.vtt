together<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.289> it<00:01:34.410> or<00:01:34.590> else<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
together and then to do it or else to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.130 
together and then to do it or else to
the<00:01:35.220> only<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.550> at<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> analogous<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.690> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the only thing at the analogous to the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.940 
the only thing at the analogous to the
same<00:01:37.350> thing<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.649> close<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:39.350> now<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
same thing to close it now this is this

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.590 
same thing to close it now this is this
is<00:01:41.100> probably<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> hardest<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.509> all

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
is probably the hardest one out of all

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
is probably the hardest one out of all
