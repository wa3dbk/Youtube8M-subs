00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.439
 how are you welcome to the second part 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.930
 of the special game on android mx 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.780
 this is I'm going to be talking about a game 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.330
 quite well not so well known or what 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.309
 better yes already many people know him but 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.550
 I like it a lot in transports 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:23.019
 talking about him is always called round that 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.380
 this game was born at the same time for 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.990
 more platforms of the manzanita and good 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.029
 ya android 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.130
 but because the manzanita is very polarized 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.940
 and after all you can grab 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.400
 working is a pretty good game is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.470
 a game like the zombies more like 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:47.160
 for flavor to go for a while is not the great 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.019
 thing that you say a game as such in the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 thematic and game is quite simple and 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:57.030
 simple you just have to run jumping 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.850
 slide and other things give you achievements 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.640
 they give you goals they give you many more things 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.979
 then let's give more to the successes 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.530
 how it starts, they're just going 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.000
 perceived as changuitos and put 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.450
 jump tells me never to lift 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.660
 you can move with the meter and then the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.490
 goal is not to fall, not to hit you 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.280
 do not eat the changuitos or whatever they are 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.380
 those things although we need to enter what 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.340
 again it 's a bit difficult to record 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.250
 talk and try to play so apologize 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.590
 then nothing else to do swaps 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.619
 again 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.570
 nothing else has to be done with the fingers 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:41.390
 to grab the little things that are 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.560
 there in this constitution as fichitas 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.159
 then we go with the accelerometer to 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.530
 in some cases this there are very 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.750
 narrow then we have to go by 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.360
 some specific place or simply we 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.930
 we move with the accelerometer to be able 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.200
 collect the little things and these I do not know 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.350
 how are they just like a felipe is 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.700
 breathing like diamonds here when 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.289
 we come to obstacles of this kind 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.140
 we just have to slide them in 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.750
 the floor which is the objective because nothing 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.790
 none really is simply 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.900
 hold the most amount of time or 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.700
 possible distance away from the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.860
 little monkeys these and there 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.430
 I could not stand that much good anymore 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.010
 I concentrated so much and it was like that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.129
 tree then you get achievements in this 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.650
 case the objective or objective achievements 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.519
 the objective is a corridor with a thousand meters 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.250
 with this they have multiplied me the 14th 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:48.209
 in my next goal to fulfill is my 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.549
 be round that would be to collect or run 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.850
 500 meters without collecting coins ok 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.270
 they are coins whatever they are on floor 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.940
 and well that would be what is the plot in 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.720
 Actually the game you get your score 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.720
 they give a little bit of 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.720
 how 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.920
 a joke for that call of the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.690
 way you lost it's hard to cum 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.340
 in your head and you can see that the moment 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.440
 he has no head 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.989
 have your score the distance you travel 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.060
 this coins and other things from 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.180
 here you can tweet it like tell it in 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.700
 twitter will open the application or the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.180
 browser 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.790
 for 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.659
 ask for the necessary permits then 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.659
 of normally 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.070
 already 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.020
 auto says the application then I should 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.840
 tweet what 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:54.200
 and he says he's going to tweet the tweets 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.330
 and already tweet sent then basically 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.690
 it's all they can buy more things inside 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.270
 of the game that would be 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.750
 there are also skills that you run more 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.360
 fast that 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.050
 it does not hurt you not to hit yourself with 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.270
 something that you can spend walking the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.570
 cliffs or the parts where there's no 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.850
 way then it would be basically a 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.769
 pretty interesting game of those times 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.870
 what are you waiting for something that is 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.610
 waiting for someone who has nothing 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.010
 what to do and you say good what I do 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.800
 then I tell you it's pretty 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.090
 recommendable is free in the play store 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.400
 it's called temporary and so here I say goodbye 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.040
 I'm collecting this is for 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.210
 android mx dot net visit the blog and 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.210
