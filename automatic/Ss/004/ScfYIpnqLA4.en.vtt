00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello there is a blade of grass with you 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.130
 Today I'll show you one interesting 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.969
 the story in general today brought me 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.650
 computer repair with a problem not 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.699
 turns on does not respond to the button 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.380
 switching on for a long time without thinking I put 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.039
 knowingly working block computer 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 everything started well this block completely 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.349
 already state employees quite simple and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.500
 such budget units are being repaired 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.019
 impractical 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 so how can you put a worker behind the look 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.380
 for the same money as repairs 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.350
 such a block 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.040
 here is more than that, the unit was installed 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.760
 much better company from better 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.300
 cooled here by 80 millimeters 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.550
 cooling cooler 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.680
 atoms lattice at 100 and 120 but oh well 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.390
 very client is used a story 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.800
 such was the previous system unit something 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.049
 buzzed then this sound was gone then the children 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.049
 played small games and computer 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.860
 turned off and went bad smell in 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.619
 general such a story was well again 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.350
 I repeat the system is already repaired and 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.229
 enjoys the client and now I still 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.890
 there was a minute I usually do not spend 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.780
 repair time and blocks of this type 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.430
 But there is a moment to do something. 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 how to sit around and I decided to look 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.229
 immediately shows the side to which 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.560
 you need to pay attention 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.829
 the one who noticed I don't know but who doesn't 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.810
 noticed showing you can see here some 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.979
 hole 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.290
 and for some reason itâ€™s not even just metal 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.649
 not just the hole part of the metal there 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.259
 Inward and entered OSP from there on my rail car 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.159
 assumptions assumption because I 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.220
 there is no reason what to prove though option 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.670
 sheet for now see myself in general 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.970
 speculation such is not a customer right away 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.150
 I say it did the one who installed 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.140
 earlier to the block he probably you 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.519
 it was lubricate the cooler I take off the cover 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.700
 metal removing the cooler from on its 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:28.400
 I am removing the wire plan was not a seal 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:32.519
 mud plug and lubricate the sleeve 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.430
 cooler probably probably but that was all 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.099
 and he according to his method 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.530
 don't know the technique made a hole and their 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.120
 finger drove there drove the oil in general 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.950
 I do not know this for many years of work 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.620
 the first to see the first further about 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.410
 smell smell yes there really is and over 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.130
 fees leaves you understandably this is not 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.930
 feel but what is the most interesting they 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.709
 visually by visual inspection in general 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.109
 not what elements burned sti invisible and 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.910
 melting too 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.760
 hay to here cooling systems 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.470
 well, like systems cooling power supply 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.180
 there was dust inside, I wouldn't 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:23.130
 said but there are such cooler 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.079
 plaque and dust but this is the little things themselves 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.609
 what happens 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.060
 now I will show you in practice how he himself 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.060
 leads 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.870
 already heard a characteristic click can 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:44.720
 the camera did not convey I do not know what we take 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.590
 dough for power supplies now 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:55.980
 listen and look at the indicators 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:59.660
 LED well, of course, quite weak 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.660
 was not following the camera to not conveyed 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.430
 here in this area in this area 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.650
 the onion is such a feeling that god 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.000
 goes to goats 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:22.790
 but the way it is and you saw the tension 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.300
 almost all the voltages are not here at 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.360
 This cooler does not twitch at all, but 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.990
 his hands spin but badly very badly 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.990
 is spinning 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.370
 one of the reasons why it could 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.130
 there will again be a guess as 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.979
 the fact was not noticed 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.960
 from the words of the client and given information from 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:53.780
 practice is quite possible that the system 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:59.090
 Sleeve system on the cooler was bad 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.870
 lubricated cooler significantly reduced their 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.530
 turnovers 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:10.700
 either stopped altogether or burned out 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:14.990
 respectively, aluminum radiators are not 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.479
 coped with cooling and system 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.889
 out of order 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.310
 The tester did not call anything again 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.250
 grief 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.840
 before that I did not make it and that's what I 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:29.169
 wanted to see this quick 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.169
 unleash 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:39.390
 on the bushes unwind to see the gum 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.910
 or they are plastic plugs 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:47.460
 these 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:52.320
 under which are sleeves which 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:55.250
 required to blur the time to end 3 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.250
 remember the minutes 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.300
 Yes, here is a look Verka still have 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:25.920
 metal part 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:34.260
 sticks out here now look the same way 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:38.060
 time time the camera by okay no 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:45.960
 opportunities right now to get to the screwdriver 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:49.620
 criticize the screw for a healthy screw this 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.880
 part broken and I barely barely 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.680
 barely it may not even be broken yes 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:02.340
 there is no longer plastics on 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:04.980
 rubber stopper and inside everything is dry 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.580
 you probably do not notice and do not say 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.870
 everything is dry 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:15.240
 to through but not all the same here punched 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:19.370
 An interesting method of this method is not yet 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:22.620
 Well, in general, this is of course a foolish method 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:25.100
 damage the case if you can take it apart 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.100
 lubricate 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.100
 lubricate it not repair later 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:34.550
 power supply spend a lot on it 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:44.270
 more time as opposed to data 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:47.270
 procedures in general on this all expect 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.580
 Soon there will be an interesting video a little 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:53.720
 here is loaded for work on the store and yes 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:57.040
 repair services in general will be 

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.090
 I'll make a video for a minute 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.670
 everyone who liked not forget 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.180
 like and subscribe to 

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.820
 channel 

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.820
 Well, until we meet again until all
