downloaded<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:30.360> enjoy<00:02:30.690> quite<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.230> bit

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
downloaded and I enjoy quite a bit

00:02:31.410 --> 00:03:00.600 
downloaded and I enjoy quite a bit
actually<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> we'll<00:02:37.110> do<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.470> Box<00:02:37.740> wave<00:02:38.070> first

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:25.100 

there's<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.909> and<00:03:02.860> then<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:05.500> donut<00:03:06.500> shop<00:03:06.680> pro

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:46.630 

and<00:03:26.110> then<00:03:30.270> my<00:03:31.270> finger

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.860 

so<00:03:47.870> as<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.110> can<00:03:49.230> see<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:51.270> first<00:03:51.570> two<00:03:51.750> are

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
so as you can see the first two are

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.280 
so as you can see the first two are
pretty<00:03:52.140> similar<00:03:52.730> but<00:03:53.730> one<00:03:54.720> thing<00:03:54.960> you<00:03:55.080> will

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
pretty similar but one thing you will

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.800 
pretty similar but one thing you will
note<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.670> Adonit<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:58.370> it's<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.730> much<00:04:00.570> more

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
note is the Adonit is it's a much more

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.890 
note is the Adonit is it's a much more
tight<00:04:01.170> text<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.880> really<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.480> can<00:04:03.720> really

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
tight text I can really I can really

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.150 
tight text I can really I can really
write<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.830> in<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.160> smaller<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:06.090> smaller<00:04:07.080> area<00:04:07.740> I

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
write in a in a smaller a smaller area I

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.270 
write in a in a smaller a smaller area I
was<00:04:08.760> writing<00:04:09.060> rather<00:04:09.360> quickly<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.130> you<00:04:11.130> know

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
was writing rather quickly so you know

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.560 
was writing rather quickly so you know
the<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.270> writing<00:04:13.170> accuracy<00:04:13.830> is<00:04:14.070> going<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.340> be

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
the the writing accuracy is going to be

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.110 
the the writing accuracy is going to be
you<00:04:15.570> know<00:04:15.660> pretty<00:04:15.930> much<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.170> same<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:18.090> know

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
you know pretty much the same you know

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.090 
you know pretty much the same you know
my<00:04:18.360> finger<00:04:18.780> my<00:04:19.140> finger<00:04:19.170> didn't<00:04:19.709> do<00:04:19.860> so<00:04:20.070> well

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
my finger my finger didn't do so well

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.420 
my finger my finger didn't do so well
it's<00:04:20.580> probably<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.239> worst<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.840> three<00:04:22.430> and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
it's probably the worst of the three and

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.190 
it's probably the worst of the three and
also<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.360> biggest<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.080> three

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.220 

where<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.710> Adamic<00:04:29.160> job<00:04:29.340> Pro<00:04:29.670> come<00:04:30.420> seems<00:04:31.050> to

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
where the Adamic job Pro come seems to

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.160 
where the Adamic job Pro come seems to
shine<00:04:31.440> is<00:04:32.270> when<00:04:33.270> you're<00:04:33.420> when<00:04:33.780> you're<00:04:33.810> working

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
shine is when you're when you're working

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.040 
shine is when you're when you're working
slowly<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:36.090> you're<00:04:36.300> you're<00:04:36.570> trying<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.930> get

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
slowly and you're you're trying to get

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.280 
slowly and you're you're trying to get
some<00:04:37.380> real<00:04:37.560> precision<00:04:38.540> you<00:04:39.540> know<00:04:39.630> like<00:04:39.990> like

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
some real precision you know like like

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.690 
some real precision you know like like
an<00:04:40.440> art<00:04:40.620> application

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
an art application

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.790 
an art application
you<00:04:42.180> know<00:04:42.270> SketchBook<00:04:42.720> Pro<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.990> have<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.620> I'm

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
you know SketchBook Pro I have that I'm

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.770 
you know SketchBook Pro I have that I'm
not<00:04:43.980> gonna<00:04:44.100> pull<00:04:44.730> it<00:04:44.850> out<00:04:44.910> because<00:04:45.090> I'm<00:04:45.540> just

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
not gonna pull it out because I'm just

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.730 
not gonna pull it out because I'm just
horrible<00:04:46.680> at<00:04:47.010> drawing<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:49.110> wouldn't<00:04:49.650> be

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
horrible at drawing and I wouldn't be

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.070 
horrible at drawing and I wouldn't be
able<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.460> know<00:04:50.490> really<00:04:51.450> show<00:04:51.690> anything

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
able to you know really show anything

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.490 
able to you know really show anything
but<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:54.240> fact<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.660> can<00:04:54.810> see<00:04:55.080> through

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
but the fact that you can see through

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.580 
but the fact that you can see through
this<00:04:56.010> this<00:04:56.670> little<00:04:56.940> disc<00:04:57.180> here<00:04:57.480> really<00:04:57.780> really

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
this this little disc here really really

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.520 
this this little disc here really really
changes<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.430> game<00:04:59.660> as<00:05:00.660> far<00:05:00.870> as<00:05:00.960> accuracy<00:05:01.260> goes

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
changes the game as far as accuracy goes

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.610 
changes the game as far as accuracy goes
with<00:05:02.010> art<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.900> it<00:05:03.900> is<00:05:04.050> great<00:05:04.290> for<00:05:04.440> writing

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
with art and it is great for writing

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.010 
with art and it is great for writing
like<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.250> said<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.730> can<00:05:05.880> write<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.150> lot<00:05:06.510> a<00:05:06.750> lot

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
like I said you can write a lot a lot

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.190 
like I said you can write a lot a lot
tighter<00:05:07.350> a<00:05:07.530> lot<00:05:07.770> cleaner<00:05:08.810> one<00:05:09.810> thing<00:05:09.960> I<00:05:10.020> will

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
tighter a lot cleaner one thing I will

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.950 
tighter a lot cleaner one thing I will
say<00:05:10.230> though<00:05:10.590> is<00:05:10.710> it's<00:05:10.980> it's<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.430> little<00:05:11.550> loud<00:05:11.960> it

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
say though is it's it's a little loud it

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960 
say though is it's it's a little loud it
kind<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.590> kind<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.100> taps<00:05:14.340> on<00:05:14.580> your<00:05:14.700> screen

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
kind of kind of taps on your screen

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.190 
kind of kind of taps on your screen
while<00:05:15.180> you're<00:05:15.360> where<00:05:15.570> you're<00:05:15.660> going<00:05:15.960> along

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
while you're where you're going along

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.440 
while you're where you're going along
which<00:05:17.070> can<00:05:17.280> be<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.460> problem<00:05:17.700> for<00:05:17.910> some<00:05:18.300> if

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
which can be a problem for some if

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.420 
which can be a problem for some if
you're<00:05:18.630> in<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.780> real<00:05:18.960> quiet<00:05:19.230> area<00:05:19.650> or<00:05:19.890> if<00:05:20.280> that

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
you're in a real quiet area or if that

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.940 
you're in a real quiet area or if that
just<00:05:20.670> annoys<00:05:20.940> you

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
just annoys you

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.830 
just annoys you
I<00:05:23.040> feel<00:05:23.430> like<00:05:23.550> when<00:05:23.730> I'm<00:05:23.850> in<00:05:24.090> you<00:05:24.480> know<00:05:24.510> in

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
I feel like when I'm in you know in

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.340 
I feel like when I'm in you know in
class<00:05:25.170> it's<00:05:26.070> not<00:05:26.190> going<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.520> be<00:05:26.610> an<00:05:26.700> issue

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
class it's not going to be an issue

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.920 
class it's not going to be an issue
we'll<00:05:28.350> find<00:05:28.530> out<00:05:28.680> tomorrow<00:05:29.090> because<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.660> know

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
we'll find out tomorrow because you know

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.320 
we'll find out tomorrow because you know
that<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.890> instructor<00:05:32.550> is<00:05:32.640> talking<00:05:32.880> and

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
that the the instructor is talking and

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.590 
that the the instructor is talking and
people<00:05:33.540> are<00:05:33.840> you<00:05:34.110> know<00:05:34.490> murmuring<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.760> the

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
people are you know murmuring and the

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.030 
people are you know murmuring and the
instructors<00:05:37.080> writing<00:05:37.380> on<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.530> board<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:38.010> I

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
instructors writing on the board so I

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.560 
instructors writing on the board so I
don't<00:05:38.280> think<00:05:38.430> it'll<00:05:38.550> be<00:05:38.670> quite<00:05:38.820> quite<00:05:39.450> an

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
don't think it'll be quite quite an

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.280 
don't think it'll be quite quite an
issue<00:05:39.830> but<00:05:40.830> uh<00:05:40.860> only<00:05:41.400> time<00:05:41.580> will<00:05:41.700> tell<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:42.780> will

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
issue but uh only time will tell I will

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.760 
issue but uh only time will tell I will
say<00:05:43.470> the<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.980> Box<00:05:44.160> wave<00:05:44.340> also<00:05:44.670> does<00:05:45.000> have<00:05:45.270> a

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
say the the Box wave also does have a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.760 
say the the Box wave also does have a
magnetic<00:05:46.770> feature<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:48.260> sticks<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.560> your

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
magnetic feature that sticks to your

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
magnetic feature that sticks to your
your<00:05:50.430> iPad<00:05:51.919> you<00:05:52.919> can<00:05:53.070> see<00:05:53.220> that<00:05:53.340> there<00:05:53.580> it<00:05:53.700> is

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
your iPad you can see that there it is

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.140 
your iPad you can see that there it is
on<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.120> incline<00:05:54.570> so<00:05:54.900> it's<00:05:55.020> not<00:05:55.169> rolling<00:05:55.380> down

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
on the incline so it's not rolling down

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.159 
on the incline so it's not rolling down
well<00:05:57.150> until

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
well until

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.959 
well until
did<00:05:58.259> that<00:05:58.379> it's<00:05:59.009> something<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.460> a<00:05:59.550> gimmick<00:05:59.759> I

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
did that it's something of a gimmick I

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.420 
did that it's something of a gimmick I
think<00:06:00.240> I<00:06:00.689> mean<00:06:01.229> it<00:06:01.469> is<00:06:01.620> cool<00:06:01.860> it<00:06:02.069> won't<00:06:02.249> roll

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
think I mean it is cool it won't roll

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.269 
think I mean it is cool it won't roll
away<00:06:02.550> from<00:06:02.669> you<00:06:03.210> on<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.419> desk<00:06:03.629> but<00:06:04.020> it's<00:06:04.319> a

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:05.279 
away from you on the desk but it's a

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.909 
away from you on the desk but it's a
it's<00:06:05.580> it's<00:06:06.029> not<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.479> strongest<00:06:06.919> connection

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
it's it's not the strongest connection

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.869 
it's it's not the strongest connection
in<00:06:08.009> the<00:06:08.099> world<00:06:08.279> so<00:06:09.560> personally<00:06:10.560> I<00:06:10.800> think<00:06:11.490> that

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
in the world so personally I think that

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.600 
in the world so personally I think that
they<00:06:12.150> are<00:06:12.300> both<00:06:12.710> great<00:06:13.710> styluses<00:06:14.279> I<00:06:14.430> just

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
they are both great styluses I just

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.860 
they are both great styluses I just
think<00:06:14.759> they<00:06:14.879> have<00:06:14.969> different<00:06:15.300> applications

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
think they have different applications

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.760 
think they have different applications
the<00:06:16.860> Vox<00:06:17.069> wave<00:06:17.310> is<00:06:17.490> great<00:06:17.669> for<00:06:17.879> navigation<00:06:18.770> if

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
the Vox wave is great for navigation if

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.420 
the Vox wave is great for navigation if
you're<00:06:19.979> trying<00:06:20.219> to<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:20.669> know<00:06:20.699> just<00:06:21.389> do<00:06:22.430> things

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
you're trying to you know just do things

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.070 
you're trying to you know just do things
on<00:06:23.639> your<00:06:23.819> iPad<00:06:24.150> that<00:06:24.300> don't<00:06:24.449> require<00:06:24.810> a<00:06:24.870> whole

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
on your iPad that don't require a whole

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.790 
on your iPad that don't require a whole
lot<00:06:25.169> of<00:06:25.229> precision<00:06:26.029> more<00:06:27.029> speed<00:06:27.439> type<00:06:28.439> stuff

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
lot of precision more speed type stuff

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.219 
lot of precision more speed type stuff
if<00:06:29.729> if<00:06:30.210> you're<00:06:30.360> playing<00:06:30.539> the<00:06:30.659> simpler<00:06:31.020> game

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
if if you're playing the simpler game

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.489 
if if you're playing the simpler game
like<00:06:31.499> Angry<00:06:31.710> Birds<00:06:32.129> or<00:06:33.029> tiny<00:06:34.020> wings<00:06:34.259> or

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:34.499 
like Angry Birds or tiny wings or

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:35.719 
like Angry Birds or tiny wings or
whatever<00:06:34.740> something<00:06:35.039> like<00:06:35.279> that<00:06:35.430> cut<00:06:35.669> the

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
whatever something like that cut the

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.079 
whatever something like that cut the
rope<00:06:36.319> it<00:06:37.319> just<00:06:37.620> seems<00:06:37.860> to<00:06:38.099> do<00:06:38.310> better<00:06:38.339> because

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.089 
rope it just seems to do better because

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:41.629 
rope it just seems to do better because
it<00:06:39.240> does<00:06:39.360> have<00:06:39.509> that<00:06:39.659> give<00:06:40.020> and<00:06:40.349> you're<00:06:41.339> used

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
it does have that give and you're used

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.879 
it does have that give and you're used
to<00:06:41.729> your<00:06:41.849> finger<00:06:42.180> having<00:06:42.479> that<00:06:42.629> give<00:06:42.870> on<00:06:43.229> on

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
to your finger having that give on on

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.950 
to your finger having that give on on
applications<00:06:44.729> and<00:06:44.879> it<00:06:45.029> just<00:06:45.240> it<00:06:45.449> doesn't<00:06:45.629> feel

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
applications and it just it doesn't feel

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.499 
applications and it just it doesn't feel
right<00:06:46.370> for<00:06:47.370> it<00:06:47.430> to<00:06:47.520> come<00:06:47.669> to<00:06:47.699> a<00:06:47.849> complete<00:06:48.180> stop

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
right for it to come to a complete stop

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.749 
right for it to come to a complete stop
with<00:06:48.810> the<00:06:48.930> jot<00:06:49.199> when<00:06:49.409> you're<00:06:49.529> playing<00:06:49.759> playing

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
with the jot when you're playing playing

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.499 
with the jot when you're playing playing
games<00:06:51.060> or<00:06:51.419> navigating<00:06:52.069> so<00:06:53.069> personally<00:06:53.969> I'm

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:54.509 
games or navigating so personally I'm

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.200 
games or navigating so personally I'm
going<00:06:54.719> to<00:06:54.779> use<00:06:54.930> them<00:06:55.110> both<00:06:55.289> I<00:06:56.089> think<00:06:57.089> they're

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
going to use them both I think they're

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.230 
going to use them both I think they're
both<00:06:57.330> great<00:06:57.389> and<00:06:58.009> I<00:06:59.009> just<00:06:59.729> think<00:06:59.849> they<00:07:00.120> have

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
both great and I just think they have

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.600 
both great and I just think they have
different<00:07:00.659> uses<00:07:00.930> different<00:07:01.469> times<00:07:01.710> you<00:07:02.189> know

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
different uses different times you know

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.100 
different uses different times you know
to<00:07:02.669> be<00:07:02.909> used<00:07:04.520> the<00:07:05.520> Adonit<00:07:06.060> jot<00:07:06.210> Pro<00:07:06.389> I<00:07:06.599> will<00:07:06.930> say

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
to be used the Adonit jot Pro I will say

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.119 
to be used the Adonit jot Pro I will say
is<00:07:07.289> $30<00:07:08.360> so<00:07:09.360> if<00:07:09.659> you're<00:07:09.810> on<00:07:09.899> a<00:07:09.930> budget<00:07:10.139> it's<00:07:10.620> you

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:11.129 
is $30 so if you're on a budget it's you

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.429 
is $30 so if you're on a budget it's you
know<00:07:11.250> it's<00:07:11.699> something<00:07:12.000> to<00:07:12.149> consider<00:07:12.360> the<00:07:13.229> Box

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:13.439 
know it's something to consider the Box

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:16.999 
know it's something to consider the Box

one go with the box wave it's a little

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:45.320 
one go with the box wave it's a little
more<00:07:42.990> versatile<00:07:43.560> it's<00:07:44.399> more<00:07:44.550> forgiving<00:07:45.060> and

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:45.330
