after I cut the lace off the front it

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.509 
after I cut the lace off the front it
was<00:03:16.950> shedding<00:03:17.430> even<00:03:17.819> more<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.510> um<00:03:19.380> yeah<00:03:20.370> it

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
soon as you put your fingers through it

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.110 
soon as you put your fingers through it
and<00:03:27.660> shits<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.170> it's<00:03:28.590> not<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.579> but<00:03:29.880> it

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
