have did that and made farfetch a little

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.000 
have did that and made farfetch a little
bit<00:02:32.520> more<00:02:32.700> appealing<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.720> players<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.800> um

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
bit more appealing to the players but um

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.070 
bit more appealing to the players but um

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
yeah that's why I want far-fetched to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.220 
yeah that's why I want far-fetched to
evolve<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.680> stats<00:02:38.040> are<00:02:38.310> pretty<00:02:38.730> low<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.810> it

should definitely get a pre evolution if
any<00:02:53.280> kind<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.730> evolution<00:02:54.270> whatsoever<00:02:54.780> piswyck

should get a pre evolution because as

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.290 
should get a pre evolution because as
look<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:57.720> stats<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.470> already<00:02:58.770> breaks<00:02:59.190> 500<00:03:00.150> in

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
look at stats it already breaks 500 in

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.930 
look at stats it already breaks 500 in
terms<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.990> base<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.260> total<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.550> only<00:03:02.790> that

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
terms of a base that total not only that

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.000 
terms of a base that total not only that
but<00:03:03.000> look<00:03:03.270> at<00:03:03.390> his<00:03:03.510> attack<00:03:03.900> stat<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.770> tax

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
but look at his attack stat it's a tax

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.460 
but look at his attack stat it's a tax
that<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.280> completely<00:03:05.850> monstrous<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:07.230> that

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470

is on par with hair cross like honestly

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.540 
is on par with hair cross like honestly
pincer<00:03:11.900> deserves<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.200> pre<00:03:13.650> evolution<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.310> some

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
pincer deserves a pre evolution of some

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.240 
pincer deserves a pre evolution of some
kind<00:03:14.790> now<00:03:15.330> some<00:03:15.900> people<00:03:15.930> might<00:03:16.170> say<00:03:16.590> we<00:03:17.100> don't

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
sense you would think that since Pokemon

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.229 
sense you would think that since Pokemon
are<00:03:46.260> based<00:03:46.530> off<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:46.890> real<00:03:47.340> life<00:03:47.580> things<00:03:47.880> like

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
are based off of real life things like

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.570 
are based off of real life things like
animals<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.050> bugs<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.530> whatever<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.190> will

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
animals and bugs and whatever you will

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.910 
animals and bugs and whatever you will
think<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.150> Pokemon<00:03:51.660> would<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.170> know<00:03:52.320> go

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
think that a Pokemon would you know go

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.310 
think that a Pokemon would you know go
by<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.190> same<00:03:53.489> rule<00:03:53.760> right<00:03:54.060> well<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.810> mean<00:03:55.110> not

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
by the same rule right well I mean not

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.740 
by the same rule right well I mean not
pincer<00:03:55.860> because<00:03:56.190> pincer<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:57.060> eat<00:03:57.209> just

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
pincer because pincer just eat just

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.470 
pincer because pincer just eat just
hatches<00:03:58.140> from<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.350> egg<00:03:58.470> as<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.250> pincer<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.150> it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
hatches from the egg as a pincer and it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.670 
hatches from the egg as a pincer and it
stays<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.780> way<00:04:00.989> for<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.260> rest<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.500> his<00:04:01.620> life

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
stays that way for the rest of his life

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.759 
stays that way for the rest of his life
yeah<00:04:02.370> okay<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.180> may<00:04:03.390> get<00:04:03.630> bigger<00:04:04.019> or<00:04:04.380> something

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
yeah okay it may get bigger or something

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.160 
yeah okay it may get bigger or something
in<00:04:04.950> like<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.250> actual<00:04:05.760> Pokemon<00:04:06.239> world<00:04:06.480> but<00:04:07.050> in

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
in like the actual Pokemon world but in

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.080 
in like the actual Pokemon world but in
the<00:04:07.320> game<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.860> doesn't<00:04:08.220> get<00:04:08.340> any<00:04:08.400> bigger<00:04:08.790> it

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
the game it doesn't get any bigger it

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.759 
the game it doesn't get any bigger it
just<00:04:09.300> sits<00:04:09.570> there<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.380> it's<00:04:10.709> just

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
just sits there and it's just it's just

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.270 
just sits there and it's just it's just
a<00:04:10.980> pen<00:04:11.310> sir<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:12.660> kind<00:04:13.050> of<00:04:13.170> just<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.590> doesn't

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
a pen sir and it kind of just it doesn't

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.400 
a pen sir and it kind of just it doesn't
make<00:04:14.400> any<00:04:14.700> sense<00:04:15.090> whatsoever<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.140> does

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
make any sense whatsoever that it does

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.440 
make any sense whatsoever that it does
that<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.160> think<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.729> should<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.299> know

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
that so I think that should you know

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.560 
that so I think that should you know
have<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:19.140> baby<00:04:19.769> form<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.400> pre<00:04:20.669> evolution<00:04:21.269> that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
have a baby form a pre evolution that

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.450 
have a baby form a pre evolution that
can<00:04:21.780> hatch<00:04:21.989> out<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.229> an<00:04:22.380> egg<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.890> then<00:04:23.310> you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
can hatch out of an egg and then you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.580 
can hatch out of an egg and then you
know<00:04:23.640> with<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.000> proper<00:04:24.600> grinding<00:04:25.350> and

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
know with the proper grinding and

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.980 
know with the proper grinding and
training<00:04:26.190> or<00:04:26.310> whatever<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.940> can<00:04:27.120> become<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.690> pen

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
training or whatever it can become a pen

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.780 
training or whatever it can become a pen
skirt<00:04:28.320> that's<00:04:28.680> why<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:28.979> feel<00:04:29.250> like<00:04:29.370> pencils

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
skirt that's why I feel like pencils

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.640 
skirt that's why I feel like pencils
deserves<00:04:30.390> a<00:04:30.600> pre<00:04:30.870> evolution<00:04:31.320> more<00:04:31.500> than

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
deserves a pre evolution more than

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.390 
deserves a pre evolution more than
evolution

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
evolution

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.340 
evolution
so<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.210> pokemon<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.660> his<00:04:33.900> number<00:04:33.990> three<00:04:34.320> on

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
so the pokemon that his number three on

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.439 
so the pokemon that his number three on
my<00:04:34.440> list<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.889> Lapras<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.759> Lapras<00:04:36.120> it's<00:04:36.330> my

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
my list is Lapras and Lapras it's my

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.600 
my list is Lapras and Lapras it's my
list<00:04:36.690> for<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.139> same<00:04:37.320> exact<00:04:37.740> reason<00:04:38.070> as<00:04:38.190> penser

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
list for the same exact reason as penser

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.990 
list for the same exact reason as penser
it<00:04:38.820> has<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> very<00:04:39.570> high<00:04:39.870> stat<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.070> terms<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.490> HP

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
it has a very high stat in terms of HP

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.779 
it has a very high stat in terms of HP
it<00:04:42.210> breaks<00:04:42.720> 500<00:04:43.320> in<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.470> base<00:04:43.680> stat<00:04:43.949> total<00:04:44.400> not

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
it breaks 500 in the base stat total not

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.090 
it breaks 500 in the base stat total not
only<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.419> but<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:45.870> came<00:04:46.050> out<00:04:46.199> in<00:04:46.350> jan<00:04:46.530> one<00:04:46.830> and

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
only that but it came out in jan one and

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.400 
only that but it came out in jan one and
i<00:04:47.580> think<00:04:47.850> i<00:04:47.940> should<00:04:48.000> get<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.600> pre<00:04:48.930> evolution

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
i think i should get a pre evolution

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.170 
i think i should get a pre evolution
more<00:04:49.590> than<00:04:49.740> an<00:04:49.830> evolution<00:04:50.310> because<00:04:50.520> like<00:04:51.060> i

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
more than an evolution because like i

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.360 
more than an evolution because like i
said<00:04:51.210> same<00:04:51.720> reason<00:04:52.050> Spencer<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.650> not<00:04:53.250> only

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
said same reason Spencer and not only

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.180 
said same reason Spencer and not only
that<00:04:53.490> but<00:04:53.669> Lapras<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.360> also<00:04:54.720> dual<00:04:55.080> type<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:56.100> you

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
that but Lapras is also dual type so you

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.710 
that but Lapras is also dual type so you
know<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.580> free<00:04:56.759> evolution<00:04:57.210> could<00:04:57.330> be<00:04:57.449> no

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
know it's free evolution could be no

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.510 
know it's free evolution could be no
single<00:04:58.080> type<00:04:58.259> and<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.650> can<00:04:58.860> get<00:04:59.039> like<00:04:59.220> it's

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
single type and it can get like it's

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.820 
single type and it can get like it's
let's<00:05:00.270> say<00:05:00.389> ice<00:05:00.630> typing<00:05:01.169> when<00:05:01.289> it<00:05:01.440> evolves

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
let's say ice typing when it evolves

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.770 
let's say ice typing when it evolves
into<00:05:02.009> a<00:05:02.160> Lapras<00:05:02.669> so<00:05:03.090> there's<00:05:03.300> really<00:05:03.419> not<00:05:03.600> much

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
into a Lapras so there's really not much

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.680 
into a Lapras so there's really not much
to<00:05:03.840> explain<00:05:04.350> with<00:05:04.590> Lapras<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:05.639> yeah<00:05:06.240> it's<00:05:06.510> same

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
to explain with Lapras so yeah it's same

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.140 
to explain with Lapras so yeah it's same
reason<00:05:07.020> Spencer<00:05:07.410> so<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.250> pokemon<00:05:08.639> is<00:05:08.729> crackin

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
reason Spencer so the pokemon is crackin

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.000 
reason Spencer so the pokemon is crackin
number<00:05:09.360> two<00:05:09.510> on<00:05:09.660> this<00:05:09.780> cantelle<00:05:10.169> list<00:05:10.410> is<00:05:10.590> jinx

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
number two on this cantelle list is jinx

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.620 
number two on this cantelle list is jinx
and<00:05:11.160> jinx<00:05:11.520> is<00:05:11.610> hitting<00:05:11.880> this<00:05:12.000> list<00:05:12.240> because<00:05:12.419> I

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
and jinx is hitting this list because I

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.659 
and jinx is hitting this list because I
feel<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:13.350> even<00:05:13.889> though<00:05:14.100> jinx<00:05:14.430> has<00:05:14.520> an

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
feel that even though jinx has an

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.090 
feel that even though jinx has an
evolution<00:05:15.150> line<00:05:15.300> of<00:05:15.539> you<00:05:16.260> know<00:05:16.380> Smoochum<00:05:16.979> to

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
evolution line of you know Smoochum to

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.400 
evolution line of you know Smoochum to
jinx<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.550> think<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:17.910> jinx<00:05:18.330> should<00:05:18.840> evolve

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
jinx I think that jinx should evolve

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.250 
jinx I think that jinx should evolve
into<00:05:19.889> something<00:05:20.070> else<00:05:20.430> because<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.720> mean<00:05:22.020> even

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
into something else because I mean even

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.620 
into something else because I mean even

pre evolutions just like jinx did and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.110 
pre evolutions just like jinx did and
