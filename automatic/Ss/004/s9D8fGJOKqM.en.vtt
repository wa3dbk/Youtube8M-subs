00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880

which but he'll basically have to go

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.160 
which but he'll basically have to go
through<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.830> map<00:03:42.040> defusing<00:03:42.730> bombs<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.360> while

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
through the map defusing bombs and while

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.750 
through the map defusing bombs and while
your<00:03:44.440> team<00:03:44.710> will<00:03:44.890> have<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.430> know<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.670> rest

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
your team will have you know the rest

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.130

your<00:03:45.940> team<00:03:46.060> will<00:03:46.210> have<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.420> protect<00:03:46.750> him<00:03:46.870> while

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
your team will have to protect him while

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.170

he<00:03:47.380> diffuses<00:03:47.770> these<00:03:47.890> bombs<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.460> guess<00:03:49.030> he's

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
he diffuses these bombs I guess he's

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.960 
he diffuses these bombs I guess he's
vulnerable<00:03:49.390> from<00:03:49.960> behind<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.650> he's<00:03:51.340> also<00:03:51.550> he

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
vulnerable from behind and he's also he

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.520 
vulnerable from behind and he's also he
can<00:03:52.000> soak<00:03:52.270> up<00:03:52.390> some<00:03:52.600> damage<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:52.930> he's<00:03:53.200> got<00:03:53.350> some

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
can soak up some damage to he's got some

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.530 
can soak up some damage to he's got some
armor<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:54.580> think<00:03:54.910> it's<00:03:55.030> kind<00:03:55.120> of<00:03:55.210> funny<00:03:55.270> that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
armor I think it's kind of funny that

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.790 
armor I think it's kind of funny that
he's<00:03:55.660> got<00:03:55.750> an<00:03:55.840> automatic<00:03:56.080> shotgun<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.770> a

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
he's got an automatic shotgun and a

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.410 
he's got an automatic shotgun and a
grenade<00:03:57.100> launcher<00:03:57.520> it's<00:03:57.790> just<00:03:58.000> interesting

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
grenade launcher it's just interesting

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.960 
grenade launcher it's just interesting
to<00:03:58.690> me<00:03:58.840> two<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> most<00:03:59.970> classically

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
unbalanced weapons and in the gaming

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.520 
unbalanced weapons and in the gaming
history<00:04:03.130> this<00:04:03.910> one<00:04:04.210> guy<00:04:04.390> has<00:04:04.630> on<00:04:04.840> top<00:04:05.140> of<00:04:05.320> some
