going to add the food and this is

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.600 
going to add the food and this is
basically<00:03:06.870> what<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.260> do<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.650> break<00:03:08.310> up<00:03:08.340> some

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
basically what I do I just break up some

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.900 
basically what I do I just break up some
organic<00:03:09.090> carrots<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.890> yes<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.190> feed<00:03:11.640> mine

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
organic carrots and yes I feed mine

organic carrots and yes I feed mine
organic<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.490> reason<00:03:14.850> being<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.330> because

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
organic and the reason being is because

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.699 
organic and the reason being is because
my<00:03:16.860> chickens<00:03:18.770> chicken<00:03:19.770> feed<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.160> organic<00:03:20.640> and

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
my chickens chicken feed is organic and

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.160 
my chickens chicken feed is organic and
so<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:24.740> my<00:03:25.740> eggs<00:03:25.980> because<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:27.030> feed<00:03:27.480> my<00:03:27.750> chickens

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
so is my eggs because I feed my chickens

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.160 
so is my eggs because I feed my chickens
organically<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:30.030> since<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.600> feed<00:03:30.930> my

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
organically and so since I feed my
