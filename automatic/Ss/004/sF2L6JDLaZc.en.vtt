00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
actually not restricting a movement so

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:53.670 
actually not restricting a movement so
let's<00:00:20.010> move<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.970> high<00:00:21.510> mobility<00:00:21.750> mode

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.829 

so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.680 

and<00:00:59.839> that's<00:01:00.710> pretty<00:01:00.859> quick<00:01:01.190> this<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.120> high

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
and that's pretty quick this is a high

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.410 
and that's pretty quick this is a high
mobility<00:01:02.929> form<00:01:03.530> we're<00:01:04.159> off<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> skirt<00:01:05.000> arm<00:01:05.239> and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
mobility form we're off a skirt arm and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.260 
mobility form we're off a skirt arm and
now<00:01:05.540> transformed<00:01:06.200> into<00:01:06.470> this<00:01:07.270> really

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
now transformed into this really

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.990 
now transformed into this really
beautiful<00:01:08.509> wings<00:01:09.280> well<00:01:10.280> its<00:01:10.460> use<00:01:10.640> of<00:01:10.670> our

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
don't want to do it now because I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.540 
don't want to do it now because I
actually<00:03:49.150> haven't<00:03:49.900> play<00:03:50.830> around<00:03:51.100> with<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.370> too

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
actually haven't play around with it too

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.280 
actually haven't play around with it too
much<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.120> was<00:03:52.300> certain<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.750> if<00:03:53.020> I<00:03:53.140> play

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
much but I was certain that if I play

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.380 
much but I was certain that if I play
around<00:03:53.320> with<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.740> bit<00:03:53.920> too<00:03:54.070> much<00:03:54.240> they<00:03:55.240> will

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
around with a bit too much they will

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.370 
around with a bit too much they will
come<00:03:55.540> off<00:03:55.800> ahead<00:03:57.030> in<00:03:58.030> full<00:03:58.390> album<00:03:58.690> rock<00:03:58.900> forms

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
come off ahead in full album rock forms

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.900 
come off ahead in full album rock forms
so<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.650> can<00:03:59.800> turn<00:03:59.980> her<00:04:00.130> head<00:04:00.160> anymore<00:04:00.580> because

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
so you can turn her head anymore because

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.500 
so you can turn her head anymore because
the<00:04:01.750> amount<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.140> hair<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.800> has<00:04:02.920> on<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.160> back

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the amount of hair so it has on the back

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.090 
the amount of hair so it has on the back
so<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.600> can<00:04:04.720> only<00:04:04.959> wiggle<00:04:05.410> really<00:04:05.890> tour

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
so you can only wiggle really tour

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.120 
so you can only wiggle really tour
around<00:04:06.480> just<00:04:07.480> enough<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.080> make<00:04:08.110> her<00:04:08.740> looks<00:04:08.980> at

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
around just enough to make her looks at

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.660 
around just enough to make her looks at
you<00:04:09.610> looking<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.030> left<00:04:10.060> or<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.570> right

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
you looking to the left or to the right

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.090 
you looking to the left or to the right
and<00:04:12.670> also<00:04:13.120> because<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.660> them<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:14.019> those<00:04:14.800> hair

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
and also because of them of those hair

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.820 
and also because of them of those hair
I'm<00:04:15.790> cognitive<00:04:16.540> ways<00:04:16.750> too<00:04:17.109> high<00:04:17.350> up<00:04:17.590> either

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
I'm cognitive ways too high up either

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.580 
I'm cognitive ways too high up either
with<00:04:18.250> all<00:04:18.459> start<00:04:18.730> to<00:04:19.000> interfere<00:04:19.660> with<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
with all start to interfere with the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.950 
with all start to interfere with the
rest<00:04:20.830> of<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.310> construction<00:04:21.760> by<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.630> way<00:04:22.810> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
rest of the construction by the way the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.540 
rest of the construction by the way the
wings<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.380> not<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.770> Wayans<00:04:23.980> action<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.520> a

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
wings is not the Wayans action on a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.820 
wings is not the Wayans action on a
separate<00:04:24.940> joint<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:25.900> they<00:04:26.200> can<00:04:26.380> actually<00:04:26.680> go

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
separate joint so they can actually go

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.719 
separate joint so they can actually go
in<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.130> out<00:04:27.630> any<00:04:28.630> way<00:04:28.840> you<00:04:28.900> want<00:04:29.229> without

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
in and out any way you want without

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.620 
in and out any way you want without
affecting<00:04:30.729> anything<00:04:32.250> but<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.460> yeah<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:34.450> only

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
affecting anything but so yeah the only

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.000 
affecting anything but so yeah the only
thing<00:04:34.810> that<00:04:35.169> is<00:04:35.290> actually<00:04:35.590> bad<00:04:35.770> about

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
thing that is actually bad about

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.969 
thing that is actually bad about
altering<00:04:36.400> i<00:04:36.550> will<00:04:36.729> say<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.540> hair<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.050> if

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
altering i will say is the hair and if

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.250 
altering i will say is the hair and if
that<00:04:39.190> is<00:04:39.340> actually<00:04:39.850> if<00:04:40.600> you<00:04:40.780> had<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:40.990> consider
