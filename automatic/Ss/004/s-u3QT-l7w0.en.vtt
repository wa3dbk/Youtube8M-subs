00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:19.080
 the 14 th of July 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:19.080
 Tyunina in boats the hummingbird pool pool 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:37.770
 boat kolibri 3 meter resistance 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.770
 nice im still here's a chair turning 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 it's put in the center hi luda and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:58.050
 children ride 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:58.050
 in Turkey tuning 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.270
 in short, you need to move more caps 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:18.610
 leaning all calm if you move 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:21.690
 janitor you are full tough they did not set 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.690
 I have it on the shore 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.970
 I play easier called yes this one 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:39.770
 turn 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:39.770
 hooks up to speak grab lower 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:02:12.090
 well now what is the best tuning 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:02:21.030
 let's get it right it moves a little bit 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:21.770
 against the chair this moves closer to 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.680
 paradise 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.680
 2 on 1 then over more steadily 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.459
 more stable so the chair itself keeps 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.819
 in me thank god 115 kilograms keeps 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.590
 easy 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.890
 Well, I want to draw attention to these 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.250
 transom wheels firm caliber and the same 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.480
 the coolest thing is very good 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.909
 they will not lower our after 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:03:00.760
 last muddy fishing to swimming pool and 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:03:05.439
 so of course the material is 110 in thickness 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.439
 boat boat 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.660
 there is a movie here too 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.990
 custom made anchor 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.990
 roller 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.280
 thought of doing tuning 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:48.820
 right above the pools now left 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:52.270
 just go to the big water to collect 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.730
 assemble spinning put the coil 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:07.400
 safety bottom and run this run 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:10.670
 fish dishes come here 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:24.880
 OFDM suggested it before and I myself 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:27.860
 I switched or something and hit the VGIK 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.330
 listening in moscow was just passing i 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.330
 I did not even see the red square 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.110
 such are the things 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:53.110
 ok here it turns off 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.560
 anyway j is 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:31.870
 This operator clones even ideological 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.870
 mastermind for this tuner itself 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:47.820
 they are not taken off by the muffin 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:47.820
