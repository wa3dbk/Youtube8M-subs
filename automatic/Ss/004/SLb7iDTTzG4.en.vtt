00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
life my drive was that I just always

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.690 
life my drive was that I just always
wanted<00:00:08.100> to<00:00:08.130> play<00:00:08.220> football

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.100 

my<00:00:11.700> first<00:00:11.940> time<00:00:12.090> translating<00:00:12.480> football<00:00:12.900> was

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
my first time translating football was

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.290 
my first time translating football was
in<00:00:13.260> middle<00:00:13.500> school<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.040> tried<00:00:14.310> to<00:00:14.670> join<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> Pop

in middle school I tried to join the Pop

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.270 
in middle school I tried to join the Pop
Warner<00:00:15.330> team<00:00:15.810> and<00:00:16.380> I<00:00:16.680> guess<00:00:16.980> there<00:00:17.130> was<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
Warner team and I guess there was a

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.640 
Warner team and I guess there was a
weight<00:00:17.610> limit<00:00:17.940> up<00:00:18.060> by<00:00:18.210> 180<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.500> already

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
weight limit up by 180 and I was already

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.710 
weight limit up by 180 and I was already
like<00:00:19.860> 200<00:00:20.430> pounds<00:00:20.790> it<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.450> kind<00:00:21.660> of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
like 200 pounds it was kind of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
like 200 pounds it was kind of
devastating<00:00:22.290> to<00:00:22.529> hear<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.950> couldn't<00:00:23.310> play

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369

devastating to hear that I couldn't play
football

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
