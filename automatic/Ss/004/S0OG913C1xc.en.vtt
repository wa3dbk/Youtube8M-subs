00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
closer apparently these factory couplers

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.460 
closer apparently these factory couplers
that<00:01:44.610> came<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.420> car<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.899> original

not lining up right there way too long I

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.080 
not lining up right there way too long I
can<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.670> on

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
super great on them they roll fairly

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.589 
super great on them they roll fairly
well<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.180> makes<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.659> cars<00:02:06.930> shake<00:02:08.599> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
well but it makes the cars shake the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.160 
well but it makes the cars shake the
second<00:02:10.170> unit<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:11.039> second<00:02:11.580> car<00:02:11.790> rather

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
the coupler was modified but again I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.050 
the coupler was modified but again I
mean<00:02:16.290> look<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.740> differences<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.580> coupler

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
mean look at the differences and coupler

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.680 
mean look at the differences and coupler
heights<00:02:18.770> they<00:02:19.770> they<00:02:20.100> need<00:02:20.250> work<00:02:20.520> I'm<00:02:21.120> not<00:02:21.210> sure

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
heights they they need work I'm not sure

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.720 
heights they they need work I'm not sure
what<00:02:22.470> needs<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.800> be<00:02:23.010> done<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.520> they

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
what needs to be done but they

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.630 
what needs to be done but they
definitely<00:02:24.240> need<00:02:24.660> work<00:02:29.030> we'll<00:02:30.030> pan<00:02:30.330> down<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
definitely need work we'll pan down the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.820 
definitely need work we'll pan down the
rest<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> Train<00:02:33.450> here<00:02:33.810> slow<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.560> can

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
rest of the Train here slow so you can

see<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:38.900> some<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.020> these<00:02:40.140> have<00:02:40.440> been<00:02:40.470> modified

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
see it some of these have been modified

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
see it some of these have been modified
that<00:02:42.300> when<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.810> coupler<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.320> good<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:45.000> next

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
that when the coupler is good the next

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.020 
that when the coupler is good the next
one<00:02:45.570> it's<00:02:45.750> good<00:02:46.160> although<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.310> haven't<00:02:47.550> had<00:02:47.880> it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
one it's good although I haven't had it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.180 
one it's good although I haven't had it

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
on a Katy gauge yet so I'm not sure

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.130 
on a Katy gauge yet so I'm not sure
whether<00:02:50.370> they're<00:02:50.670> true<00:02:50.970> heights<00:02:51.270> but<00:02:51.720> they're

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
whether they're true heights but they're

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.020 
whether they're true heights but they're
lining<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.710> with<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.980> rest<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> cars<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
lining up with the rest of the cars and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.300 
lining up with the rest of the cars and
this<00:02:54.990> last<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.550> couplers<00:02:57.000> are<00:02:57.030> junk<00:02:58.310> this

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
this last one the couplers are junk this

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.220 
this last one the couplers are junk this
one<00:02:59.550> kept<00:02:59.850> falling<00:03:00.330> off<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> finally<00:03:01.110> just

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
one kept falling off so I finally just

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.390 
one kept falling off so I finally just
took<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.710> off<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.100> get<00:03:02.310> sick<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.820> falling<00:03:03.300> off

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
took it off I get sick of it falling off

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.240 
took it off I get sick of it falling off
so<00:03:05.480> these<00:03:06.480> cars<00:03:06.810> are<00:03:07.050> going<00:03:07.170> back<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.770> storage

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
so these cars are going back and storage

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.440 
so these cars are going back and storage
for<00:03:08.550> now<00:03:08.870> but<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.110> did<00:03:10.320> want<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.650> run<00:03:10.830> them<00:03:11.960> it

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
for now but I did want to run them it

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.960 
for now but I did want to run them it
okay<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.630> here's<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.260> second<00:03:16.800> train<00:03:18.650> three

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
one like the other one back in 98 and it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.720 
one like the other one back in 98 and it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
seemed very little run time so it does

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.290 
seemed very little run time so it does

not<00:04:20.459> really<00:04:20.850> my<00:04:21.030> railroad<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:21.960> I'm<00:04:22.289> not<00:04:22.500> overly

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
not really my railroad so I'm not overly

not really my railroad so I'm not overly

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
concerned about it and don't pay that

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.720 
concerned about it and don't pay that
much<00:04:25.650> attention<00:04:25.860> to

much attention to

much attention to
but<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.690> also<00:04:27.930> noticed<00:04:28.320> something<00:04:28.740> else

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
but I also noticed something else

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.900 
but I also noticed something else
different<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:31.170> car<00:04:31.590> body<00:04:32.570> sets<00:04:33.570> higher<00:04:34.910> on

different the car body sets higher on
these<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:37.470> I'm<00:04:38.010> not<00:04:38.190> sure<00:04:38.430> if<00:04:38.520> that's<00:04:38.700> correct

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
these and I'm not sure if that's correct

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.540 
these and I'm not sure if that's correct
either<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.690> know<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:42.510> early<00:04:42.800> 80s<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:44.190> believe

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
either I know in the early 80s I believe

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.000 
either I know in the early 80s I believe
it<00:04:44.760> was<00:04:45.020> EMD<00:04:46.100> with<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.250> 50<00:04:47.760> series<00:04:48.530> raise<00:04:49.530> the

it was EMD with the 50 series raise the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.480 
it was EMD with the 50 series raise the
frame<00:04:50.460> slightly<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:52.500> I'm<00:04:52.710> not<00:04:52.860> sure<00:04:52.920> if<00:04:53.190> that

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
frame slightly so I'm not sure if that
