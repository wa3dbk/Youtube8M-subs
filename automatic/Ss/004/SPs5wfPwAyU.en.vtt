guys I think it's a very decent score

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.090 
guys I think it's a very decent score
for<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> sniper<00:01:05.040> playing<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> small<00:01:06.060> map<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
pack it's basically insane in my opinion

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.859 
pack it's basically insane in my opinion
it's<00:01:12.299> very<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:13.049> good<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and some stuff that I think most people

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.490 
and some stuff that I think most people
don't<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.149> only<00:01:54.149> some<00:01:54.360> editors<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.259> that

and let's let's start it to talk about

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
and let's let's start it to talk about
it<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.610> those<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.420> know

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
which I think everybody knows this map

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.459 
which I think everybody knows this map
it's<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.340> remake<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:06.030> firing<00:02:06.630> range<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.170> black

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
it's a remake of firing range from black

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.339 
it's a remake of firing range from black
ops<00:02:07.680> 1<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.670> layout<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.479> exactly<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.140> same

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
ops 1 the layout it's exactly the same

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.250 
ops 1 the layout it's exactly the same
but<00:02:10.679> they<00:02:11.520> change<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.150> design<00:02:12.330> or<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
but they change the design or is it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.840 
but they change the design or is it
either<00:02:13.410> way

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
either way

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.640 
either way
around<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.510> design<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.110> same<00:02:15.320> but<00:02:15.500> they

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
around the design is the same but they

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.380 
around the design is the same but they
change<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.010> layout<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.460> don't<00:02:16.730> know<00:02:16.790> what

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
change the layout I don't know what

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.660 
change the layout I don't know what
basically<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.170> same<00:02:18.260> map<00:02:18.670> with

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
basically it's the same map with

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.310 
basically it's the same map with
different<00:02:20.710> constructions<00:02:21.790> different

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
different constructions different

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.700 
different constructions different
pictures<00:02:24.320> different<00:02:24.920> everything<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
pictures different everything but the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.650 
pictures different everything but the
map<00:02:27.890> it's<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.400> same<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.880> that's<00:02:29.300> pretty

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
map it's the same and that's pretty

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.870 
map it's the same and that's pretty
insane<00:02:29.930> because<00:02:30.380> black<00:02:31.040> ops<00:02:31.220> 2<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.670> much

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
insane because black ops 2 it's a much

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.580 
insane because black ops 2 it's a much
faster<00:02:32.240> pace<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.750> game<00:02:32.900> compared<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.470> black

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
faster pace the game compared to black

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.790 
faster pace the game compared to black
ops<00:02:33.860> 1<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.430> it's<00:02:35.240> it's<00:02:35.780> now<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:36.290> funny<00:02:36.590> to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
ops 1 and it's it's now it's funny to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.890 
ops 1 and it's it's now it's funny to
see<00:02:36.980> how<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:38.720> person<00:02:39.470> plays<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:40.400> black<00:02:41.210> ops<00:02:41.390> 1<00:02:41.510> or

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
see how a person plays on black ops 1 or

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.820 
see how a person plays on black ops 1 or
black<00:02:42.200> ops<00:02:42.440> 2<00:02:43.420> because<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.440> same<00:02:45.590> app

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
black ops 2 because it is the same app

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.910 
black ops 2 because it is the same app
but<00:02:46.370> it's<00:02:46.400> played<00:02:46.880> very<00:02:47.300> differently<00:02:48.050> on<00:02:48.440> both

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
but it's played very differently on both

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.400 
but it's played very differently on both
both<00:02:49.490> games<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.780> think<00:02:51.020> you<00:02:51.110> know<00:02:51.140> that's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
both games and I think you know that's

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.460 
both games and I think you know that's
very<00:02:51.650> interesting<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:53.840> must<00:02:54.110> say<00:02:54.260> that

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
very interesting and I must say that

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.100 
very interesting and I must say that
this<00:02:54.890> map<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.640> colors<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.480> map<00:02:56.870> are

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
this map the colors of the map are

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.100 
this map the colors of the map are
really<00:02:57.620> really<00:02:57.830> good<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:59.210> don't<00:02:59.510> get<00:02:59.750> tired

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
really really good you don't get tired

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.400 
really really good you don't get tired
of<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.560> it's<00:03:01.250> insane<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.330> one<00:03:02.780> really<00:03:03.140> good

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
of it it's insane and one really good

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.700 
of it it's insane and one really good
thing<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.850> think<00:03:05.210> most<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:06.230> advanced

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
thing that I think most like advanced

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.760 
thing that I think most like advanced
editors<00:03:07.220> notice<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:09.140> finally<00:03:09.440> have

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
editors notice is that you finally have

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.250 
editors notice is that you finally have
a<00:03:09.800> legit<00:03:10.340> green<00:03:10.970> screen<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.810> mask<00:03:12.050> your

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
a legit green screen to mask your

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.130 
a legit green screen to mask your
weapons<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.240> this<00:03:14.240> is<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.510> first<00:03:14.750> time<00:03:14.960> you

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
weapons and this is the first time you

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.450 
weapons and this is the first time you
know<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.710> a<00:03:15.880> studio<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.980> at<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
know this is a studio and like at the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.490 
know this is a studio and like at the
bottom<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.990> of<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:23.180> map<00:03:23.360> there<00:03:24.140> are<00:03:24.260> some

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
bottom of the of the map there are some

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.650 
bottom of the of the map there are some
green<00:03:24.830> screen<00:03:25.280> stuff<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.360> use

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
green screen stuff that you can use

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.750 
green screen stuff that you can use
actually<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.560> edit<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.160> do<00:03:28.310> some<00:03:28.520> sick

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
actually to edit and do some sick

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.510 
actually to edit and do some sick
transitions<00:03:29.450> or<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.650> know<00:03:30.770> just<00:03:30.800> some

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
transitions or you know just some

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.410 
transitions or you know just some
effects<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:33.190> most<00:03:34.190> most<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.970> times<00:03:35.210> you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
effects that most most of the times you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.630 
effects that most most of the times you
are<00:03:35.570> not<00:03:35.840> able<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.320> do<00:03:36.440> because<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.550> know

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
are not able to do because you know

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.270 
are not able to do because you know
there<00:03:37.850> is<00:03:37.880> no<00:03:38.120> green<00:03:38.510> screen<00:03:38.960> but<00:03:39.740> now<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.010> can

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
there is no green screen but now you can

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.760 
there is no green screen but now you can
do<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.940> think<00:03:41.240> most<00:03:41.720> editors<00:03:42.110> will<00:03:42.560> take

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
do it and I think most editors will take

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.740 
do it and I think most editors will take
advantage<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.850> we<00:03:44.060> will<00:03:44.210> try<00:03:44.390> you

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
advantage of that and we will try you

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.660 
advantage of that and we will try you
know<00:03:44.960> to<00:03:45.170> make<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.800> best<00:03:45.980> out<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.430> and

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
know to make the best out of it and

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.020 
know to make the best out of it and
that's<00:03:46.820> going<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.150> be<00:03:47.330> really<00:03:47.480> really<00:03:47.780> good<00:03:49.030> so

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
that's going to be really really good so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.500 
that's going to be really really good so
some<00:03:50.330> of<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:50.600> may<00:03:50.990> be<00:03:51.020> wondering<00:03:51.260> why<00:03:52.070> i

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
some of you may be wondering why i

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.920 
some of you may be wondering why i
haven't<00:03:53.510> uploaded<00:03:53.990> like<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:55.100> clip<00:03:55.490> or<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:56.390> data

haven't uploaded like a clip or a data
and<00:03:57.410> all<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.790> because<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.540> last<00:03:59.720> dlc

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
and all that because on the last dlc

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.850 
and all that because on the last dlc
things<00:04:01.220> went<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:02.060> know<00:04:02.090> perfectly<00:04:02.810> insane<00:04:03.500> on

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
things went you know perfectly insane on

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.600 
things went you know perfectly insane on
the<00:04:04.340> first<00:04:04.550> day<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:05.630> on<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.870> new<00:04:06.680> dlc<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
the first day but on this new dlc the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.740 
the first day but on this new dlc the
only<00:04:07.790> thing<00:04:07.970> I've<00:04:08.120> got<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.420> two<00:04:08.900> splits<00:04:09.700> clips

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
only thing I've got is two splits clips

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.510 
only thing I've got is two splits clips
so<00:04:11.750> i<00:04:11.780> will<00:04:12.260> probably<00:04:12.470> not<00:04:12.860> going<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.280> do<00:04:13.490> a

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
so i will probably not going to do a

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.050 
so i will probably not going to do a
data<00:04:14.020> however<00:04:15.070> if<00:04:16.070> something<00:04:16.640> happens

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
data however if something happens

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.810 
data however if something happens
tonight<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.930> it's<00:04:18.109> insane<00:04:18.950> i<00:04:19.280> will<00:04:19.520> upload

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
tonight that it's insane i will upload

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.330 
tonight that it's insane i will upload
it<00:04:20.090> but<00:04:20.420> i<00:04:20.450> don't<00:04:20.540> think<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.380> tomorrow<00:04:22.220> I'm

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
it but i don't think so and tomorrow I'm
