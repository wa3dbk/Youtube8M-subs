00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.640
 in our last video about the flower of 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.590
 chocolate 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.190
 Several people have asked me to 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:20.080
 teach how to make a corito to return to 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.390
 do a little bit you can see it 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.000
 we use it as a mini sleeve 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.760
 pastry and chocolate is very useful 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.790
 especially when we have to do 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.850
 some small details or write 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.710
 as if it were a pencil 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.149
 and if he has never taught you to do it by 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.780
 the truth that has a little bit of 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.379
 complication but as you will see once 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.379
 taught is very easy 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.110
 we take a piece of paper from oven 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.110
 any oven that looks these 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 non-stick 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 and we cut a triangular 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 we mark it well 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.320
 the knife 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:15.820
 is cutting multi neither the triangular 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.970
 and with this we start 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.190
 very simple we put the triangulation with 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.390
 the main tip right angle 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.680
 looking up 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.680
 we take one of the sides 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.960
 we put it 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.430
 same as the major angle and we give it the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.430
 high request 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.420
 in such a way 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.990
 that fits us well equal adif to the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.909
 corners 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.649
 with the other piece of paper that we have 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.649
 we turn around 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.300
 that has been formed simply to put 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.210
 that point in its place 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.750
 and we have a perfect way 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.750
 should be 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.160
 now we have to bend carefully 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.160
 this part 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.270
 but not 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.580
 to prevent us from developing 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.390
 and a little trick is 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.900
 break a bit of the paper and go back to 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.900
 fold it 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.190
 carefully 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.690
 to ensure much better especially the 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.190
 outer layer of the cone has remained 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.190
 with or totally closed 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.940
 and able to receive our chocolate 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.250
 whenever we fill a cone of 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.560
 chocolate is important to use a little 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.560
 and if not then at the same time it was going to be 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.380
 complicated 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.380
 to close it we make a double first 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.540
 another second d 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.620
 we put the little tips inside 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.470
 and we go back to hours and now we're going 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.120
 bending until you get certain 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.750
 tension the cone and start to come out 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.750
 chocolate by the tip 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.300
 we already have our 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.300
 as ready 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.980
 works 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.310
 that we want to cut more or 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.310
 less 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.330
 we can make cartoons 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.530
 do not 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.450
 I want 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.379
 the technique 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.489
 and here you have it 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.400
 As you can see, it 's very simple 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.770
 but there is a trick 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.319
 if we are in a hurry 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.940
 and we do not want to catch up we do not have 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.470
 Oven paper we do not have to do 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.360
 details especially if you simply 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.039
 we need a sleeve for a moment 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.129
 punctual to fill a glass of a 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.720
 dessert we hope to do for example 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.150
 the video of the flowers is not later 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.080
 in this type there is a tube that is 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.180
 using 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.930
 a sponge of conservation of all the 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.340
 lifetime 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.870
 Let's see 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.870
 we doubled a little 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.919
 we are also chocolate 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.280
 Y 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.630
 a sort cites our own 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.090
 and again with scissors 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.580
 we cut him there the tip 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.930
 this type of manga gives us less 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.030
 mobility or less precision because it's going to 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.260
 leave a thicker thread generally and 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.770
 it's harder to control 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.810
 but to make a coin as is the 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.490
 logic case let's make the petals 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.520
 of chocolate 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.629
 it serves us perfectly 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.000
 I hope you liked it and you know 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.710
