and<00:01:08.960> we<00:01:09.350> use<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.530> small<00:01:09.890> sample<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.400> soil<00:01:10.640> that

and we use a small sample of soil that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.030 
and we use a small sample of soil that
we've<00:01:10.910> just<00:01:11.090> taken<00:01:11.300> from<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.660> garden<00:01:12.040> break

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
we've just taken from the garden break

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.930 
we've just taken from the garden break
up<00:01:13.250> any<00:01:13.400> lumps<00:01:13.700> using<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.390> supplied<00:01:14.750> stick

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
up any lumps using the supplied stick

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.470 
up any lumps using the supplied stick
and<00:01:16.940> it's<00:01:17.390> looking<00:01:17.840> good<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.060> then<00:01:20.060> add<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.240> few

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
and it's looking good and then add a few

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.580 
and it's looking good and then add a few
drops<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:20.990> indicator<00:01:21.440> liquid<00:01:21.890> first<00:01:22.190> and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
drops of the indicator liquid first and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.250 
drops of the indicator liquid first and
then<00:01:24.590> mix<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.040> will<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.790> make<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.270> thick<00:01:26.870> sort<00:01:27.110> of

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
then mix it will to make a thick sort of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.510 
then mix it will to make a thick sort of
paste<00:01:28.300> yeah<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:29.900> about<00:01:30.230> perfect<00:01:33.520> yeah

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
paste yeah it's about perfect yeah

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.030 
paste yeah it's about perfect yeah
looking<00:01:35.390> good<00:01:35.570> then<00:01:36.110> sprinkle<00:01:36.619> with<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.770> white

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
looking good then sprinkle with a white

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.390 
looking good then sprinkle with a white
barium<00:01:37.550> powder<00:01:37.820> from<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.180> puffer<00:01:38.540> bottle<00:01:39.400> it

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
barium powder from the puffer bottle it

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.770 
barium powder from the puffer bottle it
should<00:01:40.580> be<00:01:40.729> enough<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.210> then<00:01:41.330> leave<00:01:41.510> it<00:01:41.660> for

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
should be enough and then leave it for

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.710 
should be enough and then leave it for
about<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:42.020> minute<00:01:42.260> to<00:01:42.410> develop<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.010> color<00:01:43.720> this

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
about a minute to develop the color this

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.480 
about a minute to develop the color this
color<00:01:44.990> chart<00:01:45.380> which<00:01:45.740> has<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.040> be<00:01:46.100> kept<00:01:46.340> in<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
color chart which has to be kept in the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.249 
color chart which has to be kept in the
dark<00:01:46.760> by<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.030> way<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.300> was<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.780> colors<00:01:48.110> will

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
dark by the way I was the colors will

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.650 
dark by the way I was the colors will
fade<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:49.160> needs<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.850> be<00:01:49.970> compared<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.540> the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
fade it needs to be compared to the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.480 
fade it needs to be compared to the
color<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.170> samples<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.070> can<00:01:52.250> see

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
color of the samples so that you can see

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.760 
color of the samples so that you can see
this<00:01:52.820> one's<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.300> alkaline<00:01:53.720> range<00:01:54.080> very

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
this one's in the alkaline range very

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.800 
this one's in the alkaline range very
alkaline<00:01:55.190> in<00:01:55.460> fact<00:01:55.640> right<00:01:56.030> there<00:01:56.330> and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
alkaline in fact right there and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.410 
alkaline in fact right there and
simulate<00:01:57.320> pH<00:01:58.040> 8<00:01:58.310> yeah<00:01:58.880> that's<00:01:59.090> what<00:01:59.240> you'd

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
simulate pH 8 yeah that's what you'd

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.039 
simulate pH 8 yeah that's what you'd
expect

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.709 

in<00:02:05.039> vegetable<00:02:05.640> beds<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> fairly<00:02:06.479> high

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
in vegetable beds with a fairly high

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.839 
in vegetable beds with a fairly high
nutrient<00:02:07.469> load<00:02:07.679> the<00:02:07.859> pH<00:02:08.160> readings<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.819> can

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
nutrient load the pH readings you can

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.300 
nutrient load the pH readings you can
expect<00:02:09.360> would<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.569> quite<00:02:09.840> different<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:11.099> take

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
expect would be quite different we take

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.820 
expect would be quite different we take
a<00:02:11.340> sample<00:02:11.670> near<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> root<00:02:12.360> sign<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:13.620> like

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
a sample near the root sign just like

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.180 
a sample near the root sign just like
that<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.840> remove<00:02:15.840> any<00:02:16.080> organic<00:02:16.470> materials

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
that and remove any organic materials

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.539 
that and remove any organic materials
because<00:02:17.430> they<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.790> skewer<00:02:18.180> your<00:02:18.420> reading

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
because they can skewer your reading

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.100 
because they can skewer your reading
then<00:02:20.549> with<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> sample<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.480> plate<00:02:21.840> on

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
then with the sample on the plate on

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.210 
then with the sample on the plate on
goes<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.370> indicator<00:02:23.910> dye<00:02:24.239> first<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:26.040> add

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
goes the indicator dye first just add

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.190 
goes the indicator dye first just add
enough<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.610> make<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> thick<00:02:27.150> paste<00:02:27.420> with<00:02:28.110> a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980

this<00:02:32.160> guy<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.019> puff<00:02:34.319> from<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> barium

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
this guy and then a puff from the barium

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.110 
this guy and then a puff from the barium
powder<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:37.290> should<00:02:37.530> be<00:02:37.709> enough<00:02:37.950> leave<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.970> for

a<00:02:39.180> minute<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.780> now<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.340> see<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.760> color

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
