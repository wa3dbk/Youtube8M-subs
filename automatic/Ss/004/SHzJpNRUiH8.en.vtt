close popularity did manage to pull
ahead<00:03:44.709> however<00:03:45.359> but<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.689> me<00:03:47.230> also

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
ahead however but that is me also

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.520 
ahead however but that is me also
because<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.730> is<00:03:48.909> much<00:03:49.090> smaller<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:50.170> physical

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
because it is much smaller the physical

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.240
