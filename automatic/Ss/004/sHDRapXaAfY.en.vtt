here<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.460> our<00:00:11.759> electronic<00:00:12.300> labeling

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
here we have our electronic labeling

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.660 
here we have our electronic labeling
dispenser<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.440> we've<00:00:13.920> introduced<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.549> our

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
dispenser that we've introduced to our

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.550 
dispenser that we've introduced to our
range<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.269> help<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.599> those<00:00:15.750> time-consuming

range to help with those time-consuming
labeling<00:00:17.279> runs<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.020> see<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
labeling runs so you can see it's a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.790 
labeling runs so you can see it's a
compact<00:00:20.160> portable<00:00:20.699> device<00:00:21.300> ideal<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.470> use<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
designated packaging area so once you've

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
designated packaging area so once you've
loaded<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.490> labels<00:00:29.880> into<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> machine<00:00:30.570> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
loaded the labels into the machine you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.569 
loaded the labels into the machine you
need<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.710> use<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> blue<00:00:32.130> buttons<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.489> the

need to use the blue buttons on the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
need to use the blue buttons on the
front<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.780> tell<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> Machine<00:00:34.410> how

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
front here just to tell the Machine how

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
front here just to tell the Machine how
long<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> label<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.180> knows<00:00:36.360> how<00:00:36.570> much

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
long the label is so it knows how much

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.459 
long the label is so it knows how much
to<00:00:36.930> feed<00:00:37.079> through<00:00:37.380> each<00:00:37.530> time<00:00:38.960> now<00:00:39.960> when<00:00:40.440> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
to feed through each time now when I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.530 
to feed through each time now when I
take<00:00:40.680> away<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.010> first<00:00:41.219> label<00:00:41.670> you'll<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.480> how

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
take away the first label you'll see how

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.270 
take away the first label you'll see how
it<00:00:42.690> feeds<00:00:42.899> through<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.500> presents<00:00:44.040> me<00:00:44.190> with

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it feeds through and presents me with

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.630 
it feeds through and presents me with
the<00:00:44.370> next<00:00:44.520> label<00:00:45.320> sticky<00:00:46.320> side<00:00:46.530> exposed<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the next label sticky side exposed so

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.130 
the next label sticky side exposed so
it's<00:00:47.789> ready<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.149> apply<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.480> straight<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
it's ready to apply it straight on to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:02.240 
it's ready to apply it straight on to
your<00:00:49.289> product<00:00:49.649> or<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:49.950> parcel<00:01:01.039> what's<00:01:02.039> also

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
your product or your parcel what's also

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
your product or your parcel what's also
great<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.390> how<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.409> feeds

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
great about this is how as it feeds

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.830 
great about this is how as it feeds
through<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.159> labels<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.390> wins<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
through the labels to you it wins the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810 
through the labels to you it wins the
backing<00:01:07.200> paper<00:01:07.380> back<00:01:08.130> within<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> machine

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
backing paper back within the machine

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
backing paper back within the machine
itself<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.780> you've<00:01:09.900> got<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> neat<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> tidy

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
itself so you've got a neat and tidy

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
itself so you've got a neat and tidy
workstation<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:11.970> times<00:01:14.330> there's<00:01:15.330> also<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
workstation at all times there's also a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.109 
workstation at all times there's also a
counter<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.200> front<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.610> counts<00:01:18.000> up

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
counter on the front here this counts up

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
counter on the front here this counts up
every<00:01:18.360> time<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> label<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.020> produced<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.770> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
every time a label is produced so you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
every time a label is produced so you
can<00:01:20.310> keep<00:01:20.430> track<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.909> how<00:01:21.240> many<00:01:21.299> labels<00:01:21.630> you've

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
can keep track on how many labels you've

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.280 
can keep track on how many labels you've
done<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:23.189> much<00:01:23.340> work<00:01:23.549> you've<00:01:23.759> done<00:01:24.290> it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
done and how much work you've done it's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
done and how much work you've done it's
also<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> great<00:01:25.799> speed<00:01:26.280> function<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.820> here

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
also got a great speed function on here

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.649 
also got a great speed function on here
as<00:01:27.150> well

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
as well

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
as well
for<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> demonstration<00:01:28.890> purposes<00:01:29.790> I've<00:01:30.090> got

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
for the demonstration purposes I've got

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.390 
for the demonstration purposes I've got
this<00:01:30.360> set<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.659> speed<00:01:30.900> five<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.220> go

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
this set on speed five but you can go

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
this set on speed five but you can go
all<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.579> way<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> speed<00:01:33.299> ten<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
all the way up to a speed ten all the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.830 
all the way up to a speed ten all the
way<00:01:34.619> down<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> speed<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> depends<00:01:36.780> on

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
way down to a speed one so it depends on

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.170 
way down to a speed one so it depends on
your<00:01:36.960> application<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> time<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.310> if

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
your application at the time or if

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.609 
your application at the time or if
you're<00:01:39.360> working<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> conveyor<00:01:40.200> belt<00:01:40.290> speed

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
you're working to a conveyor belt speed

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.469 
you're working to a conveyor belt speed
you<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> speed<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.170> well

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
you can have this to that speed as well

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.960 
you can have this to that speed as well
now<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.659> model<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.770> dispenses<00:01:47.520> labels

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
now this model here dispenses labels
