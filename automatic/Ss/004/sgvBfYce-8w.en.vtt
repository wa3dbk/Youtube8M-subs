00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:23.350
 Patch 2.3.0 - The Kanai Cube 

00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:28.283
 In the beginning, the Horadrim were 

00:00:28.283 --> 00:00:29.859
 in the hunt for the three. 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.208
 They saw that they would need an artifact of immense power. 

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:37.524
 Then they created a cube 

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:40.241
 whose existence has implications 

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:42.552
 terrible for what it is capable of doing. 

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:45.441
 So they used the cube for a long time to help them, 

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:49.055
 but they were always aware of the risk of corruption. 

00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:54.138
 Then they sent the cube to be protected 

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:57.342
 by a secret society of barbarians. 

00:00:57.342 --> 00:00:59.506
 The barbarians kept it for many years, 

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.454
 until the fall of Sescheron, 

00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:05.279
 when a barbarian leader named Kanai was killed. 

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:09.306
 Kanai ended up being the last guardian of the cube. 

00:01:09.307 --> 00:01:14.281
 When the artifact appears in the world of Diablo 3, 

00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.089
 it is known as the "Kanai Cube". 

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:21.758
 But what happened was that one of the ancient Horadrim 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.134
 disagreed with the decision to hide the cube, 

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:25.678
 and this Horadrim was Zoltun Kell. 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.877
 He appears in the game and tells the player: 

00:01:28.878 --> 00:01:33.683
 "There was an ancestral cube that they hid from me, 

00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:37.171
 because he was very powerful, but he is here. 

00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:39.942
 If you go to such a place, you will find it. " 

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:45.598
 One of the cool things the cube can do, 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.486
 one of many, is to allow you to 

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:52.312
 draw powers from legendary items 

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.740
 and add them to the collection system. 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.531
 In extracting this power, 

00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:00.632
 you can activate skills and use them, infusing them 

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:02.679
 in your character, who can then use those powers 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.938
 without using the item. 

00:02:03.938 --> 00:02:06.876
 So if you want to wear your regal grandeur ring 

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:10.120
 but the ring spaces are focused on Containment, you can do that. 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.884
 If you want multiple quiver powers on your demon hunter, 

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:14.689
 You can also do this. 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.940
 We have many nice functions in the cube 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.399
 and I'm looking forward to creating even more in the future, 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.212
 after the staff is with him 

00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:25.420
 and start testing out the fantastic ideas that will appear. 

00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:33.579
 The Kanai cube has this name 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.621
 because of King Kanai, and that too 

00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:41.057
 It's our friend's name. 

00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:46.554
 Kevin Kanai Griffith, who passed away during the development of Diablo 3. 

00:02:47.964 --> 00:02:52.941
 Kevin was a brilliant member of our team. 

00:02:52.942 --> 00:02:56.372
 When we had a new idea, he was usually the first 

00:02:56.372 --> 00:02:58.109
 to go there and put his hand in the dough. 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.479
 The ice caves are his work. 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.340
 And he made the ice caves in ... 

00:03:03.923 --> 00:03:07.527
 few weeks, the whole level. 

00:03:07.527 --> 00:03:12.312
 And he was smart, tireless, worked fast and well. 

00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:17.684
 He also "randomized" several environments. 

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:20.836
 When playing in cracks or in adventure mode, 

00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:22.030
 the lighting is always different. 

00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:24.235
 We are in Tristram and sometimes it is raining, and 

00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:25.642
 sometimes it's a clear day. 

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:27.939
 Or it may be windy a lot and sometimes it stays at night, 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.959
 and this is something the fans really wanted. 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.785
 Kevin was a real fan and always thought, 

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.034
 "What do I want to play?" 

00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:38.416
 "P" wanted to see a Horadric Cube, 

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:41.440
 he wanted to see a barbarian temple. 

00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:46.912
 It means a lot to me to be able to make these things happen. 

00:03:49.144 --> 00:03:52.471
 I worked on the effects of King Kanai 

00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:56.088
 and by drawing it, I tried to make it 

00:03:56.088 --> 00:04:01.585
 a ghost of orange color, the embodiment of barbaric fury. 

00:04:03.444 --> 00:04:06.681
 Kevin was very careful with the look of his barbarian. 

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:11.254
 So this is the same set of armor he wore with his character. 

00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:14.574
 It's very cool to be able to catch this same barbarian 

00:04:14.574 --> 00:04:16.088
 and place him on the throne. 

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:21.254
 And make this barbarian become a fiery, fire-colored creature. 

00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:25.568
 is a tribute to my friend. 

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:31.776
 Thanks for watching this video on the Kanai Cube. 

00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:34.536
