00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.799
 Today we will get to know one of the great virtues of the players. 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.962
 They can comment on every most controversial topic. 

00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:29.244
 You've made the best start of the league in history. Does this mean Tito is better than Guardiola? 

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:33.791
 Time will tell, they are both very good coaches. 

00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:40.882
 A real phenomenon! BarÃ§a players have great power to get wet * less than a hippie in the shower! We return to our proof. 

00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:43.361
 Carles, what do you think about independence [Catalonia]? 

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:47.855
 Independence is like that, sometimes you are in favor of, and sometimes against. 

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:50.239
 Are you for or against? 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.799
 Fair competition is the most important thing. 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.757
 You see. Fantastic! 

00:00:56.757 --> 00:01:00.312
 It's impossible for them to answer any question openly! 

00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:03.837
 How was your dinner yesterday? 

00:01:03.837 --> 00:01:06.863
 And as always, no small bar. 

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:08.384
 And I was at the cinema. 

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:09.535
 Was the movie cool? 

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:15.163
 The actors worked hard for 90 minutes and the director can be satisfied with his effort. 

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:18.654
 But did you like the movie or not? 

00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:23.951
 I'd rather not talk about the movie. Everyone can see it and comment on it. 

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:32.423
 We accompany Puyol in his daily activities to see what keeps him in his power. 

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:35.590
 Do you want to buy something? 

00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:41.750
 I am preparing for shopping, but it depends on the trainer. If he wants me to buy something, I'm ready. 

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:43.750
 Well, but you want to buy something or not? 

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:48.210
 Being part of a team means that your opinion does not count, you have to work together with the team. 

00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:51.960
 You see! It's lucky to have someone so neutral in the team. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.250
 We hope he will continue playing for us, at least until he renews his injury. 

00:01:57.264 --> 00:02:00.480
 What are you talking about? Fuck the renewal of injuries! 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.380
 Screw the management, the more with Sandro Rosella! 

00:02:04.943 --> 00:02:05.560
 Yes or no? 

00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:13.360
 Well, it's important to play fair and ... effort for 90 minutes and ... 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.120
 But above all honest game! 

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:17.990
 If you want, I will tell you what I think about you. 

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:21.140
 There's no need to. 

00:02:21.138 --> 00:02:23.340
 No, let's leave it for another day, thank you.
