nothing to do with this esta myself was

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.819 
nothing to do with this esta myself was

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.530 
yeah its operation Metro personal ad
relay<00:03:31.290> operator<00:03:31.680> metro<00:03:32.070> it's<00:03:32.310> as<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:33.060> bet<00:03:33.390> to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
relay operator metro it's as a bet to

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.979 
relay operator metro it's as a bet to
choke<00:03:33.870> point<00:03:34.260> e<00:03:34.410> if<00:03:35.280> that's<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.640> town<00:03:35.989> they

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
choke point e if that's a town they

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.840 
choke point e if that's a town they
still<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.350> got<00:03:37.380> choke<00:03:37.799> points<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.340> some<00:03:38.519> reason

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
still I got choke points for some reason

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.210 
still I got choke points for some reason
and<00:03:39.570> when<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.350> map<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.590> no<00:03:40.829> different

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
and when that that map is no different

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.039 
and when that that map is no different
special<00:03:41.850> when<00:03:42.060> you're<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.510> go<00:03:42.660> from<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
special when you're like you go from the

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.140 
special when you're like you go from the
gardens<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.040> tunnels<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:45.000> just

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
gardens and to the tunnels it's just

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.759 
gardens and to the tunnels it's just
sort<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.390> wake<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.930> other<00:03:46.049> team<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.500> solve

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
sort of wake the other team can solve

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.400 
sort of wake the other team can solve
just<00:03:47.010> like<00:03:47.160> set<00:03:47.549> up<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.060> sade<00:03:48.450> these<00:03:49.019> tunnels

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
just like set up and sade these tunnels

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.250 
just like set up and sade these tunnels
and<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.709> fucking<00:03:50.040> more<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.430> down<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:51.260> so

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
and just fucking more you down and so

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.319 
and just fucking more you down and so
we'll<00:03:52.920> see<00:03:53.160> if<00:03:53.190> they've<00:03:53.519> changed<00:03:53.760> answer<00:03:54.180> than

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
we'll see if they've changed answer than

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.970 
we'll see if they've changed answer than
that<00:03:54.360> when<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.840> comes<00:03:55.140> out<00:03:56.900> so<00:03:57.900> yeah<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.920> I'm

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
that when I comes out so yeah but I'm

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
that when I comes out so yeah but I'm
really<00:03:59.160> looking<00:03:59.400> forward<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.640> trying<00:03:59.850> to

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
really looking forward to trying to

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.270 
really looking forward to trying to
caspian<00:04:00.420> border<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:01.470> looks<00:04:01.709> like<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:02.040> really

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
caspian border it looks like a really

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550 
caspian border it looks like a really
cool<00:04:02.519> map<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.910> what's<00:04:03.299> like<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.540> massive<00:04:03.930> sort

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
cool map is what's like a massive sort

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.180 
cool map is what's like a massive sort
of<00:04:05.120> what<00:04:06.120> I've<00:04:06.420> seen<00:04:06.630> from<00:04:06.959> people<00:04:07.829> start

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
of what I've seen from people start

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.380 
of what I've seen from people start
breaking<00:04:08.579> down<00:04:08.610> what<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:08.970> looks<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.239> they

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
breaking down what it looks like they

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.970 
breaking down what it looks like they
got<00:04:09.420> like<00:04:09.660> concept<00:04:10.200> art<00:04:10.380> or<00:04:10.470> something<00:04:10.829> of<00:04:10.950> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
got like concept art or something of the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.300 
got like concept art or something of the
map<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:12.090> know

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
map that you know

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.770 
map that you know
I've<00:04:12.370> got<00:04:12.580> like<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.819> way<00:04:12.970> out<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.330> map<00:04:13.480> and

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
I've got like a way out of the map and

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.590 
I've got like a way out of the map and
basically<00:04:14.319> what<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:14.860> like<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:16.480> two

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
basically what it's like is the two

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.569 
basically what it's like is the two
teams<00:04:16.810> start<00:04:17.109> off<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.470> end<00:04:17.650> of<00:04:17.829> course<00:04:18.070> but

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
teams start off to end of course but

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.930 
teams start off to end of course but
there's<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.850> massive<00:04:19.180> sort<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.370> nor<00:04:21.370> man's<00:04:21.609> land

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
there's a massive sort of nor man's land

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.470 
there's a massive sort of nor man's land
and<00:04:22.180> between<00:04:22.600> their<00:04:23.260> bases<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.850> capture

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
and between their bases and the capture

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.570 
and between their bases and the capture
points<00:04:25.750> in<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.900> middle<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:26.590> all<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.220> points

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
points in the middle so all the points

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.730 
points in the middle so all the points
are<00:04:27.820> sort<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.270> condensed<00:04:28.990> into<00:04:29.200> this<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.650> know

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
are sort of condensed into this you know

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.990 
are sort of condensed into this you know
it's<00:04:29.860> obviously<00:04:30.280> still<00:04:30.430> going<00:04:30.639> to<00:04:30.700> be<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.790> big

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
it's obviously still going to be a big

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.850 
it's obviously still going to be a big
space<00:04:31.270> but<00:04:31.930> it's<00:04:32.080> in<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.200> middle<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.650> map

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
space but it's in the middle of the map

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.370 
space but it's in the middle of the map
whereas<00:04:33.610> there's<00:04:34.270> i<00:04:34.360> spec<00:04:34.570> no<00:04:34.780> man's<00:04:34.990> land<00:04:35.080> all

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
whereas there's i spec no man's land all

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.810 
whereas there's i spec no man's land all
around<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.830> that's<00:04:35.950> probably<00:04:36.250> obvious<00:04:36.460> like

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
around that that's probably obvious like

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.300 
around that that's probably obvious like
dog<00:04:37.000> fighting<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.540> shit<00:04:37.750> like<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.310> so

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
dog fighting and shit like that and so

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.260 
dog fighting and shit like that and so
it's<00:04:39.400> interesting<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.910> see<00:04:40.030> how<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.240> goes

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
it's interesting to see how that goes

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.030 
it's interesting to see how that goes
here<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.660> about<00:04:41.169> unlock<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.560> man<00:04:41.680> that's<00:04:41.800> good

apparently apparently days were going to
release<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.900> bitter<00:05:02.110> last<00:05:03.010> week<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.460> think<00:05:03.639> it

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
release the bitter last week I think it

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.360 
release the bitter last week I think it
was<00:05:03.880> but<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.600> got<00:05:04.780> rejected<00:05:04.960> by<00:05:05.350> Microsoft<00:05:06.040> for

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
was but it got rejected by Microsoft for

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.370 
was but it got rejected by Microsoft for
some<00:05:06.760> reason<00:05:07.270> that's<00:05:07.450> why<00:05:07.750> I<00:05:07.780> heard<00:05:08.139> that

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
some reason that's why I heard that

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.760 
some reason that's why I heard that
basically<00:05:08.800> Microsoft<00:05:10.080> turned<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.229> down<00:05:11.380> for

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
basically Microsoft turned it down for

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.820 
basically Microsoft turned it down for
whenever<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.610> they<00:05:13.389> had<00:05:13.510> to<00:05:13.690> they<00:05:13.900> had<00:05:14.470> to

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
whenever and they had to they had to

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.330 
whenever and they had to they had to
sort<00:05:15.040> of<00:05:15.810> delay<00:05:16.810> it<00:05:16.930> because<00:05:17.200> days<00:05:17.470> they've

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
sort of delay it because days they've
