all right boys and girls let's talk
about<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.760> periodic<00:00:03.540> table<00:00:03.870> is

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
about how the periodic table is

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.960 
about how the periodic table is
organized<00:00:04.650> there<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> method<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.730> its

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
organized there is a method to its

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.940 
organized there is a method to its
madness<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.899> promise<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.379> you'll<00:00:07.649> be<00:00:07.799> able

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
at it yeah okay so the periodic table is

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.320 
at it yeah okay so the periodic table is
organized<00:00:15.509> into<00:00:15.660> oh<00:00:17.090> dear<00:00:19.070> yes<00:00:20.119> it's<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
organized into oh dear yes it's the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 
organized into oh dear yes it's the
periodic<00:00:22.080> table<00:00:22.410> pokken<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.369> fine

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
periodic table pokken what it's fine

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.689 
periodic table pokken what it's fine
it's<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.180> pokemon<00:00:24.720> anyways<00:00:25.289> up<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it's just pokemon anyways up here is the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.189 
it's just pokemon anyways up here is the
actual<00:00:26.970> periodic<00:00:27.449> table<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.380> embarrassed<00:00:30.199> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
actual periodic table so embarrassed so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770 
actual periodic table so embarrassed so
the<00:00:32.160> first<00:00:32.430> thing<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.730> need<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> talk<00:00:33.180> about<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the first thing we need to talk about is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.889 
the first thing we need to talk about is
how<00:00:34.590> its<00:00:34.829> organized<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:36.180> actually<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
how its organized up there actually is a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.440 
how its organized up there actually is a
name<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.739> columns<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.820> name<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
name for the columns and a name for the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.619 
name for the columns and a name for the
rows<00:00:39.719> okay<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:42.600> columns<00:00:43.260> here

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
rows okay right so the columns here

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.700 
rows okay right so the columns here
every<00:00:45.629> single<00:00:45.840> column<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.710> called<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:48.260> family<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
every single column is called a family a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
every single column is called a family a
family<00:00:50.430> or<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> group<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.449> may<00:00:51.600> also<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
family or a group you may also see the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.740 
family or a group you may also see the
word<00:00:52.440> group<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.039> they're<00:00:53.699> organized<00:00:54.180> by

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
word group and they're organized by

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.049 
word group and they're organized by
similar<00:00:55.430> properties<00:00:56.430> chemical<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:56.969> physical

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
similar properties chemical and physical

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.510 
similar properties chemical and physical
properties<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:59.010> family

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
properties right so like in your family

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
properties right so like in your family
you're<00:01:00.059> similar<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.870> your<00:01:00.989> siblings<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> your

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you're similar to your siblings and your

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
you're similar to your siblings and your
parents<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.760> elements<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.420> families<00:01:03.840> have

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
parents so elements and families have

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140 
parents so elements and families have
similar<00:01:04.470> properties<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> families<00:01:06.000> or

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
similar properties so the families or

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.330 
similar properties so the families or
groups<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.450> similar<00:01:06.960> chemical<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
groups have similar chemical and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
groups have similar chemical and
physical<00:01:08.460> properties<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.170> Mendeleev

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
physical properties just like Mendeleev

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.010 
physical properties just like Mendeleev
and<00:01:10.920> Mosley<00:01:11.100> did<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.030> their<00:01:12.180> original<00:01:12.600> one

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and Mosley did with their original one

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.469 
and Mosley did with their original one
so<00:01:13.909> alright<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.600> about<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.770> rows<00:01:17.549> here

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
so alright so what about the rows here

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
so alright so what about the rows here
were<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.290> rows<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.189> call<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> rows

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
were these rows so we call the rows

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.060 
were these rows so we call the rows
periods<00:01:21.830> okay<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:22.890> they're<00:01:23.220> called<00:01:23.520> periods

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
periods okay so they're called periods

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.240 
periods okay so they're called periods
and<00:01:26.070> remember<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.479> goes<00:01:27.900> across<00:01:28.290> from

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and remember that it goes across from

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
and remember that it goes across from
left<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:29.759> by<00:01:29.909> increasing<00:01:30.540> atomic

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
left to right by increasing atomic

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.310 
left to right by increasing atomic
number<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.650> increasing<00:01:32.100> number<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.460> protons

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
number so increasing number of protons

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.780 
number so increasing number of protons
okay<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.430> increasing<00:01:35.430> atomic<00:01:36.210> number<00:01:36.740> as<00:01:37.790> we

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
okay so increasing atomic number as we

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.069 
okay so increasing atomic number as we
move<00:01:39.030> left<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> right<00:01:40.229> yeah<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.100> periods

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
move left to right yeah so periods

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.200 
move left to right yeah so periods
families<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.200> groups<00:01:43.340> periods<00:01:44.340> families<00:01:45.090> or

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
families or groups periods families or

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.359 
families or groups periods families or
groups<00:01:46.670> great<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:50.220> other

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
groups great all right now the other

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
groups great all right now the other
thing<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.640> ought<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> talk<00:01:50.909> about<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.390> there

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
thing we ought to talk about is there

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.499 
thing we ought to talk about is there
are<00:01:51.930> three<00:01:52.320> different<00:01:52.409> types<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:54.000> elements

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
are three different types of elements

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.090 
are three different types of elements
overall<00:01:55.049> there's<00:01:55.439> metals

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
overall there's metals

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
overall there's metals
there's<00:01:56.340> nonmetals<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.509> there's<00:01:57.689> these

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
there's nonmetals and then there's these

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
there's nonmetals and then there's these
things<00:01:58.049> called<00:01:58.320> metalloids<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:59.399> are<00:01:59.549> kind

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
things called metalloids which are kind

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.789 
things called metalloids which are kind
of<00:01:59.820> metals<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.450> they're<00:02:01.140> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.619> little

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
of metals then they're kind of a little

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.429 
of metals then they're kind of a little
bit<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> both<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
bit of both right so what we have to

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.830 
bit of both right so what we have to
really<00:02:04.829> pay<00:02:05.070> attention<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.479> one

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
really pay attention to is this one

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.440 
really pay attention to is this one
thing<00:02:07.200> called<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.799> staircase<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
thing called the staircase now if you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.880 
thing called the staircase now if you
can<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.629> there's<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.289> dark<00:02:10.530> line<00:02:10.860> on

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
can see there's a little dark line on

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.350 
can see there's a little dark line on
the<00:02:11.310> periodic<00:02:11.700> table<00:02:11.849> though<00:02:12.090> i'm<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the periodic table though i'm going to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.730 
the periodic table though i'm going to
make<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.510> even<00:02:12.750> darker<00:02:13.020> for<00:02:13.440> you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
make it even darker for you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
make it even darker for you
actually<00:02:14.490> there<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> dark<00:02:15.300> line<00:02:15.540> right<00:02:15.750> here

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
actually there is a dark line right here

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.810 
actually there is a dark line right here
we'll<00:02:16.260> come<00:02:16.470> back<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.890> why<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.400> all<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> way

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
we'll come back to why it is all the way

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.990 
we'll come back to why it is all the way
over<00:02:17.850> here<00:02:18.210> as<00:02:18.330> well<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.310> all<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.820> way

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
over here as well but we go all the way

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.050 
over here as well but we go all the way
along<00:02:21.600> here<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.650> that's<00:02:23.070> where<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.700> periodic

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
along here and that's where the periodic

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.240 
along here and that's where the periodic
table<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.420> divided<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.890> dividing

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
table is divided that's the dividing

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.450 
table is divided that's the dividing
point<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:27.300> right<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:28.650> technically<00:02:29.220> these

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
point all right now technically these

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.910 
point all right now technically these
guys<00:02:29.730> down<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.060> are<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:33.720> side<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.440> that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
guys down here are on this side of that

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.850 
guys down here are on this side of that
stair<00:02:35.190> staircase<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.860> so

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
stair staircase just so you know so

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.740 
stair staircase just so you know so
let's<00:02:38.310> start<00:02:38.580> with<00:02:38.730> what<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.390> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
let's start with what is on the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.180 
let's start with what is on the
staircase<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:40.680> that's<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> little<00:02:41.010> bit

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
staircase because that's a little bit

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.280 
staircase because that's a little bit
easier<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.730> understand<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.510> elements<00:02:42.960> along<00:02:43.230> a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
easier to understand so elements along a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.740 
easier to understand so elements along a
staircase<00:02:43.710> are<00:02:44.070> called<00:02:44.310> metalloids<00:02:44.700> okay<00:02:45.660> so

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
staircase are called metalloids okay so

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.820 
staircase are called metalloids okay so
that<00:02:45.990> beam<00:02:46.430> everything<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.090> staircase

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
that beam everything that the staircase

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.910 
that beam everything that the staircase
touches<00:02:49.830> except<00:02:50.550> for<00:02:51.260> except<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.290> aluminum

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
touches except for except for aluminum

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.430 
touches except for except for aluminum
so<00:02:53.640> these<00:02:53.910> guys<00:02:54.240> right<00:02:54.810> here

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
so these guys right here

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.370 
so these guys right here
we<00:02:56.430> call<00:02:56.730> these<00:02:56.990> metalloids<00:02:57.990> and<00:03:00.380> what's

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
we call these metalloids and what's

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.500 
we call these metalloids and what's
special<00:03:01.560> about<00:03:01.890> them<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.850> they<00:03:03.270> have

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
special about them so they have

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.910 
special about them so they have
properties<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.350> both<00:03:04.680> metals<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.430> nonmetals

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
properties of both metals and nonmetals

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.750 
properties of both metals and nonmetals
okay<00:03:07.920> properties<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:09.090> metals<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.760> nonmetals

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
okay properties of metals and nonmetals

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.820 
okay properties of metals and nonmetals
they<00:03:12.300> can't<00:03:12.540> be<00:03:12.690> classified<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.410> one<00:03:13.590> or<00:03:13.710> the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
they can't be classified as one or the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.110 
they can't be classified as one or the
other<00:03:14.010> all<00:03:14.820> right

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
other all right

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.650 
other all right
which<00:03:16.850> yeah<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.030> we'll<00:03:18.180> leave<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.360> at<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.540> for

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
which yeah so we'll leave it at that for

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.870 
which yeah so we'll leave it at that for
now<00:03:18.870> yeah<00:03:19.290> okay<00:03:19.710> so<00:03:19.770> those<00:03:20.640> are<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
now yeah okay so those are the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.670 
now yeah okay so those are the
metalloids<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.720> everything<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.410> going

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
metalloids and then everything is going

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.500 
metalloids and then everything is going
to<00:03:22.860> be<00:03:23.040> whatever<00:03:23.580> is<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> left<00:03:24.270> of<00:03:24.420> that

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
to be whatever is to the left of that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.280 
to be whatever is to the left of that
and<00:03:24.630> whatever<00:03:24.840> it's<00:03:24.960> good<00:03:25.110> right<00:03:25.260> about

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
and whatever it's good right about

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.520 
and whatever it's good right about
exactly<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:26.610> everything<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.450> left<00:03:27.780> which

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
exactly so everything to the left which

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.910 
exactly so everything to the left which
is<00:03:28.560> most<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> periodic<00:03:29.910> table<00:03:30.240> are<00:03:30.590> metals

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.220 

metals<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.460> everything's<00:03:36.240> left<00:03:36.480> except<00:03:36.960> for

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
metals so everything's left except for

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.810 
metals so everything's left except for
hydrogen

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
hydrogen

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.460 
hydrogen
yeah<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.030> hydrogen<00:03:39.510> by<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.720> way<00:03:39.900> hydrogen<00:03:40.350> is

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
yeah and hydrogen by the way hydrogen is

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.390 
yeah and hydrogen by the way hydrogen is
not<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.710> metalloid

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
not a metalloid

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.240 
not a metalloid
no<00:03:42.060> okay<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.960> we'll<00:03:43.380> say<00:03:43.560> except<00:03:43.920> for<00:03:44.070> hydrogen

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
no okay so we'll say except for hydrogen

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.950 
no okay so we'll say except for hydrogen
and<00:03:44.550> aluminum<00:03:45.000> those<00:03:45.180> are<00:03:45.300> not<00:03:45.480> metalloids

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
and aluminum those are not metalloids

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
and aluminum those are not metalloids
but<00:03:46.740> everything<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.550> left<00:03:47.790> here<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.330> a

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
but everything to the left here is a

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.860 
but everything to the left here is a
metal<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.340> aluminum<00:03:50.730> think<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.450> aluminum

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
metal and aluminum think of aluminum

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.310 
metal and aluminum think of aluminum
foil<00:03:52.080> aluminum<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.800> a<00:03:52.830> metal<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:54.320> metals

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
foil aluminum is a metal and metals

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.930 
foil aluminum is a metal and metals
conduct<00:03:55.620> electricity<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.670> well<00:03:56.970> right<00:03:57.650> so

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
conduct electricity really well right so

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.400 
conduct electricity really well right so
let<00:03:59.940> me<00:04:00.060> let<00:04:00.360> me<00:04:00.390> clear<00:04:00.750> some<00:04:01.020> of<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.200> out

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
let me let me clear some of this out

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.490 
let me let me clear some of this out
this<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.310> getting<00:04:02.580> confusing<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.540> everything

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
this is getting confusing so everything

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.820 
this is getting confusing so everything
over<00:04:04.830> here<00:04:07.040> these<00:04:08.040> are<00:04:08.250> all<00:04:08.370> metals<00:04:08.820> yeah<00:04:09.210> and

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
over here these are all metals yeah and

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.670 
over here these are all metals yeah and
metals<00:04:10.830> are<00:04:12.350> good<00:04:13.350> conductors<00:04:13.490> of

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
metals are good conductors of

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.640 
metals are good conductors of
electricity<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.310> heat<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:18.239> that's<00:04:19.140> pretty

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
electricity and heat and that's pretty

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.570 
electricity and heat and that's pretty
much<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:20.070> right<00:04:20.250> there

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
much it right there

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.600 
much it right there
yeah<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:20.850> usually<00:04:21.000> shiny<00:04:21.510> yeah<00:04:22.290> exactly

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
yeah and I usually shiny yeah exactly

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.660 
yeah and I usually shiny yeah exactly
so<00:04:23.970> what<00:04:24.150> about<00:04:24.240> everything<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:25.050> was<00:04:25.560> not

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
so what about everything that was not

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.860 
so what about everything that was not
that<00:04:27.330> was<00:04:27.540> over<00:04:28.340> here<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.940> small<00:04:30.420> area

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
that was over here so the small area

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.620 
that was over here so the small area
those<00:04:31.350> are<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.680> nonmetals<00:04:32.270> okay<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.480> they

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
those are the nonmetals okay and they

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.020 
those are the nonmetals okay and they
are<00:04:33.660> not<00:04:34.020> good<00:04:34.350> conductors<00:04:34.980> so<00:04:35.730> it's<00:04:35.910> either

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
are not good conductors so it's either

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.840 
are not good conductors so it's either
good<00:04:36.300> conductors<00:04:36.750> not<00:04:37.530> get<00:04:37.770> conductors<00:04:38.250> and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
good conductors not get conductors and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.310 
good conductors not get conductors and
then<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.090> metalloids<00:04:39.450> are<00:04:39.660> in<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.870> middle<00:04:40.140> we

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
then the metalloids are in the middle we

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.260 
then the metalloids are in the middle we
call<00:04:40.500> those<00:04:41.060> semiconductors

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
call those semiconductors

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.270 
call those semiconductors
okay<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.640> poor<00:04:44.640> conductors<00:04:45.620> good<00:04:46.620> conductors

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.000 

semiconductors<00:04:50.480> all<00:04:51.480> right<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:52.620> remember

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
semiconductors all right and remember

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.260 
semiconductors all right and remember
again<00:04:54.710> hydrogen<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.830> included<00:04:56.460> in<00:04:56.610> the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
again hydrogen is included in the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.790 
again hydrogen is included in the
nonmetals<00:04:57.870> even<00:04:58.200> though<00:04:58.320> it's<00:04:58.470> all<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.710> way

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
nonmetals even though it's all the way

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.350 
nonmetals even though it's all the way
over<00:04:59.010> there<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.460> you'll<00:04:59.580> find<00:04:59.700> out<00:05:00.000> why<00:05:00.180> it's

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
over there and you'll find out why it's

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.200 
over there and you'll find out why it's
all<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.570> way<00:05:00.660> over<00:05:00.870> there<00:05:01.050> at<00:05:01.890> some<00:05:02.100> point<00:05:02.340> all

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
all the way over there at some point all

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.160 
all the way over there at some point all
right<00:05:03.390> that<00:05:03.780> seems<00:05:04.020> like<00:05:04.320> it<00:05:04.470> yep
