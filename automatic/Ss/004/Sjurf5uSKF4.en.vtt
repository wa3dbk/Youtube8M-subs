00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.049
 it's pretty clueless about what 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.730
 happened it's too much that's 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.710
 amazing but really amazing and 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.520
 if today to people who have the 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.529
 courage to say that Lorient played well 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.420
 or that has been tactically orientated 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.880
 ordinary with a team of broken arms 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.230
 who was 18th and who may be saved 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.330
 that thanks to this crazy match 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.189
 Well, I do not, but I do not have 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.119
 of time I saw a team from the om 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.290
 who has it all and anything 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.449
 among all those who wait for the om 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.590
 breaks his mouth for delta size 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.640
 of small antilles notebook of 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.200
 continue to see him to Libyans 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.730
 I would like to know all those who have 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.920
 militant like dingos when he dances 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.360
 and 3,3 and if there is one who at that 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.440
 moment there peace did not think they 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.660
 were going to win that om was winning 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.180
 4.3 or a believe that obviously they do not 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.559
 will never say so at the start and 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 I imagine that many are delighted to 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.670
 see this tumble they go 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.320
 obviously a trivial bielsa while 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.289
 the problem is much deeper 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.300
 than behind those mistakes because 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.630
 that there are and its main 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.039
 of past mistakes as we all are 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.650
 to have thought they could be 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.350
 magician he overestimated players who 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.240
 are happy with baltrings 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.119

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.560
 well it can be any 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.150
