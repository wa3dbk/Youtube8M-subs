handed checkers

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.020 
handed checkers
everyone<00:00:16.350> hates<00:00:16.650> test<00:00:16.949> kits<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.460> testing<00:00:17.850> in

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
everyone hates test kits and testing in

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.490 
everyone hates test kits and testing in
general<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.630> these<00:00:18.750> checkers<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.320> really

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
general so these checkers can really

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
general so these checkers can really
change<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.010> way<00:00:20.130> some<00:00:20.370> of<00:00:20.400> us<00:00:20.610> reef<00:00:20.880> most

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
change the way some of us reef most

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.180 
change the way some of us reef most
experienced<00:00:22.230> reefers<00:00:22.440> will<00:00:22.830> agree<00:00:23.010> that

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
experienced reefers will agree that

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.160 
experienced reefers will agree that
alkalete<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.760> probably<00:00:24.030> the<00:00:24.150> most<00:00:24.450> common<00:00:25.020> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
alkalete is probably the most common and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.750 
alkalete is probably the most common and
important<00:00:25.590> parameter<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> keep<00:00:26.310> closer<00:00:26.610> tabs

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
important parameter to keep closer tabs

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.609 
important parameter to keep closer tabs
on<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.660> we're<00:00:27.780> going<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.960> start<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.440> one

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
on so we're going to start with that one

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.680 
on so we're going to start with that one
step<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.610> to<00:00:29.700> turn<00:00:29.850> the<00:00:30.000> checker<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.390> by

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
step one is to turn the checker on by

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.240 
step one is to turn the checker on by
hitting<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.110> button<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:31.860> fill<00:00:32.129> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
hitting the button and then fill the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.220 
hitting the button and then fill the
cuvette<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> 10<00:00:33.149> milliliter<00:00:33.629> line<00:00:33.900> with

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
cuvette to a 10 milliliter line with

cuvette to a 10 milliliter line with
water<00:00:34.470> from<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> tank<00:00:35.100> put<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> sample<00:00:36.210> in

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
water from the tank put the sample in

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.100 
water from the tank put the sample in
the<00:00:36.660> checker

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the checker

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.170 
the checker
and<00:00:37.290> hit<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:37.770> button<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.220> it<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.400> zero<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and hit the button and it will zero in a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.479 
and hit the button and it will zero in a
matter<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.510> seconds<00:00:40.020> next<00:00:40.680> open<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:40.980> reagent

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
matter of seconds next open the reagent

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.280 
matter of seconds next open the reagent
bottle<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.970> draw<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.570> milliliter<00:00:42.989> of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
bottle and draw one milliliter of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.840 
bottle and draw one milliliter of
solution<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.100> pull<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> plunger<00:00:44.820> back

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
solution just pull the plunger back

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
solution just pull the plunger back
until<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> hits<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:46.020> milliliter<00:00:46.350> line

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
until it hits the one milliliter line

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.620 
until it hits the one milliliter line
it's<00:00:47.280> perfectly<00:00:47.670> normal<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.270> there<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.570> a

it's perfectly normal for there to be a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
small air bubble at the top so ignore

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.520 
small air bubble at the top so ignore
that<00:00:50.790> add<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> reagent<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> cuvette<00:00:52.470> and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that add the reagent to the cuvette and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.160 
that add the reagent to the cuvette and
invert<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.160> five<00:00:53.340> times<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:53.969> mix<00:00:54.180> place<00:00:54.989> it

back in the checker and hit the button
in<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.570> few<00:00:57.750> seconds<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.530> give<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.920> a

in a few seconds it will give you a

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.910 
in a few seconds it will give you a
reading<00:00:59.309> which<00:00:59.700> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.120> multiply<00:01:00.600> by<00:01:00.920> 0.05
