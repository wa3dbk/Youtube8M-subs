00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.129
 a little scared for being for the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.809
 this elegant trend this year what's good 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.300
 what you have is that you will find it in 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.370
 many different forms the most 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.750
 habitual in which you will see it will be 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.059
 in the stripes for example like this 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 We dress she wore I also will 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.930
 find in horizontal stripes ten in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.170
 account two things the horizontal stripes 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.420
 what are these that are going to do 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.010
 be a little bit wider, so if 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.690
 you want to hide some part of your 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.850
 body that has more volume does not 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.620
 use however the stripes 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 vertical what they are going to do is going to be 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.360
 give you a more slender feeling for the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.640
 opposite what you have to have in 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.170
 account is that if you want to reduce the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.630
 volume in some area of ​​your body 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 use the garment that is darker by 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.049
 example if you have hips a little 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.060
 wider than the shoulders uses a 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.359
 pants or a skirt in black and in the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.189
 upper part uses white after 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.539
 one of the trends that there are also 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.109
 this season are the prints 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:27.420
 geometric here we have a garment that 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.740
 has geometric patterns one of the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.820
 characteristics that they have of this type 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.920
 of prints is that they will give you 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.119
 enough volume with which you have to 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.219
 be very careful when it comes to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.929
 use them as you see this trend 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.450
 besides being a geometric print of 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.399
 some tendency a memory something else or 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.249
 less oriental is another trend 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.649
 of this season with which if you want 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.450
 go very very to the last useful combines the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.270
 white with black with a pattern that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.100
 be of oriental type 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.079
 the best they have the tendency of 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.210
 white and black is that you can give 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.640
 from a youth to a very look 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.939
 classic for example very youthful muscle 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.610
 would be this one of horizontal lines with a 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.700
 lightly touch sailor combined with 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.459
 a short like for example this in a 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.590
 clear color as you see the sun as I am 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.930
 explained above is in one color 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.849
 in broken white try that if your 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.290
 hips are wide instead of white or 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.000
 be the black in which the pants go 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.340
 on the contrary if you want to take a 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.920
 Completely elegant look chooses a 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.230
 classic black pants and then combine 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.049
 with a jacket that carries the tone 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.549
 white and black as you are seeing almost 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.859
 all the types of lines that I am 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.510
 teaching the lines are horizontal 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.220
 vertical you're going to find that there 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.680
 many meshes that many leggins 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.629
 be careful because if your land 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.340
 It is a little wider than usual 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.470
 what is going to happen is that instead of 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.829
 a straight line you see a line that acs 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.269
 and that's not going to favor anything like 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.859
 I was able to check the options for 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.659
 combine white and black are 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.189
 multiple now depends on you and your 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.049
 imagination and the desire to try 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.049
 new things combining the votes
