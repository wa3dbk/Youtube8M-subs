00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
millimeter watch I'm not really sure why

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.090 
millimeter watch I'm not really sure why
it<00:02:50.480> might<00:02:50.780> be<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.410> has<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> relatively

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
it might be the it has a relatively

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.060 
it might be the it has a relatively
short<00:02:52.570> lug<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.720> lug<00:02:56.709> but<00:02:57.709> one<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.040> unique

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
short lug to lug but one of the unique

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.250 
short lug to lug but one of the unique
things<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.120> oversized<00:02:59.720> crown<00:03:00.080> and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
things is that oversized crown and

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.440 
things is that oversized crown and
ground<00:03:00.470> guards<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:00.980> does<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.970> right<00:03:02.180> side

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
ground guards so it does the right side

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.260 
ground guards so it does the right side
of<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.660> case<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.590> know<00:03:03.680> has<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.670> don't<00:03:05.180> know

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
of the case you know has I don't know

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.820 
of the case you know has I don't know
how<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.450> say<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.050> don't<00:03:06.080> know<00:03:08.050> it<00:03:09.050> does<00:03:09.590> play

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
how to say it I don't know it does play

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.290 
how to say it I don't know it does play
a<00:03:09.860> little<00:03:10.040> bit<00:03:10.250> smaller<00:03:10.489> than<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.880> then<00:03:11.120> it's

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
a little bit smaller than it then it's

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.360 
a little bit smaller than it then it's
listed<00:03:11.630> specs<00:03:11.930> at<00:03:12.080> 44<00:03:12.590> millimeter<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.190> that's

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
listed specs at 44 millimeter so that's

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.710 
listed specs at 44 millimeter so that's
probably<00:03:13.670> good<00:03:13.850> for<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:14.060> lot<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.360> people<00:03:14.630> who

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
probably good for a lot of people who

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.890 
probably good for a lot of people who
like<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.930> little<00:03:15.380> bit<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.680> smaller<00:03:15.980> watch<00:03:16.900> but

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
like a little bit of a smaller watch but

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.350 
like a little bit of a smaller watch but
then<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.140> do<00:03:18.260> have<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.620> very<00:03:19.100> large<00:03:19.850> Dover

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
then you do have that very large Dover

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.300 
then you do have that very large Dover

and stitch it into the back of the strap
here<00:04:01.909> I'm<00:04:02.090> not<00:04:02.389> sure<00:04:02.450> why<00:04:02.930> they<00:04:03.139> chose<00:04:03.379> to<00:04:03.439> put

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
here I'm not sure why they chose to put

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.610 
here I'm not sure why they chose to put
it<00:04:03.950> there<00:04:04.159> though<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:05.170> almost<00:04:06.170> would<00:04:06.500> have

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
it there though I almost would have

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.830 
it there though I almost would have
liked<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.889> seen<00:04:07.129> the<00:04:07.250> patch<00:04:07.480> maybe<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.599> little

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
liked to seen the patch maybe a little

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.270 
liked to seen the patch maybe a little
patch<00:04:08.989> like<00:04:09.200> on<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.470> outside<00:04:09.829> of<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.040> strap

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
patch like on the outside of the strap

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.119 
patch like on the outside of the strap
here<00:04:10.519> instead<00:04:11.319> one<00:04:12.319> of<00:04:12.409> the<00:04:12.470> reasons<00:04:12.799> I'm<00:04:12.950> just

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
here instead one of the reasons I'm just

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.759 
here instead one of the reasons I'm just
not<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.280> fan<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.730> it<00:04:13.849> here<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.569> because<00:04:14.900> this<00:04:15.590> is

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
not a fan of it here is because this is

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.140 
not a fan of it here is because this is
the<00:04:15.799> part<00:04:16.070> that's<00:04:16.099> going<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.579> sit<00:04:16.820> against

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
the part that's going to sit against

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.589 
the part that's going to sit against
your<00:04:17.299> wrist<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.870> being<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.530> fabric<00:04:18.949> like<00:04:19.130> this

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
your wrist and being a fabric like this

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.360 
your wrist and being a fabric like this
it's<00:04:20.599> going<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.989> get<00:04:21.169> sweaty<00:04:21.500> which<00:04:21.859> in<00:04:22.160> turn

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
it's going to get sweaty which in turn

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.230 
it's going to get sweaty which in turn
it's<00:04:22.550> gonna<00:04:22.729> get<00:04:22.940> dirty<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.960> imagine<00:04:24.410> after

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
it's gonna get dirty and I imagine after

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.730 
it's gonna get dirty and I imagine after
you<00:04:26.240> know<00:04:26.360> wearing<00:04:26.570> this<00:04:26.810> watch<00:04:27.020> on<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.440> strap

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
you know wearing this watch on the strap

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.040 
you know wearing this watch on the strap
for<00:04:27.949> a<00:04:28.039> decent<00:04:28.220> amount<00:04:28.520> of<00:04:28.610> time<00:04:29.050> it's

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
for a decent amount of time it's

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.050 
for a decent amount of time it's
probably<00:04:30.440> gonna<00:04:30.770> start<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.130> look<00:04:31.250> kind<00:04:32.000> of

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
probably gonna start to look kind of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.710 
probably gonna start to look kind of
nasty<00:04:32.270> looking<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:34.240> that's<00:04:35.240> just<00:04:35.479> something

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
nasty looking so that's just something

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.390 
nasty looking so that's just something
that<00:04:36.020> maybe<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.710> don't<00:04:36.830> know<00:04:37.009> maybe<00:04:37.160> that's

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
that maybe I don't know maybe that's

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.240 
that maybe I don't know maybe that's
just<00:04:37.490> my<00:04:37.669> personal<00:04:38.090> take<00:04:38.330> on<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:39.070> like<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.190> said

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
just my personal take on it like I said

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.290 
just my personal take on it like I said
it<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.580> 22<00:04:41.120> millimeters<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.199> easily<00:04:42.770> rectified

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
it is 22 millimeters so easily rectified

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.120 
it is 22 millimeters so easily rectified
if<00:04:44.300> you're<00:04:45.050> not<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.260> fan<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.590> these<00:04:45.800> kind<00:04:46.070> of

if you're not a fan of these kind of

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.620 
if you're not a fan of these kind of
straps<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.610> could<00:04:46.760> put<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.000> on<00:04:47.120> any<00:04:47.300> kind<00:04:47.479> of

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
straps you could put it on any kind of

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.950 
straps you could put it on any kind of
22<00:04:48.380> millimeter<00:04:48.860> strap<00:04:49.479> let's<00:04:50.479> take<00:04:50.659> a<00:04:50.690> look<00:04:50.870> at

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960
