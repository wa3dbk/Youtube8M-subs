00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
let's get into it so I'm starting off

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.010 
let's get into it so I'm starting off
this<00:01:04.979> process<00:01:05.460> by<00:01:05.670> using<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.210> soak<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.750> base

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
this process by using the soak off base

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
this process by using the soak off base
gel<00:01:07.380> coat<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> very<00:01:08.549> thick

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
gel coat and this is a very thick

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
gel coat and this is a very thick
formula<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.780> supposed<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.290> thick<00:01:10.530> so

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
formula it's supposed to be thick so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.820 
formula it's supposed to be thick so
just<00:01:11.220> keep<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.729> mind<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.290> end<00:01:13.680> up

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
just keep that in mind if you do end up

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
just keep that in mind if you do end up
putting<00:01:14.040> too<00:01:14.340> much<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.850> gonna<00:01:15.119> leak<00:01:15.420> off

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
putting too much it is gonna leak off

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.660 
putting too much it is gonna leak off
your<00:01:16.350> nail<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.619> onto<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> sides<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.610> your

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
your nail and onto the sides of your

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.080 
your nail and onto the sides of your
skin<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:19.710> ends<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.070> getting<00:01:20.280> hard<00:01:20.700> once

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
skin and that ends up getting hard once

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
skin and that ends up getting hard once
you<00:01:21.210> put<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.570> fingers<00:01:22.140> underneath<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> UV

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you put your fingers underneath the UV

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310 
you put your fingers underneath the UV
light<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.880> keep<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.270> mind<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.869> little

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
light so just keep that in mind a little

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.200 
light so just keep that in mind a little
bit<00:01:25.560> goes<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> long<00:01:26.040> way<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.580> once<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.090> have

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
bit goes a long way so once you have

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.789 
bit goes a long way so once you have
that<00:01:27.330> thin<00:01:27.600> layer<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> base<00:01:28.350> coat<00:01:28.619> on

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that thin layer of the base coat on

fingers<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.799> fit<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> wanted<00:01:35.490> my<00:01:35.610> thumb<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.030> fit

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
fingers in fit I wanted my thumb to fit

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
fingers in fit I wanted my thumb to fit
in<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.450> too<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.229> didn't<00:01:37.500> happen<00:01:37.829> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
in there too but just didn't happen so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
in there too but just didn't happen so
you<00:01:38.460> wait<00:01:38.700> 30<00:01:38.939> seconds<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:39.930> I'm<00:01:40.259> putting

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you wait 30 seconds and then I'm putting

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740 
you wait 30 seconds and then I'm putting
my<00:01:40.680> thumb<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.450> pretty<00:01:42.659> much

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
my thumb in and then that's pretty much

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.109 
my thumb in and then that's pretty much
it<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.259> base<00:01:43.439> coat<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> totally<00:01:44.280> dry<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.970> then

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it the base coat is totally dry so then

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.569 
it the base coat is totally dry so then
once<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.990> complete<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.799> go<00:01:46.979> into<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
once that's all complete you go into the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.940 
once that's all complete you go into the
actual<00:01:47.880> color<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.380> using<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.770> light

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
actual color so I'm using that light

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.499 
actual color so I'm using that light
purple<00:01:50.250> color<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> very<00:01:51.270> thick

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
purple color and this is a very thick

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.960 
purple color and this is a very thick
formula<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.079> well<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.829> again<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.850> bit

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
formula as well so again a little bit

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.200 
formula as well so again a little bit
goes<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> long<00:01:54.509> way<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.409> too<00:01:55.470> crazy<00:01:56.210> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
goes a long way don't go too crazy the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.469 
goes a long way don't go too crazy the

that's what my fingers are looking like
right<00:02:12.870> now<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.350> thought<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.340> could<00:02:14.610> go<00:02:14.820> back

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
right now I thought that I could go back

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.180 
right now I thought that I could go back
and<00:02:15.360> clean<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.930> once<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.350> done<00:02:16.500> painting<00:02:16.950> all

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.240 
and clean up once I'm done painting all
my<00:02:17.370> nails<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.330> quickly<00:02:18.930> found<00:02:19.410> out<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:20.010> if

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
that happened on the first layer and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.240 
that happened on the first layer and
yeah<00:02:51.690> I'm<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.989> painting<00:02:52.230> my<00:02:52.440> nails<00:02:52.470> like

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
that and then doing the same process

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.620 
that and then doing the same process
putting<00:02:56.130> my<00:02:56.250> hands<00:02:56.610> underneath<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> UV<00:02:57.420> light

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
putting my hands underneath the UV light

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:09.910 
putting my hands underneath the UV light
waiting<00:02:58.080> 30<00:02:58.260> seconds<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.130> calling<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.880> a<00:03:00.060> day

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.780 

so<00:03:10.920> once<00:03:11.130> you're<00:03:11.280> done<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.640> actual

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
so once you're done with the actual

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.760 
so once you're done with the actual
color<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.630> have<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.900> move<00:03:13.080> on<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.500> soaked

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
color you have to move on to the soaked

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.320 
color you have to move on to the soaked
off<00:03:13.980> top<00:03:14.340> gel<00:03:14.760> coat<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.900> also<00:03:16.260> thick<00:03:16.980> and

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
off top gel coat this is also thick and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.570 
off top gel coat this is also thick and
again<00:03:18.330> light<00:03:19.080> layer<00:03:19.350> don't<00:03:19.739> go<00:03:19.890> too<00:03:19.950> crazy<00:03:20.250> or

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
again light layer don't go too crazy or

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.190 
again light layer don't go too crazy or
else<00:03:20.880> you're<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.299> gonna<00:03:21.390> have<00:03:21.570> goopy<00:03:21.959> nails

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
else you're just gonna have goopy nails

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.500 
else you're just gonna have goopy nails
so<00:03:22.950> I'm<00:03:23.100> doing<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.670> thin<00:03:23.940> light<00:03:24.209> layer

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
so I'm doing just a thin light layer

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.479 
so I'm doing just a thin light layer
making<00:03:24.959> sure<00:03:25.200> everything<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.650> nice<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:25.950> even

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and once I have coated each and every

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.070 
and once I have coated each and every
single<00:03:29.220> nail<00:03:29.580> I'm<00:03:29.880> going<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.390> put<00:03:30.630> my<00:03:30.750> hands

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
single nail I'm going to put my hands

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.229

underneath<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.680> UV<00:03:31.950> light<00:03:32.160> let<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.549> soak<00:03:32.940> in

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
underneath the UV light let that soak in

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.289 
underneath the UV light let that soak in
and<00:03:33.510> then<00:03:34.130> we're<00:03:35.130> gonna<00:03:35.220> do<00:03:35.489> another<00:03:35.850> quick

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
and then we're gonna do another quick

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.330 
and then we're gonna do another quick
extra<00:03:36.780> step<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:40.320> once<00:03:40.530> I'm<00:03:40.680> done<00:03:40.829> with<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.040> top

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
extra step so once I'm done with the top

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.580 
extra step so once I'm done with the top
coat<00:03:41.640> it's<00:03:41.850> time<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.299> take<00:03:42.480> some<00:03:42.510> alcohol<00:03:42.930> and

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
coat it's time to take some alcohol and

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.490 
coat it's time to take some alcohol and
cotton<00:03:44.340> pad<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.299> wipe<00:03:45.660> down<00:03:45.959> your<00:03:45.989> nails

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
cotton pad and just wipe down your nails

cotton pad and just wipe down your nails
this<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:46.920> going<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.160> take<00:03:47.370> off<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.760> tacky

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
this is going to take off that tacky

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.580 
this is going to take off that tacky
layer<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.810> then<00:03:48.930> everything<00:03:49.380> should<00:03:49.560> be

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
layer and then everything should be

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.550 
layer and then everything should be
glossy<00:03:50.010> thick<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.690> look<00:03:51.900> really<00:03:52.350> really

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
and complete I love the way they came

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.410 
and complete I love the way they came
out<00:03:58.560> they<00:03:58.920> were<00:03:58.980> thick<00:03:59.310> they<00:03:59.579> were<00:03:59.670> glossy<00:04:00.180> at

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
out they were thick they were glossy at

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.819 
out they were thick they were glossy at
first<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.900> was<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.049> little<00:04:01.140> uncomfortable

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
first it was a little uncomfortable

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.800 
first it was a little uncomfortable
because<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.640> was<00:04:02.760> my<00:04:02.850> first<00:04:03.060> time<00:04:03.239> using<00:04:03.299> gel

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
because it was my first time using gel

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.690 
because it was my first time using gel
and<00:04:04.079> they<00:04:04.500> felt<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.890> little<00:04:05.160> bit<00:04:05.280> heavier<00:04:05.610> than

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
and they felt a little bit heavier than

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.610 
and they felt a little bit heavier than
regular<00:04:06.030> nail<00:04:06.420> polish<00:04:06.810> but<00:04:07.110> at<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.410> end<00:04:07.530> of

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
regular nail polish but at the end of

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.650 
regular nail polish but at the end of
the<00:04:07.680> day<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:07.860> loved<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.850> way<00:04:09.000> they<00:04:09.120> turned<00:04:09.209> out

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the day I loved the way they turned out

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.410

process<00:05:11.030> is<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.210> lot<00:05:11.420> faster<00:05:11.780> than<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.980> regular

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
process is a lot faster than the regular

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.370 
process is a lot faster than the regular
nail<00:05:13.790> process<00:05:14.390> using<00:05:14.720> regular<00:05:15.020> nail<00:05:15.200> polish

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380

would have to redo my nails like all the
time<00:05:20.150> when<00:05:20.390> I<00:05:20.420> would<00:05:20.510> do<00:05:20.690> regular<00:05:21.020> nail<00:05:21.200> polish

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440

time when I would do regular nail polish
like<00:05:21.620> they<00:05:21.800> would<00:05:21.920> never<00:05:22.100> dry<00:05:23.260> so<00:05:24.260> overall<00:05:24.620> I

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
like they would never dry so overall I

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.190 
like they would never dry so overall I
do<00:05:25.040> like<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.670> gel<00:05:25.940> nail<00:05:26.240> process<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.960> little

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
bit more it's faster I feel like the
