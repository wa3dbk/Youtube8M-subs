00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.459
It is great to be at one of the finest technical
institutes in the world.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.120
One of the finest in the world. I mean, you've got
to be if the Ramblin' Wreck is still running

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:32.100
after all these years. [APPLAUSE] That's a
Georgia Tech reference that some of you may

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:40.660
not know. [LAUGHTER] I also know that Georgia
Tech is terrific because we've actually worked

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.120
with you on several fronts -– from promoting
advanced manufacturing to unlocking the mysteries

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:57.879
of the brain to helping more students become
entrepreneurs. After the worst economic crisis

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.899
of our lifetimes, over the past five years,
our businesses have now created 12 million

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.600
new jobs. Unemployment continues to come down,
and obviously that's good news for those of

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:20.320
you who are graduating soon. [APPLAUSE] Yes,
that's right, you want a job. [LAUGHTER] Your

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:29.240
parents also want you to have a job. They
don't want you on the couch. And today, a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.280
college degree is the surest ticket to the
middle class and beyond. It's the key to getting

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.490
a good job that pays a good income. And it
offers a measure of security, because a college

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.219
degree tells employers that you don't just
have one set of skills; that you've got the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.560
continuous capacity to learn new skills, which
is going to be particularly important for

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.000
your generation because the economy is going
to churn and change in ways that none of us

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
can even anticipate. The skill-sets you are
getting now are going to keep you in that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.520
job market. You're going to have multiple
jobs before you're 30. Some of you will have

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.420
multiple careers. And we live in a 21st-century
economy, where your most valuable asset is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.340
your imagination, your knowledge, your ability
to analyze tough problems. And let me say

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.360
that it's been established time and time again
that Georgia Tech is one of the best bargains

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:41.660
around. You are getting a great education
for a great value. [APPLAUSE] Which is one

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.050
of the reasons I'm here; obviously, I wouldn't
go to a place that was a bad bargain and really

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.019
expensive and no value. That would not make
sense. [LAUGHTER] I believe that America is

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.679
not a place where higher education is a privilege
that is reserved for the few. America needs

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.030
to be a place where higher education has to
be available for every single person who's

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.140
willing to strive for it, who's willing to
work for it. [APPLAUSE] Meanwhile, we're working

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.500
to hold down the cost of a college education.
So we're partnering with schools like Georgia

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.250
Tech on innovative ways to increase value
-– like your online master's program in

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:31.210
computer science -- [APPLAUSE] -- which costs
just a fraction of the price of an in-classroom

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.720
program. So we're trying to tackle this problem
from every angle. There's no silver bullet.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.540
But we're trying to make sure that across
the board, more and more young people can

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.010
afford to go to college, and then afterwards,
aren't so burdened with debt that you can't

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.310
do anything else. We want to make this experience
more affordable because you're not just investing

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.580
in yourselves, you're investing in your nation.
[APPLAUSE] I want us to all organize together

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.299
-- not on a partisan basis, it's not organizing
around an election, it's organizing around

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.950
a simple idea that everybody should be able
to get behind. And you're going to have to

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.010
play the part. Because what we also made the
point of this past weekend is young people

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.500
typically lead the pack with new ideas, with
new initiatives, with new focus, with a new

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.860
vision. [APPLAUSE] And in the meantime, you've
got to study hard, and work hard, and have

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:31.620
fun. Make some new discoveries. Inspire us.
Lead us. Be the Americans that we need you

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.000
to be. Every American should have the right
to go as far as their talents and hard work

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.690
will take them. That is what college is all
about. That is what America is all about.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:54.280
And you embody that basic notion. You are
that talent. You are an embodiment of what

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.120
we hope for: A country that says that everybody,
rich, poor, black, white, Hispanic, Asian,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:08.020
gay, straight, man, woman, with disabilities,
without -- no matter who you are or where

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.790
you come from, not only can you succeed but
you can help everybody else succeed. That's

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.920
the promise that helped us become the greatest
nation in the world. That's the promise that

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.960
I need you working for. Thank you, everybody.
God bless you. Thank you, Georgia.
