00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
hours and the amount of time you need

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.510 
hours and the amount of time you need
will<00:03:07.489> depend<00:03:07.520> on<00:03:08.270> how<00:03:09.080> warm<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.890> room<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.280> so

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
will depend on how warm the room is so

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.070 
will depend on how warm the room is so
if<00:03:10.640> it's<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.850> warmer<00:03:11.209> room<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.600> may<00:03:11.690> go<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.870> little

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
if it's a warmer room it may go a little

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.050 
if it's a warmer room it may go a little
bit<00:03:12.290> faster<00:03:12.620> be<00:03:12.709> closer<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.130> 12<00:03:13.400> hours<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:13.940> it's

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
bit faster be closer to 12 hours if it's

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.970 
bit faster be closer to 12 hours if it's
a<00:03:14.120> cooler<00:03:14.420> room<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.690> may<00:03:14.810> take<00:03:15.050> closer<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.590> 18

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
a cooler room it may take closer to 18

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.160 
a cooler room it may take closer to 18
hours<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.030> most<00:03:17.330> common<00:03:17.780> though<00:03:17.870> for<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:18.110> to

take on the longer end of that time

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.030 
take on the longer end of that time
spectrum<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.720> once<00:03:20.930> this<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.170> set<00:03:21.470> for<00:03:21.500> 12<00:03:21.739> to

18 hours we have this one that we
