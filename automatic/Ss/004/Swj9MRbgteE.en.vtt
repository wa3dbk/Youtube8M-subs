00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.710
 Let's talk about the situations we have to go with the hamster to the vet! 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.920
 We will begin by discussing the digestive problems of hamsters because, 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.610
 undoubtedly, 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.970
 are the most common problems, especially diarrhea. These are very common 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.590
 and very serious in the case of hamsters, are caused by many different factors, 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.489
 including parasites, is very important 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.439
 to deparasite these animals, 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.500
 people think these little animals do not need, but it's not true, 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.940
 will repeat, they need 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.010
 by a frequent deworming. On the other hand, we are confronted with dysbiosis, 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.260
 imbalance of intestinal flora 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.429
 due to a food change, 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.539
 or sudden sudden stress, often happens 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.170
 and can lead to the disease that we call the "wet tail" 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.650
 which is manifested by abundant aqueous diarrhea. We call him "wet tail" 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.320
 because we notice that the animal always has a wet tail. 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.980
 You will see exactly what she looks like because I brought an animal with me 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.500
 affected by this problem. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 It is very important to examine your physical condition daily 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.200
 of your pet and to look especially in the area around the anus, 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.990
 because this disease, this watery diarrhea, can do that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.760
 in just a few hours 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.690
 the animal to dehydrate, 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.130
 to decompose, 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.520
 and finally 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.740
 to aggravate a lot. 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.729
 Then, 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.530
 if the animal has diarrhea, we will hydrate it as soon as possible, 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.380
 you can take a syringe and force it to drink water, 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.189
 in addition, you also have 2 products available that you can use, 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.230
 Cunipic Flora Digest and Cunipic Vita Suero, 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.270
 these products restore the balance of intestinal flora as quickly as possible, 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.200
 hydrates the animal and helps it 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.240
 to recover. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.659
 On the second plane in order of importance, we need to talk about 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.540
 pneumonia and respiratory processes. We often meet hamsters 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.290
 with problems with conjunctivitis, rhinitis 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.420
 and pneumonia in general, 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.780
 all due to environmental conditions, that is 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.490
 unencrypted, too cold or too hot environments, 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.430
 but also because of too small and enclosed spaces. Although it is true like hamsters 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.420
 very well supports cold climate conditions, is very important 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.470
 to ensure that there are no sudden changes in climate, 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.570
 that is, not to go from hot to cold quickly, 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.119
 especially when we warm the house in winter. 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:33.030
 Also, 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.289
 to control 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.120
 and the quality of the bedding we use, it is important to put them 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.029
 substrate of press paper, but to put them a lump, 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.040
 as you can see here, one of a fan, 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 where animals 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.940
 can shelter, 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.480
 they like to make their own vegetal fiber slice, like the fan. In addition, 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.140
 the fan is also useful for the situations we talked about at the beginning of the video, for diarrhea, 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.900
 the fan controls the digestive processes very well, the fibers help 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.439
 the animal to return. 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.309
 Last but not least, I want to talk about another common problem, 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.340
 skin problems, skin problems: 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.569
 alopecia, 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.449
 wounds. They are especially common in hamsters, 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.750
 both because of external parasites, and here I will insist again, 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.590
 deparazite your animals both externally and internally, 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.560
 all animals, if they are small does not mean that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.609
 they do not need it. 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.890
 External parasites, namely mites 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.220
 are the cause of many hearing and skin problems in rodents, but 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.369
 of hamsters in particular. 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.449
 In addition, if you have more, 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.340
 following the beatings between them 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.879
 there are many scratches, many skin wounds, 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.710
 mushrooms are very common, 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.320
 all the more so in dirty environments, that's why 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.919
 I have to clean the cage of the hamsters 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.880
 every week, 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.770
 but we need to examine the animal every day, 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.000
 because small animals can get sick 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.640
 very fast, 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.140
 so when we take him to play with him and examine all the parts.
