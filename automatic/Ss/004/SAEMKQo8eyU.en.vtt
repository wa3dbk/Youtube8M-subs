00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:10.930
SPEAKER 1: Back in 2011, we
unveiled the Shiv, the

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.290
ultimate bike for triathletes
focusing on all the pieces

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.600
that athlete has in mind, from
aerodynamics, to fuel, to fit,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.130
making sure that athlete
is one with their bike.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.020
That same year, in 2011, Craig
Alexander rode the Shiv for

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.860
the first time, going 13 minutes
faster on the bike

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.595
than ever before setting a
course record and winning the

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.760
world championship.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.299
There's no better way to prove
that air is everything.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.549
SPEAKER 2: Craig Alexander--

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:43.279
a new course record!

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:44.529
Unbelievable!

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.460
CRAIG ALEXANDER: You know, my
job is to get fit, but there

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.940
is so much more performance than
just my level of fitness.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.545
And obviously, my equipment
plays a huge role, as I found

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:57.850
out first hand in 2011.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.592
It's always about going fast
because it's a race, but it's

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:02.150
about going faster
with a minimum

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.180
input of energy possible.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.610
Minimizing drag in aerodynamics
plays a huge role

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.160
because you want to be able to
expend your energy in a way

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.530
that you get a massive return on
that investment, ie, going

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.160
further down the road, and also
saving energy for the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.490
marathon which is a huge
determining factor in success

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.510
or failure in any triathlon,
in particular Hawaii.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.650
SPEAKER 1: Over the years,
adapting time trial bikes for

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190
triathlon has is never worked,
because the rider hasn't had a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.110
place carry their fuel.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.520
Now you take an athlete like
Bevan Docherty, two-time

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.770
Olympic champion, transitioning
from short

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.700
course to long course, he's
been able to benefit from

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.930
these integrated fuel
options on the Shiv.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.200
BEVAN DOCHERTY: Certainly in
changing from short course to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.470
long course, the Shiv has been
crucial in my training and

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.300
also racing.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.410
And it's designed for a
long course athlete.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.750
When I'm out there racing and
I have to grab a bottle from

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.630
someone, I pretty much
just dump it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.780
straight into the fuselage.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.220
Pop open the top, dump the
water in, and carry on.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.450
In my fuel cell, I generally
just jam as many gels and bars

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.335
in it as I can.

00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:16.360
It just makes it super
aero and super

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.610
clean and super tidy.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.680
SPEAKER 1: The Shiv was designed
with fit in mind to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.990
be as aerodynamic as possible
but be comfortable

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.990
for the long haul.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.220
Macca has used the adjustability
of the Shiv to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.260
continually refine his
fit over the years.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.230
CHRIS MCCORMACK: I changed so
many things about my position,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.440
I learned so much about my
geometry, the way I'm built

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.250
and why I sit in certain ways.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.390
We moved the seat back a little
bit, believe it or not,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.940
and I was able to come up a
little bit higher without

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.980
affecting my frontal
area at all.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.380
When I'm having to see that on
the screen, and you can see

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.360
here I am with lower position
in front, here you are a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.780
higher position there's no
change in your frontal drag

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.610
and it's so much more
comfortable.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.780
It's night and day.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.190
You guys are able to fit not
only me to position, but

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.340
you've got the arsenal of
products to make sure that

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.850
position works, is comfortable,
and is

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.540
functional.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.610
The position is there,
everything's right it's up to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.270
me to get the result I'm after.
