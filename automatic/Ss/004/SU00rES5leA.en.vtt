 hello everybody welcome to another one 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.410
 overview video here in the pics channel 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.210
 online 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.600
 in this video we will be giving a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.760
 sequence to our last video that was 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.830
 than that of the former biturbo star of this 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.609
 We'll see the former team and ex trike again. 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.539
 conca gum conca alan and conca ris 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.160
 here o 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 Why are we going to do an overview? 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.230
 it will already because the pious crowd that's right 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.790
 young man after a camera man intended 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 They are found everywhere and are years 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.239
 years of training to interact with the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.520
 person on the other side 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 beautiful I liked it here looking at the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.750
 his face I already wanted to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.910
 put a cool machine on him, let's go 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.039
 the code that people always get us 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.449
 we will see on the lateral sides and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.789
 side we take a look at everything 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.160
 our side here you can see that it has 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.350
 a cut of acrylic and by the way the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.899
 I click to smoke that neither the biturbo that is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.740
 very cool says that kofu mission well 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.810
 Nice and has a whole design kitadi 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.920
 very nice air intake woman who 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.600
 front part 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.280
 front when he has a style 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.990
 of full bay here 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 but at first it seems he has three 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.790
 dvd bays to remove them is very 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.780
 Easy, you just pull it here. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.330
 and then he crossed the shot was already more 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.770
 Easy here, only after that. 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.900
 here on the front panel two connectors 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.939
 usb plus a 3.0 sbt audio and microphone 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.619
 power button reset button 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.570
 unlike the bi turbo that had a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.520
 button simply one off 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.649
 here we have two flight controllers 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.909
 also on the front and top 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.360
 only they have speed regulation 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.210
 very cool 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.340
 on the other side just like the other does not have 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 the acrylic record on his back 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.890
 we also had the 12 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.360
 the output of the motherboard panel outputs 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.710
 here for you is to set up a system of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.290
 refrigeration 1234567 bays 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.080
 it also has one of O system here 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.760
 easy removal for you to cover all 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.360
 screws after you finish 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.810
 Assembly 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.930
 it is the source is down in the part of 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.000
 he has other technical support I smoked 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.710
 very cool where you can see that it gives 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 to put two more fans of 12 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.170
 centimeters in it and this lid here she 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.100
 slips and she has what's in here 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.650
 roni 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.170
 the docking station and turn just like be 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.850
 now we will open it to give a 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.630
 Look inside as you can. 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.800
 see screws for easy removal 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.140
 forever as you will soon see 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.000
 He is very similar to the biturbo. 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.959
 he has that the system also of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.989
 tucuruí where you inspire puts what 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.100
 Do you want to put in the bay? Come here. 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.570
 catch it 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.780

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.459
 brackets for hd apae to dhd much 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.420
 Guys can see that behind it has 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.450
 a record 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.100
 because if you pull so she opens cac 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.630
 of the hour and why is it beside 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.140

 tv that was left over a quota 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.190
 Then you just tighten it up so you can 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.230
 then a dog ta working part 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.980
 two men mentioned that she is 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.290

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.400
 I mentioned you can add two more 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.150
 top poles just remove that part 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.220
 on here 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.630
 from the front should give 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.269
 put two fans too 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:51.180
 let's see what's in the other's system and 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:53.100
 I have to filter system and place 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.640
 their fans right here for them here and 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:02.220
 then you come and they already boxed like that 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.100
 it's very cool super cool simple 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.810
 then just come here is the part 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.239
 cool I think to choke the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.640
 cabinet 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.769
 The radinho and lacking people see what 's 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.180
 Giovanni cool now the bottom 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.959
 of the source's core has a filter 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.520
 also 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.100
 Now let's see what he comes here for. 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.320
 connection to usb 3.0 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.110
 only on the motherboard here we have 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.170
 Standard with USB Audio Power Input 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.660

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.190
 we have a SATA connector is for you power 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.260
 turn on the touch and here's the power of the doc 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.270
 and here we have the funk controller 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.790
 you will connect the logic controller that 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.560
 he would have energy and here you will call 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.290
 up to four fans it is already specified 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.840
 Which car from the front to the top location? 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.390
 so you can control the speeds 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.170
 and in fact they will never almost forget the 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.380
 mounting kit the screws but the 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.050
 system to organize the cables well 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.200

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.660

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.000
 sure that should be very cool 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.450
 cool I think it should have a pull on 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.100
 lighting should look great for 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.700
