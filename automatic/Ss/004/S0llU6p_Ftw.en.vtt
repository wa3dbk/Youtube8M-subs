00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
to create a much looser curl i would

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.270 
to create a much looser curl i would
always<00:01:01.350> use<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.129> larger<00:01:02.670> section<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> hair<00:01:04.280> but

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
always use a larger section of hair but

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.969 
always use a larger section of hair but
the<00:01:05.339> strength<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.790> slightly<00:01:06.330> lower<00:01:06.570> down

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
the strength is in slightly lower down

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:15.390 
the strength is in slightly lower down
bend<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.689> around

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.810 

I'm<00:01:16.030> just<00:01:16.210> gonna<00:01:16.300> end<00:01:16.390> up<00:01:16.600> with<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.780> much<00:01:16.990> looser

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I'm just gonna end up with a much looser

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.270 
I'm just gonna end up with a much looser
list<00:01:18.820> height<00:01:19.090> ringing<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:22.680> also<00:01:23.680> if<00:01:23.980> you<00:01:24.160> were

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
list height ringing it also if you were

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.890 
list height ringing it also if you were
to<00:01:24.400> do<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.550> more<00:01:24.760> tightly<00:01:25.000> as<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.600> showed<00:01:25.810> you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
to do it more tightly as I showed you

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.870 
to do it more tightly as I showed you
before<00:01:25.990> but<00:01:26.770> wanted<00:01:27.040> it<00:01:27.160> to<00:01:27.310> look<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.760> bit

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
before but wanted it to look a bit

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.450 
before but wanted it to look a bit
looser<00:01:28.420> just<00:01:28.900> pulling<00:01:29.200> out<00:01:29.380> afterwards<00:01:30.010> will

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
looser just pulling out afterwards will

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.310 
looser just pulling out afterwards will
achieve<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.820> much<00:01:31.060> looser<00:01:31.300> look<00:01:34.170> repeat<00:01:35.170> this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
achieve a much looser look repeat this

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.810

technique<00:01:35.740> all<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.220> way<00:01:36.340> around<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.670> head

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
technique all the way around the head

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.910 
technique all the way around the head
and<00:01:37.090> you'll<00:01:37.630> achieve<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:38.200> lovely<00:01:38.500> curly<00:01:38.800> look

and you'll achieve a lovely curly look

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.440 
and you'll achieve a lovely curly look
using<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.640> pair<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.850> straightening<00:01:40.210> irons

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
using just a pair of straightening irons
