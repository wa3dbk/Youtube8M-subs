00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.520
 what can we say that is 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.139
 fabulous 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.639

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.099
 made championship this year is so 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.210
 well we were regular it's clear that in 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.639
 second part so in second season 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.770
 we were perhaps less effective than the 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.289
 first I was regular it's clear 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.840
 that we append that has a lot of goals 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.460
 we go to fair play we are one of the two 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.810
 best in both groups 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.669
 so it's clear that we showed again 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.169
 today under the grounds etc that 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.849
 can be the strength of our team that we 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.849
 was regular here
