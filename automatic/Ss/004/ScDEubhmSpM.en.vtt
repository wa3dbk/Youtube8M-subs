 the girls to the people I 'm sorry I'm 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.920
 labiano video channels we are again 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.289
 in this section that consists in seeing the 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.539
 faces of subscribers that cool and it 's me 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.280
 has really liked this house really 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.679
 I mean it's functional is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 modernity is extra in apothecary and strange 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:22.890
 I must also say it but I liked it 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.449
 a lot is made by the newspaper and you do not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.320
 I wanted to fuss with the name forget do 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.060
 Youtube 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.429
 as the sea says contemporary house 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.169
 modern functional and free hey that 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.030
 that is free is very good because 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.620
 it's okay the free stuff we like to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 we 're all going to start with this part of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.500
 here although I want to say something where 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.780
 I would enter 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.490
 this is a column a simple column 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.430
 that I am now has scratched me and I say and 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.410
 where do we go to the house because the house 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.030
 where would it rise if we come 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.309
 from somewhere 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.079
 you understand me, because if we 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.270
 we come here how we do to access 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.910
 she 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.100
 because it has no opening if you 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.710
 you fix not or that I'm blind and not the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.750
 I'm watching even though he has a face 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.180
 you will see but well we will see 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.770
 it's okay guys, it does not matter, I'm not struck 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.300
 I say nothing more as it is a house that has 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.040
 as different gateways because it has 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.800
 different different levels of 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.510
 stairs also by those 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.890
 they 're pretty good, let's start with 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.540
 this part of up here we must 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.880
 start with this part that I liked 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.990
 much to say that the forgotten has 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.300
 put some touches that I liked 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.100
 very much because they also give me a 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.509
 very cool feeling seen this house and I 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.759
 I have been very happy because it is a 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.960
 house that I liked a lot and this well 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.149
 well as you can see there are a lot of things 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.130
 with apples everywhere and these 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.540
 guys is a relaxation room but 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.160
 good room pardons a zone of 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.110
 good relaxation was inflated them go 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.960
 good of dirty yoga for ducks and here 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.200
 well carrots here do not knock down and masters and 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.200
 we would say 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.250
 Never coming good do not know what 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.299
 it says in yoga it gives us quite cool this 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.820
 part of here as it is decorated in 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.250
 quartz the house itself is quartz with 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.710
 colored clay but - also 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.810
 tinted glass that stays very cool 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.430
 Upon entering the house we realize 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.770
 which is a functional house in all 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.060
 we will see it in the first place 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.100
 place as you see here we have a bank 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.840
 to sit and observe I think it gives 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.850
 just look just the sun where 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.250
 comes out here we have what it comes to be 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.420
 this is very cool a pinball pad one that 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.980
 shoot snowballs 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.110
 it's very cool the truth that pretty 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.510
 We have chests to address our 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.890
 things there we have another chest there are two more 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.110
 I work that increase we will not go 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.120
 here we are going to cut down that this is 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.860
 very cool more buy here as there 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.630
 quite prepared fastened and we have 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.980
 things to go to the elt and kill the dragon 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.140
 more blue ball the koleston flag all 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.220
 kind of seeds is a guy who knows what 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.140
 He has carefully worked a lot because as you see it has 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.520
 dedicated to putting us in the chests having 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.740
 done with creative I guess it has not 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.360
 said in the mail but I imagine what 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.610
 creative also run it txiki as 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.040
 the video of now the teachers and they are very 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.960
 few do you think so we see that 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.640
 because the boy was engaged in thinking hears 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.470
 Well, if I were this house, then, like, 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.840
 I would do the truth that I like that 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.770
 that people were cured of logging and this 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.890
 boy of now I say that he has done it and 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.750
 much here as it is would be a portal to 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.790
 determinant well decorated with crystals 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.080
 a truth that is pretty nice in that 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.290
 room from here we have a bedroom 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.780
 As you can see we have two beds here 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.000
 double requirements other layers two beds 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.110
 good double and different chests the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.940
 true that he's pretty cool with the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.620
 tinted glasses and then here 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.430
 we already have descents we do not have two 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.829
 descents 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.150
 I think they take us to the same place 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.180
 there we have a kind of 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.579
 closed terrace where we have 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.719
 cakes if we want to eat well this 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.269
 part as it charges us to take us 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.069
 towards the different sides by this 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.840
 part is where we could go down if 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.519
 we would have gone instead of here 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.340
 we would have gone down we have a kind of 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.650
 barbecue like that would be I'm here or a 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.590
 fire with you believe call it here an area 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.049
 of rest and different tables and for 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.459
 here this communicated by the site because 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.919
 we just downloaded that I just 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.450
 teach and this is something strange is worth this 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.829
 it's strange now you'll see why but 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.359
 good is a descent as you see with 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.980
 Ccoo cast crystals in the shape of 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.599
 Rainbow is pretty cool and 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.879
 here we have the crops crops of 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.709
 cocoa here we make the carrot 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.169
 and the potato or potato and carrot 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.500
 a climb that would take us to the 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:16.479
 wheat that we have cabbalas as we have 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.470
 more cocoa thanks to something strange is 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.109
 declared here to me in particular 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.430
 they seem strange, we can also 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.560
 climb through the water but it's good for me 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.449
 I miss what I find strange about 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.940
 this house is that I think you have 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.860
 worked a lot but as I said you have not 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.030
 thought of how to get through it 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.280
 if for example you go 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.680
 if you go out there to kill monsters like 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.020
 you go up to her I explain you would have to 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.340
 do something there should be a 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.250
 opening for example from here some 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.300
 stairs that were made I know 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.420
 you know in the style that you have done it 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.030
 because if not, a person can not come 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.110
 on the other hand if it is not that he was born in 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.730
 she less I mean you have currado 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.560
 very much in the house but promotion to 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.300
 entry and nothing happens or only to 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.820
 I would also spend if a house grows in 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.650
 creative would be of the very entry 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.650
 I believe that the truth is that it is 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.660
 pretty good the house modifications such 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.040
 time on the subject of maybe the walls or 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.360
 something like that because they are a bit empty 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.580
 and that I always perfectionist 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.050
 but I think this house is very good 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.820
 I do not think we need to say 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.290
 to discuss what is missing what 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.970
 do not believe is a house that is very well 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.890
 very well done very bizarre like 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.840
 he said very emotional means very 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.730
 peculiarly worth is something different is a 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.350
 different house but not for them worse or 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.490
 better than others I think it's a 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.950
 very modern very functional house 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.840
 different contemporary and I like it 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.070
 quite so if you like this house 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.840
 remember this description like all 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.250
 that I analyze you can subscribe if you wish 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.680
 you can tell you how similar it can be 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.569
 like and see you then win your two 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.110
 crisis to the smallest goodbye 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.110
 81
