basically<00:01:11.430> dead<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.300> its<00:01:12.479> try<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.660> hit<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
basically dead on its try to hit the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.240 
basically dead on its try to hit the
same<00:01:13.050> place<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> wasn't<00:01:13.650> trying<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> spread<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
same place I wasn't trying to spread it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
same place I wasn't trying to spread it
out<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.300> panel<00:01:15.600> could<00:01:15.690> absorb<00:01:15.990> more<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.530> was

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
out so the panel could absorb more I was

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.650 
out so the panel could absorb more I was
trying<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.190> go<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> same<00:01:17.729> impact<00:01:18.330> every

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
trying to go for the same impact every

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.260 
trying to go for the same impact every
time<00:01:18.869> knows<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.320> close<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.800> that<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.070> possible

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
time knows as close to that as possible

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.460 
time knows as close to that as possible
so<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.300> helped<00:01:21.630> bowed<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:22.050> because<00:01:22.290> it's

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
so that helped bowed out because it's

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.719 
so that helped bowed out because it's
hitting<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> same<00:01:22.979> place<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> middle

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
hitting the same place in the middle

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.969 
hitting the same place in the middle
every<00:01:23.940> time<00:01:24.180> plus<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.170> had<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.320> stick<00:01:25.560> back<00:01:25.770> here

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
every time plus I had to stick back here

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.380 
every time plus I had to stick back here
prop<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:26.970> getting<00:01:27.090> tock

prop in this up so it's getting tock

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.249 
prop in this up so it's getting tock
code<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.020> hit<00:01:28.229> whatever<00:01:29.190> we<00:01:29.610> did<00:01:30.259> excel
