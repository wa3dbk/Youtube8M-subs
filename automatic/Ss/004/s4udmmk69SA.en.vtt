00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.760
 was 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.570
 start my on the training ground where 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.430
 future motorists are trying to learn 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.680
 perform complex maneuvers in particular 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.730
 parking in reverse their so-called 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.980
 parallel parking that is 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.770
 get to know a beautiful student 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.480
 which is already on our eyes well minutes 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.829
