generated a lot of questions I'm gonna

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.409 
generated a lot of questions I'm gonna
try<00:00:30.739> to<00:00:30.800> answer<00:00:31.039> another<00:00:31.369> one<00:00:31.550> of<00:00:31.669> them<00:00:31.789> a<00:00:32.029> lot

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
try to answer another one of them a lot

try to answer another one of them a lot
of<00:00:32.509> people<00:00:32.720> asked<00:00:32.989> me<00:00:33.110> Jason<00:00:33.530> why<00:00:33.649> do<00:00:33.710> you

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
of people asked me Jason why do you

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.680 
of people asked me Jason why do you
hyperextend<00:00:34.670> at<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.879> top<00:00:35.059> of<00:00:35.180> your<00:00:35.269> deadlift

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
hyperextend at the top of your deadlift

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.410 
hyperextend at the top of your deadlift
like<00:00:35.899> that<00:00:36.140> is<00:00:36.769> that<00:00:36.980> a<00:00:37.010> problem<00:00:37.339> why<00:00:38.269> are<00:00:38.300> you

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
like that is that a problem why are you

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.850 
like that is that a problem why are you
doing<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:38.900> what<00:00:39.110> are<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.320> risks<00:00:39.620> associated

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
doing it what are the risks associated

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.380 
doing it what are the risks associated
with<00:00:40.220> that<00:00:40.370> are<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:40.760> worried<00:00:40.970> about<00:00:41.030> injuring

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
with that are you worried about injuring

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.630 
with that are you worried about injuring
yourself<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.589> to<00:00:42.710> raise<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:42.890> couple<00:00:43.159> of<00:00:43.309> points

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
yourself and to raise a couple of points

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.060 
yourself and to raise a couple of points
there<00:00:43.839> as<00:00:44.839> far<00:00:45.050> as<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.290> injury<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.650> things<00:00:45.860> go

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
there as far as the injury and things go

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.490 
there as far as the injury and things go
one<00:00:46.640> I'm<00:00:46.879> not<00:00:47.059> getting<00:00:47.839> up<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.110> top<00:00:48.320> and

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
one I'm not getting up to the top and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500 
one I'm not getting up to the top and
then<00:00:48.589> hyperextending<00:00:49.370> way<00:00:49.640> after<00:00:50.120> I'm<00:00:50.300> hyper

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
then hyperextending way after I'm hyper

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.930 
then hyperextending way after I'm hyper
extending<00:00:51.320> is<00:00:51.409> one<00:00:51.620> smooth<00:00:51.949> movement<00:00:52.220> and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
extending is one smooth movement and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.130 
extending is one smooth movement and
I'll<00:00:53.059> get<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.239> why<00:00:53.449> I<00:00:53.480> do<00:00:53.719> that<00:00:53.870> in<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:53.989> minute

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
I'll get to why I do that in a minute

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.750 
I'll get to why I do that in a minute
and<00:00:54.350> number<00:00:54.590> two<00:00:54.800> I'm<00:00:55.039> doing<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:55.370> with<00:00:55.489> still

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and number two I'm doing it with still

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.279 
and number two I'm doing it with still
what<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.059> not<00:00:56.239> considered<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.750> really<00:00:57.019> heavy

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
what is not considered a really heavy

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.439 
what is not considered a really heavy
weight<00:00:57.590> now<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.219> know<00:00:58.430> heavy<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.910> very<00:00:59.120> relative

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
weight now I know heavy is very relative

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.479 
weight now I know heavy is very relative
but<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.929> people<00:01:00.199> who<00:01:00.320> train<00:01:00.739> relatively

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
but the people who train relatively

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.630

working<00:01:12.200> with<00:01:12.289> a<00:01:12.350> weight<00:01:12.619> like<00:01:12.830> that<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:14.270> I'm

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
working with a weight like that that I'm

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.330 
working with a weight like that that I'm
using<00:01:14.810> anything<00:01:15.020> under<00:01:15.350> about<00:01:15.500> 90<00:01:15.890> percent<00:01:16.250> of

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
using anything under about 90 percent of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.740 
using anything under about 90 percent of
your<00:01:16.460> one<00:01:16.640> rep<00:01:16.789> max<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.240> not<00:01:17.390> going<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.630> be

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
your one rep max is not going to be

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.240 
your one rep max is not going to be
considered<00:01:18.050> really<00:01:18.320> heavy<00:01:18.679> work<00:01:18.890> so

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
considered really heavy work so

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.820 
considered really heavy work so
therefore<00:01:19.780> my<00:01:20.780> back<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.350> connective<00:01:21.800> tissue

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
therefore my back and connective tissue

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.350 
therefore my back and connective tissue
and<00:01:22.159> things<00:01:22.340> are<00:01:22.520> generally<00:01:22.880> going<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.300> be

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
and things are generally going to be

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.719 
and things are generally going to be
used<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.750> handling<00:01:24.110> workloads<00:01:24.560> like<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:25.039> so

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
used to handling workloads like that so

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.969 
used to handling workloads like that so
for<00:01:25.940> me<00:01:26.000> for<00:01:26.119> example<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.690> was<00:01:26.840> 495<00:01:27.679> pounds

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
for me for example that was 495 pounds

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.969 
for me for example that was 495 pounds
and<00:01:28.550> you<00:01:29.179> guys<00:01:29.330> have<00:01:29.450> seen<00:01:29.599> me<00:01:29.660> pull<00:01:29.989> 575<00:01:30.770> on

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
and you guys have seen me pull 575 on

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.559 
and you guys have seen me pull 575 on
camera<00:01:31.369> we're<00:01:31.520> dealing<00:01:31.759> with<00:01:31.789> less<00:01:32.119> than<00:01:32.270> 90

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
camera we're dealing with less than 90

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.719 
camera we're dealing with less than 90
percent<00:01:32.720> on<00:01:33.110> top<00:01:33.229> of<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:33.500> deficit<00:01:33.979> work<00:01:34.220> is

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
percent on top of that deficit work is

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.279 
percent on top of that deficit work is
going<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.090> be<00:01:35.179> lighter<00:01:35.539> than<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:35.869> can<00:01:36.020> do<00:01:36.110> full

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
going to be lighter than you can do full

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.169 
going to be lighter than you can do full
range<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.679> motion<00:01:37.069> so<00:01:37.099> you<00:01:37.610> factor<00:01:37.940> in<00:01:38.060> are

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
range of motion so you factor in are

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.229 
range of motion so you factor in are
doing<00:01:38.390> triples<00:01:39.009> off<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.459> deficit<00:01:40.970> it's

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:41.239 
doing triples off of a deficit it's

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:43.690 
doing triples off of a deficit it's
ultimately<00:01:41.720> not<00:01:41.959> that<00:01:42.170> heavy<00:01:42.319> on<00:01:42.530> my<00:01:42.709> back<00:01:43.039> so

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
ultimately not that heavy on my back so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.520 
ultimately not that heavy on my back so
no<00:01:43.849> I<00:01:43.880> don't<00:01:44.149> ever<00:01:44.270> get<00:01:44.539> strain<00:01:44.929> or<00:01:45.170> feel<00:01:45.349> any

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
no I don't ever get strain or feel any

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.260 
no I don't ever get strain or feel any
pain<00:01:45.739> in<00:01:45.950> my<00:01:46.039> back<00:01:46.250> from<00:01:46.280> doing<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.000> that's

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
pain in my back from doing it and that's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.309 
pain in my back from doing it and that's
the<00:01:47.450> thing<00:01:47.599> you<00:01:47.690> need<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.840> remember<00:01:47.959> it's<00:01:48.289> not

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
the thing you need to remember it's not

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.260 
the thing you need to remember it's not
with<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.619> really<00:01:48.979> heavy<00:01:49.160> weight<00:01:49.429> now<00:01:49.729> why<00:01:50.000> am<00:01:50.149> i

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
with a really heavy weight now why am i

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.020 
with a really heavy weight now why am i
doing<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.780> when<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.619> talk<00:01:51.860> about<00:01:52.030> not

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
doing it when I talk about not

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.790 
doing it when I talk about not
decelerating<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:53.959> training<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:54.410> avoiding

even pause work in the middle this comes

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.600 
even pause work in the middle this comes
back<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.319> the<00:01:57.440> same<00:01:57.679> point<00:01:57.979> of<00:01:58.099> you<00:01:58.250> have<00:01:58.429> to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
back to the same point of you have to

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.400 
back to the same point of you have to
decelerate<00:01:59.270> at<00:01:59.479> some<00:01:59.840> point<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.319> you're

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
decelerate at some point and you're

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.440 
decelerate at some point and you're
going<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.739> decelerate<00:02:01.099> close<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:02.119> where<00:02:02.270> you

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
going to decelerate close to where you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.270 
going to decelerate close to where you
train<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.989> do<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.229> in<00:02:03.319> your<00:02:03.349> regular<00:02:03.619> training

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
train to do it in your regular training

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.859 
train to do it in your regular training
and<00:02:04.459> so<00:02:04.550> by<00:02:04.759> be<00:02:04.910> doing<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.239> deficit<00:02:05.599> workout

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
and so by be doing the deficit workout

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.449 
and so by be doing the deficit workout
training<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.349> build<00:02:06.470> more<00:02:06.770> speed<00:02:07.039> off<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.369> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.570 
training to build more speed off of the
floor<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.959> pull<00:02:09.200> faster<00:02:09.770> when<00:02:10.399> I'm

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
floor so that I can pull faster when I'm

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.400 
floor so that I can pull faster when I'm
at<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.729> normal<00:02:11.239> deadlift<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.750> competition<00:02:12.319> or

at a normal deadlift and competition or
peaking<00:02:12.680> for<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> meet<00:02:13.129> so<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.400> can<00:02:13.580> pull<00:02:13.879> faster

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390

peaking for a meet so I can pull faster
that<00:02:14.569> way<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.900> generate<00:02:15.200> more<00:02:15.230> speed<00:02:15.590> more

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
that way and generate more speed more

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.100 
that way and generate more speed more
power<00:02:16.340> here's<00:02:17.120> gonna<00:02:17.239> remember<00:02:17.540> speed<00:02:17.810> equals

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
power here's gonna remember speed equals

your deadlift as only as a result of
deceleration<00:02:29.860> because<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.130> fact<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.520> lot

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
deceleration because the fact that a lot

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.970 
deceleration because the fact that a lot
of<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.910> can

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
at the top is more than sufficient the

at the top is more than sufficient the
only<00:02:41.739> reason<00:02:42.040> you're<00:02:42.160> gonna<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:42.459> problems

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
only reason you're gonna have problems

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.030 
only reason you're gonna have problems
at<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.330> top<00:02:43.540> ever<00:02:44.020> on<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> deadlift

at the top ever on a deadlift

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.180 
at the top ever on a deadlift
accordingly<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.730> because<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:47.440> lost<00:02:47.920> too

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
accordingly is because you have lost too

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.680 
accordingly is because you have lost too
much<00:02:48.340> energy<00:02:48.910> coming<00:02:49.150> out<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.510> bottom

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
much energy coming out of the bottom

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.690 
much energy coming out of the bottom
you've<00:02:49.989> slowed<00:02:50.290> down<00:02:50.500> too<00:02:50.739> much<00:02:50.980> or<00:02:51.280> your<00:02:51.400> form

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
you've slowed down too much or your form

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.430 
you've slowed down too much or your form
has<00:02:51.880> started<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.239> degradation<00:02:52.720> ear<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.260> top

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
has started to degradation ear the top

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.930 
has started to degradation ear the top
because<00:02:54.040> once<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.340> can<00:02:54.489> get<00:02:54.610> those<00:02:54.700> good

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
because once you can get those good

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.790 
because once you can get those good
leverages<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.630> coming<00:02:56.080> from<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.290> dead<00:02:56.470> stop<00:02:56.620> a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
leverages it coming from a dead stop a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.620 
leverages it coming from a dead stop a
lot<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.130> people<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.489> deadlift<00:02:57.790> 200<00:02:58.330> pounds

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
lot of people can deadlift 200 pounds

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.940 
lot of people can deadlift 200 pounds
more<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.050> lockout<00:02:59.410> then<00:02:59.560> they<00:02:59.650> can<00:02:59.800> pull

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
more on the lockout then they can pull

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.759 
more on the lockout then they can pull
off<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.220> floor<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:01.019> what<00:03:02.019> I'm<00:03:02.200> doing<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:02.739> is

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
off the floor so what I'm doing there is

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.800 
off the floor so what I'm doing there is
training<00:03:03.099> myself<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.580> decelerate<00:03:04.360> or<00:03:04.510> later

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
training myself to decelerate or later

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.880 
training myself to decelerate or later
in<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.140> lift<00:03:05.350> now<00:03:05.560> when<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.709> get<00:03:05.830> to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
in the lift now when I get to

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.259 
in the lift now when I get to
competition<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.610> guys<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:06.880> noticed<00:03:07.030> I

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
competition you guys have noticed I

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.699 
competition you guys have noticed I
still<00:03:07.540> locked<00:03:07.780> out<00:03:07.900> part<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.319> top<00:03:08.500> but<00:03:08.650> I

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
still locked out part of the top but I

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.500 
still locked out part of the top but I
don't<00:03:08.890> go<00:03:09.100> back<00:03:09.280> quite<00:03:09.550> as<00:03:09.790> far<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:10.180> I'm<00:03:10.300> doing

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
don't go back quite as far as I'm doing

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.090 
don't go back quite as far as I'm doing
in<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.840> training<00:03:11.170> videos<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:11.830> because

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
in the training videos and it's because

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.650 
in the training videos and it's because
when<00:03:12.280> I'm<00:03:12.370> dealing<00:03:12.519> with<00:03:12.730> weights<00:03:13.030> above<00:03:13.330> 90%

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
when I'm dealing with weights above 90%

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.039 
when I'm dealing with weights above 90%
I<00:03:14.260> can't<00:03:15.069> keep<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.640> inertia<00:03:16.239> going<00:03:16.780> long

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
I can't keep the inertia going long

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.280 
I can't keep the inertia going long
enough<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.410> do<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.739> but<00:03:18.519> by<00:03:18.700> training<00:03:19.360> that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
enough to do that but by training that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.039 
enough to do that but by training that
way<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.950> changed<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.880> deceleration<00:03:22.269> curve

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
way I changed the deceleration curve

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.570 
way I changed the deceleration curve
near<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.410> top<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.709> my<00:03:23.830> deadlift<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.549> I

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
near the top of my deadlift so that I

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.180 
near the top of my deadlift so that I
train<00:03:24.970> myself<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.480> not<00:03:25.709> decelerate<00:03:26.709> quite<00:03:27.010> as

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
train myself to not decelerate quite as

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.250 
train myself to not decelerate quite as
quick<00:03:27.459> as<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.790> would<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.180> if<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.390> stopped<00:03:28.720> shorter

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
quick as I would is if I stopped shorter

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.710 
quick as I would is if I stopped shorter
so<00:03:29.709> by<00:03:29.830> doing<00:03:29.890> one<00:03:30.340> heavy<00:03:30.640> smooth<00:03:31.060> pull<00:03:31.420> and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
so by doing one heavy smooth pull and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.740 
so by doing one heavy smooth pull and
coming<00:03:31.959> all<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.230> way<00:03:32.260> back<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.920> am<00:03:33.760> moving<00:03:34.480> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
coming all the way back I am moving the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.570 
coming all the way back I am moving the
deceleration<00:03:35.140> curve<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.950> where<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.190> starts

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
deceleration curve to where it starts

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.069 
deceleration curve to where it starts
further<00:03:36.940> up<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.329> deadlift<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.930> that's

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
further up in the deadlift and that's

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.599 
further up in the deadlift and that's
going<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.380> carry<00:03:38.500> over<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.859> me<00:03:39.070> getting<00:03:39.370> better

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
going to carry over to me getting better

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.610 
going to carry over to me getting better
lock<00:03:40.120> outs<00:03:40.359> when<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.690> start<00:03:40.989> hitting<00:03:41.109> heavier

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
lock outs when I start hitting heavier

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.009 
lock outs when I start hitting heavier
weights<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.280> I'm<00:03:42.370> in<00:03:42.579> actual<00:03:43.000> at<00:03:43.239> true<00:03:43.570> maxes

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
weights and I'm in actual at true maxes

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.349 
weights and I'm in actual at true maxes
so<00:03:44.530> there's<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:44.920> reason<00:03:45.519> behind<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.209> not

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
so there's a reason behind that it's not

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.180 
so there's a reason behind that it's not
going<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.630> be<00:03:46.780> risky<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.440> way<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.769> I'm<00:03:47.859> doing

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
going to be risky the way that I'm doing

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.190 
going to be risky the way that I'm doing
it<00:03:48.370> with<00:03:48.549> fairly<00:03:49.329> low<00:03:49.480> volume<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.019> weights

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
it with fairly low volume and weights

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.520 
it with fairly low volume and weights
that<00:03:50.380> aren't<00:03:51.660> extremely<00:03:52.660> heavy<00:03:53.140> for<00:03:53.410> me<00:03:53.500> to

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
that aren't extremely heavy for me to

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.780 
that aren't extremely heavy for me to
deal<00:03:53.829> with<00:03:53.859> it<00:03:54.040> weights<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.519> could<00:03:54.670> walk

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
deal with it weights that I could walk

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.400 
deal with it weights that I could walk
in<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.030> handle<00:03:55.299> on<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.450> day-to-day<00:03:55.750> basis<00:03:56.260> it's

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
in a handle on a day-to-day basis it's

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.750 
in a handle on a day-to-day basis it's
not<00:03:56.590> going<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.799> be<00:03:56.920> problematic<00:03:57.370> because<00:03:57.609> I

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
not going to be problematic because I

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.039 
not going to be problematic because I
mean<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> normal<00:03:58.630> movement<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.989> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
I benchpress my back is pretty flexible

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.810 
I benchpress my back is pretty flexible

back err issues with my back as a result
of<00:04:13.420> dead<00:04:13.570> lifting<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.920> fairly<00:04:15.400> low<00:04:15.730> risk

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
of dead lifting so it is fairly low risk

of dead lifting so it is fairly low risk

out and for me if I miss a deadlift is
almost<00:04:28.479> always<00:04:28.720> off<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.110> floor<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.590> don't<00:04:30.370> miss

lock outs on deadlift and the way that I

lock outs on deadlift and the way that I
train<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.340> lot<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:33.639> stuff<00:04:33.789> I<00:04:33.910> do<00:04:34.210> is

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
train and a lot of this stuff I do is

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.210 
train and a lot of this stuff I do is
one<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.750> reasons<00:04:35.080> why<00:04:35.260> all<00:04:35.919> right<00:04:36.039> guys

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
one of the reasons why all right guys

one of the reasons why all right guys
that's<00:04:36.490> really<00:04:36.789> all<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:36.940> have<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.300> say<00:04:37.450> on<00:04:37.600> that

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
that's really all I have to say on that

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.670 
that's really all I have to say on that
today<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:37.990> hope<00:04:38.169> it's<00:04:38.350> been<00:04:38.500> informative

today I hope it's been informative
and<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:39.830> will<00:04:40.009> talk<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.460> guys<00:04:40.610> next<00:04:40.970> time
