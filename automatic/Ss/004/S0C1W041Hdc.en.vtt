00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.929 

I<00:01:41.360> really<00:01:42.140> feel<00:01:42.409> as<00:01:42.680> though<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.579> naming

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
I really feel as though that the naming

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.330 
I really feel as though that the naming
of<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.119> gym<00:01:44.479> should<00:01:45.439> actually<00:01:45.860> should

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
of the gym should actually should

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.370 
of the gym should actually should
actually<00:01:46.520> as<00:01:47.030> much<00:01:47.299> as<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:47.630> would<00:01:47.990> be<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.140> great

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
actually as much as it would be a great

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.080 
actually as much as it would be a great
honor<00:01:48.560> absolutely<00:01:49.340> will<00:01:49.490> be<00:01:49.520> an<00:01:49.670> honor<00:01:49.909> and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
honor absolutely will be an honor and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.539 
honor absolutely will be an honor and
then<00:01:50.180> I<00:01:50.270> will<00:01:50.420> be<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.200> would<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.430> think

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
then I will be that I would but I think

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.609 
then I will be that I would but I think
it<00:01:52.850> should<00:01:52.909> probably<00:01:53.270> go<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.630> someone<00:01:54.350> who

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
it should probably go to someone who

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.950 
it should probably go to someone who
Alan<00:01:55.399> well<00:01:55.580> one<00:01:55.850> of<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.119> university<00:01:56.840> of
