00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.220
 48 hours ago we found something 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.839
 surprising that there is a structure 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.559
 in Antarctica and a serial specimen 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:16.270
 landing 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.490
 Kate Lloyd, paleontologist of Columbia 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.910
 is to teach because it has fired thousands of 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.910
 kilometer 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.510
 we estimate that it has been here for 100,000 years 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.580
 I need a sample of tissue believe that 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.010
 it's a good idea until later 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.480
 the other friends will be immortalized 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.480
 for being part of this discovery 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.020
 the bone 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.450
 ah 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.309
 my god have attacked someone 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.620
 apparently we are all well or 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.180
 someone has miraculously cured 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.180
 or someone is not who they say they are 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.560
 avoid your cells 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.590
 I think that it is a thing that copies its prey and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.110
 hidden inside of her she tries to say 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.560
 we are not all human could be 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560
 anyone 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.369
 we can not let them leave if he succeeds 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.369
 come out well millions of people will die 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.189
 ah
