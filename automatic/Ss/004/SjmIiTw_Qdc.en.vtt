this was kind of a dud pack not gonna

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.179 
this was kind of a dud pack not gonna
lie<00:01:27.150> Wiggins<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.170> ok<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.860> already<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
lie Wiggins is ok but I already have a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.319 
lie Wiggins is ok but I already have a
better<00:01:29.430> version<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.850> him<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.090> there's<00:01:30.210> like

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
better version of him and there's like

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.850

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
facing the other way but that's filing

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.490 
facing the other way but that's filing
me<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> guess<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.570> NBA<00:01:42.720> Finals<00:01:43.140> pack<00:01:43.259> kind

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
