you<00:00:27.380> might<00:00:27.560> not<00:00:27.710> think<00:00:27.770> that<00:00:28.070> art<00:00:28.400> and

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
you might not think that art and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.700 
you might not think that art and
engineering<00:00:28.790> go<00:00:29.360> together<00:00:29.540> but<00:00:30.410> in<00:00:30.530> reality

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
engineering go together but in reality

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.910 
engineering go together but in reality
they<00:00:31.460> complement<00:00:32.000> each<00:00:32.060> other<00:00:32.270> very<00:00:32.330> well

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
they complement each other very well

they complement each other very well
many<00:00:33.920> things<00:00:34.220> that<00:00:34.550> engineers<00:00:34.730> have<00:00:35.210> put

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
many things that engineers have put

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.090 
many things that engineers have put
together<00:00:35.450> could<00:00:36.110> be<00:00:36.260> considered<00:00:36.680> art<00:00:36.920> and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
together could be considered art and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.270 
together could be considered art and
many<00:00:37.730> things<00:00:38.060> that<00:00:38.270> artists<00:00:38.600> have<00:00:38.690> done<00:00:39.280> take

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
many things that artists have done take

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.910 
many things that artists have done take
some<00:00:40.520> serious<00:00:40.760> engineering<00:00:41.720> but<00:00:42.620> what<00:00:42.770> does

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
some serious engineering but what does

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.530 
some serious engineering but what does
engineering<00:00:43.460> have<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.820> benefit<00:00:44.239> from

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
engineering have to benefit from

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.540 
engineering have to benefit from
artistic<00:00:45.140> skills<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:45.710> thinking<00:00:46.280> like<00:00:46.309> an

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
artistic skills and thinking like an

in the previous video is sketching an

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.840 
in the previous video is sketching an
important<00:00:51.800> way<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:52.100> communicating<00:00:52.610> ideas

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
important way of communicating ideas

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.200 
important way of communicating ideas
that<00:00:53.660> might<00:00:53.840> be<00:00:53.960> difficult<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.440> do<00:00:54.620> otherwise

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
that might be difficult to do otherwise

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.910 
that might be difficult to do otherwise
let's<00:00:56.210> take<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.450> look<00:00:56.660> at<00:00:56.810> engineering<00:00:56.990> so<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
let's take a look at engineering so the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.470 
let's take a look at engineering so the
eyes<00:00:58.040> of<00:00:58.280> someone<00:00:58.490> who's<00:00:58.730> trying<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.120> design

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.170 
eyes of someone who's trying to design
something<00:01:00.520> let's<00:01:01.520> say<00:01:01.700> you're<00:01:01.880> trying<00:01:02.060> to

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
something let's say you're trying to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.450 
something let's say you're trying to
design<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.900> machine<00:01:03.560> that<00:01:04.009> launches<00:01:04.400> a

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
design a machine that launches a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.999 
design a machine that launches a
volleyball<00:01:05.000> into<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:05.479> air<00:01:05.740> something<00:01:06.740> that

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
volleyball into the air something that

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.560 
volleyball into the air something that
could<00:01:07.160> be<00:01:07.250> used<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.670> help<00:01:07.790> someone<00:01:08.090> practice

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
could be used to help someone practice

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.389 
could be used to help someone practice
their<00:01:08.750> volleyball<00:01:09.200> skills<00:01:09.440> when<00:01:10.009> no<00:01:10.100> one<00:01:10.250> else

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
their volleyball skills when no one else

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.420 
their volleyball skills when no one else
is<00:01:10.580> around<00:01:11.229> now<00:01:12.229> when<00:01:12.649> you<00:01:12.740> first<00:01:12.950> set<00:01:13.160> out<00:01:13.190> to

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
is around now when you first set out to

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.310 
is around now when you first set out to
design<00:01:13.580> something<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:14.149> solves<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.660> problem<00:01:14.810> a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
design something that solves a problem a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.040 
design something that solves a problem a
great<00:01:15.619> first<00:01:16.190> step<00:01:16.250> is<00:01:16.580> brainstorming<00:01:17.390> our

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
great first step is brainstorming our

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.719 
great first step is brainstorming our
thinking<00:01:18.380> of<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.649> lot<00:01:18.800> of<00:01:18.860> different<00:01:19.310> ways<00:01:19.399> to

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
thinking of a lot of different ways to

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.480 
thinking of a lot of different ways to
solve<00:01:20.119> that<00:01:20.360> problem<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:21.080> have<00:01:21.890> some<00:01:22.070> sketches

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
solve that problem I have some sketches

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.400 
solve that problem I have some sketches
here<00:01:22.790> from<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.270> brainstorming<00:01:23.869> session<00:01:23.930> in

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
here from the brainstorming session in

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.070 
here from the brainstorming session in
video<00:01:24.920> 2<00:01:25.009> of<00:01:25.190> this<00:01:25.700> series<00:01:25.869> let's<00:01:26.869> take<00:01:27.050> a

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
video 2 of this series let's take a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.590 
video 2 of this series let's take a
closer<00:01:27.380> look<00:01:27.620> at<00:01:27.740> them<00:01:28.240> these<00:01:29.240> sketches

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
closer look at them these sketches

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.200 
closer look at them these sketches
better<00:01:30.229> convey<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.710> product<00:01:31.070> idea<00:01:31.400> way

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
better convey the product idea way

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.660 
better convey the product idea way
better<00:01:32.479> than<00:01:32.870> words<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.350> do<00:01:33.470> alone<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.520> see

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
better than words can do alone you see

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.730 
better than words can do alone you see
how<00:01:34.760> clear<00:01:35.030> they<00:01:35.180> are<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.600> how<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.080> idea<00:01:36.500> is

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
how clear they are and how the idea is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.219 
how clear they are and how the idea is
conveyed<00:01:37.159> really<00:01:37.549> quickly<00:01:37.940> just<00:01:38.120> by<00:01:38.869> taking<00:01:39.080> a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
conveyed really quickly just by taking a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.150 
conveyed really quickly just by taking a
quick<00:01:39.440> look

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.050 

something<00:01:43.160> like<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.490> doesn't<00:01:43.850> have<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.000> be

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
something like this doesn't have to be

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.500 
something like this doesn't have to be
perfect<00:01:44.630> or<00:01:45.080> take<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.320> long<00:01:45.530> time<00:01:45.830> either

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
perfect or take a long time either

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.940 
perfect or take a long time either
this<00:01:47.510> type<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:47.780> sketching<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:48.470> sometimes

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
this type of sketching is sometimes

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.400 
this type of sketching is sometimes
called<00:01:49.190> ideation<00:01:50.060> sketching<00:01:50.570> there<00:01:51.230> are<00:01:51.350> a

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
called ideation sketching there are a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.290 
called ideation sketching there are a
few<00:01:51.560> basic<00:01:52.070> pointers<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.760> can<00:01:52.880> help<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.150> get

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
few basic pointers that can help you get

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.410 
few basic pointers that can help you get
started<00:01:53.360> making<00:01:54.200> your<00:01:54.350> own<00:01:54.470> sketches<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:56.330> the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
started making your own sketches so the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.120 
started making your own sketches so the
basic<00:01:56.780> motions<00:01:57.140> for<00:01:57.320> sketching<00:01:57.680> actually

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
basic motions for sketching actually

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.280 
basic motions for sketching actually
come<00:01:58.310> from<00:01:58.490> your<00:01:58.640> entire<00:01:58.940> arm<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.870> just<00:02:00.140> your

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
come from your entire arm not just your

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.520 
come from your entire arm not just your
hand<00:02:00.500> alone<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.880> first<00:02:02.150> kind<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.990> warm-up

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
hand alone so the first kind of warm-up

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.050 
hand alone so the first kind of warm-up
exercise<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.340> we're<00:02:04.490> going<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.640> go<00:02:04.790> through

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
exercise that we're going to go through

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.270 
exercise that we're going to go through
the<00:02:05.600> first<00:02:05.780> basic<00:02:06.350> sketching<00:02:06.740> technique<00:02:07.130> is

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
the first basic sketching technique is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.040 
the first basic sketching technique is
the<00:02:07.790> curved<00:02:08.030> line<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.890> do<00:02:10.040> a<00:02:10.070> curved<00:02:10.369> line

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
the curved line so to do a curved line

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.130 
the curved line so to do a curved line
what<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.080> want<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.440> do<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.800> hold<00:02:13.250> your<00:02:14.140> wrist

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
what you want to do is hold your wrist

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.110 
what you want to do is hold your wrist
locked<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.370> kind<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.640> want<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.850> pivot

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
locked and you kind of want to pivot

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.320 
locked and you kind of want to pivot
your<00:02:17.450> whole<00:02:17.780> arm<00:02:18.020> about<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.680> elbow<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:20.120> by

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
your whole arm about the elbow so by

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.530 
your whole arm about the elbow so by
using<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.870> pivoting<00:02:21.470> motion<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:23.120> can<00:02:23.330> kind

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
using this pivoting motion you can kind

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.870 
using this pivoting motion you can kind
of<00:02:23.600> get<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.960> curved<00:02:24.290> shape<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:31.520> after<00:02:31.760> you

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
of get a curved shape so after you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.720 
of get a curved shape so after you
practice<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.750> curved<00:02:33.440> line<00:02:33.860> motion<00:02:34.160> or<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
practice the curved line motion or the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.350 
practice the curved line motion or the
arc

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
arc

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.780 
arc
the<00:02:36.080> next<00:02:36.380> important<00:02:36.830> sketch<00:02:37.100> move<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.580> going

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
the next important sketch move is going

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.030 
the next important sketch move is going
to<00:02:37.880> be<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.120> straight<00:02:38.390> line<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.830> for<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
to be the straight line so for a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.290 
to be the straight line so for a
straight<00:02:40.370> line<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.790> want<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.000> take<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
straight line you want to take the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.360 
straight line you want to take the
motion<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.840> had<00:02:41.870> before<00:02:42.100> kind<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.190> take

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
motion that you had before kind of take

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.370 
motion that you had before kind of take
that<00:02:43.550> arc<00:02:43.790> emotion<00:02:44.240> but<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.840> also<00:02:44.990> want<00:02:45.320> to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
that arc emotion but you also want to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.290 
that arc emotion but you also want to
add<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> little<00:02:45.860> bit<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.070> lateral<00:02:46.400> motion<00:02:47.090> and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
add a little bit of lateral motion and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.910 
add a little bit of lateral motion and
then<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.110> way<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.320> can<00:02:48.530> kind<00:02:48.739> of<00:02:48.770> get

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
then that way you can kind of get

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.640 
then that way you can kind of get
something<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.340> comes<00:02:49.550> out<00:02:49.700> more<00:02:49.970> straight

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
something that comes out more straight

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.380 
something that comes out more straight
so<00:02:51.650> that's<00:02:51.860> how<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.160> get<00:02:52.400> lines<00:02:52.670> like<00:02:53.030> this

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.270 

some<00:02:56.390> things<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.780> pay<00:02:56.900> attention<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.530> if<00:02:57.739> you

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
some things to pay attention to if you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130 
some things to pay attention to if you
notice<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.640> your<00:02:59.030> lines<00:02:59.480> are<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.720> little<00:02:59.900> bit

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
notice that your lines are a little bit

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.470 
notice that your lines are a little bit
too<00:03:00.290> Wiggly<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.670> might<00:03:01.850> be<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.270> a<00:03:02.360> little

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
too Wiggly you might be going a little

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.530 
too Wiggly you might be going a little
bit<00:03:02.720> too<00:03:02.900> slow<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.790> lot<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.030> sketching<00:03:05.390> is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
bit too slow a lot of this sketching is

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.560 
bit too slow a lot of this sketching is
really<00:03:05.780> fast<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.350> loose<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.800> kind<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.160> bold

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
really fast and loose and kind of bold

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.370 
really fast and loose and kind of bold
so<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.630> don't<00:03:08.810> want<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.020> have<00:03:09.110> too<00:03:09.290> many

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
so you don't want to have too many

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.530 
so you don't want to have too many
wiggly<00:03:09.830> lines<00:03:12.400> okay<00:03:13.400> once<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.330> practice

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
wiggly lines okay once you practice

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.080 
wiggly lines okay once you practice
straight<00:03:15.320> lines<00:03:15.560> for<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.860> while<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.940> next

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
straight lines for a while the next

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.310 
straight lines for a while the next
basic<00:03:17.390> shape<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.140> do<00:03:18.290> some<00:03:18.560> circles<00:03:20.320> the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
basic shape is to do some circles the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.770 
basic shape is to do some circles the
way<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.500> do<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> circle<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:23.180> kind<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.480> hold

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
way to do a circle is you kind of hold

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.840 
way to do a circle is you kind of hold
your<00:03:24.080> hand<00:03:24.350> over<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.010> page<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.520> hold<00:03:25.730> your

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
your hand over the page you hold your

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.340 
your hand over the page you hold your
pen<00:03:26.030> over<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.360> page<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.840> without<00:03:27.110> touching

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
pen over the page and without touching

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.000 
pen over the page and without touching
down<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.250> make<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> few<00:03:28.730> practice<00:03:29.239> circles<00:03:30.010> and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
down you make a few practice circles and

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.460 
down you make a few practice circles and
then<00:03:31.670> as<00:03:32.150> soon<00:03:32.360> as<00:03:32.450> you're<00:03:32.600> ready<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:33.200> kind<00:03:33.380> of

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
then as soon as you're ready you kind of

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.229 
then as soon as you're ready you kind of
touch<00:03:33.680> down<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.660> make<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.690> circle<00:03:36.110> shape<00:03:37.239> and

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
touch down and make a circle shape and

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.310 
touch down and make a circle shape and
that's<00:03:38.330> how<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.600> can<00:03:38.720> get<00:03:38.840> something<00:03:39.050> that's

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
that's how you can get something that's

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.360 
that's how you can get something that's
pretty<00:03:39.530> round

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.680 

now<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.640> draw<00:03:44.820> your<00:03:45.000> circles<00:03:45.360> around<00:03:45.450> a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
now you can draw your circles around a

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.460 
now you can draw your circles around a
couple<00:03:45.960> times<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.410> kind<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.650> calibrate<00:03:48.470> and

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
couple times to kind of calibrate and

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.650 
couple times to kind of calibrate and
that's<00:03:50.070> how<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.580> kind<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.090> fine-tune

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
that's how you can kind of fine-tune

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.700 
that's how you can kind of fine-tune
your<00:03:51.810> circles<00:03:57.080> so<00:03:58.080> practice<00:03:58.500> these<00:03:58.650> skills

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
your circles so practice these skills

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.420 
your circles so practice these skills
and<00:03:59.310> use<00:03:59.970> them<00:04:00.150> as<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.330> way<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.540> warm<00:04:00.870> up<00:04:01.430> when

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
and use them as a way to warm up when

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.430 
and use them as a way to warm up when
you're<00:04:02.550> ready<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.910> do<00:04:03.030> some<00:04:03.240> sketching<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.810> if

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
you're ready to do some sketching and if

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.350 
you're ready to do some sketching and if
you<00:04:04.560> practice<00:04:04.950> these<00:04:05.100> basic<00:04:05.520> shapes<00:04:05.550> you'll

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
you practice these basic shapes you'll

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.850 
you practice these basic shapes you'll
be<00:04:06.510> better<00:04:06.690> at<00:04:06.840> putting<00:04:07.140> them<00:04:07.290> together<00:04:07.440> to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
be better at putting them together to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.940 
be better at putting them together to
get<00:04:08.340> more<00:04:08.580> complicated<00:04:09.240> shapes<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.740> build

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950
