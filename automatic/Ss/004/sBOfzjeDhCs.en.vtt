00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.010
 EUR go out 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.190
 at complex force stresses by pulling here at such and such 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.139
 push exercises 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.139
 as partner competitions the whole body claims 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.039
 There is usually less standardized movement 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.140
 they also have a boom and coordinative shares 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.579
 in addition, the similarity with combat situations for the players 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.579
 especially motivate 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 the culprit 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.820
 vintage 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 who were old 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.579
 to keep your balance is during exercises on the top 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.840
 the interaction of all muscles required 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.090
 with additional tasks such as the running of a ball become even higher coordinative 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.660
 Requirements made 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.350
 Methodical principle here is the unstable footprint 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.040
 Instead of the spinning top, soft floors can also be used 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.680
 throwing and catching on the top is even more difficult 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.179
 Virtualization means that everything is always great euphoria 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.269
 Ruud van Nistelrooy re-invented exactly that to balance himself 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.189
 the work needs gold again 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.200
 the one in a similar exercise in one leg was on the Eichhof 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.829
 For example, indicia balls can be used 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.829
 Bad Wildbad continues 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.639
 both armrests or straps on the mat and now spoon says whether behind it 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.929
 and also rude manners get explained 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.150
 Immediately he falls back to the buzzword of 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.519
 Continue the quarter 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.519
 and continue on headphones and that he maybe one 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.499
 further relaxed
