00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.170

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.849
 today I propose a 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.279
 presentation of my collection of 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.800
 steelbook in the gard it's about 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.119
 steelbook assassin's creed then I 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.470
 do in order go more or less 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.789
 chronological this chan that is really going 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.489
 a steelbook per episode 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.070
 assassin's style book creed 1 to 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.180
 know here the April edition ts4 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.980
 exclusive on pc so we have this site books 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.640
 see it's like it's the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.260
 jacket of the game 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.910
 except that it's a good metal case 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.590
 on the other hand it's true that the box is 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.079
 broken I received so I am 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.850
 quite dissatisfied with this purchase but hey 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.920
 just for the collection I keep this 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.819
 type book so there to fill in basically 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.190
 the gmail jacket 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.170
 the code that I saw for the beta of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.999
 brotherhood is a memory and I 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.129
 wish to keep it but if you want 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.489
 see what gives the bottom of the site 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.100
 books 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.420
 so it's nice the disadvantage it's 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.570
 that it is broken true I am quite disappointed 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.470
 but hey it's not too serious 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.970
 then we have two book styles enough 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.630
 connection for assassin's creed 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.030
 brotherhood 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.260
 finally actually you have 2 front here 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.510
 it's silly 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.100
 behind we have to say so do his 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.290
 beautiful ranks I received nine he was 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.820
 drunk easter and kind and he's really 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.710
 beautiful I really take care of 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.520
 do not derail is in you have 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.100
 so three locations 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.960
 so I put assassin's creed 1 here 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.880
 other rÃ©my bonus dvd scheme and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.250
 assassin's creed 1 and see that make it 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.270
 that's basically the image of brotherhood 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.910
 with the different characters 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.250
 multiplayer if you want to see here we 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.260
 assassin's creed 2 assassin's creed 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.780
 brotherhood actually makes it the picture 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.080
 background is a picture re re we see the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.130
 doctor here so that's it you 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.210
 had been done for the first three 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.460
 episodes 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.690
 if you had after all logically 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.210
 steelbook of assassin's creed 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.580
 revelations is so this site you here 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.830
 behind it's like that so there too 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.590
 very pretty box is already sacred 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.300
 two revelations and basically one to 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.060
 constantinople see like this so 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.230
 if you are very nice and gas in place and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.940
 is outpaced down that's what they had 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.280
 basically we have three episodes in one 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.390
 front axle the other but there is another 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.550
 loop style which is very 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.180
 interesting and very very beautiful it's this 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.380
 book assassin's style creed collection 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.030
 when I saw that I mention I was at 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.310
 world behind we have the image again 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.630
 Diome the background said it will sell its 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.670
 embarrass a little what vote bar code but 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.780
 good and the apf and if you have four 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.640
 locations logically for 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.410
 put the one no 2 bronze at the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.260
 revelations - in this case gmi 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.850
 linear music that was in 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.100
 revelation I also put the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.530
 brotherhood and assassin's music 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:58.370
 creed embers and so that's the bottom of the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.650
 stud book his flying connections i'm going 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.600
 put back their place in the top 6 1 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.600
 the simplification of the plan 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.830
 then we move to the bank style 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.360
 pre-orders from the expert store mark en 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.349
 germany so with a plastic case 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.750
 a description of the game behind scrum 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.540
 stick book it's like that I loved 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.030
 a lot of danger box design 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.230
 good to me ok we're happy here then he 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.850
 is not interesting that's why 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.360
 I wanted to fill that was the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.769
 contents of assassin's creed brotherhood 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.920
 cdm I had this picture so in fact if 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.230
 we look at it the picture is completed by 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.010
 behind 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.420
 so that's the German style book 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.580
 that's fine with me and finally we 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.670
 ends with two steelbook 2 assassin's 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.560
 creed 3 drawn by alex cross the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.600
 cartoonist who is relatively famous 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.970
 and therefore teeth will imagine all 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.049
 logic assassin's creed 3 I have nothing 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.610
 to fill besides but well here 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.930
 the bottom you see it's not much 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.950
 it's just a flag fluttering at 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:14.150
 wind editions fluid m and zoda sa 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.070
