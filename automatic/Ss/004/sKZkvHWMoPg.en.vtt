an unboxing review I shot it yesterday
and<00:00:06.750> it's<00:00:07.620> pretty<00:00:08.189> quiet<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:09.210> like<00:00:09.540> insanely

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and it's pretty quiet it's like insanely

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.009

quiet for those paintball guns I was

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.450 
quiet for those paintball guns I was
safer<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:13.590> because<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.980> printed<00:00:14.280> off<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
safer here because I printed off the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.099 
safer here because I printed off the
firing<00:00:14.969> modes<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.389> I'm<00:00:15.509> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.780> go<00:00:15.900> through

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
firing modes and I'm going to go through

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.710 
firing modes and I'm going to go through
them<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.550> change<00:00:20.789> them<00:00:21.090> hold<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> trigger

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
them so to change them hold the trigger

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
them so to change them hold the trigger

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.330 

also<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.730> back<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> red<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.899> alright<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.229 

ok<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.800> long<00:00:50.370> ride<00:00:50.640> press<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> once<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.840> similar

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
ok so long ride press it once or similar

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
ok so long ride press it once or similar
blinks<00:00:54.239> back<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:56.010> go<00:00:56.160> ahead<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
blinks back at you and can go ahead and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.200 
blinks back at you and can go ahead and
chop<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.579> off<00:00:58.039> turn<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.100> back<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.789> don't<00:01:00.120> know

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
chop it off turn it back on I don't know

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.810 
chop it off turn it back on I don't know
why<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:01.020> doesn't<00:01:01.289> always<00:01:03.350> ok<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.559> yes<00:01:04.820> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
why but it doesn't always ok but yes so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.330 
why but it doesn't always ok but yes so
that's<00:01:06.659> how<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.810> change<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.229> most<00:01:07.409> part<00:01:08.040> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that's how you change the most part it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
that's how you change the most part it
out<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:08.760> example<00:01:09.119> how<00:01:10.020> about<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> driving

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
out as an example how about the driving

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070 
out as an example how about the driving
part<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.400> trigger<00:01:11.820> pull<00:01:12.090> would<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.900> for

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
part so one trigger pull would be for

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
part so one trigger pull would be for
semi-automatic<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.850> capped<00:01:16.189> it's<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.670> lower

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
semi-automatic to is capped it's a lower

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.980 
semi-automatic to is capped it's a lower
bps<00:01:19.189> because<00:01:20.189> versus<00:01:20.970> being<00:01:21.150> untapped<00:01:21.570> going

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
bps because versus being untapped going

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
bps because versus being untapped going
as<00:01:22.049> fast<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.530> trigger<00:01:22.740> finger<00:01:23.030> cap<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
as fast as your trigger finger cap so it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.190 
as fast as your trigger finger cap so it
only<00:01:25.080> goes<00:01:25.290> i'm<00:01:25.590> guessing<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.950> 20<00:01:26.250> BPS<00:01:27.200> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
only goes i'm guessing the 20 BPS and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.160 
only goes i'm guessing the 20 BPS and
EXO<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:29.570> three<00:01:30.570> poles<00:01:31.880> I've<00:01:32.880> never<00:01:33.180> used<00:01:33.900> em

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
EXO is three poles I've never used em

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.600 
EXO is three poles I've never used em

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
you're in pilotto then nine poles of the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.890 
you're in pilotto then nine poles of the
trigger<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.569> first<00:02:30.890> ten<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.099> fully<00:02:32.400> automatic

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
trigger is first ten is fully automatic

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.699 
trigger is first ten is fully automatic
11<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:33.959> rebound<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.799> 12<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.940> billy<00:02:36.180> ball<00:02:36.709> so

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
11 is rebound and 12 is billy ball so

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.650 
11 is rebound and 12 is billy ball so
the<00:02:38.069> gun<00:02:38.250> does<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.610> 12<00:02:38.910> different<00:02:39.120> firing
