case of the lower arch

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.810 
case of the lower arch
appears<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.410> be<00:02:48.500> complete<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.220> press<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.460> pink

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820

and<00:02:55.010> now<00:02:55.070> we'll<00:02:55.340> capture<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.300> upper<00:02:56.570> right

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750

first Bunco scan will be a little more
occlusal<00:03:06.070> then<00:03:07.070> I'll<00:03:07.190> roll<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.460> towards<00:03:07.790> the
