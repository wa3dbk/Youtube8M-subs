there's the smaller one right there in
pouring<00:05:22.580> these<00:05:22.760> there<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.240> is<00:05:23.450> very<00:05:23.690> simple

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.719 

you<00:05:27.139> have<00:05:27.200> three<00:05:27.620> different<00:05:27.800> styles<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:28.580> can

you have three different styles you can

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.320 
you have three different styles you can
use<00:05:29.510> a<00:05:29.540> Mickey<00:05:29.870> wave<00:05:30.140> like<00:05:30.470> we're<00:05:30.680> doing<00:05:30.830> here

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
use a Mickey wave like we're doing here

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.200 
use a Mickey wave like we're doing here
you<00:05:32.330> can<00:05:32.510> use<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.720> small<00:05:33.140> lead<00:05:33.470> pot<00:05:33.740> or<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:35.030> can

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
you can use a small lead pot or you can

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.390 
you can use a small lead pot or you can
use<00:05:35.479> our<00:05:35.960> big<00:05:37.000> five-gallon<00:05:38.000> production<00:05:38.960> pots

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
use our big five-gallon production pots

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.940 
use our big five-gallon production pots
which<00:05:40.400> as<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.729> can<00:05:40.760> see<00:05:40.940> this<00:05:41.450> has<00:05:41.690> a<00:05:41.720> pop<00:05:42.650> to

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
which as you can see this has a pop to

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.370 
which as you can see this has a pop to
it<00:05:42.979> that<00:05:43.220> has<00:05:43.400> a<00:05:43.430> big<00:05:43.700> stir<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:45.050> keeps

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
it that has a big stir that keeps

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.230 
it that has a big stir that keeps
everything<00:05:45.710> suspended<00:05:46.520> so<00:05:46.669> we<00:05:46.789> don't<00:05:47.000> have<00:05:47.090> to

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
everything suspended so we don't have to

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.480 
everything suspended so we don't have to
worry<00:05:47.419> about<00:05:47.510> taking<00:05:48.110> a<00:05:48.200> knife<00:05:48.410> and<00:05:49.130> getting

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
worry about taking a knife and getting

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.719 
worry about taking a knife and getting
in<00:05:49.640> here<00:05:50.140> but<00:05:51.140> it<00:05:51.890> goes<00:05:52.100> from<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:52.550> white

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
in here but it goes from the white

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.300 
in here but it goes from the white
liquid<00:05:53.169> in<00:05:54.169> here<00:05:54.430> -<00:05:55.430> 350<00:05:56.300> -<00:05:56.500> 350<00:05:57.500> degrees<00:05:58.039> and

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
liquid in here - 350 - 350 degrees and

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.180 
liquid in here - 350 - 350 degrees and
then<00:05:58.400> it<00:05:59.240> turns<00:05:59.479> to<00:05:59.630> a<00:05:59.750> clear<00:06:00.169> liquid<00:06:00.410> of<00:06:00.950> which

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
then it turns to a clear liquid of which

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
then it turns to a clear liquid of which
we<00:06:01.370> add<00:06:01.580> covering<00:06:02.120> and<00:06:02.919> plate<00:06:03.919> to<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.250> as<00:06:04.460> you

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
we add covering and plate to it as you
