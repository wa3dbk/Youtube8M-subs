00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
fast and super easy this is just the I'm

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.420 
fast and super easy this is just the I'm
using<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.790> bandicam<00:02:00.119> trial<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:00.810> now<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
using the bandicam trial right now I

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.740 
using the bandicam trial right now I
don't<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.700> I'm<00:02:02.790> gonna<00:02:02.909> actually<00:02:03.329> buy<00:02:03.689> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
don't think I'm gonna actually buy it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.660 
don't think I'm gonna actually buy it
because<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.950> already<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.369> give<00:02:05.579> you

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
because you they already they give you

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.999 
because you they already they give you
ten<00:02:05.939> minutes<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.649> recording<00:02:07.649> time

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
ten minutes of recording time

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.979 
ten minutes of recording time
so<00:02:08.879> once<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> tennis<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.869> just

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
so once the tennis is up you can just

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.720 
so once the tennis is up you can just
start<00:02:10.140> recording<00:02:10.289> another<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.520> start

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
start recording another you can start

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.920 
start recording another you can start
recording<00:02:11.910> again

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
recording again

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.729 
recording again
but<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.970> there's<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.569> really<00:02:15.930> any<00:02:16.290> reason<00:02:16.500> to

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
but so there's not really any reason to

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.710 
but so there's not really any reason to
buy<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.950> full<00:02:17.250> thing<00:02:17.489> but<00:02:17.819> if<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.150> want<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
buy the full thing but if you want a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.569 
buy the full thing but if you want a
