00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
our first tip of the day is tree leaves

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.550 
our first tip of the day is tree leaves
now<00:00:28.000> to<00:00:28.449> do<00:00:28.570> this<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:29.020> enter<00:00:29.199> in<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.380> command

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
now to do this you enter in the command

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.109 
now to do this you enter in the command
that's<00:00:29.740> gonna<00:00:29.860> pop<00:00:30.039> up<00:00:30.070> on<00:00:30.369> your<00:00:30.400> screen<00:00:30.520> it's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
a world edit command for a brush that

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
a world edit command for a brush that
has<00:00:33.730> some<00:00:34.629> leaves<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.500> mostly<00:00:36.100> air<00:00:36.309> in<00:00:36.550> it<00:00:36.700> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
has some leaves and mostly air in it and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.299 
has some leaves and mostly air in it and
basically<00:00:38.140> all<00:00:38.290> you<00:00:38.410> do<00:00:38.530> is<00:00:38.650> you<00:00:38.739> click<00:00:38.980> along

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
the upper branches of the tree until you

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:52.920 
the upper branches of the tree until you
are<00:00:42.070> happy<00:00:42.519> with<00:00:42.550> what<00:00:42.699> you<00:00:43.059> got<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.510> next<00:00:52.720> tip

is clocks now to pull these off you
really<00:00:55.690> only<00:00:55.809> need<00:00:55.930> three<00:00:56.710> things<00:00:56.739> you<00:00:57.220> need<00:00:57.370> a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
really only need three things you need a

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.420 
really only need three things you need a
circular<00:00:58.090> face<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.629> short<00:00:59.200> hand<00:00:59.440> along<00:01:00.129> hand

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
circular face a short hand along hand

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.340 
circular face a short hand along hand
and<00:01:00.610> a<00:01:00.969> background<00:01:01.450> that<00:01:01.719> leaves<00:01:01.930> buttons

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
and a background that leaves buttons

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.990 
and a background that leaves buttons
visible<00:01:02.860> at<00:01:03.039> even<00:01:03.370> intervals<00:01:03.489> so<00:01:03.820> that<00:01:03.850> you

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
visible at even intervals so that you

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.490 
visible at even intervals so that you
can<00:01:04.119> tell<00:01:04.270> what<00:01:04.390> time<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.690> is<00:01:04.750> those<00:01:05.470> are

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
can tell what time it is those are

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.779 
can tell what time it is those are
really<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.979> only<00:01:06.009> things<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.460> need<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.670> make

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.860 

up<00:01:17.870> next<00:01:18.410> on<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.620> agenda<00:01:18.710> we<00:01:19.280> have<00:01:19.310> flags<00:01:20.240> now

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
up next on the agenda we have flags now

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.560 
up next on the agenda we have flags now
flags<00:01:21.770> are<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.670> lot<00:01:22.910> easier<00:01:23.210> than<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.450> might

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
flags are a lot easier than you might

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.220 
flags are a lot easier than you might
expect

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
expect

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.620 
expect
but<00:01:24.470> one<00:01:24.980> thing<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.280> really<00:01:26.150> really<00:01:26.330> stands

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
but one thing that really really stands

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.480 
but one thing that really really stands
out<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.900> all<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.620> people<00:01:27.710> who<00:01:27.890> apply<00:01:28.160> for<00:01:28.190> the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
out to all the people who apply for the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.680 
out to all the people who apply for the
built<00:01:28.670> team<00:01:28.880> are<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:30.560> common<00:01:31.190> wind<00:01:31.430> direction

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
built team are a common wind direction

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.610 
built team are a common wind direction
basically<00:01:32.690> making<00:01:32.900> sure<00:01:33.140> that<00:01:33.260> all<00:01:33.440> your

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
basically making sure that all your

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.140 
basically making sure that all your
flags<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.190> your<00:01:34.280> built<00:01:34.490> flow<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.000> same

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
flags and your built flow the same

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.370 
flags and your built flow the same
direction<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:35.750> not<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.110> it's<00:01:36.260> that

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
direction it's not that it's that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.400 
direction it's not that it's that
impressive<00:01:37.040> it's<00:01:37.400> just<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:37.910> it's<00:01:38.350> it's<00:01:39.350> a

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
impressive it's just that it's it's a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.140 
impressive it's just that it's it's a
small<00:01:39.530> detail<00:01:39.800> that<00:01:40.190> we<00:01:40.280> look<00:01:40.640> upon<00:01:40.760> very

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
small detail that we look upon very

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.870 
small detail that we look upon very
highly<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:42.800> also<00:01:43.010> want<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.310> decide<00:01:43.610> how

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
highly you also want to decide how

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.640 
highly you also want to decide how
strong<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.360> wind<00:01:44.540> is<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.900> more<00:01:45.110> when<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
strong the wind is the more when the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.080 
strong the wind is the more when the
straighter<00:01:45.980> out<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.280> flag<00:01:46.490> will<00:01:46.670> be<00:01:46.700> while

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
straighter out the flag will be while

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.030 
straighter out the flag will be while
less<00:01:47.480> means<00:01:47.960> it's<00:01:48.320> hanging<00:01:48.590> down<00:01:48.680> below

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
less means it's hanging down below

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.310 
less means it's hanging down below
finally<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.360> want<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.600> get<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.720> flow<00:01:50.990> into<00:01:51.229> your

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
finally you want to get a flow into your

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.110 
finally you want to get a flow into your
flag<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.800> can<00:01:51.950> do<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:52.220> by<00:01:52.400> making<00:01:52.760> them<00:01:52.940> go

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
flag you can do this by making them go

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:04.890 
flag you can do this by making them go
back<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.390> forth<00:01:53.750> as<00:01:53.990> shown

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.630 

all<00:02:05.890> right<00:02:06.010> this<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.220> probably<00:02:06.310> something

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
all right this is probably something

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.389 
all right this is probably something
you've<00:02:06.850> all<00:02:07.060> been<00:02:07.360> kind<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.170> wanting<00:02:09.100> for<00:02:09.369> a

you've all been kind of wanting for a

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.310 
you've all been kind of wanting for a
while<00:02:09.670> since<00:02:09.970> we'd<00:02:10.210> add<00:02:10.570> a<00:02:10.630> lot<00:02:10.930> of<00:02:11.020> bindings

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
while since we'd add a lot of bindings

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.060 
while since we'd add a lot of bindings
on<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.500> our<00:02:11.590> stuff

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
on to our stuff

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.830 
on to our stuff
vines<00:02:12.700> make<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.030> build<00:02:13.240> look<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.480> little<00:02:13.690> more

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
vines make you build look a little more

with curving vines you should try to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.770 
with curving vines you should try to
never<00:02:17.920> have<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.190> 90-degree<00:02:18.850> corner<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.510> side

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
basically can just make an angled line

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.800 
basically can just make an angled line
going<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.459> any<00:02:39.610> direction<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.390> just<00:02:40.630> have

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
and now for our last tip of the day we

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.580 
and now for our last tip of the day we
come<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.800> light<00:03:00.310> tricks<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:02.380> is

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
come to light tricks and this is

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.380 
come to light tricks and this is
actually<00:03:03.130> really<00:03:03.430> really<00:03:03.700> easy<00:03:03.910> basically

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
actually really really easy basically

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.030 
actually really really easy basically
you<00:03:04.600> throw<00:03:04.630> down<00:03:04.960> a<00:03:04.990> block<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.380> glowstone<00:03:05.770> and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you throw down a block of glowstone and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.860 
you throw down a block of glowstone and
use<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:07.680> block<00:03:08.680> like<00:03:08.890> leaves<00:03:09.280> or<00:03:09.820> pistons<00:03:10.480> or

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
use a block like leaves or pistons or

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.420 
use a block like leaves or pistons or
paintings<00:03:11.530> or<00:03:11.680> something<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.040> cover<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.370> up

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
paintings or something to cover it up

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.730 
paintings or something to cover it up
and<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:13.030> light<00:03:13.240> will<00:03:13.420> actually<00:03:14.080> come<00:03:14.350> through

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
and the light will actually come through

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.620 
and the light will actually come through
that<00:03:14.950> object<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.700> it'll<00:03:16.030> still<00:03:16.300> light<00:03:16.450> up<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
that object so it'll still light up the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.450 
that object so it'll still light up the
area<00:03:16.930> around<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.830> can<00:03:17.980> actually<00:03:18.130> do<00:03:18.340> the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
area around it you can actually do the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.430 
area around it you can actually do the
same<00:03:18.610> thing<00:03:18.790> with<00:03:18.970> carpet<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:19.990> can<00:03:20.020> throw<00:03:20.380> a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
same thing with carpet you can throw a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.410 
same thing with carpet you can throw a
glow<00:03:20.680> stone<00:03:20.950> down<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.400> ground<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.910> carpet

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
glow stone down on the ground and carpet

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.120 
glow stone down on the ground and carpet
over<00:03:22.600> top<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.560> light<00:03:23.740> will<00:03:23.920> still

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
over top of it and the light will still

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.420 
over top of it and the light will still
protrude<00:03:24.550> through<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:25.090> carpet
