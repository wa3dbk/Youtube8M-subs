00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
to figure it out and found out that the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.760 
to figure it out and found out that the
permission<00:02:45.840> plugging<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.280> biggest

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
permission plugging was the biggest

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.750 
permission plugging was the biggest
problem<00:02:49.770> in<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.950> first<00:02:50.250> place

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
problem in the first place
