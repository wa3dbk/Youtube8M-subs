00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and then you keep see their traffic

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.520 
and then you keep see their traffic
keeps<00:02:03.390> declining<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.990> declining<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
keeps declining and declining and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.800 
keeps declining and declining and
climbing<00:02:04.979> over<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.390> very<00:02:06.390> interesting<00:02:06.719> to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
climbing over there very interesting to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.809 
climbing over there very interesting to
see<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.930> even<00:02:07.590> week<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.280> week<00:02:08.429> last<00:02:08.729> week

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
see that even week to week last week

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339 
see that even week to week last week
they<00:02:09.000> had<00:02:09.119> another<00:02:09.330> five<00:02:09.539> percent<00:02:09.660> drop<00:02:09.959> so

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
they had another five percent drop so

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.380 
they had another five percent drop so
it's<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:10.890> getting<00:02:11.129> any<00:02:11.250> better

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
it's not getting any better

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.420 
it's not getting any better

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
so we'll see what happens with that so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.010 
so we'll see what happens with that so
it's<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.670> shows<00:02:15.910> like<00:02:16.120> even<00:02:16.390> big<00:02:16.570> companies

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
it's just shows like even big companies

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.180 
it's just shows like even big companies
could<00:02:17.140> actually<00:02:17.290> get<00:02:17.500> slapped<00:02:17.770> pretty<00:02:17.980> hard

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
could actually get slapped pretty hard

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.460 
could actually get slapped pretty hard
by<00:02:18.310> Google<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:19.630> then<00:02:19.750> we<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:20.110> people<00:02:20.230> saying

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
by Google but then we have people saying

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.030 
by Google but then we have people saying
it<00:02:20.650> has<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:20.920> with<00:02:21.040> ebays<00:02:22.920> stance<00:02:23.920> on

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
it has to do with ebays stance on

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.000 
it has to do with ebays stance on

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
manual actions are updated twice daily

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.950 
manual actions are updated twice daily
within<00:02:30.610> Google<00:02:30.880> Webmaster<00:02:31.330> Tools<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:31.750> only

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
within Google Webmaster Tools but only

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.680 
within Google Webmaster Tools but only
email<00:02:32.260> down<00:02:32.440> once<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.950> day<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:34.180> very<00:02:34.420> rare

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
email down once a day so it's very rare

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.720 
email down once a day so it's very rare
but<00:02:34.720> basically<00:02:35.260> John<00:02:35.500> Mueller<00:02:35.830> said<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.550> is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
but basically John Mueller said that is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.610 
but basically John Mueller said that is
possible<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.480> you'll<00:02:37.870> get<00:02:37.990> an<00:02:38.080> email<00:02:38.140> and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
possible that you'll get an email and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.560 
possible that you'll get an email and
then<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.830> updated<00:02:39.130> after<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.460> email

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
then it's updated after the email

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.670 
then it's updated after the email
because<00:02:40.570> Google<00:02:40.990> Webmaster<00:02:41.350> Tools<00:02:41.560> is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
because Google Webmaster Tools is

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.840 
because Google Webmaster Tools is
updated<00:02:41.950> twice<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.160> day<00:02:42.400> whereas<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> email

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
updated twice a day whereas the email

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.850 
updated twice a day whereas the email
sent<00:02:43.060> down<00:02:43.150> once<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.450> day<00:02:43.600> that's<00:02:44.500> good<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.770> know

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
sent down once a day that's good to know

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.250 
sent down once a day that's good to know
so<00:02:45.340> just<00:02:45.880> as<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.120> little<00:02:46.270> tidbit<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.990> terms<00:02:47.140> of

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
so just as a little tidbit in terms of

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.920 
of the map the new zip code actually
relates<00:04:53.450> to<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:53.930> that's<00:04:53.990> pretty<00:04:54.200> neat<00:04:54.380> feature

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930

this<00:05:53.840> year<00:05:53.900> and<00:05:54.290> because<00:05:54.980> that<00:05:55.010> it<00:05:55.400> seems<00:05:55.610> like

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
this year and because that it seems like

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.100 
this year and because that it seems like
increase<00:05:56.390> a<00:05:56.420> lot<00:05:56.600> of<00:05:56.690> click-through<00:05:56.960> rates

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
increase a lot of click-through rates

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.020

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.520 
because people are those ads are more
blended<00:05:59.480> in<00:05:59.600> so<00:05:59.630> this<00:05:59.870> is<00:05:59.930> the<00:05:59.990> old<00:06:00.110> format

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
blended in so this is the old format

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.350 
blended in so this is the old format
whereas<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.460> new<00:06:01.550> format<00:06:01.880> just<00:06:02.120> has<00:06:02.210> a<00:06:02.240> look

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
whereas the new format just has a look

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.970 
whereas the new format just has a look
at<00:06:02.420> as<00:06:02.600> level<00:06:02.780> but<00:06:03.020> it's<00:06:03.140> white<00:06:03.380> background<00:06:03.890> so

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
at as level but it's white background so

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.780 
at as level but it's white background so
people<00:06:04.130> are<00:06:04.190> clicking<00:06:04.340> on<00:06:04.550> it<00:06:04.640> more
