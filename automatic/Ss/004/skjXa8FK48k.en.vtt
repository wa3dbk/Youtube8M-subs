do<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.390> think<00:02:40.600> we<00:02:40.720> will<00:02:40.810> finally<00:02:41.320> see<00:02:41.530> some

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
do you think we will finally see some

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.030 
do you think we will finally see some
with<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.100> ps4<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:42.940> think<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.740> kind

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
with the ps4 I think that this is kind

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.860 
with the ps4 I think that this is kind
of<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.030> an<00:02:46.240> interesting<00:02:46.510> question

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
of a this is an interesting question

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.870 
of a this is an interesting question
because<00:02:47.260> we<00:02:47.590> don't<00:02:47.740> really<00:02:47.950> see<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.610> lot<00:02:48.640> of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
because we don't really see a lot of

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.080 
because we don't really see a lot of
custom<00:02:49.450> controllers<00:02:49.930> for<00:02:50.680> ps4<00:02:51.160> or<00:02:51.460> ps3<00:02:51.820> I

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
custom controllers for ps4 or ps3 I

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.480 
custom controllers for ps4 or ps3 I
should<00:02:52.390> say<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.680> do<00:02:53.830> see<00:02:54.070> all<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.220> these

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
should say and we do see all of these

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.400 
should say and we do see all of these
really<00:02:54.730> cool<00:02:54.850> like<00:02:55.210> titanfall<00:02:55.630> controllers

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
really cool like titanfall controllers

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.370 
really cool like titanfall controllers
and<00:02:56.620> things<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.130> for<00:02:57.430> Xbox<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.360> have<00:02:59.350> a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
and things like that for Xbox I have a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.920 
and things like that for Xbox I have a
feeling<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.340> if<00:03:00.790> Sony<00:03:01.390> were<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.750> do

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
feeling that if Sony were to do

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.630 
feeling that if Sony were to do
something<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.920> would<00:03:03.040> be<00:03:03.070> with<00:03:03.430> an

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
something like this it would be with an

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.360 
something like this it would be with an
exclusive<00:03:04.180> IP<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.260> something<00:03:05.710> they<00:03:06.100> are<00:03:06.220> not

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
exclusive IP so something they are not

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.510 
exclusive IP so something they are not
gonna<00:03:06.550> see<00:03:06.820> on<00:03:07.060> any<00:03:07.330> other<00:03:07.660> console<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:09.310> if

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
gonna see on any other console so if

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.040 
gonna see on any other console so if
there's<00:03:09.730> anything<00:03:10.000> out<00:03:10.240> there<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.780> you're

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
there's anything out there that you're

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.860

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
a little bit of a struggle kind of
