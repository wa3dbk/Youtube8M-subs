it's<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.530> third<00:00:49.739> time<00:00:49.950> ever<00:00:50.219> doing

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it's one of my third time ever doing

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.060 
it's one of my third time ever doing
this<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.510> had<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.289> results<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.800> I'd<00:00:52.920> say

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
this and I had good results so I'd say

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.650 
this and I had good results so I'd say
it's<00:00:53.190> pretty<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.489> foolproof<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.539> get

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
it's pretty much foolproof if I can get

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
it's pretty much foolproof if I can get
through<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> without<00:00:55.110> any<00:00:55.469> issue<00:00:58.129> I'm<00:00:59.129> getting
