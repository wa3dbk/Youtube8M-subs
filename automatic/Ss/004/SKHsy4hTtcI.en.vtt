00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
was like super super duper long time

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.680 
was like super super duper long time
they<00:02:38.460> got<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.640> go<00:02:38.790> full<00:02:39.060> length<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.480> field

they got to go full length of the field
figure<00:02:40.470> you're<00:02:40.620> gonna<00:02:40.710> probably<00:02:40.950> give<00:02:41.220> up

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
figure you're gonna probably give up

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.190 
figure you're gonna probably give up
three<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.880> if<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.360> only<00:02:42.480> got<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> go<00:02:42.810> half<00:02:43.020> the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
three and if you only got to go half the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.390 
three and if you only got to go half the
length<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.620> field<00:02:43.830> you're<00:02:44.010> figuring

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
length of the field you're figuring

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.520 
length of the field you're figuring
three<00:02:44.640> at<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.910> minimum<00:02:45.180> potential<00:02:45.930> touchdown

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
three at the minimum potential touchdown

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.250 
three at the minimum potential touchdown
so<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:47.430> keep<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.850> mind<00:02:48.210> but<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.170> can

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so just keep that in mind but as you can

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.140
