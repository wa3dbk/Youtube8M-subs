00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.539
 secretly hidden new cars 

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.820
 parking for overproduction 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.439
 Brand new car on secret parking 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.010
 hidden around the sales figures too 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.139
 beautiful 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.090
 on the internet, cards and pictures circulate 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.890
 of huge areas on which factory 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.170
 fresh cars are secretly parked 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.550
 because they are not for sale, the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.190
 industry picture with it clearly 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.160
 declining demand hid in 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.410
 The global auto industry is making its way 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.359
 a huge scandal of millions 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.969
 brand new unsold and with it 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.760
 superfluous cars are everywhere 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.039
 the world on runways or huge 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.629
 parked parking spaces and stand there 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.519
 they then and gradually rot because 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.979
 they are not wisely maintained 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.589
 outside probably millions of cars 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.850
 parked on farthest huge 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.109
 surface where she apparently on her 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.479
 waiting for scrapping 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.129
 hiding new cars in big 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.809
 style is evidently especially of the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.729
 American automobile manufacturers 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.920
 used and is under the name 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.260
 Channel staffing known sales figures 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.560
 beautiful by giving the traders more 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.420
 delivers as they can sell 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.250
 the parking spaces extend around 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.229
 but also the globe in europe too 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.899
 Example in France and Spain 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.970
 there are these disposal cities standing there 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.950
 in some places thousands of new ones 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.079
 your fate is uncertain 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.270
 questionable is what with the cars now 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.939
 it happens to be suspected that the car 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.229
 industry, however, the true extent of this 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.289
 scandals wants to cover up 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.060
 possibly the wg will eventually 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.009
 scrapped because roadworthy likely 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.549
 many of them are gone 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.320
 his 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.420
 a car for several months somewhere 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.549
 is standing and not moving is already 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.619
 soon the battery is not roadworthy anymore 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.360
 should be hers after just one month 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.250
 Give up the ghost and the moving parts 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.330
 they rot so you just have them 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.789
 can tow 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.770
 it should be exciting what the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.869
 auto industry may say so 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.549
 it is one of the biggest 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.470
 scandals in the automotive industry around the 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.270
 Sales and production figures artificially 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.069
 Cars that are not 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.950
 be used anyway and produced 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.500
 land on these secret parking lots 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.569
 on the internet, coordinates and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.489
 Pictures of huge surfaces on those 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.650
 Factory fresh cars parked secretly 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.650
 because they are not for sale 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.630
 other industries need it similarly 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.510
 We still have so many people in production 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.910
 or do people work too much or too much 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:42.690
 are eight billion too much 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.490
 or what's up what's up what's up and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.110
 what is most of all just so much 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.330
 produced as well as actually 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.160
 Everything is needed in the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.680
 they have produced abundance 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.200
 seen where it goes that does not matter 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.400
 Sense makes no sense does not make sense 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.400
 makes no sense
