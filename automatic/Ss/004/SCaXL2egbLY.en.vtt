waiting<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.410> procedure<00:00:26.900> okay<00:00:27.900> then

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
think it's much more interesting not

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.590 
think it's much more interesting not
have<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.469> people<00:00:40.469> cut<00:00:40.710> okay<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.910> pretty<00:00:42.270> good

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
have that people cut okay is pretty good

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.130 
have that people cut okay is pretty good
and<00:00:45.200> we<00:00:46.200> still<00:00:46.590> use<00:00:46.950> glue<00:00:47.520> sticks<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.450> see

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and we still use glue sticks now we see

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.880 
and we still use glue sticks now we see
how<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.590> use<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.370> glue<00:00:50.670> stick<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:52.020> paper<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
how we use the glue stick this paper is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.000 
how we use the glue stick this paper is
seen<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.680> careful

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
seen so you have to be really careful

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.049 
seen so you have to be really careful
and<00:00:57.770> there<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> chance<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.600> paper<00:01:00.899> get

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
and there is a chance that the paper get

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.320 
and there is a chance that the paper get
cheered<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:05.060> strong<00:01:06.060> enough

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
cheered because it's not strong enough

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.770 
cheered because it's not strong enough
of<00:01:07.020> course<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> would<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.390> be

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of course you can do it would just be

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.520 
of course you can do it would just be
very<00:01:09.990> careful<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:14.240> how<00:01:15.240> about<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.930> time<00:01:16.229> we

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
very careful and how about this time we

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
very careful and how about this time we
glue<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.950> onto<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:18.240> paper

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:49.130 

ok<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.899> flat<00:01:46.440> is<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.659> paper

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
ok so is flat is good but the paper

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.039 
ok so is flat is good but the paper
because<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.190> scene<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.180> transparent

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
because it's so scene and so transparent

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
because it's so scene and so transparent
so<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.220> through<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.610> background

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so you can see through the background

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.950 
so you can see through the background
paper<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.909> piece<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.330> much

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
paper and if you have a piece of much

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.550 
paper and if you have a piece of much
secret<00:01:58.590> paper<00:01:59.240> example<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:01.289> one

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
secret paper example this one this one

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.960 
secret paper example this one this one
is<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.830> triple<00:02:02.640> Cygnus<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.479> much<00:02:04.350> less

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
is a triple Cygnus is much less

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.719
