00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.600 

well<00:00:01.589> I<00:00:01.620> think<00:00:01.740> when<00:00:02.040> it<00:00:02.159> when<00:00:02.370> it<00:00:02.460> first

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
well I think when it when it first

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.130 
well I think when it when it first
started<00:00:02.879> happening<00:00:02.939> it<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.480> we<00:00:03.929> don't<00:00:04.049> really

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
started happening it is we don't really

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.329 
started happening it is we don't really
think<00:00:04.259> it<00:00:04.410> would<00:00:04.470> affect<00:00:04.560> us<00:00:04.920> but<00:00:05.100> then<00:00:05.220> it

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
think it would affect us but then it

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.889 
think it would affect us but then it
slowly<00:00:05.549> kept<00:00:05.819> rising<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.420> when<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.750> got<00:00:06.839> to

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
slowly kept rising and when it got to

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.320 
slowly kept rising and when it got to
