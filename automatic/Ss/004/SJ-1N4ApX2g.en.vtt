00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
with experimenting so hemp seeds look

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.010 
with experimenting so hemp seeds look
like<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.100> they<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.090> protein<00:01:39.600> omega

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
like that and they have protein omega

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.039 
like that and they have protein omega
fatty<00:01:40.439> acids<00:01:40.950> iron<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.689> use<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:42.960> in

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
probably more than that so that's what

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.899 
probably more than that so that's what
they<00:01:49.439> look<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.549> I'll<00:01:50.700> take<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
they look like and I'll take a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.149 
they look like and I'll take a
tablespoon<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.040> them

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
tablespoon out so that you can see them

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.300 
tablespoon out so that you can see them
up<00:01:53.310> close<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:54.680> don't<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.070> how<00:01:56.280> to
