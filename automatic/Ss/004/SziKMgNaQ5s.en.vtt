00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.140
 hello passion friends mobile and power 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.740
 fight today in our segment of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.360
 applications we have pdf max which is a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.280
 pdf reader but with a 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.669
 interesting feature and that is that we 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.950
 It also allows annotations 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.530
 underline and more things like drawings we 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.180
 allows to have multiple open pdf 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 eyelashes as you see here I have open 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 two one that says pdf sample and another one that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.730
 says pdf test in this way I can have 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 open more pdf files in it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.150
 reader in the same application for 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.400
 change between them in a more 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.070
 fast and not having to be using 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.320
 several applications or having to close 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 one file and open another to be able 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.730
 visualize them so as you see is a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 very simple way that is done and in this 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.810
 case are single-page files like this 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.580
 that are not very complex and let's see 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.070
 what can we do about the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.260
 basic actions for example here as 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.630
 you see we have on the right side we have 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.090
 a toolbar about which 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 we can press for example this one 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.909
 underlined but first it tells us if 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.550
 we want to make a backup 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.840
 in case the modifications we make do not 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.409
 we like them at this time we are going to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.020
 put him 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.409
 we want backup and so on 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.090
 easy we can underline in a very 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.770
 simple and here we can change the color 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.869
 as you see also has a very selector 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.659
 elegant and we can also change the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.420
 transparency that has this underline 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.640
 we also select the size let's say 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.560
 or the opacity with which we want 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.020
 is underlined and from here we have to 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.490
 undo or redo and once we have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.530
 finished we put the popcorn 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.530
 this is the normal underline but also 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.420
 we have an underline as online 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.439
 only which also works 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.659
 fairly good 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.879
 we have also crossed out in a very 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.679
 simple and also the underline that is 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.929
 it looks more or less like a proofreader 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.329
 spelling, so you see, you have very 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.280
 interesting these functions and now 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.829
 we can also draw a line from a 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.410
 very simple way or also a figure 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.290
 like a square or a circle so 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.440
 they are tools that facilitate 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.720
 we can also write here text as 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.790
 hello, obviously we can change 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.310
 the color for example we put it in a 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.170
 black and ready so as you see from a 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.250
 very simple way we can manipulate 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.610
 our archives 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.770
 to underline the markings and also 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.840
 to have multiple open files 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.870
 to exchange us among them for a 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.060
 way easier and simpler so 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.800
 it's a very good reader do not forget to give it 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.430
