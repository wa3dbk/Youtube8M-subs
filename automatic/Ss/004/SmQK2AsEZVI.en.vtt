mission<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.040> saw<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:54.570> saw<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.290> there

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
mission and I saw I saw it right there

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.399 
mission and I saw I saw it right there
and<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> hell<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.780> yeah

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and I'm like what the hell but yeah

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.690 
and I'm like what the hell but yeah
we're<00:01:58.560> gonna<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:59.100> into<00:01:59.250> number<00:01:59.520> five

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
we're gonna be going into number five

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.370 
we're gonna be going into number five
and<00:02:00.000> at<00:02:00.119> number<00:02:00.210> five<00:02:00.540> there's<00:02:00.840> absolutely

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and at number five there's absolutely

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.280 
and at number five there's absolutely
nothing<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.869> pass

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
nothing it's just a it's just a pass

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
nothing it's just a it's just a pass
passed<00:02:05.009> by<00:02:05.250> area<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.899> will<00:02:07.789> as<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.179> can

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
passed by area if you will as you can

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.609 
passed by area if you will as you can
see<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:09.690> gonna<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.959> showing<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> here<00:02:10.560> that

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
see I'm gonna be showing you here that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.010 
see I'm gonna be showing you here that
there's<00:02:10.920> absolutely<00:02:11.310> nothing

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
there's absolutely nothing

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.760 
there's absolutely nothing
thing<00:02:12.170> around<00:02:13.240> boohoo<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.200> number<00:02:15.440> three

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
thing around boohoo but and number three

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.490 
thing around boohoo but and number three
there<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.180> at<00:02:17.180> least<00:02:17.450> three<00:02:17.690> mining<00:02:17.990> spots<00:02:18.290> but

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
there is at least three mining spots but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.470 
there is at least three mining spots but
this<00:02:18.710> time<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.890> got<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.430> one<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.850> them<00:02:19.940> we<00:02:20.120> just

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
this time I got to one of them we just

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.860 
this time I got to one of them we just
passed<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:22.300> said<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.420> right<00:02:23.540> at<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.660> bat

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
passed I said that right at the bat

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.510 
passed I said that right at the bat
because<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.350> right<00:02:24.800> next<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.190> entrance

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
because it's right next to the entrance

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.490 
because it's right next to the entrance
and<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.240> second<00:02:26.630> spot<00:02:26.960> here<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:28.850> one<00:02:29.120> and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
and the second spot here is that one and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.320 
and the second spot here is that one and
ideally<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.680> third<00:02:31.070> one<00:02:31.280> spawns<00:02:31.580> right<00:02:31.910> next<00:02:32.240> to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
ideally a third one spawns right next to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.270 
ideally a third one spawns right next to
the<00:02:32.420> one<00:02:32.510> I'm<00:02:32.660> at<00:02:32.840> but<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.980> didn't<00:02:34.190> happen

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
the one I'm at but that didn't happen

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.660 
the one I'm at but that didn't happen
because<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.820> RNG<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.720> know<00:02:36.070> was<00:02:37.070> stupid<00:02:37.430> and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
because the RNG you know was stupid and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.330 
because the RNG you know was stupid and
right<00:02:38.210> there<00:02:38.480> that's<00:02:38.780> another<00:02:39.440> unlikely<00:02:40.160> one

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
right there that's another unlikely one

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.360 
right there that's another unlikely one
that<00:02:40.550> I've<00:02:40.850> seen<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.890> just<00:02:43.070> take<00:02:43.190> all

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
that I've seen but if you just take all

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.010 
that I've seen but if you just take all
around<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.700> map<00:02:43.910> you'll<00:02:44.480> probably<00:02:44.690> find

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
around the map you'll probably find

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.480 
around the map you'll probably find
these<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.440> they're<00:02:45.620> very<00:02:45.770> easy<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.250> spot

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
these and they're very easy to spot

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.920 
these and they're very easy to spot
because<00:02:46.850> they<00:02:47.000> have<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> little<00:02:47.420> bit<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.660> glow

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
because they have a little bit of a glow

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.310 
because they have a little bit of a glow
to<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.350> when<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.520> when<00:02:50.210> you<00:02:50.360> look<00:02:50.540> around<00:02:50.720> or

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
to it when you when you look around or

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.580 
to it when you when you look around or
it's<00:02:51.920> just<00:02:52.040> like<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:54.080> I'm<00:02:54.380> gonna<00:02:54.500> be

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
it's just like that and I'm gonna be

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.710 
it's just like that and I'm gonna be
showing<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:55.010> another<00:02:55.190> unlikely<00:02:56.000> spot<00:02:56.420> but

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
showing you another unlikely spot but

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.900 
showing you another unlikely spot but
maybe<00:02:56.990> you<00:02:57.170> might<00:02:57.200> find<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.680> if<00:02:57.860> maybe<00:02:58.760> you're

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
maybe you might find it if maybe you're

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.870 
maybe you might find it if maybe you're
curious<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.840> there<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:00.920> turned<00:03:01.820> my

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
curious right there I just turned my

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.300 
curious right there I just turned my
camera<00:03:02.030> there<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:03.350> yeah<00:03:03.680> right<00:03:03.860> around<00:03:04.130> that

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
camera there but yeah right around that

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.210 
camera there but yeah right around that
bottom<00:03:04.490> arrow<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.970> may<00:03:05.090> be<00:03:05.150> finding<00:03:05.630> one<00:03:05.870> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
bottom arrow you may be finding one and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.030 
bottom arrow you may be finding one and
now<00:03:07.360> over<00:03:08.360> there<00:03:08.540> right<00:03:09.110> in<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.410> back<00:03:09.590> I'm

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
now over there right in the back I'm

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.450 
now over there right in the back I'm
showing<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.810> that's<00:03:11.810> where<00:03:12.110> one<00:03:12.380> can<00:03:13.100> spawn

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
showing you that's where one can spawn

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.600 
showing you that's where one can spawn
but<00:03:14.330> likely<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:15.230> two<00:03:15.440> three<00:03:15.740> maybe<00:03:15.920> spawn<00:03:16.340> in

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
but likely to two three maybe spawn in

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.210 
but likely to two three maybe spawn in
this<00:03:16.820> area<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.510> that's<00:03:18.230> pretty<00:03:18.530> much<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.980> you

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
this area and that's pretty much it you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.360 
this area and that's pretty much it you
guys<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:20.660> six<00:03:21.050> seven<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.650> three<00:03:21.980> are<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> only

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
guys to six seven and three are the only

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.880 
guys to six seven and three are the only
mining<00:03:22.790> spots<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.360> this<00:03:23.600> area<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.230> if<00:03:24.740> you

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
mining spots in this area and if you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.680 
mining spots in this area and if you
find<00:03:25.130> out<00:03:25.310> more<00:03:25.720> right<00:03:26.720> now<00:03:26.750> cuz<00:03:27.110> I'm<00:03:27.530> not<00:03:28.690> I'm

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
find out more right now cuz I'm not I'm

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.970 
find out more right now cuz I'm not I'm
not<00:03:29.840> sure<00:03:30.050> if<00:03:30.140> there's<00:03:30.290> more<00:03:30.380> remaining<00:03:30.740> spots

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
not sure if there's more remaining spots

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.830 
not sure if there's more remaining spots
but<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.430> checked<00:03:31.700> thoroughly<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.480> there's

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
but I checked thoroughly and there's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.650 
but I checked thoroughly and there's
none<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.350> I've<00:03:34.100> seen<00:03:34.340> these<00:03:34.490> other<00:03:34.670> ones<00:03:34.970> so

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
none that I've seen these other ones so

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.420 
none that I've seen these other ones so
yeah<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.110> go<00:03:36.380> around<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.010> pattern

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
yeah just go around and in the pattern

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.310 
yeah just go around and in the pattern
I'm<00:03:37.670> going<00:03:37.700> around<00:03:38.180> in<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.600> could<00:03:38.750> grind<00:03:39.020> it

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
I'm going around in you could grind it

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.250 
I'm going around in you could grind it
and<00:03:40.030> yeah<00:03:41.030> but<00:03:41.270> that's<00:03:41.540> pretty<00:03:41.780> much<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.200> but

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
and yeah but that's pretty much it but

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.860 
and yeah but that's pretty much it but
on<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.250> side<00:03:43.459> no<00:03:43.760> I'm<00:03:44.030> really<00:03:44.420> enjoying<00:03:44.540> this

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
on the side no I'm really enjoying this

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.930
