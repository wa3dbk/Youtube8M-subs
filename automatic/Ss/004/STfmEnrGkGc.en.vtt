00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
you know the their leaf growth and rut

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.450 
you know the their leaf growth and rut
growth<00:00:25.080> most<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:25.890> fairly<00:00:26.039> similar

oilseed radish you eat a daikon radish

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.889 
oilseed radish you eat a daikon radish
this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.960> same<00:00:43.200> thing<00:00:44.450> in<00:00:45.450> fact<00:00:45.690> this

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
this is the same thing in fact this

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.990 
this is the same thing in fact this
radish<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.010> source<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.430> buy<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.670> from

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
radish here the source we buy it from

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.779 
radish here the source we buy it from
they<00:00:48.210> label<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:49.010> other<00:00:50.010> seed<00:00:50.309> companies

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
they label it for other seed companies

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.500 
they label it for other seed companies
and<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.629> call<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> cover<00:00:52.739> crop<00:00:53.010> radish<00:00:53.510> you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and they call it cover crop radish you

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
and they call it cover crop radish you
know<00:00:54.920> stubble<00:00:55.920> radish<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.520> things<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
know stubble radish and things like that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.170 
know stubble radish and things like that
I<00:00:57.539> guess<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.410> sell<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.219> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
I guess we sell it for what it is and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.689 
I guess we sell it for what it is and
that's<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:02.370> know<00:01:02.460> these<00:01:02.640> are

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that's what it is you know these are

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.990 
that's what it is you know these are
some<00:01:02.940> pretty<00:01:03.090> good<00:01:03.359> typical<00:01:04.019> examples<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
some pretty good typical examples of it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
some pretty good typical examples of it
and<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> long<00:01:06.570> rip<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.830> was

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and see that long rip this one was

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.850 
and see that long rip this one was
probably<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> second<00:01:09.210> planting<00:01:09.860> but

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
probably from the second planting but

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
probably from the second planting but
that<00:01:11.070> rut<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.549> about<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.420> deep<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that rut was about that deep in the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.440 
that rut was about that deep in the
ground<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.740> radishes<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.580> come<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.820> quite

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
ground the radishes don't come on quite
as<00:01:15.600> quick<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.500> wind<00:01:16.530> fir'd<00:01:16.860> hybrid<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.430> the

can<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:30.780> varietal

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
can have a little to do with varietal

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.749 
can have a little to do with varietal
difference<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.220> more<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.729> with

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
difference but it has more to do with

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
difference but it has more to do with
planting<00:01:33.329> depth<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.619> most<00:01:34.860> situations

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130

like<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.689> planted<00:01:37.079> fairly

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
like this they get planted fairly

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.020 
like this they get planted fairly
shallow<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.130> you're<00:01:38.400> mixing<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:38.880> the

above<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.130> ground<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.940> here's<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.630> little<00:02:25.110> bit

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
above the ground and here's a little bit

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.290 
above the ground and here's a little bit
of<00:02:25.320> an<00:02:25.410> example<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:27.090> he

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
of an example of that this one here he

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.770 
of an example of that this one here he
went<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:29.340> hit<00:02:29.580> some<00:02:29.730> trouble<00:02:30.060> here<00:02:30.239> and

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
went down and hit some trouble here and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.449 
went down and hit some trouble here and
took<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> little<00:02:31.350> bit<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.709> jog<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
took a little bit of a jog and as you

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.949 
took a little bit of a jog and as you
can<00:02:32.610> see<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:33.000> was<00:02:33.120> quite<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> bit<00:02:33.570> more<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.870> it

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
can see there was quite a bit more of it

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.080 
can see there was quite a bit more of it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.540 
doing a good job this tap rut I just
I<00:03:34.480> didn't<00:03:35.140> bother<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.560> dig<00:03:35.740> them<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.069> just

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
I didn't bother to dig them I just

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.130 
I didn't bother to dig them I just
grabbed<00:03:36.819> them<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.150> slowly<00:03:37.510> wiggle<00:03:37.750> them<00:03:37.990> and

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.370 
pulled slow and desperate here I would
guess<00:03:42.730> it's<00:03:42.760> probably<00:03:43.090> down<00:03:43.599> another<00:03:44.020> foot

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380
