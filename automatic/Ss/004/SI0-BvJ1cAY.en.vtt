00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.340
 hey good everyone here on your channel and 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.550
 good droid 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.740
 disappeared around two months the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.630
 number one broke down there's no 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.820
 computer like this is 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:22.050
 number 2 my cell phone broke down like this 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.580
 that this time it 's time for a boxing 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.160
 that as you can see projects still 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.540
 all scattered but hey this is the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.370
 phone we would like today from now on 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.750
 go ahead to be able to make my videos 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.430
 and I hope you like it or not, let's start 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.350
 with this hype as they can lose me 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.280
 love the carey unboxing is about the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.100
 zte blade l2 a very good phone 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.489
 price quality 2 thousand pesos for this 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.620
 quality is something incredible the truth that 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.420
 I could not believe 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.420
 well here you can see the terminal 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.920
 although I can tell you well it's a 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.920
 terminal of a 5-inch screen 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.800
 runs Android 4.4 4.2.2 a processor 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.740
 quad-core at 1.3 gigahertz a camera 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.530
 with an 8 megapixel camera and a 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.810
 1.3 megapixel front too 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.810
 has an analog television signal 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.080
 that we can find in the box because it is 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.050
 the classic in the guarantee policy 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.250
 instructive like the Mexican casino and 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.370
 the really a usb micro usb cable 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.650
 usb 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.250
 this adapter than this adapter 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.810
 it's amazing because other adapters 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.460
 They are too thick to be able 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.230
 put them in the light connection this is 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.060
 perfect because the part of 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.250
 up I do not know about television the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.220
 fan or anything from 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.840
 questions that you are using 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.090
 and a normal cube would not enter because 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.400
 because they are now zone but this one 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.260
 fits perfectly in good very well 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.210
 and there is no need to disconnect the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.980
 fan and death die of heat or 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.730
 disconnect the TV and as a litt of 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.170
 boredom 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.909
 here is this adapter very good point 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.060
 a point against that I see this 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.129
 device is that it is from stack not to 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.799
 extrainning the stack can not be 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.780
 change the brother because if the stack of 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.200
 it gets to inflate it does not get to damage 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.400
 well 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.709
 it was called real marta but good 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.819
 what else can I say about this winter 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.470
 Milan 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.360
 I suppose nothing 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.630
 on the right side we will find the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.040
 button to turn off and lock in 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.530
 the left side we will find the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.480
 Volume buttons and volume to low 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.160
 Volume up on the top 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.600
 we will only find the jack at 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.670
 3.5 headphones on the bottom of the 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.860
 port to charge micro usb and the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.920
 microphone 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.069
 Now let's see 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.910
 you can not see there we are going to take it 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.910
 this thing 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.580
 classically protective 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.010
 and then here is this terminal as 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.010
 can see telcel 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.209
 that allow an active 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.310
 what happens is that I already downloaded 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.260
 some things but I wanted to show you the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.410
 pure customization layer that has 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.230
 be finished you can see this the cen is 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.080
 very fluid 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.970
 the terminal has a giga of ram and 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.200
 I'm going to show it in adjustment 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.220
 to applications we're going 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.220
 in the execution 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.030
 As you can see, you can not see us 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.030
 can play very well we say 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:04.680
 I have 186 mega ejected and 786 megabytes 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.010
 free is a gig of ram what count 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.870
 this device the truth the only bad thing 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:16.269
 is the applications as you can see 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.970
 it is a giga of internal use 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.669
 how are you good here I lied to you go this 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.440
 is another giga for internal use are also 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.940
 2 gigas that serve us for a lot 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.740
 true but good 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.000
 I discovered a trick that later 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.790
 and I will show you how you and the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.270
 really good that's all for today this 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.730
 small unboxing of the zte blade l2 that the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.610
 true that here in Mexico it came to a very 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.180
 good price of only two thousand pesos for 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.610
 this great good phone 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.280
 I am Eduardo and I say goodbye with him 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.400
