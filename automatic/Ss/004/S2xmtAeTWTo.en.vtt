00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.379
 good morning everyone today I am going to teach you 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.719
 how to prepare a chicken cause the 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.490
 ingredients are going to be potatoes that the 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:18.099
 we will previously take chili onion chicken 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.099
 oil yellow salt 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.870
 and what we do is put the potato 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.630
 boil 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.850
 we put it until the potato is well 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.970
 cooked that then we will have to pass 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.810
 Then I'll teach you mashed 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.810
 Step by Step 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.610
 Once the potato and we 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.550
 known what we're going to do is peel it 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.100
 and pass it through mashed potatoes and put chicken 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.840
 I cooked chicken breasts 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 because I like it more because then you have to 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.420
 to say to charlo is to say that there is like 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.080
 chop it then now we leave the chicken 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.030
 the chicken cooking and we start to peel 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.980
 the potatoes I will not teach how but 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.510
 the potatoes because I could throw everything 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.760
 the day recording and it would take a lot 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.170
 video now I'm showing how it happened 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.330
 for puree and all that thank you 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.900
 You see I've peeled the potatoes now what 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.150
 what am I going to do with him 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.480
 pass puree I will pass all the potatoes 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.580
 and I'm going to make them as puree and now I 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.010
 I teach how it is 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
 You see how it is once we have already 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.490
 passed through the mash by the masher 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.380
 Now what we are going to do is catch 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.380
 all towards yellow that is this 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.440
 and we got the little one so that we do not 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.160
 they pique a lot we throw it in a glass 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.630
 with the blender and oil and we beat it 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.700
 everything so that we stay like a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.010
 liquid so yellow that that's why it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.050
 so called yellow even if it is orange and 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.790
 then we 'll throw it out here 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.310
 we will pour the salt and everything now returns 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.680
 to show I'm going to beat this and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.870
 removing the benita thank you very much 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.330
 Now, as I said, it takes away the benita 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.659
 I've missed here and catches you and I miss the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.399
 oil 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.759
 I miss olive oil because it is 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.939
 much better we take the black pepper 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.939
 milled 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.100
 and we also salt 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.459
 throwing salt and what we do is beat it 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.459
 all 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.150
 it stays yellow see how it stays 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.150
 yellow it looks like it's called yellow 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.950
 well I will continue to beat because this 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.349
 you have to beat for about two 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.989
 minutes and I do not want to waste time 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.410
 you see you have already beaten 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.030
 everything and this is how it looks yellowish and 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.980
 Now what we have to catch are two or 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.930
 three lemons for example these lemons 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.340
 they are big but if they are the files 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 small green ones that are also 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.230
 they can take that they are the ones in truth is 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.430
 that you milk five to six 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.349
 limas and here the cousins 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.560
 I have to get the juice out of all the 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.560
 lemon 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.629
 now we throw the first mixture that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.200
 we have made the yellow pepper with the 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.360
 oil and now we have to take the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.099
 next the lemon juice that we have 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.560
 milkshake that is here previously beaten 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.510
 all this has to be kneaded 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.510
 that that is the cause 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.620
 once we 've had a good time 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.110
 we take the lemon juice you see the dough 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.930
 is loose appointment does not have to be 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.720
 diluted we put the lemon juice and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.130
 we return to have a good time well to remember 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.800
 this has to have a little bit of 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.350
 patience do not fuck and how are you going all 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.750
 in a hurry I was wrong not the best in the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.770
 patience and move knead knead and that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.770
 be consistent 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.689
 Now what we do is chop the onion 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:00.319
 this is going to be the filling of the cause 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:04.069
 we chop it in squares 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.069
 the irak onions along with the chicken there 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.870
 people that I've tossed tuna that also 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.079
 can make the cause of tuna or can you 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.579
 also throw vegetables like peas 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.820
 carrot that leads to the taste of each 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.220
 person then apart 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.410
 we take and wash the onion so that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.850
 what the taste very very strong 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.850
 onion 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.790
 and 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.570
 the chicken as you see we have frayed 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.130
 all the chicken then now what 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.130
 we do is mix the chicken 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.830
 in a bowl together with the onion 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.210
 and everything is mixed well and once it 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.580
 mix what we do is throw him 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.040
 mayonnaise, mayonnaise 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.470
 homemade boat that already as you like to 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.450
 Here you mix it well well well 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.450
 and we add mayonnaise 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.730
 this one that goes well mayonnaise 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.210
 Well, I'm going to stop at the moment because 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.469
 I have to move everything again with the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.080
 mayonnaise and all hours I teach the 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.949
 result you see this is the way that 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.949
 it has to be the whole well mixed 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.990
 well with chicken mayonnaise already 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:37.319
 remember here you can always add 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:39.610
 here vegetables like Jewish peas 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:41.800
 carrot whatever you want if you want in 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.840
 you can throw your chicken with the 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.300
 onion which was has many 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.599
 varieties and now already what we have to 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.340
 to do is design our cause now what 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:54.099
 designed as we do not do this is cast 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.650
 on top of the part of a potato base 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.509
 then put the potato base on top and 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.539
 then you are already puts the decor 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:04.509
 you want now you will see it thank you very much 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.610
 you see they were the first potato base 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.680
 now the second one is the filling 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.560
 what are we going to do and now another base is going 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.599
 just like potato above you see this is the 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.879
 second this is the second part already 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.729
 we have put first layer potato second 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.289
 third potato filling now we go with 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.370
 the decoration in the decoration that 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.400
