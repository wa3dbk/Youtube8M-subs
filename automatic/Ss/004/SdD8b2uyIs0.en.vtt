00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.070 

we<00:00:10.309> built<00:00:11.000> a<00:00:11.150> couple<00:00:11.389> of<00:00:11.450> robots<00:00:11.780> here<00:00:11.959> if<00:00:12.019> you

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
we built a couple of robots here if you

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.660 
we built a couple of robots here if you
want<00:00:12.200> to<00:00:12.260> take<00:00:12.379> a<00:00:12.440> look<00:00:12.650> kind<00:00:13.190> of<00:00:13.250> show<00:00:13.490> off

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
want to take a look kind of show off

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.540 
want to take a look kind of show off
some<00:00:13.700> of<00:00:13.969> the<00:00:14.090> capabilities<00:00:14.240> of<00:00:14.690> that<00:00:14.980> so<00:00:15.980> this

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
some of the capabilities of that so this

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.210 
some of the capabilities of that so this
one<00:00:16.700> is<00:00:16.820> called<00:00:17.000> nitro<00:00:17.509> and<00:00:17.980> first<00:00:18.980> thing<00:00:19.130> you

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
one is called nitro and first thing you

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.950 
one is called nitro and first thing you
see<00:00:19.369> here<00:00:19.550> this<00:00:19.669> is<00:00:19.730> our<00:00:19.970> controller<00:00:20.360> compact

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
camera and you see what we're using

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.289 
camera and you see what we're using
currently<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:57.450> an<00:01:57.659> axis<00:01:58.970> industrial<00:01:59.970> camera

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
currently is an axis industrial camera

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450 
currently is an axis industrial camera
that<00:02:00.450> gets<00:02:00.600> used<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.200> security<00:02:01.979> monitoring

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
as sort of thing and so it allows us to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.990 
as sort of thing and so it allows us to
pull<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.720> anywhere<00:02:07.170> 15<00:02:07.799> 30<00:02:08.160> frames<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.550> second

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
that to actually do things like object

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.930 
that to actually do things like object
recognition<00:02:24.739> taking<00:02:25.739> visual<00:02:26.190> commands<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
recognition taking visual commands and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.509 
recognition taking visual commands and
act<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.330> those<00:02:27.510> with<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> robot<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.530> also

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
act on those with the robot and also

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.100 
act on those with the robot and also
track<00:02:29.849> different<00:02:30.209> objects<00:02:30.599> within<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.930> field

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
track different objects within the field

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.780 
track different objects within the field
so<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.950> opens<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.459> lot<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.730> new

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
so it opens up a lot of new

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.789 
so it opens up a lot of new
possibilities<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.660> students<00:02:34.080> with

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
possibilities for the students with

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:43.309 
possibilities for the students with
their<00:02:34.920> control<00:02:35.250> system

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.349 

Oh
