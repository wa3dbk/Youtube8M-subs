try to get into the hop so that would be

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.080

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
there's nine holes and it should be a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.660 
there's nine holes and it should be a
lot<00:01:23.360> of<00:01:23.420> fun<00:01:23.679> just<00:01:24.679> like<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.250> said<00:01:25.429> it<00:01:25.520> wasn't

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
anything super serious but I really

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.809 
anything super serious but I really
wanted<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:27.860> try<00:01:28.099> and<00:01:28.250> make<00:01:28.340> something<00:01:28.610> a

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
wanted to try and make something a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.639 
wanted to try and make something a
little<00:01:28.940> bit<00:01:29.119> different<00:01:29.450> because<00:01:29.539> I<00:01:29.720> always<00:01:30.319> do

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
little bit different because I always do

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.219 
little bit different because I always do
like<00:01:30.800> tutorials<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.580> stuff<00:01:31.899> but<00:01:32.899> I<00:01:32.959> have

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
like tutorials and stuff but I have

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.169 
like tutorials and stuff but I have
never<00:01:33.410> really<00:01:33.770> done<00:01:34.310> anything<00:01:34.759> like<00:01:35.119> this

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
never really done anything like this

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.900 
never really done anything like this
before<00:01:35.709> like<00:01:36.709> make<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:36.979> custom<00:01:37.459> map<00:01:37.700> or

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
before like make a custom map or

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.859 
before like make a custom map or
anything<00:01:38.179> like<00:01:38.209> that<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:39.910> was<00:01:40.910> tempted<00:01:41.599> to

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
anything like that so I was tempted to

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.620 
anything like that so I was tempted to
make<00:01:42.170> sort<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.920> like<00:01:43.069> a<00:01:43.099> childish<00:01:44.000> one<00:01:44.239> almost

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
make sort of like a childish one almost

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.680 
make sort of like a childish one almost
where<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:46.310> sort<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.789> have<00:01:47.149> like<00:01:47.179> windmills

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
where you sort of have like windmills

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.180 
where you sort of have like windmills
and<00:01:47.929> stuffing<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.319> might<00:01:48.500> be<00:01:48.649> another<00:01:48.860> video

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
and stuffing that might be another video

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.919 
and stuffing that might be another video
for<00:01:49.459> another<00:01:49.670> time<00:01:49.970> but<00:01:50.420> this<00:01:50.569> time<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:50.810> really

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
for another time but this time I really

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.930 
for another time but this time I really
wanted<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.530> try<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:51.950> get<00:01:52.039> this<00:01:52.220> down<00:01:52.580> because

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
wanted to try and get this down because

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.490 
wanted to try and get this down because
you<00:01:53.300> know<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.569> seems<00:01:53.720> like<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.959> would<00:01:54.170> be<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.319> lot

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
you know it seems like it would be a lot

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.100 
you know it seems like it would be a lot
of<00:01:54.530> fun<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.860> make<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.340> I'm<00:01:55.489> kind<00:01:56.030> of<00:01:56.149> I'm<00:01:56.390> I'm

blog

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.350 
blog
we'll<00:02:16.690> stop<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:18.130> sand<00:02:18.460> is<00:02:18.670> an<00:02:18.790> ok<00:02:19.060> trap

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
we'll stop it so sand is an ok trap

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.220 
we'll stop it so sand is an ok trap
water<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.260> not<00:02:20.680> an<00:02:20.950> okay<00:02:21.250> trap<00:02:21.580> if<00:02:22.180> your<00:02:22.990> ball

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
water is not an okay trap if your ball

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.980 
water is not an okay trap if your ball
touches<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> water<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.670> have<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:25.569> restart

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
touches the water you have to restart

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.559 
touches the water you have to restart
the<00:02:26.080> hole<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.190> say<00:02:27.490> I'm<00:02:27.640> I'm<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.270> here<00:02:28.300> and

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
the hole so say I'm I'm right here and

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.140 
the hole so say I'm I'm right here and
I'm<00:02:28.690> trying<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:28.990> get<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.200> over<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.470> water<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
I'm trying to get it over the water to

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.720 
I'm trying to get it over the water to
go<00:02:31.360> right<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.319> pick<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.920> up<00:02:33.040> go<00:02:33.550> back

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
go right in there so pick it up go back

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.970 
go right in there so pick it up go back
to<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:33.880> beginning<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.480> restart<00:02:35.200> keep<00:02:35.709> your

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
to the beginning and restart keep your

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.650 
to the beginning and restart keep your
score<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.580> if<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.730> already<00:02:36.880> did<00:02:37.120> two<00:02:37.330> crows

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
score so if you already did two crows

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.490 
score so if you already did two crows
that<00:02:37.930> will<00:02:38.050> be<00:02:38.140> your<00:02:38.290> third<00:02:38.530> throw<00:02:38.940> all<00:02:39.940> right

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that will be your third throw all right

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.280 
that will be your third throw all right
and<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:42.190> whoa<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.540> one<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.080> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
and so whoa so the one like this you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.229 
and so whoa so the one like this you
would<00:02:44.410> need<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> be<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.709> little<00:02:44.860> bit<00:02:44.980> careful

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
would need to be a little bit careful

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.699 
would need to be a little bit careful
not<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.450> get<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.630> into<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.080> hole<00:02:47.230> there<00:02:47.500> but

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
not to get it into the hole there but

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.110 
not to get it into the hole there but
you<00:02:47.830> can<00:02:47.980> probably<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.370> something<00:02:48.550> like<00:02:48.820> this

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
you can probably do something like this

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.770 
you can probably do something like this
get<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.080> par<00:02:50.350> there<00:02:51.360> something<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:52.510> that

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
get a to par there something like that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.470 
get a to par there something like that
and<00:02:53.080> for<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.160> last<00:02:54.310> hole<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.180> ball

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
and for the last hole it is a ball

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.759 
and for the last hole it is a ball
collection<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.390> downhill<00:02:58.840> hole<00:02:59.380> and

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
collection so it's a downhill hole and

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.520 
collection so it's a downhill hole and
your<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.519> stand<00:03:00.820> here<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.300> I've<00:03:01.780> noticed<00:03:02.440> how

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
your to stand here and I've noticed how

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.100 
your to stand here and I've noticed how
to<00:03:02.590> throw<00:03:03.400> jump<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.540> throw<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.900> those<00:03:05.080> a

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
to throw jump and throw it those a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.100 
to throw jump and throw it those a
little<00:03:05.350> bit<00:03:05.560> further<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.510> when<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.840> get<00:03:08.080> your

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
little bit further so when you get your

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.290 
little bit further so when you get your
ball<00:03:08.440> into<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.010> hole<00:03:10.709> like<00:03:11.709> so<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:13.000> will<00:03:13.269> go

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
ball into this hole like so it will go

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.740 
ball into this hole like so it will go
into<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.989> chest<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:16.090> my<00:03:16.300> mini<00:03:16.510> golf
