so I started over in the corner and I

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.800 
so I started over in the corner and I
made<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> knot<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.040> thread<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
made a knot in the thread and I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.090 
made a knot in the thread and I
basically<00:02:07.049> buried<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> yarn

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.170 

and<00:02:14.100> we'll<00:02:14.670> start<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.810> new<00:02:16.350> one<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:17.400> ended

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and we'll start on a new one so we ended

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.270 
and we'll start on a new one so we ended
here<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.970> what<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.090> gonna<00:02:21.210> do<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.160> about
