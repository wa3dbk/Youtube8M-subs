just depends on what you want your boat
in<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.750> back<00:00:28.960> area<00:00:29.320> here<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.810> particular

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
in the back area here this particular

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.569 
in the back area here this particular
boats<00:00:32.619> got<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:35.440> boat<00:00:35.710> has<00:00:35.890> got<00:00:35.920> dual<00:00:36.339> rear

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
boats got this boat has got dual rear

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.700 
boats got this boat has got dual rear
ballast<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:37.510> they've<00:00:37.600> got<00:00:37.659> hard<00:00:38.140> ballast

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
ballast and so they've got hard ballast

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.979 
ballast and so they've got hard ballast
tanks<00:00:39.190> in<00:00:39.909> the<00:00:40.089> rear<00:00:40.239> of<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.420> boat<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.629> don't

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
tanks in the rear of the boat that don't

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.599 
tanks in the rear of the boat that don't
take<00:00:41.199> up<00:00:41.379> all<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.589> room<00:00:41.739> inside<00:00:42.249> here<00:00:42.489> we

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
trapped down in the bags that get mossy

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.139 
trapped down in the bags that get mossy
and<00:00:58.929> they're<00:00:59.559> just<00:00:59.769> a<00:00:59.920> mess<00:01:00.159> this<00:01:00.909> is<00:01:01.120> a

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149

cleaner looking we talked about the the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.500 
cleaner looking we talked about the the
the<00:01:05.379> ballast<00:01:05.799> pumps<00:01:06.010> those<00:01:06.880> ballast<00:01:07.299> pumps

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
the ballast pumps those ballast pumps

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.540 
the ballast pumps those ballast pumps
are<00:01:07.900> right<00:01:08.590> here<00:01:08.980> they're<00:01:09.190> accessible

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
to take these motors off replace them in

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.960 
to take these motors off replace them in
about<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.810> minute<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.440> a<00:01:26.530> half<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.640> just<00:01:27.850> a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
about a minute and a half it's just a

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.360 
about a minute and a half it's just a
really<00:01:28.330> nice<00:01:28.540> way<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.960> build<00:01:29.260> a<00:01:29.440> system<00:01:29.680> some

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
really nice way to build a system some

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.400 
really nice way to build a system some
of<00:01:30.490> our<00:01:30.640> competitors<00:01:31.210> it's<00:01:31.780> very<00:01:32.110> very

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
of our competitors it's very very

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.650 
of our competitors it's very very
difficult<00:01:32.740> we<00:01:33.580> like<00:01:33.760> to<00:01:33.970> make<00:01:34.120> things<00:01:34.180> as

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
difficult we like to make things as

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.470 
difficult we like to make things as
simple<00:01:34.900> as<00:01:35.140> we<00:01:35.350> can<00:01:35.560> make<00:01:35.710> them<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:37.210> makes

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
simple as we can make them and it makes

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.750 
simple as we can make them and it makes
it<00:01:37.690> so<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:38.260> consumer<00:01:39.190> can<00:01:39.370> actually

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
it so that the consumer can actually

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.400 
it so that the consumer can actually
service<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.300> lot<00:01:40.480> of<00:01:40.600> these<00:01:40.660> parts<00:01:40.990> out<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.350> the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
service a lot of these parts out in the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.490 
service a lot of these parts out in the
field<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:42.100> takes<00:01:42.370> less<00:01:42.640> time<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:43.900> replace<00:01:44.440> a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
field it takes less time to replace a

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.179 
field it takes less time to replace a
ballast<00:01:45.160> pump

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
ballast pump

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.620

yourself that it does to connect the
boat<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.229> trailer<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> bring<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
boat to your trailer get to bring it to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.080 
boat to your trailer get to bring it to
a<00:01:50.640> dealer<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.890> ability<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.789> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
a dealer so you have the ability if you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.410 
a dealer so you have the ability if you
choose<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:55.439> save<00:01:55.679> yourself<00:01:56.100> some<00:01:56.250> time<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
choose to save yourself some time if you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.700 
choose to save yourself some time if you
got<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.600> ballast<00:01:57.960> pump<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.289> goes<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.679> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
got a ballast pump that goes out and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.120 
got a ballast pump that goes out and
they<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.189> go<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.750> you<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.899> unscrew<00:02:01.590> one

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
they do go out you just unscrew one
