for your PC gaming so that's really cool
so<00:03:44.099> right<00:03:45.099> now<00:03:45.190> I'm<00:03:45.370> gonna<00:03:45.459> load<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.909> state

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
so right now I'm gonna load the state

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.349 
so right now I'm gonna load the state
that<00:03:46.389> I<00:03:46.420> have<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:51.280> as<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.459> can<00:03:51.549> see<00:03:51.730> this<00:03:52.209> is

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
that I have so as you can see this is

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.569 
that I have so as you can see this is
without<00:03:52.510> speed<00:03:52.959> hacks<00:03:53.200> on<00:03:53.409> and<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:54.310> it's

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
without speed hacks on and it's it's

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.080 
without speed hacks on and it's it's
literally<00:03:55.319> really<00:03:56.319> slow<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:57.819> know<00:03:57.849> it's

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
literally really slow you know it's

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.270 
literally really slow you know it's
basically<00:03:58.269> slow<00:03:58.720> motion<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.319> don't<00:04:00.159> know<00:04:00.220> if

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
basically slow motion I don't know if

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.780 
basically slow motion I don't know if
you<00:04:00.340> can<00:04:00.400> hear<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.670> audio<00:04:03.659> sounds<00:04:04.659> really

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
you can hear the audio sounds really

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.420 
you can hear the audio sounds really
sounds<00:04:06.790> really<00:04:07.060> really<00:04:07.599> terrible<00:04:07.930> actually

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
sounds really really terrible actually

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.399 
sounds really really terrible actually
sounds<00:04:09.430> like<00:04:09.609> dying<00:04:10.420> robots<00:04:10.989> or<00:04:11.379> something

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
sounds like dying robots or something

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.830 
sounds like dying robots or something
like<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.099> it's<00:04:12.700> actually<00:04:13.030> quite<00:04:13.269> disturbing

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
like that it's actually quite disturbing

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.180 
like that it's actually quite disturbing
so<00:04:14.049> I'm<00:04:14.230> actually<00:04:14.379> going<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.739> close<00:04:15.010> it

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
so I'm actually going to close it

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.009 
so I'm actually going to close it
because<00:04:15.250> it's<00:04:15.519> kind<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.760> freaking<00:04:16.060> me<00:04:16.090> out<00:04:16.180> so

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
because it's kind of freaking me out so

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.870 
because it's kind of freaking me out so
you<00:04:17.590> want<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:17.949> go<00:04:18.010> configure<00:04:18.489> emulation

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
you want to go configure emulation

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.770 
you want to go configure emulation
settings<00:04:19.419> speed<00:04:19.780> hacks<00:04:20.039> turn<00:04:21.039> them<00:04:21.250> on<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:22.270> know

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
settings speed hacks turn them on I know

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.719 
settings speed hacks turn them on I know
they're<00:04:22.960> not<00:04:22.990> recommended<00:04:23.650> but<00:04:23.919> I<00:04:23.949> have<00:04:24.280> mine

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
they're not recommended but I have mine

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.839 
they're not recommended but I have mine
all<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.120> way<00:04:25.210> up<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.430> have<00:04:27.580> pretty<00:04:27.760> much

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
all the way up and I have pretty much

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.110 
all the way up and I have pretty much
all<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.180> them<00:04:28.330> enabled<00:04:29.039> and<00:04:30.039> click<00:04:30.190> apply<00:04:30.460> for

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
all of them enabled and click apply for

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.820 
all of them enabled and click apply for
that<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.570> now<00:04:32.020> I'm<00:04:32.169> going<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.380> run<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.680> again

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
that and now I'm going to run it again

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.089 
that and now I'm going to run it again
I'm<00:04:33.340> going<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.580> continue<00:04:34.000> running<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.479> and<00:04:35.099> you

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
I'm going to continue running it and you

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.129 
I'm going to continue running it and you
can<00:04:36.220> see<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.520> it's<00:04:37.000> running<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.960> much

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
can see that it's running so much

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.060 
can see that it's running so much
smoother<00:04:38.710> it's<00:04:39.699> literally<00:04:40.330> uh<00:04:40.360> like<00:04:41.349> I<00:04:41.650> mean

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
smoother it's literally uh like I mean

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.760 
smoother it's literally uh like I mean
it's<00:04:42.220> almost<00:04:42.490> real-time<00:04:43.380> it's<00:04:44.380> actually

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
it's almost real-time it's actually

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.439 
it's almost real-time it's actually
running<00:04:45.099> about<00:04:45.280> as<00:04:45.490> smooth<00:04:45.760> as<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.240> normally

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
running about as smooth as it normally

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.659 
running about as smooth as it normally
would<00:04:46.990> as<00:04:47.919> you<00:04:48.039> can<00:04:48.159> see<00:04:48.220> there's<00:04:48.400> kind<00:04:48.550> of

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
would as you can see there's kind of

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.730 
would as you can see there's kind of
some<00:04:48.820> weird<00:04:49.000> glitching<00:04:49.630> on<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.349> screen<00:04:50.620> right

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
some weird glitching on the screen right

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.339 
some weird glitching on the screen right
here<00:04:50.800> these<00:04:51.130> weird<00:04:51.340> black<00:04:51.699> circles<00:04:52.349> those

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
here these weird black circles those

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.529 
here these weird black circles those
aren't<00:04:54.250> in<00:04:54.370> every<00:04:54.610> level<00:04:54.820> that's<00:04:55.090> just<00:04:55.360> in

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
aren't in every level that's just in

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.120 
aren't in every level that's just in
this<00:04:55.720> level<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.320> Batcave<00:04:56.680> or

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
this level this is the Batcave or

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.909 
this level this is the Batcave or
whatever<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:58.300> uh<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:59.349> actually<00:04:59.560> runs

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
whatever but uh it actually runs

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.070 
whatever but uh it actually runs
completely<00:05:00.280> smooth<00:05:00.940> which<00:05:01.360> is<00:05:01.599> honestly

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
completely smooth which is honestly

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.930 
completely smooth which is honestly
pretty<00:05:02.560> surprising<00:05:02.919> because<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.550> don't<00:05:03.729> have<00:05:03.909> a

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
pretty surprising because I don't have a

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.960 
pretty surprising because I don't have a
super<00:05:04.419> high-end<00:05:04.840> computer<00:05:05.340> but<00:05:06.340> enabling<00:05:06.639> the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
super high-end computer but enabling the

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.360 
super high-end computer but enabling the
speed<00:05:07.180> hacks<00:05:07.389> does<00:05:07.630> work<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.889> might<00:05:09.039> get<00:05:09.190> some

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
speed hacks does work you might get some

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.200 
speed hacks does work you might get some
weird<00:05:09.580> glitches<00:05:10.120> or<00:05:10.510> something<00:05:11.610> but<00:05:12.610> it<00:05:13.000> works

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
weird glitches or something but it works

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.480 
weird glitches or something but it works
mostly<00:05:13.720> for<00:05:13.960> pretty<00:05:14.680> much<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:15.039> lot<00:05:15.310> of<00:05:15.400> the

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
mostly for pretty much a lot of the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.490 
mostly for pretty much a lot of the
games<00:05:15.669> so<00:05:16.449> when<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:17.050> want<00:05:17.229> to<00:05:17.260> keep<00:05:17.320> in

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
games so when you you want to keep in

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.110 
games so when you you want to keep in
mind<00:05:17.680> that<00:05:17.860> this<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.310> not<00:05:18.370> going<00:05:18.699> to<00:05:18.789> work<00:05:18.969> with

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
mind that this is not going to work with

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.480 
mind that this is not going to work with
every<00:05:19.479> game<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.990> tried<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.529> play<00:05:20.680> Killzone<00:05:21.190> the

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
every game I tried to play Killzone the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.930 
every game I tried to play Killzone the
original<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.900> didn't<00:05:23.200> it<00:05:23.320> wouldn't<00:05:23.469> even

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
original and it didn't it wouldn't even

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.470 
original and it didn't it wouldn't even
at<00:05:24.630> all<00:05:24.780> so<00:05:25.530> you<00:05:26.250> know<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.640> sometimes<00:05:27.300> the

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
at all so you know and sometimes the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.820 
at all so you know and sometimes the
speed<00:05:27.720> hacks<00:05:27.960> don't<00:05:28.200> work<00:05:28.350> with<00:05:28.500> every<00:05:28.710> game

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
speed hacks don't work with every game

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.470 
speed hacks don't work with every game
so<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:29.100> might<00:05:29.250> actually<00:05:29.370> have<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.760> disable

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
so you might actually have to disable

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.910 
so you might actually have to disable
them<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.140> then<00:05:31.530> try<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.490> game<00:05:32.610> again<00:05:33.000> but<00:05:33.750> uh

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
them and then try the game again but uh

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.160 
them and then try the game again but uh
if<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.520> game<00:05:35.700> works<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.360> it's<00:05:36.810> just<00:05:36.960> running

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
if the game works and it's just running

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.050 
if the game works and it's just running
really<00:05:37.260> slow<00:05:37.620> I<00:05:37.650> turn<00:05:38.040> speed<00:05:38.340> hacks<00:05:38.580> on<00:05:38.790> if<00:05:38.940> I

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
really slow I turn speed hacks on if I

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.030 
really slow I turn speed hacks on if I
are<00:05:39.120> you<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.990> rest<00:05:40.170> of<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.350> stuff<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.800> can't

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
are you the rest of the stuff I can't

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.320 
are you the rest of the stuff I can't
just<00:05:41.220> leave<00:05:41.400> alone<00:05:41.670> unless<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.090> know<00:05:42.210> what

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
just leave alone unless you know what

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.730 
just leave alone unless you know what
you're<00:05:42.420> doing<00:05:42.750> you<00:05:43.200> can<00:05:43.260> change<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.620> aspect

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
you're doing you can change the aspect

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.610 
you're doing you can change the aspect
ratio<00:05:44.160> from<00:05:44.700> 4:3<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.360> 16:9<00:05:45.540> I<00:05:46.020> don't<00:05:46.380> know<00:05:46.440> why

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
ratio from 4:3 to 16:9 I don't know why

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.260 
ratio from 4:3 to 16:9 I don't know why
you<00:05:46.680> would<00:05:46.890> want<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.160> play<00:05:47.280> anything<00:05:47.700> in<00:05:47.790> 4:3

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
you would want to play anything in 4:3

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.870 
you would want to play anything in 4:3
it<00:05:48.420> looks<00:05:48.570> really<00:05:48.840> stupid<00:05:49.350> so<00:05:50.130> I'm<00:05:50.610> trying<00:05:50.850> to

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
it looks really stupid so I'm trying to

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.220 
it looks really stupid so I'm trying to
think<00:05:50.970> there's<00:05:51.240> anything<00:05:51.420> else<00:05:51.630> I<00:05:51.750> should<00:05:51.930> say

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
think there's anything else I should say

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.030 
think there's anything else I should say
for<00:05:52.470> this<00:05:52.560> video<00:05:54.320> now<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.380> audio<00:05:55.740> is<00:05:55.890> still

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
for this video now the audio is still

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.010 
for this video now the audio is still
kind<00:05:56.250> of<00:05:56.280> kind<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.580> be<00:05:56.730> weird<00:05:57.090> even<00:05:57.540> if<00:05:57.840> it's

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
kind of kind of be weird even if it's

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.830 
kind of kind of be weird even if it's
running<00:05:58.260> perfectly<00:05:59.090> but<00:06:00.090> I<00:06:00.120> personally<00:06:00.570> I'd

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
running perfectly but I personally I'd

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.870 
running perfectly but I personally I'd
rather<00:06:00.990> have<00:06:01.260> a<00:06:01.290> clearer<00:06:01.890> picture<00:06:01.920> instead<00:06:02.760> of

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
rather have a clearer picture instead of

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.260 
rather have a clearer picture instead of
a<00:06:02.910> great<00:06:03.660> audio<00:06:04.080> but<00:06:04.680> uh<00:06:04.850> it's<00:06:05.850> it's<00:06:06.120> pretty

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
a great audio but uh it's it's pretty

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.910 
a great audio but uh it's it's pretty
surprising<00:06:06.570> that<00:06:06.750> actually<00:06:07.050> runs<00:06:07.290> really

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
surprising that actually runs really

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.830 
surprising that actually runs really
smoothly<00:06:08.310> I<00:06:09.000> thought<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.420> was<00:06:09.510> really<00:06:09.600> cool

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
smoothly I thought that was really cool

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.140 
smoothly I thought that was really cool
so<00:06:10.710> that's<00:06:11.280> it<00:06:11.430> for<00:06:11.580> this<00:06:11.640> video<00:06:11.790> if<00:06:11.940> you<00:06:12.060> guys
