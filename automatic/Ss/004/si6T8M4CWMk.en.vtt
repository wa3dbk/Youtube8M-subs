00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.010
 yes hello 14 dubai - lpg we want us 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.020
 Today, look at it like a multivan 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.879
 what works and if it works 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.390
 sometimes problems are what this may be 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.270
 look what wise multivan televised 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:25.730
 once 16 meters cable through - easy 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.860
 to switch the valve and higher to 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.580
 screw it down and then we have 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.199
 the multivan thiel as such this time 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.090
 by thomas otto is actually 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.769
 Highest quality and we were 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.030
 It's only normal for us 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.559
 thomas etti valve 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.260
 yes what's on a valve 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.629
 Once the float goes up when 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.690
 Thank you then we have this here 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:54.620
 Fill the pipe and remove the pipe 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.600
 then we have the coil and 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.120
 Unlock line 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.359
 then we have here once an 8 mm 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.790
 command line then we have one here 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.650
 6 mm extraction line at thomas 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.490
 otto extra if there are these 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.110
 line as eight millimeters also output 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.430
 then we have the attachment for 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.289
 the level sensor manufacturer but 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.750
 then you click if now just times 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.409
 Sounds easy here 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.840
 lock depending on how full it is 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:32.509
 and I now thank the swimmer 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.100
 up and take the instrument with her 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.770
 finally electrically and who reports 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.009
 then front over resistance to the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.450
 switch the level and above it 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.060
 He then also the lights on that one 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.759
 Let's see this is one 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.219
 overpressure valve that is when the tank 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.869
 was and again always too much stretches 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.359
 no matter how the gas is 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.030
 should expand this dissolves at all 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.579
 valve at 27 was off and leaves 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.100
 controls the pressure but you in 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.240
 the regular screw so can I 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.310
 Close the valve when I have the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.740
 turn off the wire completely turn away 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.440
 this all turn out mechanically 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.240
 valve is open 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.640
 Often people turn it in and out 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.020
 confused to turn up again and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.790
 mother does not transform the plant 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.200
 that works is the real thing 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.360
 Closure valve where the coil on it 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.319
 I can only sit 17 times 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.300
 turn from it and then here I see the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.140
 is the actual closure is 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.459
 actually stored with a spring 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.840
 presses on this stimulus you something more 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.820
 there where it comes out as liquid 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.690
 closing is that is called electricity 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.780
 the coil pulls up this pen and 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.160
 Gives the gas free sometimes 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.760
 also these mistakes here 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:56.890
 You have to see that it is freed 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:02.350
 so that comes on it screws for mounting 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.230
 The easiest way to do it with the 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.489
 Striker together filling the pipe 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.430
 just get in here over the top 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:17.530
 surname is important 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.440
 Here the montage that the writing 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.650
 thomas otto schinle that up 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:31.720
 shows at 12 o'clock you can already 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:35.049
 see and still be observed would be this 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.900
 screw takes that one in and work 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:42.640
 Assembling two teams screwing over 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.420
 cross- tightening connection torque is 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.489
 It should take you about 56 minutes to get there 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.019
 the tightening is called cross 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:55.049
 Of course always opposite 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.049
 Tighten otherwise misunderstood the valve 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:03.769
 We are grateful to each other and to each other 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:06.799
 is screwed tightly coil again 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.499
 on it - connected and I will 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.480
 Sometimes there are problems with it 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.000
 refuel one for a short while 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.620
 typical mistake while refueling is that 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.769
 I can not refuel 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.989
 that is then different 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.300
 Either the meeting is connection 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.050
 in fact that they feel google 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.849
 At times the refueling sun conclusion that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.889
 bullet in it 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:34.789
 and just in winter free-tv times 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:38.000
 then I can not refuel or possible 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.340
 there is two at the command line inside 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.680
 in there is plastic cross and that 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.150
 often you have to get rid of them 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.660
 unscrew the plastic wood 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.160
 and then it's usually good god too 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.449
 that was it 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.449
 Until next time
