00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.469
 and how are you friends of youtube 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.850
 I hope very good in this 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.640
 I bring you a video a little 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.070
 different just like I bring them 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.200
 what is this trick with regard to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.320
 this music and what it would be in this 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.700
 tricks with what would be these that are 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.910
 the hearing aids that brings the extras of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.160
 Manzana 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.500
 and these tricks are compatible with both 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.440
 grass like zinc the break band no 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.770
 requires and are applicable for those who 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.120
 they use ipod iphone and ipad devices 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.850
 I think that in these tricks is the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.519
 integrated from air 5.0 to 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.930
 up I'm not sure but many very 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.720
 few people know how to make this 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.800
 trick so I 'm going to teach you trick 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.009
 which consists of with some control 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.740
 remote do with what would be the 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.190
 hearing aids so let's connect them what 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.540
 I'm going to connect 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.260
 there and I connected and for example they 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.400
 I bring 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.400
 It is the d 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.320
 can you change 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.810
 of song just squeezing me this 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.750
 I did not know it recently I knew 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.850
 we'll see 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.970
 for many who do not know including the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.490
 mine 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.670
 we can as everyone knows simply 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.430
 pressing the button in the middle that 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.950
 play the song there they can see 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.110
 this pulse will fold up and if 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.780
 press twice on the same button 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.650
 is going to jump to the next song let's go 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.650
 twice 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.110
 there you saw that the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.000
 next song 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.460
 simply giving 2 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.460
 pressing the middle button twice 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.390
 and now to go back the song would be 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.700
 pressed through the middle button 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.660
 to this sense that is to be where they are 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.660
 three times with the medium 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.420
 it did not come out again 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.530
 this pressure or three times it was voted into law 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.780
 sometimes it costs a bit to accommodate 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.550
 to be 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.550
 twice is forwards 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.460
 there are people 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.560
 now three times three times to go 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.560
 back we're going to do it three times 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.770
 now if we want to advance the song 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.060
 let's press twice and leave 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.060
 pressed the middle button 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.230
 I do not know if you can see that the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.140
 song is running much faster 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.750
 You already saw that everything is given for 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.270
 back is the same more than we press 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.790
 nothing more without three of that middle button 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.240
 and we left pressed I think there's the 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.920
 part of twice can not see that already 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.920
 is receding are three times 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.990
 you are going back now again 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:38.470
 to the next song twice 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.680
 again and we go back three times 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.069
 the button and a half 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.439
 and it's so good 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.290
 also brings these three more options not 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:52.040
 only applies for what is the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.040
 player or the music 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:01.080
 We can also take pictures through the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.080
 control of the hearing aids let's go there 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.010
 and if we press 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.010
 volume button + 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.940
 we can take the picture while still touching 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.940
 the button so let's press it 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.410
 there press it and now it's just 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.620
 take the photo 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.560
 Let's go to another one 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.830
 equal the volume button more and take the 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.830
 Photo 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.910
 good can you see and also this 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.580
 it is noteworthy that these controls 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.450
 students apply also so that 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.540
 are the calls if they are calling us 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.060
 this if we press once we can hang 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.740
 and pick up the call 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.909
 symantec if you are calling us and keep 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.219
 pressed the middle button or is this 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.469
 expert this means if we keep it 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:06.150
 computer they automatically call you 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:08.370
 ignore so that we do not answer it and 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.169
 also this can be activated city and 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.659
 keep impressed if it stays 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.400
 pressed the middle button as in the 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.400
 time is deactivated now let's see 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.069
 there are also you 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.039
 I do not get civilized because I do not 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.770
 I'm connected to the internet but again 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.879
 see you 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.879
 and it is activated like this 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.139
 and good as I say this trick what 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.090
 I discovered recently 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.529
 I'm investigating a little more about 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.509
 this 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:45.419
 and I already discovered that he has many more 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.080
 details tricks it out of our 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.560
 orbit 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.389
 and good as I do this as I say 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.069
 this did not know this to me it serves me 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.289
 pretty when I go to music as 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.750
 before, what I was doing was taking out the 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.719
 iphone to overtake and delay a 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.210
 song and well now I realized 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:06.909
 that there is no need to pressure him 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.300
 get it out simply with the control of 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:13.060
 with the bass control knob worthy 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.830
 what can you do to us but it is worth mentioning 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.680
 that have to be those of the ornaments 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.699
 originals these are the originals of 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.830
 Apple are those of the iphone 4s I think 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.360
 they also serve in hands and I'm sure 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.659
 that they also serve what they are for 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.690
 the new ipods that we already know that 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.280
 they have iphone 5 of the iphone 85 of fifth 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.570
 generation 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.570
 they are all very good tires 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:42.880
 they're going to serve pretty good with this 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.900

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.550
