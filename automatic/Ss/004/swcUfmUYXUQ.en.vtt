00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.650
 to my channel this short I 'm going to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.270
 teach how to backup all 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.630
 your contacts that are on the phone 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.490
 in this case they are still 16 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.700
 very easy and very simple knowledge 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.440
 we just go here by contacts 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.910
 we look for the option of contacts these 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.689
 are all the contacts that I have in the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 phone and I here for more settings and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.400
 then on screen contacts to show 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.260
 which is in the device that is in 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.940
 the cell phone will show me all those 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 contacts if I other settings 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.600
 bancayÃ¡n and we want to make contacts 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.780
 that they have like this they will see that I do not have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.309
 no contact in the sim then yes I 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.670
 what I want is to pass all my 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.160
 contacts to implement them again me 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.559
 I put here on the device and I give it 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 here import and export and I give it 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.579
 export all contacts me here 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.890
 the card option without exporting 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.219
 select all the contacts I'm going to 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.839
 accept accept and list here is 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.540
 keeping all the contacts that I have 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.570
 on my phone on the tape that easy 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.970
 it is emotion contact a backup in our 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.479
 without all the contacts that are in 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.479
 our phone 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.350
 now they will see that if I say here 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.290
 contacts to show me show me 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.250
 that are on top to show all the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.700
 contacts that you just stored well 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.550
 easy and very simple another thing is that the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.290
 site from here forgiveness of salt and heaven and 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.240
 display shows view all 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.580
 contacts and very surely I will 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.640
 draw repeated contacts because because 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.479
 is that I had already made a backup in the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.000
 sim already have a backup on my account 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.990
 gmail and I have a backup on the phone 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.870
 so that's why he shows me 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 double or triple contacts 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.980
 that was all known thank you very much for 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.980
