00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 and here we are, this is the new dacha 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.470
 duster 2014 version 1600 gpl 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.370
 I decided to make this video because 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.559
 the moment I was looking for 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.560
 a car I found almost none 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.609
 serious review concerning the version 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.060
 gpl as it goes as it does not go consumption and everything 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.369
 the rest 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.920
 the car more or less who is watching 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.699
 this video surely knows it 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.780
 I was pleasantly satisfied with it 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:36.660
 impressed by the quality of the engine and also 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 interior one thinks low cost and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 machine but in reality it is not a machine 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.170
 very low cost starting from the price 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.719
 this is the practically full version 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.079
 optional the only thing I didn't do 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.390
 put are the cruise control and le 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.860
 maps of europe because i don't 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.350
 they were used for the engine 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.890
 it is not excellent 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.049
 mounts a 1600 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.619
 above all this is a whole 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.860
 what renault sees mounting 1600 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.770
 renault then renault engine and fittings 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.979
 i'm nissan renault so we have 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.080
 engine and chassis are of the nissan e 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.729
 of the renault then we say how 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.820
 guarantee and security 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.040
 we have a good one 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.930
 the quality as regards instead 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.450
 the gas plant and a gas plant 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.610
 della landi is one of the companies 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.860
 which supplies almost all gas systems 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.120
 how many car manufacturers of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 world and one of the companies of the 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.030
 plus more renew more series and even more 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.170
 reliable in a landi and di plant 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.870
 secure guarantee 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.880
 then let's talk about the car for 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.890
 normal dacha we know almost 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.780
 then all I did my first 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.000
 3,500 kilometers we see now 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.899
 how many they are 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.490
 then they are 3500 120 kilometers per hour 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 regarding the internal aspect 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.970
 we have little to say because now the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.700
 they all know 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.840
 the touch screen and everything but that 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.710
 I want I want to talk today 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.880
 engine then what is this LPG 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.370
 dacia is an engine is excellent 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.640
 initially I'm scared it's more 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.980
 what else because it has a break-in a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.390
 the first ones are a bit complicated as a machine 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.450
 400 km 5 100 km I thought the car 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.990
 in reality it was worth nothing in 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.910
 how much braking she had stopped 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.630
 did not really shoot had not 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.150
 nothing but maybe programmed 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.440
 the programmed with the control unit this 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.090
 this situation 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.670
 as you went on with the km 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.250
 the machine will always respond better to 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:12.160
 all the commands I gave him 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.200
 then shooting acceleration and 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.660
 whenever I had a problem there 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.890
 car more to go on km and more 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.170
 responded well to my needs 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.150
 now that we are on 3,500 km we say that 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.370
 I think it came almost to the top the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.990
 running in them should be 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.580
 about three thousand kilometers per hour 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.040
 we talk about the gas and I did the first 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.900
 700 kilometers only and 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.900
 petrol only for one 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.360
 I do not know even advice for 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.310
 urban legends, however, the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.830
 machine lubricated well in the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.630
 engine and headings frigato sfigato well e 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.030
 now the gas news none then the 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.510
 gas and how many kilometers you do it how much 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.660
 walk and what performance 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.290
 then I did not many come 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.660
 in fact the machine is two months old and 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.890
 how mileage can vary from 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:16.730
 300 to 370 km with a full one that full 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:20.420
 I'm 25 22 euros 20 is something for me that 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.100
 I come from petrol or diesel and a lot that 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.800
 consumed a lot is really a 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.940
 this is the unattainable goal 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.940
 trunk is so much I show it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.650
 my son filling the car 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:42.750
 of course then and 300 kilometers 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.830
 very good performance and now I am 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.449
 trying to go with eco mode like 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.729
 the eco mode that you take net 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.900
 it should still save fuel 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.580
 would like to save more 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.979
 greater savings then consumption 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.360
 less gas and is experiencing precisely 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.759
 that less consumption 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.300
 actually there is so I think of 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:06.719
 arrive in 380 390 km with a full of 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.960
 gas 25 euro 380 km if I make the account of 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.750
 how much I spent before I am rich defect 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.639
 of the class machines, however, is precisely one 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.479
 opening baggage to the first 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.159
 see the flaw is one that would not be 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:26.460
 we have escort powers 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:29.039
 we have a kit to inflate the wheels 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.689
 wheel with with a small compressor that 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.129
 it sticks to the socket but 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:37.680
 I think if it really happens 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:40.020
 fortunately we are put very badly 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.909
 dacia offers a guarantee service 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.589
 twenty-four out of seven seven 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.569
 seven for five years I did a 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:47.610
 package for five years of assistance 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.379
 road in any case everywhere 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.310
 Italy offer us abroad 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.360
 road assistance even with hotel or 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.069
 if they fail the system of 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.190
 car immediately so it's enough 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:04.990
 complete the dacia kit than inside 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:10.000
 that presents in the usual things then 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.890
 the triangle gloves jacket and I did 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.190
 the first cutting at 3 thousand kilometers is me 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:18.040
 they also gave a first kit 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.240
 rescue but always better to have it than not 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.260
 have it 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.400
 this is my impression of 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.970
 machine 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.310
 I am satisfied satisfied with the machine 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.720
 also gives confidence to drive it at the beginning 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.080
 he was a little skeptical with for the 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.620
 dacia brand but sincerely I am 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.340
 remained more than satisfied with the machine 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:46.600
 seems very safe it looks stable 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:50.710
 spacious consumption although excellent from 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:55.060
 already beautiful very attractive line 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.460
 and I don't think he has anything to 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.230
 envy with more machines and brands 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.790
 blazoned 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.860
 I hope you refuse to be helpful 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.580
 this my review 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.580
 see you soon
