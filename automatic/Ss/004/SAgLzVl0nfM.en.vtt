00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.979 
really lacking you can change these
different<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.970> different<00:02:25.239> sized<00:02:25.480> ear<00:02:25.690> tips

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
different to different sized ear tips

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.460 
different to different sized ear tips
you<00:02:26.140> just<00:02:26.319> pull<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.709> off<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.750> then

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
you just pull this off like so and then

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.070 
you just pull this off like so and then
pop<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.860> different<00:02:30.220> size<00:02:30.490> on<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.690> changed

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
pop a different size on and I changed

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.380 
pop a different size on and I changed
them<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.770> these<00:02:32.950> large<00:02:33.280> ones<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.790> ones<00:02:33.820> on

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
them to these large ones the ones on

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.830 
them to these large ones the ones on
now<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.830> as<00:02:35.980> soon<00:02:36.190> as<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.520> change<00:02:36.550> them<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.480> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
now and as soon as I change them to the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.880 
now and as soon as I change them to the
large<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.770> absolutely<00:02:40.470> transformed<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
large it absolutely transformed the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.140 
large it absolutely transformed the
sound<00:02:42.450> now<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:44.050> going<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.230> differ<00:02:44.650> between

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
sound now it's going to differ between

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.760 
sound now it's going to differ between
person<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.270> person<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.110> might<00:02:47.350> get<00:02:47.709> a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
person to person so you might get a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.320 
person to person so you might get a
better<00:02:47.920> result<00:02:48.160> with<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.490> small<00:02:48.819> one<00:02:49.030> or<00:02:49.240> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
better result with a small one or the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.150 
better result with a small one or the
medium<00:02:49.660> one<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.410> point<00:02:50.650> I'm<00:02:50.830> trying<00:02:50.860> to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
medium one but the point I'm trying to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.220 
medium one but the point I'm trying to
make<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.730> when<00:02:52.480> these<00:02:52.690> were<00:02:52.900> fitted

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
make is that when these were fitted

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.670 
make is that when these were fitted
properly<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.980> was<00:02:54.670> getting<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:55.150> lot<00:02:55.810> more<00:02:55.840> bass<00:02:56.290> a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
properly I was getting a lot more bass a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.490 
properly I was getting a lot more bass a
lot<00:02:57.100> more<00:02:57.280> detail<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.360> really<00:02:58.780> quite<00:02:59.110> liked

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
getting in all those different colors is

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.870 
getting in all those different colors is
quite<00:03:29.200> appealing<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.610> younger

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
quite appealing to the younger

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.449 
quite appealing to the younger
generation<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.860> certainly<00:03:32.860> if<00:03:32.980> you've<00:03:33.310> got

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
generation and certainly if you've got

colored<00:03:33.850> iPods<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:34.570> can<00:03:34.690> probably<00:03:34.900> get<00:03:35.110> a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
colored iPods you can probably get a

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.100 
colored iPods you can probably get a
shader<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.860> match<00:03:36.130> your<00:03:36.519> iPod<00:03:37.030> as<00:03:37.180> well<00:03:37.360> so

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
shader to match your iPod as well so

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
really really nice pretty good price I

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.440 
really really nice pretty good price I
think<00:03:42.190> they<00:03:42.459> could<00:03:42.610> be<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.790> little<00:03:42.940> bit<00:03:43.090> cheaper

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
think they could be a little bit cheaper

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.600 
think they could be a little bit cheaper
maybe<00:03:43.660> under<00:03:44.260> 10<00:03:44.470> pound<00:03:44.769> in<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:44.950> UK<00:03:45.370> would<00:03:45.519> be

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
maybe under 10 pound in the UK would be

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.100 
maybe under 10 pound in the UK would be
a<00:03:45.640> good<00:03:45.790> selling<00:03:46.150> price<00:03:46.390> for<00:03:46.660> these<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:47.019> if

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
a good selling price for these but if

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.770 
a good selling price for these but if
you<00:03:47.170> shop<00:03:47.350> around<00:03:47.380> who<00:03:48.250> knows<00:03:48.519> just<00:03:49.299> remember
