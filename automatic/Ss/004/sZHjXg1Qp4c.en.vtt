to pull red makes murder to maximize the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.940 
to pull red makes murder to maximize the
use<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.369> my<00:01:28.990> passive<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.560> want<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.770> start

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
use of my passive and you want to start

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.740 
use of my passive and you want to start
on<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.310> red<00:01:31.520> itself<00:01:31.850> now<00:01:32.030> I'm<00:01:32.150> smiting<00:01:32.630> this

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
on the red itself now I'm smiting this

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.990 
on the red itself now I'm smiting this
for<00:01:32.930> sure<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.860> this<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.100> like<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.610> best<00:01:34.729> way<00:01:34.940> to

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
for sure so this is like the best way to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.760 
for sure so this is like the best way to
really<00:01:35.180> do<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:36.049> start<00:01:36.260> right<00:01:36.409> about<00:01:36.500> there

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
really do it to start right about there

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.960 
really do it to start right about there
because<00:01:36.920> it's<00:01:37.100> faster<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:37.640> can<00:01:37.670> get<00:01:37.820> it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
because it's faster you can get it

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.130 
because it's faster you can get it
faster<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:38.390> can<00:01:38.450> use<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.810> faster<00:01:39.080> is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
faster you can use it the faster is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.750 
faster you can use it the faster is
going<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.320> be<00:01:39.380> back<00:01:39.500> off<00:01:39.710> cooldown<00:01:39.920> everything

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
going to be back off cooldown everything

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.200 
going to be back off cooldown everything
like<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:40.909> now<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.430> took<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.610> lot<00:01:43.790> bit<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.090> damage

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
like that now I took a lot bit of damage

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.539 
like that now I took a lot bit of damage
there<00:01:44.540> but<00:01:44.810> hopefully<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.500> can<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.799> okay<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.130> on

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
there but hopefully I can be okay so on

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.340
