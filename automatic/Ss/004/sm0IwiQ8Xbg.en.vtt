00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.339 
nail on that center line when we snapped

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.970 
nail on that center line when we snapped
that<00:00:31.609> well<00:00:32.570> about<00:00:33.020> eight<00:00:33.230> or<00:00:33.350> nine<00:00:33.379> inches<00:00:33.739> up

I threw the other end on a garbage can

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.080 
I threw the other end on a garbage can
15<00:01:18.290> feet<00:01:18.560> away<00:01:18.649> so<00:01:18.799> you<00:01:19.369> don't<00:01:19.670> bend<00:01:20.030> your

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
15 feet away so you don't bend your

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.389 
15 feet away so you don't bend your
tubing<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.110> just<00:01:21.320> grind<00:01:21.590> or<00:01:22.070> nice<00:01:22.189> and

or that grind ended I just made a mark

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.920 
or that grind ended I just made a mark
that<00:01:30.229> way<00:01:30.439> I<00:01:30.820> can<00:01:31.820> measure<00:01:31.969> this<00:01:32.210> distance<00:01:32.270> and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
that way I can measure this distance and

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.560 
that way I can measure this distance and
transfer<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.740> my<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.759> my<00:01:34.909> right<00:01:35.119> side<00:01:35.360> of

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
transfer it to my to my right side of

transfer it to my to my right side of
the<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.469> right<00:01:36.649> long<00:01:36.860> run<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> other<00:01:37.460> side

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
the the right long run to the other side

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.050 
the the right long run to the other side
of<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.790> fuselage<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.350> one<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.920> cut<00:01:40.460> just

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
of the fuselage so this one I I cut just

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.029 
of the fuselage so this one I I cut just
set<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.479> side<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:41.990> take<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.590> next<00:01:42.860> one<00:01:43.009> I

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
set it to the side I take the next one I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.999 
set it to the side I take the next one I
shove<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.549> in<00:01:43.670> go<00:01:43.939> to<00:01:43.969> the<00:01:44.090> nail<00:01:44.439> okay<00:01:45.439> but

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
shove it in go to the nail okay but

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.109 
shove it in go to the nail okay but

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
instead of putting the board on this

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.560 
instead of putting the board on this
side<00:01:47.390> I<00:01:47.420> flip<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.729> remember<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.759> nail<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.270> about

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
side I flip it remember a nail is about
