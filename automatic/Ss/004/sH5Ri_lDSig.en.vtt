first of first of all you don't have any
registration<00:00:53.420> second<00:00:54.420> part<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:56.550> color<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149

very<00:00:57.539> fail<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.699> failed<00:01:00.090> i<00:01:00.300> think<00:01:01.280> yeah<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.460> can

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
very fail so failed i think yeah we can

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.380 
very fail so failed i think yeah we can
make<00:01:03.350> different<00:01:04.350> between<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.670> model<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
make different between this model and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.460 
make different between this model and
the<00:01:06.750> model<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:08.330> tyrants<00:01:10.430> one<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> four<00:01:11.850> hundred

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
the model of tyrants one to four hundred

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.469 
the model of tyrants one to four hundred
this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> scale<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.340> four<00:01:14.700> hundred<00:01:17.479> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this is a scale one four hundred and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.830 
this is a scale one four hundred and
yeah<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.650> think<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.640> unboxing<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.210> video<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
yeah I think we unboxing this video and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.620 
yeah I think we unboxing this video and
then<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.520> make<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.790> different<00:01:24.360> between

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
then we can make it different between

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:38.170 
then we can make it different between
this<00:01:25.409> model<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.890> smaller<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:36.570> looks<00:01:36.840> nice<00:01:37.110> but
