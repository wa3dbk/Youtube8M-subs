00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.830
 very good in this video we present you 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:10.070
 how to do to be with paper 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:15.650
 the materials you use we know 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:18.880
 Newspaper a deep container other 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.130
 deep bowl with water 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.870
 a colander 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.560
 scissors and white glue 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.560
 all right 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.619
 we take a newspaper sheet 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.239
 and we will have to cut strips 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.810
 It depends on the amount I want to make 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.180
 the pasta will be the strips of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.180
 protector me now 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.479
 we counted small pieces 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.750
 always reporting 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.590
 that depends the amount we want 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:40.310
 make pasta like this will be the amount of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.310
 pieces of newspaper that we will put 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.540
 we submerge them 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.040
 what you have to do is wait 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.310
 the minimum you have to wait for 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.070
 totally soften is one day 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.920
 I recommend that they use boiled water to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.920
 that the process is a little faster 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.100
 as you can see here I already have a little 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.710
 newspaper 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.920
 you can see that it is already a little 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.370
 Undone 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.400
 and what we have to do now is 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.180
 drain 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.180
 a little 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.010
 to seep 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.230
 well we put from the other container and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.230
 we take a little more 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.290
 also to discover it you can use 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.760
 a strainer blanket to make a little 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.760
 easier work 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.360
 Well now how we will not occupy 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.970
 we can make the newspapers 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.310
 lawyers 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:30.480
 well now what we should do 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.480
 is stir glue to the mix 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.879
 well now we will have to mix 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.080
 well mixed 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.090
 because you do not feel many balls of 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.980
 newspaper until you feel 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.980
 really a pasta 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:12.440
 well I think it 's enough 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:16.700
 and that's how it is manufactured 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.260
 the newspaper pulp or it also 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.450
 you can call it papier mache this 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:28.150
 product is that we have manufactured 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:31.150
 now it can be useful for many 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
