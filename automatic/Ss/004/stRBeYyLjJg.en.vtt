00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone and the room is approaching the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.740
 final goal with respect to countries 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.500
 hosts we're at the 25th pilot so after 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.790
 he will remain the 26th and the 27th so there I 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.740
 put me on it I show you where it is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.420
 on the map 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.010
 it's exactly here so wait i've 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.420
 some zooms for you to see 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.039
 so there is an alignment you see well 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.750
 you put yourself in the same way so 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.330
 the right arrow is gone I think 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.039
 that it's going to be a bird which I know 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.269
 not or then a terrestrial animal in all 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.269
 case it can not be a marine animal 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.969
 expect we'll first see how I 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.280
 will transform me yeah that's it 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:48.899
 birds and it's a raven and I'm 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.570
 a raven a raven ok so according to this 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.079
 that I understood there would be nine sailors 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.410
 9 terrestrial and 9 birds we're going to say that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.410
 like that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:10.619
 beat again you have to accept 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:13.229
 hockey plus a raven at night to very 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.470
 visible to him too is Cyprus too 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.770
 classy when you make r2 a small village 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:26.580
 there it seems to me I seem to have seen a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:29.850
 something that shines hun sen bang meal 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.159
 crash here huh we're going to try the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.560
 challenge of the last time shit I 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.409
 tried to land on a truck or on 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.590
 a vehicle 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:48.540
 except that it's the highway where train 4 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.430
 8-bit rail tram tram it 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.380
 history is the story under this train 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.880
 there there there there there will ben good I have done 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.229
 because it did not work 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.420
 so my brief we can not ask on 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.530
 the train does not matter to a vehicle 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.259
 and then no 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.300
 in reality it is very difficult to 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.910
 stabilize a bird it does not look like 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.350
 it looks like it's really simple 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.950
 and I assure you that does not turn 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.120
 live is there I can not ask myself they 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.800
 go way too much half time so what 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.489
 I will do if I will try to 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.180
 ask on this vehicle in addition it is 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.180
 in a petrol station 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.810
 come on 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.420
 and ben no I had seen a vehicle 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.600
 behind no I think it was a 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.950
 basic vehicle no no and that's it 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.220
 everything for this video I tell you to everything 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.850
 on time 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.850
 ciao
