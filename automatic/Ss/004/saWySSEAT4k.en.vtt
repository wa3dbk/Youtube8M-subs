00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.920
 very good girls or good guys I am 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.479
 net, how are you all doing well? 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.610
 today I tell you great news about 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.950
 xbox one and it is that you can unlock 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.559
 more power in it microsoft can 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.049
 unlock an extra potential of power 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.840
 of the processing of the making of the gpu of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.000
 xbox one for the developers to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.170
 use in your favor as explained 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.970
 eurogamer there is 10% of that 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.109
 processing that will go to kinect 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.629
 and applications leaving a 118 teraflops 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.969
 for games instead of the 131 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.059
 originals through the update 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.710
 of the company because it can offer this 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.089
 10% lost from Microsoft 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.489
 they contemplate a scenario in which it is 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.949
 possible without having to compromise the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.049
 functionality of the console is to say that 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.920
 in the full eurogamer article it 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.289
 explains also 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.199
 what is it like today xbox 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.000
 one so that I get to do the 1080p 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.890
 the developers then need 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.250
 optimize performance much more 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.049
 since the console has 16 robots 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.000
 instead of the 32 that have 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.090
 playstation 4 to make comparison 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.360
 to get more rock they will need 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.030
 greater bandwidth in the ddr3 and the gpu 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.220
 The company has assured that 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.590
 who have balanced their robb at 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.130
 wide band they have for the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.680
 objectives they have in mind 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 another little thing more that I have to say the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.229
 company has also defended that they have 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.570
 built xbox one with a quality one 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.049
 very much higher quality than 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.969
 xbox 360 and they have given so much more 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.390
 freedom to the developers in this 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.909
 Dating scope of this is true 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.740
 and also keep in mind is that 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.750
 It makes me a little bit funny because 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.600
 clear xbox 360 we are talking about a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.620
 console that is already a normal years 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.560
 that they have built it 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.900
 much better and also serve the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.050
 developers on xbox are going to have 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.700
 much more freedom than in xbox 360 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.340
 they have a technical requirement 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.300
 certificate in which they ask that all 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:19.420
 the games have to be at 720p or better 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:22.000
 with 2x antiaging as for example from 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.560
 the quality standards they want 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.360
 that are achieved with the new console is 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.710
 say for the developers are going to 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.180
 have that requirement so nothing 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.660
 guys, I hope you've been interested 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.880
 news xbox one can unlock more 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.440
 power of which has a little kiss to 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.930
 all guys and see you in another video 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.930
 more of this channel until next time
