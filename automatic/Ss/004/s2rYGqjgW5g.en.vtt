00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.639
 contraction of decibels compared to music 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:48.880
 early May against war purpose 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.929
 several concepts of last 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.569

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.520
 the festival-goers so a very very vast 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.410
 the lower than usual at the moment it will be very all the comforts 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.980
 table 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.210
 actually little camped three days it's more cautious so if actually 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.909
 we abuse a little bit of emulators for his biava benefit from this festival 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.409
 the volunteers are 11 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.119
 we could not climb I imagine for an infrastructure like this 5-5 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.870
 anjum of insolence of 60 members then working on the year 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.030

 the capital will be his foot partly covered 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.909
