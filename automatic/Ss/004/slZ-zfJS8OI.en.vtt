00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.600 

so<00:00:00.840> here<00:00:01.140> on<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.439> slide<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:02.040> put<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.280> wider

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
so here on this slide I put a wider

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.840 
so here on this slide I put a wider
variety<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.419> organisms<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:05.009> just<00:00:05.250> look<00:00:05.609> at

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
variety of organisms and just look at

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.240 
variety of organisms and just look at
the<00:00:06.029> incredible<00:00:06.390> beauty<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.379> diversity<00:00:08.069> of

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
the incredible beauty and diversity of

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.540 
the incredible beauty and diversity of
life<00:00:08.900> when<00:00:09.900> these<00:00:10.349> organisms<00:00:10.889> are<00:00:11.219> so

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
life when these organisms are so

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.970 
life when these organisms are so
different<00:00:12.150> from<00:00:12.300> each<00:00:12.450> other<00:00:12.660> how<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.740> even

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
different from each other how do we even

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.240 
different from each other how do we even
begin<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.849> study<00:00:15.240> them<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
begin to study them so this is the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.960 
begin to study them so this is the
science<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.840> classification<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.260> science<00:00:19.770> of

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
science of classification the science of

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.279 
science of classification the science of
grouping<00:00:20.970> organisms<00:00:21.660> based<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.140> their

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
grouping organisms based on their

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.400 
grouping organisms based on their
similarities<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.310> differences<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:25.260> was

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
similarities and differences this was

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.410 
similarities and differences this was
begun<00:00:25.769> by<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> scientist<00:00:26.730> named<00:00:26.910> carolus

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
begun by a scientist named carolus

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.859 
begun by a scientist named carolus
linnaeus<00:00:27.980> he<00:00:28.980> founded<00:00:29.369> taxonomy<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.599> branch

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
linnaeus he founded taxonomy the branch

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.040 
linnaeus he founded taxonomy the branch
of<00:00:31.109> biology<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.949> deals<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.840> grouping<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
of biology that deals with grouping and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.639 
of biology that deals with grouping and
naming<00:00:34.920> organisms<00:00:35.930> he<00:00:36.930> invented<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
naming organisms he invented the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220 
naming organisms he invented the
binomial<00:00:38.399> system<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:39.059> nomenclature<00:00:39.270> or<00:00:40.079> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
binomial system of nomenclature or of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.450 
binomial system of nomenclature or of
naming<00:00:40.500> organisms<00:00:41.960> binomial<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.260> two<00:00:43.530> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
naming organisms binomial for two so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.720 
naming organisms binomial for two so
each<00:00:44.760> organisms<00:00:45.480> name<00:00:46.100> consists<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.190> two

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
each organisms name consists of two

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.610 
each organisms name consists of two
words<00:00:48.649> genus<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> species<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
words genus and species so here are a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.979 
words genus and species so here are a
couple<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.010> examples

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
couple of examples

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.020 
couple of examples
so<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> tiger

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so here the tiger

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.470 
so here the tiger
its<00:00:57.149> scientific<00:00:58.100> latin<00:00:59.100> name<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.699> panthera

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
its scientific latin name is panthera

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.910 
its scientific latin name is panthera
tigris<00:01:01.760> Panthera<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> genus<00:01:03.570> name

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
tigris Panthera is the genus name

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.030 
tigris Panthera is the genus name
tigress<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.400> species<00:01:05.670> name<00:01:06.740> notice<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
tigress is the species name notice that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.359 
tigress is the species name notice that
both<00:01:08.430> names<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.060> italicized<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.340> genus<00:01:11.340> name

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
both names are italicized the genus name

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.000 
both names are italicized the genus name
always<00:01:12.150> begins<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> capital<00:01:12.930> letter<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
always begins with a capital letter the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.859 
always begins with a capital letter the
species<00:01:14.520> name<00:01:14.549> always<00:01:15.060> begins<00:01:15.600> with<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
species name always begins with a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.780 
species name always begins with a
lowercase<00:01:16.350> letter<00:01:17.720> now<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.140> lion<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.920> called

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
lowercase letter now the lion is called

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.600 
lowercase letter now the lion is called
Panthera<00:01:21.509> leo

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
Panthera leo

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
Panthera leo
now<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:24.150> probably<00:01:24.540> already<00:01:24.960> aware<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
now you're probably already aware that a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
now you're probably already aware that a
lion<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> tiger<00:01:27.000> share<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> lot<00:01:28.259> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
lion and a tiger share a lot of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
lion and a tiger share a lot of
similarities<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:29.970> they're<00:01:30.119> also<00:01:30.299> different

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
similarities but they're also different

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.319 
similarities but they're also different
from<00:01:31.079> each<00:01:31.200> other<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.180> their

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
from each other so because of their

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
from each other so because of their
similarities<00:01:34.049> they<00:01:34.409> belong<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> same

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
similarities they belong to the same

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.270 
similarities they belong to the same
genus<00:01:35.909> Panthera<00:01:36.619> but<00:01:37.619> because<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:37.979> their

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
genus Panthera but because of their

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
genus Panthera but because of their
differences<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:39.900> considered

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
differences they are considered

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.569 
differences they are considered
different<00:01:40.770> species<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.470> later<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.770> later<00:01:44.369> in

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
different species and later in later in

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
different species and later in later in
the<00:01:44.729> year<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.210> will<00:01:45.360> learn<00:01:45.570> how<00:01:46.530> scientists

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the year you will learn how scientists

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.740 
the year you will learn how scientists
actually<00:01:47.460> define<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.840> species<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
actually define what a species is so a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
actually define what a species is so a
genus<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.680> species<00:01:53.009> are<00:01:53.930> different<00:01:55.070> taxons

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
genus and a species are different taxons

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.969 
genus and a species are different taxons
different<00:01:57.180> groupings<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.810> organisms<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.799> now

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
different groupings of organisms and now

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.100 
different groupings of organisms and now
let's<00:01:59.369> look<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.909> some<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> bigger

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
let's look at some of the bigger

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.030 
let's look at some of the bigger
groupings<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> all<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.990> life<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:05.009> be

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
groupings so all of life can be

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.199 
groupings so all of life can be
separated<00:02:05.909> into<00:02:06.149> three<00:02:06.719> domains<00:02:07.819> then<00:02:08.819> each

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
separated into three domains then each

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.360 
separated into three domains then each
domain<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:10.110> separated<00:02:10.619> into<00:02:10.739> multiple

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
domain is separated into multiple

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.530 
domain is separated into multiple
kingdoms<00:02:11.849> each<00:02:12.569> Kingdom

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
kingdoms each Kingdom

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.170 
kingdoms each Kingdom
has<00:02:13.780> multiple<00:02:14.290> file<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.799> each<00:02:15.159> file<00:02:15.610> um<00:02:15.879> has

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
has multiple file on each file um has

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.080 
has multiple file on each file um has
multiple<00:02:16.629> classes<00:02:17.230> each<00:02:17.739> class<00:02:18.310> has<00:02:18.670> multiple

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
multiple classes each class has multiple

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.360 
multiple classes each class has multiple
orders<00:02:19.480> each<00:02:19.750> order<00:02:20.200> has<00:02:20.379> multiple<00:02:20.829> families

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
orders each order has multiple families

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.459 
orders each order has multiple families
each<00:02:21.609> family<00:02:22.150> has<00:02:22.299> multiple<00:02:22.719> Genesis<00:02:23.290> and

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
each family has multiple Genesis and

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.259 
each family has multiple Genesis and
each<00:02:24.189> genus<00:02:24.730> has<00:02:24.909> multiple<00:02:25.420> species<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
each genus has multiple species so the

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.530 
each genus has multiple species so the
species<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.650> most<00:02:29.920> specific<00:02:30.540> grouping

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
species is the most specific grouping

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.330 
species is the most specific grouping
like<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.079> said<00:02:32.319> you<00:02:32.470> will<00:02:32.590> learn<00:02:32.769> more<00:02:33.159> about

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
like I said you will learn more about

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.819

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
how we decide which organism should be

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.649

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
single-celled how come there are two

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.260 
single-celled how come there are two
different<00:07:11.240> domains<00:07:12.010> well<00:07:13.010> they<00:07:13.640> used<00:07:14.090> to

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
different domains well they used to

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.750 
different domains well they used to
actually<00:07:14.450> be<00:07:14.870> one<00:07:15.170> group<00:07:15.530> but<00:07:16.430> after

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
actually be one group but after

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.520 
actually be one group but after
scientists<00:07:17.300> started<00:07:17.690> studying<00:07:17.930> more<00:07:18.290> about

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
scientists started studying more about

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.620 
scientists started studying more about
the<00:07:18.680> DNA<00:07:19.190> they<00:07:19.700> discovered<00:07:19.850> that<00:07:20.660> archaea

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:22.630 
the DNA they discovered that archaea

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.240 
the DNA they discovered that archaea
actually<00:07:23.630> share<00:07:23.960> a<00:07:24.200> lot<00:07:24.470> of<00:07:24.500> similarities

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250 
actually share a lot of similarities

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.540 
actually share a lot of similarities
with<00:07:25.280> eukaryote<00:07:26.210> so<00:07:27.110> archaea<00:07:27.770> are<00:07:28.010> in<00:07:28.280> some

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
with eukaryote so archaea are in some

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.630 
with eukaryote so archaea are in some
ways<00:07:28.820> similar<00:07:29.120> to<00:07:29.480> you<00:07:29.810> bacteria<00:07:30.470> and<00:07:30.740> all<00:07:31.430> in

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:31.640 
ways similar to you bacteria and all in

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.970 
ways similar to you bacteria and all in
other<00:07:31.910> ways<00:07:32.180> they're<00:07:32.540> similar<00:07:32.840> to<00:07:33.020> eukaryote

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:33.980 
other ways they're similar to eukaryote

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.480 
other ways they're similar to eukaryote
so<00:07:34.610> that's<00:07:34.910> why<00:07:35.300> this<00:07:36.050> special<00:07:36.590> group<00:07:36.740> gets

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490 
so that's why this special group gets

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.930 
so that's why this special group gets
its<00:07:37.670> own<00:07:37.910> domain<00:07:38.420> and<00:07:39.250> so<00:07:40.250> later<00:07:40.520> you<00:07:40.820> will

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:40.940 
its own domain and so later you will

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.360 
its own domain and so later you will
learn<00:07:41.180> more<00:07:41.540> about<00:07:41.600> the<00:07:42.070> characteristics<00:07:43.070> of

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370 
learn more about the characteristics of

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.250 
learn more about the characteristics of
each<00:07:43.820> of<00:07:44.000> these<00:07:44.150> different<00:07:44.510> types<00:07:45.020> of

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.260 
each of these different types of

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.420 
each of these different types of
organisms<00:07:47.140> so<00:07:48.140> now<00:07:48.350> let's<00:07:48.920> summarize<00:07:49.160> what

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.430 
organisms so now let's summarize what

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.510 
organisms so now let's summarize what
you<00:07:49.880> learn<00:07:50.090> today<00:07:50.530> first<00:07:51.530> we<00:07:51.950> discuss<00:07:52.310> some

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 
you learn today first we discuss some

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.000 
you learn today first we discuss some
vocabulary<00:07:52.880> for<00:07:53.720> the<00:07:53.870> different<00:07:54.230> parts<00:07:54.800> of

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.010 
vocabulary for the different parts of

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.990 
vocabulary for the different parts of
life<00:07:55.900> then<00:07:56.900> you<00:07:57.050> learn<00:07:57.290> about<00:07:57.410> the<00:07:57.650> shared

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 
life then you learn about the shared

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.580 
life then you learn about the shared
characteristics<00:07:59.000> of<00:07:59.240> living<00:07:59.540> organisms<00:07:59.780> and

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:00.590 
characteristics of living organisms and

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.340 
characteristics of living organisms and
then<00:08:01.430> about<00:08:01.640> the<00:08:01.790> science<00:08:02.360> of<00:08:02.540> classifying

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:03.350 
then about the science of classifying

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.010 
then about the science of classifying
and<00:08:03.680> naming<00:08:04.220> organisms<00:08:05.000> based<00:08:05.600> on<00:08:05.840> their

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:06.020 
and naming organisms based on their

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.920 
and naming organisms based on their
similarities<00:08:06.680> and<00:08:06.890> differences<00:08:07.660> so<00:08:08.660> I<00:08:08.720> hope

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:08.930 
similarities and differences so I hope

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.510 
similarities and differences so I hope
you<00:08:09.080> enjoy<00:08:09.380> this<00:08:09.590> lesson<00:08:09.830> and<00:08:10.220> that<00:08:10.370> you're
