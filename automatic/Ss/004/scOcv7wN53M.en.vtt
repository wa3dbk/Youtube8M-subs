get to the meat of this so the best

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.350 
get to the meat of this so the best
location<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> varkids<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> spawn<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
location for the varkids to spawn and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.970 
location for the varkids to spawn and
become<00:00:39.660> remembers<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> farmhouse<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
tundra Express which in case you don't

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
tundra Express which in case you don't
know<00:00:42.719> how<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.020> there<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> faster

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
know how to get there just as a faster

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.979 
know how to get there just as a faster
machine<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> select<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> location<00:00:45.270> within

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
machine you select the location within

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.389 
machine you select the location within
the<00:00:46.050> red<00:00:46.200> circles<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> best<00:00:46.890> area<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.129> get

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the red circles the best area to get

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910 
the red circles the best area to get
them<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.760> evolve<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.360> spawn<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
them to evolve and spawn and with the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.279 
them to evolve and spawn and with the
house<00:00:50.070> nearby<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.050> just

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
house nearby if you want that to just

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.779 
house nearby if you want that to just
get<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> tundra<00:00:52.949> Express<00:00:53.340> normally<00:00:53.699> you

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
get to the tundra Express normally you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
get to the tundra Express normally you
have<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.539> yellow<00:00:54.840> circle<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
have to go to the yellow circle and it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880 
have to go to the yellow circle and it
will<00:00:56.219> be<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.579> longer<00:00:56.760> walk<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
will be a much longer walk so the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.529 
will be a much longer walk so the
strategy<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.579> very<00:00:59.789> simple<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> shoot

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
strategy here is very simple you shoot

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
strategy here is very simple you shoot
only<00:01:00.719> through<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> window<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.920> when<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> get

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
only through the window and when I get

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.889 
only through the window and when I get
the<00:01:02.340> big<00:01:02.579> tooth<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.030> come<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.750> will

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the big tooth to come down they will

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.359 
the big tooth to come down they will
glitch<00:01:04.140> through<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> walls<00:01:04.680> giving<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.189> time

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
glitch through the walls giving you time

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.240 
glitch through the walls giving you time
to<00:01:05.430> shoot<00:01:05.760> them<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.119> bits<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:07.250> damaging

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to shoot them to bits and not damaging

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.280 
to shoot them to bits and not damaging
you<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.909> recommend<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.840> shoot<00:01:10.110> for

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
you at all I recommend a be shoot for

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
you at all I recommend a be shoot for
this<00:01:10.409> because<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:10.950> gives<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
this because it really gives it that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.130 
this because it really gives it that
much<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> image<00:01:11.790> mine<00:01:12.180> gives<00:01:12.420> me<00:01:12.570> four<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> six

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
much the image mine gives me four to six

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.109 
much the image mine gives me four to six
thousand<00:01:13.650> points<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> damage<00:01:14.250> first<00:01:14.909> shot

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
thousand points of damage first shot

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.420 
thousand points of damage first shot
that<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.330> use<00:01:15.570> without<00:01:16.020> draining<00:01:16.229> anything<00:01:16.710> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that I use without draining anything so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.740 
that I use without draining anything so
it<00:01:17.580> might<00:01:17.700> take<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> long<00:01:18.150> time<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it might take a long time for the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
it might take a long time for the
varkids<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.350> evolve<00:01:19.650> into<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> higher<00:01:20.189> levels

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
varkids to evolve into the higher levels

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.270 
varkids to evolve into the higher levels
of<00:01:20.790> patience<00:01:21.630> he<00:01:21.900> rewards<00:01:22.380> guys<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.070> once<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
of patience he rewards guys so once you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.740 
of patience he rewards guys so once you
get<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> ultimate<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.210> pretty<00:01:24.390> much<00:01:24.540> said

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
get the ultimate it's pretty much said

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.179 
get the ultimate it's pretty much said
and<00:01:24.900> done<00:01:25.080> they're<00:01:25.320> very<00:01:25.590> likely<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and done they're very likely going to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.249 
and done they're very likely going to
evolve<00:01:26.490> into<00:01:26.820> rivers<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> time

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
evolve into rivers if you have the time

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
evolve into rivers if you have the time
and<00:01:28.290> you've<00:01:28.619> got<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> patience<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.909> make

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and you've got the patience so just make

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
and you've got the patience so just make
sure<00:01:30.090> you're<00:01:30.299> damaging<00:01:30.720> them<00:01:30.990> constantly<00:01:31.409> so

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
sure you're damaging them constantly so

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
sure you're damaging them constantly so
they<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> greater<00:01:32.460> need<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.970> evolve

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
they have a greater need to evolve

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.749 
they have a greater need to evolve
eventually<00:01:33.960> although<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.040> mostly<00:01:35.189> based<00:01:35.579> on

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
eventually although it's mostly based on

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.880 
eventually although it's mostly based on
chance<00:01:36.030> sometimes<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.110> sometimes<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> don't

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
chance sometimes I do sometimes it don't

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
chance sometimes I do sometimes it don't
is<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.790> they're<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> very<00:01:39.750> fast

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
is if they're going to do it very fast

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.520 
is if they're going to do it very fast
no<00:01:40.860> matter<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:42.030> case<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.380> you've

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
no matter what in my case so as you've

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.560 
no matter what in my case so as you've
seen<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> second<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.340> comes<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:45.060> first<00:01:45.329> one

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
seen a second here comes the first one

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.500 
seen a second here comes the first one
from<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> size<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> big<00:01:46.649> maneuvers

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
from the size of the big maneuvers

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.450 
from the size of the big maneuvers
and<00:01:47.810> why<00:01:48.080> after<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:48.590> comes<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.980> second<00:01:49.430> one

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
and why after that comes the second one

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.070 
and why after that comes the second one
and<00:01:49.730> I<00:01:49.790> was<00:01:49.910> completely<00:01:50.240> surprised<00:01:50.690> because<00:01:50.900> I

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
and I was completely surprised because I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.570 
and I was completely surprised because I
didn't<00:01:51.560> think<00:01:51.620> we<00:01:52.010> would<00:01:52.100> be<00:01:52.250> able<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.490> have

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
didn't think we would be able to have

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.900 
didn't think we would be able to have
facilities<00:01:52.730> in<00:01:53.240> one<00:01:53.480> but<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:54.050> was<00:01:54.530> able<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:54.910> now

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
facilities in one but I was able to now

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.910 
facilities in one but I was able to now
let<00:01:56.060> surprise<00:01:56.450> be<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.870> also<00:01:57.170> helped<00:01:57.470> me<00:01:57.590> most

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
let surprise be and also helped me most

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.620 
let surprise be and also helped me most
where<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.280> situation<00:01:58.460> was<00:01:58.790> aside<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.510> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
where the situation was aside of the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.860 
where the situation was aside of the
invincible<00:01:59.960> removers<00:02:00.860> level<00:02:01.520> 53<00:02:02.150> which<00:02:02.630> both

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
invincible removers level 53 which both

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.750 
invincible removers level 53 which both
of<00:02:03.050> them<00:02:03.170> were<00:02:03.320> because<00:02:04.040> they're<00:02:04.160> so<00:02:04.310> big<00:02:04.580> they

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
of them were because they're so big they

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.280 
of them were because they're so big they
glitched<00:02:05.090> through<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.360> walls<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.900> they<00:02:06.230> were

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
glitched through the walls and they were

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.930 
glitched through the walls and they were
unable<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.740> turn<00:02:07.160> me<00:02:07.310> while<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.520> was<00:02:07.670> inside

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
unable to turn me while I was inside

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.430 
unable to turn me while I was inside
because<00:02:08.210> I<00:02:08.270> really<00:02:08.480> couldn't<00:02:08.600> move<00:02:08.900> but<00:02:09.290> when

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
because I really couldn't move but when

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.950 
because I really couldn't move but when
they<00:02:09.560> had<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.980> get<00:02:10.130> up<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.550> fly<00:02:11.180> away<00:02:11.330> they

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
they had to get up and fly away they

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.360 
they had to get up and fly away they
would<00:02:12.110> be<00:02:12.230> able<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.860> was<00:02:12.980> good<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.280> go

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
would be able to so it was good to go

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.730 
would be able to so it was good to go
otherwise<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.300> loot<00:02:14.630> when<00:02:15.050> they<00:02:15.200> drop<00:02:15.470> it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
otherwise the loot when they drop it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.050 
otherwise the loot when they drop it
would<00:02:15.830> kind<00:02:16.070> of<00:02:16.130> get<00:02:16.250> stuck<00:02:16.580> or<00:02:16.760> just<00:02:16.940> go

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
would kind of get stuck or just go

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.650 
would kind of get stuck or just go
everywhere

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
everywhere

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.600 
everywhere
however<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.170> can't<00:02:18.530> damage<00:02:19.040> them<00:02:19.430> while

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
however you can't damage them while

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.090 
however you can't damage them while
they're<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.030> way<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.110> as<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.590> see<00:02:21.860> me<00:02:22.070> doing

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
they're that way so as you see me doing

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.590 
they're that way so as you see me doing
right<00:02:22.490> here<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:22.910> hewn<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.270> was<00:02:23.420> actually

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
right here I have hewn this was actually

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.000 
right here I have hewn this was actually
trapped<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> walls<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:24.800> have<00:02:24.920> an

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
trapped in the walls and I have an

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.160 
trapped in the walls and I have an
infinity<00:02:25.460> pistol<00:02:25.910> with<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.390> V<00:02:26.660> shoot<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.080> I'm

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
infinity pistol with the V shoot and I'm

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.020 
infinity pistol with the V shoot and I'm
shooting<00:02:27.590> them<00:02:27.740> like<00:02:27.920> crazy<00:02:28.250> as<00:02:28.580> long<00:02:28.910> as

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
shooting them like crazy as long as

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.760 
shooting them like crazy as long as
they're<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.210> there<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.050> recommend<00:02:30.440> those

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
they're in there so I recommend those

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.010 
they're in there so I recommend those
too<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.850> don't<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.300> reload<00:02:32.600> and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
too because you don't have to reload and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.840 
too because you don't have to reload and
you<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.320> always<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.920> extra<00:02:34.370> damage<00:02:34.550> output

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
you have always that extra damage output

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.940 
you have always that extra damage output
and<00:02:35.180> really<00:02:35.870> no<00:02:36.140> one<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.440> damage<00:02:36.740> while

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
and really no one can damage while

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.150 
and really no one can damage while
you're<00:02:37.160> inside<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:37.790> it's<00:02:38.090> really<00:02:38.420> reliable

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
you're inside so it's really reliable

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.030 
you're inside so it's really reliable
strategy<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:41.330> really<00:02:41.840> should<00:02:42.200> take<00:02:42.620> most

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
strategy and you really should take most

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.070 
strategy and you really should take most
other<00:02:43.370> health<00:02:43.820> during<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.540> time<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.050> you

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
other health during this time so you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.050 
other health during this time so you
really<00:02:45.350> should<00:02:45.530> be<00:02:45.620> set<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.640> dude<00:02:46.820> that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
really should be set so the dude that

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.490 
really should be set so the dude that
was<00:02:47.150> plainly<00:02:47.420> if<00:02:47.600> you<00:02:47.690> came<00:02:47.930> back<00:02:48.110> from<00:02:48.290> being

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
was plainly if you came back from being

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.070 
was plainly if you came back from being
afk<00:02:49.040> for<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.490> really<00:02:49.730> long<00:02:49.820> time<00:02:49.880> during<00:02:50.840> this

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
afk for a really long time during this

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.449 
afk for a really long time during this
time<00:02:51.290> then<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> better<00:02:51.860> I'm<00:02:52.070> showing<00:02:52.340> right

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
time then the better I'm showing right

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.820 
time then the better I'm showing right
now<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.660> see<00:02:53.840> how<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.260> house<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.590> really

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
now and you see how this house is really

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.290 
now and you see how this house is really
useful<00:02:55.130> because<00:02:55.160> right<00:02:55.670> when<00:02:55.850> he<00:02:55.940> gets<00:02:56.120> out<00:02:56.270> of

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
useful because right when he gets out of

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.030 
useful because right when he gets out of
the<00:02:56.510> little<00:02:57.080> hideout<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.470> we<00:02:57.740> were<00:02:57.890> in

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the little hideout that we were in

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.460 
the little hideout that we were in
before<00:02:58.150> he<00:02:59.150> goes<00:02:59.330> down<00:02:59.630> right<00:03:00.050> away<00:03:00.200> because

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
before he goes down right away because

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.199 
before he goes down right away because
remember<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.950> attacks<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.640> actually<00:03:01.880> both<00:03:02.030> of

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
remember is attacks and actually both of

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.880 
remember is attacks and actually both of
them<00:03:02.330> do<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:03.230> can<00:03:03.440> take<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.709> down<00:03:03.860> so

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
them do and they can take you down so

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.090 
them do and they can take you down so
fast<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.540> it's<00:03:05.780> really<00:03:06.140> really<00:03:06.530> helpful<00:03:06.830> to

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
fast so it's really really helpful to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.620 
fast so it's really really helpful to
have<00:03:07.190> this<00:03:07.370> house<00:03:07.550> because<00:03:07.940> even<00:03:08.360> if<00:03:08.480> you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
have this house because even if you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.330 
have this house because even if you
don't<00:03:08.780> have<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.020> glitch<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.560> can<00:03:10.010> have

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
don't have the glitch you can have

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.280 
don't have the glitch you can have
protection<00:03:10.940> from<00:03:11.060> their<00:03:11.239> attacks<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.840> do

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
protection from their attacks and do

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.530 
protection from their attacks and do
that<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.680> attack<00:03:12.980> them<00:03:13.220> again<00:03:14.000> he<00:03:14.300> ends<00:03:14.450> up

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
that to attack them again he ends up

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.690 
that to attack them again he ends up
dying<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.200> lot<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.590> times<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.130> did<00:03:16.459> get

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
dying a lot of times but I did get

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.030 
dying a lot of times but I did get
remembered<00:03:17.510> by<00:03:17.690> then<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.200> always<00:03:18.680> is<00:03:18.800> with

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
remembered by then so always is with

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.440 
remembered by then so always is with
more<00:03:19.280> players<00:03:19.520> as<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.090> can<00:03:20.209> see<00:03:20.360> on<00:03:20.420> your

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
more players as you can see on your

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.660 
more players as you can see on your
screen<00:03:20.570> right<00:03:20.900> now<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.170> did<00:03:21.440> destroy<00:03:22.070> both<00:03:22.370> the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
screen right now it did destroy both the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.880 
screen right now it did destroy both the
removers<00:03:23.030> with<00:03:23.239> my<00:03:23.450> infinity<00:03:23.930> pistol<00:03:24.320> I<00:03:24.530> was

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
removers with my infinity pistol I was

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.020 
removers with my infinity pistol I was
kind<00:03:25.070> of<00:03:25.130> harder<00:03:25.430> by<00:03:25.580> then<00:03:25.730> because<00:03:25.880> they

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
kind of harder by then because they

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.150 
kind of harder by then because they
actually<00:03:26.180> went<00:03:26.480> after<00:03:26.690> my<00:03:26.989> body<00:03:27.230> he<00:03:27.950> was

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
actually went after my body he was

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.280 
actually went after my body he was
trying<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.640> hide<00:03:28.880> there<00:03:29.390> in<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.750> hideout<00:03:29.959> and

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
trying to hide there in the hideout and

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.440 
trying to hide there in the hideout and
survive<00:03:30.800> as<00:03:31.310> long<00:03:31.340> as<00:03:31.489> he<00:03:31.640> could<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.090> instead

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
survive as long as he could and instead

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.760 
survive as long as he could and instead
of<00:03:32.510> coming<00:03:32.720> after<00:03:33.110> me<00:03:33.290> which<00:03:33.440> was<00:03:33.650> outside

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
of coming after me which was outside

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.500 
of coming after me which was outside
they<00:03:34.100> actually<00:03:34.340> went<00:03:34.520> for<00:03:34.670> him<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:35.330> actually

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
they actually went for him so I actually

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.090 
they actually went for him so I actually
had<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.870> go<00:03:35.989> on<00:03:36.080> top<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.440> farmhouse<00:03:36.860> and

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
had to go on top of the farmhouse and

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.670 
had to go on top of the farmhouse and
destroy<00:03:37.760> them<00:03:38.000> with<00:03:38.180> my<00:03:38.330> infinity<00:03:38.900> doing<00:03:39.590> as

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
destroy them with my infinity doing as

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.920 
destroy them with my infinity doing as
much<00:03:39.860> damage<00:03:40.070> as<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.340> could<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.209> they<00:03:41.720> both

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
much damage as I could and they both

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.840 
much damage as I could and they both
kind<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:42.350> wore<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.860> same<00:03:43.010> place<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
kind of wore in the same place and the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.340 
kind of wore in the same place and the
loot<00:03:44.060> kind<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.450> just<00:03:44.630> spread<00:03:44.690> around<00:03:45.110> but

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
loot kind of just spread around but

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.320 
loot kind of just spread around but
really<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.650> good<00:03:45.830> stuff<00:03:46.190> should<00:03:46.880> be<00:03:46.910> right

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
really the good stuff should be right

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.360 
really the good stuff should be right
where<00:03:47.660> they<00:03:47.870> wore<00:03:48.140> their<00:03:48.320> bodies<00:03:48.680> but<00:03:49.220> they're

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
where they wore their bodies but they're

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.400 
where they wore their bodies but they're
so<00:03:49.520> big<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:49.910> can't<00:03:50.120> really<00:03:50.300> go<00:03:50.540> under<00:03:51.230> them

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
so big you can't really go under them

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.720 
so big you can't really go under them
and<00:03:51.590> try<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.739> find<00:03:51.920> them<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.190> have<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.459> kind<00:03:52.700> of

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
and try to find them you have to kind of

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.460 
and try to find them you have to kind of
leave<00:03:52.910> them<00:03:53.060> up<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.450> come<00:03:53.690> back<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:54.140> find<00:03:54.350> the

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
leave them up and come back to find the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.069 
leave them up and come back to find the
good<00:03:54.620> loot<00:03:54.830> which<00:03:55.160> we<00:03:55.340> didn't<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.600> we<00:03:56.930> did
