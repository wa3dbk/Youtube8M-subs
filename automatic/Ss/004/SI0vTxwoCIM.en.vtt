00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
common let's have a look at how to play

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.310 
common let's have a look at how to play
it<00:01:12.159> using<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.700> G<00:01:12.940> chord<00:01:12.970> as<00:01:13.780> our<00:01:14.650> example<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
it using a G chord as our example the

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.820 
it using a G chord as our example the
demo<00:01:17.650> first<00:01:17.890> of<00:01:18.160> all

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.690 

down<00:01:21.460> down<00:01:22.090> up<00:01:22.290> down<00:01:23.290> down

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.540 

and<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.439> account<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:30.390> 1/2<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.689> and<00:01:32.320> for

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.969 

you

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.179 

now<00:01:39.759> this<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.930> trickiest<00:01:41.350> remaining<00:01:41.950> so

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
now this is the trickiest remaining so

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.660 
now this is the trickiest remaining so
far<00:01:43.229> technically<00:01:44.229> because<00:01:44.920> we're<00:01:45.399> not

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
far technically because we're not

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.399 
far technically because we're not
playing<00:01:46.030> on<00:01:46.329> beat<00:01:46.570> three<00:01:46.960> when<00:01:47.229> we're<00:01:47.350> not

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
playing on beat three when we're not

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.800 
playing on beat three when we're not
playing<00:01:47.679> on<00:01:47.799> a<00:01:47.829> main<00:01:48.189> beat<00:01:48.549> things<00:01:49.240> go<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.539> bit

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
playing on a main beat things go a bit

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.419 
playing on a main beat things go a bit
weird<00:01:50.079> with<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.469> strumming<00:01:50.679> hat<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.219> can

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
weird with the strumming hat and it can

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.510 
weird with the strumming hat and it can
strum<00:01:52.179> in<00:01:52.270> hand<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.600> should<00:01:52.659> say<00:01:52.960> it's<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:54.280> a

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
strum in hand I should say it's it's a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.520 
strum in hand I should say it's it's a
strange<00:01:55.000> feel<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.020> have<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.200> get

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
strange feel to it that you have to get

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.350 
strange feel to it that you have to get
used<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.890> because<00:01:57.130> we<00:01:57.310> really<00:01:57.670> want<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.970> play

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
used to because we really want to play

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.210 
used to because we really want to play
on<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.960> beat<00:01:59.200> it's<00:01:59.560> sort<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.009> natural

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
on the beat it's sort of a natural

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.859 
on the beat it's sort of a natural
instinct<00:02:00.970> because<00:02:01.149> that's<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.450> strongest

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
instinct because that's the strongest

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.859 
instinct because that's the strongest
pull<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.549> we<00:02:03.880> have<00:02:04.119> this<00:02:04.329> thing<00:02:04.539> called<00:02:04.600> a

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
pull and so we have this thing called a

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.389 
pull and so we have this thing called a
tie<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.469> well<00:02:05.829> in<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.369> diagram<00:02:06.850> where<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:09.099> two

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
tie as well in the diagram where the two

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.990 
tie as well in the diagram where the two
and<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.420> plus<00:02:10.810> sign<00:02:11.019> next<00:02:11.049> to<00:02:11.380> two<00:02:11.760> carries<00:02:12.760> on

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
and the plus sign next to two carries on

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.410 
and the plus sign next to two carries on
and<00:02:13.299> he<00:02:14.140> adds<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:15.099> third<00:02:15.400> beat<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:16.390> that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
and he adds the third beat to it so that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.110 
and he adds the third beat to it so that
second<00:02:17.079> the<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.620> note<00:02:17.829> that<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.069> written<00:02:18.549> over

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
second the the note that is written over

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.710 
second the the note that is written over
beat<00:02:19.360> three<00:02:19.810> isn't<00:02:20.470> played<00:02:21.130> but<00:02:21.579> two<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.360> and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
beat three isn't played but two and and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.780 
beat three isn't played but two and and
the<00:02:23.049> three<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:23.560> added<00:02:23.950> together<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.459> make<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
the three get added together to make a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.759 
the three get added together to make a
beat<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.510> reason<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.930> we<00:02:26.110> can't<00:02:26.349> have<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> whole

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
beat the reason is we can't have a whole

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.250 
beat the reason is we can't have a whole
beat<00:02:27.010> going<00:02:27.370> over<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.730> bar<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.329> that's<00:02:28.630> why

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
beat going over the bar so that's why

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.620 
beat going over the bar so that's why
the<00:02:29.319> diagram<00:02:29.950> looks<00:02:30.220> as<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.549> does<00:02:30.730> but<00:02:31.329> you<00:02:31.420> can

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
the diagram looks as it does but you can

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.690 
the diagram looks as it does but you can
just<00:02:32.319> pay<00:02:32.500> attention<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.040> if<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.250> want<00:02:33.459> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
just pay attention to if you want the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.740 
just pay attention to if you want the
down<00:02:34.030> down<00:02:34.780> up<00:02:34.810> or<00:02:35.440> down<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.819> DS<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.329> use<00:02:37.510> and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
down down up or down the DS and use and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.870 
down down up or down the DS and use and
the<00:02:37.810> arrows<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.560> get<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> feel<00:02:39.040> for<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.640> hand

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
the arrows to get a feel for the hand

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.800 
the arrows to get a feel for the hand
motion<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.459> we<00:02:42.610> don't<00:02:42.790> want<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.000> loop<00:02:43.180> too<00:02:43.540> much

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
motion so we don't want to loop too much

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.840 
motion so we don't want to loop too much
but<00:02:44.079> just<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.410> sort<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.739> over<00:02:45.100> exaggerate<00:02:45.670> it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
but just to sort of over exaggerate it

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.190 
but just to sort of over exaggerate it
down<00:02:46.150> down<00:02:46.989> up

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
down down up

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.589 
down down up
down<00:02:48.830> we<00:02:49.250> need<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> keep<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.910> hand<00:02:50.150> motion<00:02:50.480> go

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
down we need to keep that hand motion go

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.100 
down we need to keep that hand motion go
down<00:02:50.870> down<00:02:51.319> up<00:02:51.379> up<00:02:51.860> down<00:02:52.489> down<00:02:52.819> down<00:02:53.599> up<00:02:53.900> up

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
the loop down up up down will do is

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.059 
the loop down up up down will do is
totally<00:03:01.550> fine<00:03:01.879> and<00:03:02.440> let's<00:03:03.440> have<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.680> go<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:03.980> that

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
totally fine and let's have a go at that

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.479 
totally fine and let's have a go at that

I let's have a go it down down up up
down<00:03:19.790> in<00:03:20.470> two<00:03:21.470> three<00:03:22.160> four

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.050 

pause<00:03:40.660> there<00:03:41.050> I'm<00:03:42.040> going<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.430> demo<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:42.970> a

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
pause there I'm going to demo it just a

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.880 
pause there I'm going to demo it just a
little<00:03:43.270> bit<00:03:43.390> slower<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.140> then<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.440> little<00:03:44.680> bit

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
little bit slower and then a little bit

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.380 
little bit slower and then a little bit
quicker<00:03:45.130> than<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.790> first<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.240> all<00:03:46.330> a

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
quicker than that so first of all a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.030 
quicker than that so first of all a
little<00:03:46.630> bit<00:03:46.840> slower<00:03:47.140> if<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.470> want<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.680> join<00:03:47.830> in

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
little bit slower if you want to join in

00:03:48.040 --> 00:04:04.070 
little bit slower if you want to join in
feel<00:03:48.340> free<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.900> three<00:03:49.900> four

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.960 

and<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.650> little<00:04:04.920> bit<00:04:05.070> faster<00:04:05.400> two<00:04:06.390> three<00:04:06.930> four

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
and a little bit faster two three four

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:21.770 
and a little bit faster two three four
you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.680 

so<00:04:22.780> this<00:04:22.990> strumming<00:04:23.440> pattern<00:04:23.860> is<00:04:24.270> mainly<00:04:25.270> used

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
so this strumming pattern is mainly used
