00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and flowed west we need three generator

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:27.050 
and flowed west we need three generator
three<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.049> them<00:02:20.900> do<00:02:23.870> like<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:26.060> three

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
three of them do like this three

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.860 
three of them do like this three
earnings<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:28.260> up

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870

earnings it up
i'm<00:02:30.379> going<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.709> write<00:02:31.390> looks<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.480> bit<00:02:32.599> long

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
i'm going to write looks a bit long

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.920 
i'm going to write looks a bit long
would<00:02:33.170> i<00:02:33.549> want<00:02:34.549> to<00:02:34.730> show<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.000> how<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.629> do<00:02:35.810> it

would i want to show you how to do it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:51.330 
would i want to show you how to do it
right<00:02:39.730> one<00:02:41.409> we<00:02:42.409> gotta<00:02:42.650> make<00:02:42.830> some<00:02:43.010> very<00:02:43.099> first

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.530 

so<00:02:52.340> like<00:02:52.879> that<00:02:53.349> for<00:02:54.349> the<00:02:54.440> bad<00:02:54.560> box<00:02:55.150> yeah<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.329> can

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
so like that for the bad box yeah we can

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.710 
so like that for the bad box yeah we can
make<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.780> bad<00:02:57.019> box<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:58.090> think<00:03:00.940> let<00:03:01.940> cupcake<00:03:02.690> on

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
make a bad box I think let cupcake on

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.000 
make a bad box I think let cupcake on
top<00:03:04.209> three<00:03:05.209> batteries<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.230> there<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.680> go<00:03:06.739> I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
top three batteries and there you go I

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.509 
top three batteries and there you go I
bed<00:03:07.430> looks<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:09.590> good<00:03:09.799> for<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> setup<00:03:12.519> which

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
bed looks this good for a setup which

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.670 
bed looks this good for a setup which
player<00:03:13.819> which<00:03:14.120> way<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.569> place<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.200> that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
player which way you place it that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.710 
player which way you place it that
little<00:03:15.890> hole<00:03:16.129> is<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.489> output<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.569> you

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
little hole is the output so as you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.440 
little hole is the output so as you
wanna<00:03:17.900> as<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:19.040> machine<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.670> do<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.909> or<00:03:20.090> something

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
wanna as a machine to do it or something

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.180 
wanna as a machine to do it or something
else<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:20.989> need<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.680> hole<00:03:22.129> in<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.940> back<00:03:24.190> got

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
else you need that hole in the back got

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.789 
else you need that hole in the back got
all<00:03:25.310> refined<00:03:25.760> iron<00:03:26.000> together<00:03:26.420> we<00:03:27.379> are<00:03:27.409> going

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
all refined iron together we are going

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.120 
all refined iron together we are going
to<00:03:27.890> make<00:03:28.329> us<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:30.549> generator<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:33.010> generally<00:03:34.010> you
