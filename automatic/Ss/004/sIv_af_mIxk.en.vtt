00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
throw it in your purse that looks like

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
throw it in your purse that looks like
it<00:01:30.180> belongs<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.259> far<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.250> price

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it belongs there as far as the price

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.480 
it belongs there as far as the price
they're<00:01:33.570> very<00:01:33.689> similar<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.229> price<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.950> target

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
they're very similar in price at target

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
they're very similar in price at target
the<00:01:35.850> Revlon<00:01:36.450> lip<00:01:36.479> butters<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.140> about<00:01:37.470> 650<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the Revlon lip butters are about 650 and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.780 
the Revlon lip butters are about 650 and
the<00:01:39.570> Maybelline<00:01:40.170> ones<00:01:40.380> are<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.520> six

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the Maybelline ones are I think six

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.760 
the Maybelline ones are I think six
dollars<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:43.079> about<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.290> 50<00:01:43.619> cent

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
dollars so it's about a 50 cent

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
dollars so it's about a 50 cent
difference<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.329> say<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
difference so I would say that the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
difference so I would say that the
Maybelline<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.530> does<00:01:46.799> win<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.310> course<00:01:47.520> in

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
Maybelline one does win of course in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
Revlon one then maybe it's worth the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.139

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.940 
really looks more like a lipstick than a
balm<00:03:56.500> texture<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:01.329> yeah<00:04:01.569> I<00:04:01.600> mean<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.590> can<00:04:02.739> see

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
balm texture so yeah I mean you can see

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.949 
balm texture so yeah I mean you can see
that<00:04:03.130> these<00:04:03.250> have<00:04:03.430> very<00:04:03.760> similar<00:04:04.030> finishes<00:04:04.750> I

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
that these have very similar finishes I

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.620 
that these have very similar finishes I
will<00:04:05.470> say<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.160> Revlon<00:04:06.910> lip<00:04:06.940> butters<00:04:07.359> do

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
will say that the Revlon lip butters do

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.610 
will say that the Revlon lip butters do
have<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.810> little<00:04:07.989> bit<00:04:08.109> more<00:04:08.319> of<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.470> metallic

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
have a little bit more of a metallic

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.420 
have a little bit more of a metallic
finish<00:04:09.280> but<00:04:09.819> it's<00:04:10.000> really<00:04:10.239> barely<00:04:10.630> there<00:04:11.049> so<00:04:11.889> I

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
finish but it's really barely there so I

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.009 
finish but it's really barely there so I
don't<00:04:12.790> even<00:04:12.910> know<00:04:13.090> if<00:04:13.209> it's<00:04:13.329> worth<00:04:13.480> mentioning

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
don't even know if it's worth mentioning

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.770 
don't even know if it's worth mentioning
or<00:04:14.139> not<00:04:14.319> but<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.459> think<00:04:15.910> that<00:04:16.329> both<00:04:16.510> of<00:04:16.539> these

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
or not but I think that both of these

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.620 
or not but I think that both of these
are<00:04:16.989> awesome<00:04:17.200> products<00:04:17.979> if<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:19.000> had<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.600> pick

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
are awesome products if I had to pick

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.810 
are awesome products if I had to pick
one<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:20.289> would<00:04:20.650> say<00:04:20.830> that<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.039> do<00:04:21.130> prefer<00:04:21.519> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
one I would say that I do prefer the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.490 
one I would say that I do prefer the
color<00:04:22.030> whispers<00:04:22.479> but<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.140> might<00:04:23.289> just<00:04:23.320> be

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
color whispers but that might just be

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.110 
color whispers but that might just be
the<00:04:23.590> colors<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.010> I've<00:04:24.280> tried<00:04:24.520> in<00:04:24.550> them

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
the colors that I've tried in them

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.820 
the colors that I've tried in them
so<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.479> think<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.290> they're<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> little<00:04:26.620> bit

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
so I think that they're a little bit

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.710 
so I think that they're a little bit
cheaper<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.520> like<00:04:27.760> that<00:04:27.940> their<00:04:28.120> slender<00:04:28.419> and

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
cheaper I like that their slender and

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.659 
cheaper I like that their slender and
you<00:04:28.840> can<00:04:28.990> pack<00:04:29.199> it<00:04:29.380> pack<00:04:29.770> them<00:04:30.040> into<00:04:30.310> your

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
you can pack it pack them into your

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.030 
you can pack it pack them into your
makeup<00:04:31.540> collection<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.560> don't<00:04:32.830> know<00:04:32.889> get

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
makeup collection and I don't know get

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.820 
makeup collection and I don't know get
lots<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.460> them<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:33.639> there<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.389> I<00:04:35.350> really<00:04:35.680> like

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
lots of them in there and I really like

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.219 
lots of them in there and I really like
the<00:04:35.949> color<00:04:36.160> selection<00:04:36.690> but<00:04:37.690> for<00:04:37.840> both<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:38.139> them

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
the color selection but for both of them

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.740 
the color selection but for both of them
they<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.440> have<00:04:38.770> 20<00:04:39.130> different<00:04:39.340> shades<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:40.240> went

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
they do have 20 different shades I went

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.600 
they do have 20 different shades I went
online<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.050> checked<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:41.590> both<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.190> them<00:04:42.430> have

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
online and checked so both of them have

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.159 
online and checked so both of them have
20<00:04:42.970> different<00:04:43.120> shades<00:04:43.419> so<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.870> lot<00:04:44.110> of

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
20 different shades so that is a lot of

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.409 
20 different shades so that is a lot of
color<00:04:44.380> selection<00:04:44.919> for<00:04:45.070> both<00:04:45.280> but<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.000> just<00:04:46.240> feel

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
color selection for both but I just feel

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.870 
color selection for both but I just feel
like<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.260> Maybelline<00:04:47.800> ones<00:04:48.010> I<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:48.669> kind<00:04:48.820> of
