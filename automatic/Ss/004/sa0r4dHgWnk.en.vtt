you to pick one guy he will pick the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.940 
you to pick one guy he will pick the
other<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:02.120> would<00:03:02.300> like<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.510> gauge<00:03:02.950> if

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
other and I just would like to gauge if

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.710 
other and I just would like to gauge if
I<00:03:04.160> even<00:03:04.370> see<00:03:04.670> how<00:03:04.760> much<00:03:04.970> man<00:03:05.180> he's<00:03:05.360> really

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
I even see how much man he's really

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.420 
I even see how much man he's really
improved<00:03:05.840> as<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.740> know<00:03:06.860> over<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.400> years

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
improved as you know over the years

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.220 
improved as you know over the years
because<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.030> think<00:03:08.240> he's<00:03:08.450> much<00:03:08.660> better<00:03:08.870> fighter

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
because I think he's much better fighter

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.680 
because I think he's much better fighter
better<00:03:09.800> now<00:03:10.070> than<00:03:10.250> he<00:03:10.370> was<00:03:10.400> when<00:03:11.270> they<00:03:11.450> fought

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
better now than he was when they fought

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.950 
better now than he was when they fought
but<00:03:11.960> when<00:03:12.740> I<00:03:13.160> think<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.210> a<00:03:14.240> very<00:03:14.360> sellable

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
but when I think it's a very sellable

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.530 
but when I think it's a very sellable
fight<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.860> fight<00:03:16.370> they<00:03:16.580> would<00:03:16.790> have<00:03:17.210> a<00:03:17.240> huge

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
fight and a fight they would have a huge

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.170 
fight and a fight they would have a huge
audience<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:18.560> me<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.710> can<00:03:19.130> fight<00:03:19.400> anybody<00:03:19.670> you
