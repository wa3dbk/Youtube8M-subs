I've decided that my foil stamping tools

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.440 
I've decided that my foil stamping tools
just<00:01:56.830> aren't<00:01:57.310> going<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:57.580> cut<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.759> I'm<00:01:58.210> going<00:01:58.390> to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
just aren't going to cut it I'm going to

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.430 
just aren't going to cut it I'm going to
have<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.660> figure<00:01:58.780> something<00:01:58.930> else<00:01:59.229> out<00:01:59.610> so

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
have to figure something else out so

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.609 
have to figure something else out so
anyway<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:04.600> worried<00:02:04.960> about<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.320> book

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
anyway I was worried about this book

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.870 
anyway I was worried about this book
being<00:02:05.979> small<00:02:07.410> but<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.679> compared<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.399> novel

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
being small but I compared it to a novel

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.080 
being small but I compared it to a novel
that<00:02:10.030> I<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.420> found<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.500> shelf<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.940> got

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
that I I found on the shelf just got

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.430 
that I I found on the shelf just got
done<00:02:13.209> reading<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:15.580> really<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.060> very<00:02:16.510> close

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
done reading and it really is very close

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.930 
done reading and it really is very close
and<00:02:17.620> dimension<00:02:19.019> not<00:02:20.019> thickness<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.489> but<00:02:21.549> uh

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
and dimension not thickness and but uh

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.970 
and dimension not thickness and but uh
as<00:02:22.900> far<00:02:22.959> as<00:02:24.239> link<00:02:25.239> vs<00:02:25.690> with<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:26.140> very<00:02:26.620> close

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
as far as link vs with it's very close

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.720 
as far as link vs with it's very close
