together facing towards the ceiling the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.780 
together facing towards the ceiling the
other<00:01:11.930> way<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.710> we're<00:01:13.040> going<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.280> turn<00:01:13.550> from

like this what we're doing is we're

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.589 
like this what we're doing is we're
bringing<00:02:48.280> out<00:02:48.579> this<00:02:48.790> organ<00:02:49.209> helping<00:02:49.480> to

organ itself the spleen Meridian runs up

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.890 
organ itself the spleen Meridian runs up
the<00:02:56.980> inner<00:02:57.160> aspect<00:02:57.549> of<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.700> leg<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.239> comes<00:02:58.750> up

here to the chest and by shifting and
folding<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:01.930> also<00:03:02.079> help<00:03:02.530> to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
folding like this we also help to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.650 
folding like this we also help to
stimulate<00:03:03.099> that<00:03:03.280> channel<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.030> feeds<00:03:04.390> into

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
stimulate that channel that feeds into

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.640 
stimulate that channel that feeds into
the<00:03:05.170> organ<00:03:05.500> itself<00:03:05.799> so<00:03:06.340> again<00:03:06.900> exhale<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.560> as

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
the organ itself so again exhale so as

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.559 
the organ itself so again exhale so as
you<00:03:08.769> inhale<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.430> can<00:03:09.609> imagine<00:03:09.730> yellow<00:03:10.299> light

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
you inhale you can imagine yellow light
