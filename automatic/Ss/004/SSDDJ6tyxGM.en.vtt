glyphs that includes lesser normal and
greater<00:00:43.680> ones<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:45.210> ahead<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.690> buy<00:00:45.960> the

greater ones so go ahead and buy the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.270 
greater ones so go ahead and buy the
diagrams<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.980> need<00:00:47.750> from<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> peddler

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
diagrams you need from the peddler

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.979 
diagrams you need from the peddler
before<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.430> go<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.850> craftsman<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.719> start

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
before you go to a craftsman and start

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
before you go to a craftsman and start
creating<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.530> runes<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> want<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:54.329> will

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
creating the runes you want you will

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.299 
creating the runes you want you will
need<00:00:54.600> lots<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.230> materials<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> lesser

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
need lots of materials for the lesser

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.130 
need lots of materials for the lesser
one<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.969> suggestion<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.570> buy<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
one so my suggestion is just buy the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.349 
one so my suggestion is just buy the
lesser<00:00:58.500> ones<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.550> diagram<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
lesser ones and have the diagram for the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
lesser ones and have the diagram for the
normal<00:01:00.840> ones<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> greater

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
normal ones and then for the greater

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.609 
normal ones and then for the greater
ones<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.969> need<00:01:03.120> two<00:01:03.600> letters<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> craft<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
ones you need two letters to craft the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
ones you need two letters to craft the
normal<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.250> two<00:01:05.489> normals<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.090> craft<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.630> grater

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
normal and two normals to craft a grater

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.200 
normal and two normals to craft a grater
so<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.799> four<00:01:08.130> letters<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.939> kind

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so if you have four letters of a kind

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.660 
so if you have four letters of a kind
you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> greater<00:01:11.340> by

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you can go all the way to greater by

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.960 
you can go all the way to greater by
crafting<00:01:12.150> twice<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:17.130> should<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
crafting twice you should get all of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.469 
crafting twice you should get all of
this<00:01:18.860> one<00:01:19.860> piece<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.340> each<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:21.060> soon<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
this one piece of each as soon as you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.700 
this one piece of each as soon as you
have<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> coin

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
have the coin

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.590 
have the coin
after<00:01:24.460> we<00:01:24.610> have<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.970> schematics<00:01:25.180> the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
after we have the schematics the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.540 
after we have the schematics the
diagrams<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:26.320> will<00:01:26.470> need<00:01:26.620> a<00:01:26.650> craftsman

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
diagrams we will need a craftsman

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.420
