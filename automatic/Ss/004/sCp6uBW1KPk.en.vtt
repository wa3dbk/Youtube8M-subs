00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
food because you know where you are you

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.939 
food because you know where you are you
know<00:00:20.869> really<00:00:21.080> already<00:00:21.320> calories<00:00:21.800> especially

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949

when<00:00:22.339> you<00:00:22.429> come<00:00:22.580> into<00:00:22.730> preparation<00:00:23.089> for<00:00:23.509> a

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
when you come into preparation for a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.900 
when you come into preparation for a
show<00:00:23.800> for<00:00:24.800> example<00:00:24.859> you're<00:00:25.460> training<00:00:25.730> my

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
show for example you're training my

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.519 
show for example you're training my
station<00:00:26.359> right<00:00:26.509> I<00:00:26.539> want<00:00:26.810> you<00:00:26.990> to<00:00:27.109> drop<00:00:27.230> the

station right I want you to drop the
grams<00:00:27.769> of<00:00:27.919> carbs<00:00:28.249> now<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:29.240> don't<00:00:29.449> know<00:00:29.539> how

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
grams of carbs now you don't know how

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.909 
grams of carbs now you don't know how
many<00:00:29.749> grams<00:00:30.019> of<00:00:30.199> coffee<00:00:30.380> it<00:00:30.589> going<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.769> drop

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
many grams of coffee it going to drop

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.260 
many grams of coffee it going to drop
because<00:00:31.070> you<00:00:31.249> don't<00:00:31.429> know<00:00:31.550> how<00:00:31.789> many<00:00:31.849> your

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
because you don't know how many your

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.900 
because you don't know how many your

what<00:02:04.789> this<00:02:04.940> actually<00:02:05.149> is<00:02:05.869> okay<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.380> know<00:02:06.530> a

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
what this actually is okay so you know a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.279 
what this actually is okay so you know a
good<00:02:06.770> read<00:02:07.009> up<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:08.179> has<00:02:08.360> got<00:02:08.570> extra<00:02:08.840> gluten<00:02:09.050> in

good read up it has got extra gluten in
it<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:10.519> mainly<00:02:10.820> branched<00:02:11.269> chains<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:14.530> so

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
it it's mainly branched chains and so

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.290 
it it's mainly branched chains and so
that<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.100> basically<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:22.519> that's<00:02:22.700> before<00:02:23.000> got

it<00:03:58.360> gives<00:03:58.720> me<00:03:59.050> 36<00:03:59.740> grams<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.490> protein<00:04:01.060> these

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
it gives me 36 grams of protein these

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.690 
it gives me 36 grams of protein these
now<00:04:01.660> these<00:04:01.810> are<00:04:02.020> 90<00:04:02.380> percent<00:04:02.410> lean<00:04:03.370> beef

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700

now these are 90 percent lean beef
whereas<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.660> lot<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:04.990> weights<00:04:05.170> takes<00:04:05.440> around

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590

there's six in there now each sausage is

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.920 
there's six in there now each sausage is
just<00:04:18.880> under<00:04:19.090> 15<00:04:19.480> grams<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:20.140> protein<00:04:20.640> 14.7<00:04:21.670> and

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
just under 15 grams of protein 14.7 and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.230 
just under 15 grams of protein 14.7 and
they're<00:04:22.930> just<00:04:23.200> 100<00:04:23.890> calories<00:04:24.370> per<00:04:24.640> sausage<00:04:25.090> so

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
they're just 100 calories per sausage so

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
they're just 100 calories per sausage so
they're<00:04:25.390> really<00:04:25.600> really<00:04:25.810> nice<00:04:25.990> especially

from your plan chicken breast or I

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.520 
from your plan chicken breast or I
sometimes<00:04:31.420> tend<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.960> have<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.110> lot<00:04:32.290> of<00:04:32.320> turkey

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.440 
sometimes tend to have a lot of turkey
breast<00:04:32.830> so<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.760> doesn't<00:04:34.060> make<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> big

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
breast so it doesn't make a big

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.090 
breast so it doesn't make a big
difference<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.960> as<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.140> said<00:04:35.230> it's<00:04:35.500> pure

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
difference and as I said it's pure

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.220 
difference and as I said it's pure

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
obviously put into sausage from then

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.050 
obviously put into sausage from then
I've<00:04:40.960> got<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.320> two<00:04:41.620> muscle<00:04:42.070> food<00:04:42.400> chicken

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
much different to what I have been

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.820 
much different to what I have been
getting<00:04:46.450> in<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.810> supermarket's<00:04:47.560> because

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
getting in the supermarket's because

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.130 
getting in the supermarket's because
I've<00:04:47.980> noticed<00:04:48.520> they<00:04:49.090> contain<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:49.600> lot<00:04:49.750> less

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
I've noticed they contain a lot less

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.140 
I've noticed they contain a lot less
water<00:04:50.410> so<00:04:51.190> that<00:04:51.220> only<00:04:51.490> tells<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:51.940> one<00:04:52.120> thing

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
water so that only tells you one thing

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.930 
water so that only tells you one thing
so<00:04:52.990> when<00:04:53.470> I'm<00:04:53.590> cooking<00:04:53.740> through<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.490> lot<00:04:54.910> of

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
so when I'm cooking through a lot of

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.540 
so when I'm cooking through a lot of
this<00:04:55.030> water<00:04:55.300> comes<00:04:55.600> out<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.140> so<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:57.040> always

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
this water comes out of and so I always

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.150 
this water comes out of and so I always
cook<00:04:57.880> with<00:04:57.910> my<00:04:58.150> coconut<00:04:58.630> oil<00:04:58.840> as<00:04:58.990> well<00:04:59.200> so<00:04:59.830> I

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
cook with my coconut oil as well so I

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.280 
cook with my coconut oil as well so I
just<00:05:01.030> think<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.390> gives<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.630> really<00:05:01.900> really<00:05:02.140> nice

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
just think it gives a really really nice

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.870 
just think it gives a really really nice
flavor<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.040> it's<00:05:03.160> also<00:05:03.310> got<00:05:03.669> some<00:05:03.700> really

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
flavor and it's also got some really

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.490 
flavor and it's also got some really
good<00:05:04.210> benefits<00:05:04.330> as<00:05:04.780> well<00:05:04.930> which<00:05:05.140> I'll<00:05:05.320> explain

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
good benefits as well which I'll explain

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.310
