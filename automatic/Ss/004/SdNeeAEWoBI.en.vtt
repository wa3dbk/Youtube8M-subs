00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.640
 I'm paid the injury on the Volvo bus sales day we're here at the base 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.860
 military field of may in buenos aires-argentina 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 to demonstrate the sp stability control system 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.410
 many of the accidents occur 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.580
 when suddenly an obstacle appears in front of the bus 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.410
 causing the driver to make an abrupt maneuver to avoid collision or even 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.950
 when the driver underestimated the maximum city of Acrodo admits 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.860
 it is precisely in these cases 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.350
 sp aims to avoid accidents and save lives in traffic 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.920
 the test we see now is a lane exchange maneuver where they were placed 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.770
 cones simulating the presence of a kanitz obstacle that appears 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.970
 driving the driver to make a sudden maneuver to avoid 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.970
 collision 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.710
 we got here after the resident double deck bus where one of them is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.000
 equipped with system s while others are not 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.640
 both eyes have the same charge - we will have the same speed and the same 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 conditions during the tests 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.870
 the committee 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.870
 question 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.040
 once a risk situation is decreed 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.090
 the isp 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.310
 with acceleration 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.260
 and brakes each wheel individually while maintaining vehicle stability 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 regardless of the action 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.899
 besides and shows what would happen if the bus entered a sharp turn in 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.719
 speed too high 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:04.069
 if the track is slippery there is a risk of skidding if it is dry 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.069
 cabotage with eyes the text 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:03.329
 therefore discourages a situation where the driver is obliged to make a 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.449
 braking emergency side by side we have two vehicles a white with 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.519
 conventional brake system or the drum in another vehicle equipped with a 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.209
 of risk it inclusive and ds5 in this case the abs brake system here because the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.120
 commonly used abs functions and braking assistance 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.769
 to stop the vehicle from the shortest possible distance 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.759
 that good the world's leading brand security
