00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
now to decide where to put everything

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.919 
now to decide where to put everything
can<00:00:03.929> be<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.400> very<00:00:05.400> big<00:00:05.970> hassle<00:00:06.950> my<00:00:08.929> designing

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
can be a very big hassle my designing

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.580 
can be a very big hassle my designing
and<00:00:11.000> rearranging<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.090> barns<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.719> since<00:00:13.530> I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
and rearranging of barns and since I

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.320 
and rearranging of barns and since I
like<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.190> lot<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.639> I'm<00:00:14.730> considering

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
like to do it a lot and I'm considering

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.920 
like to do it a lot and I'm considering
doing<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.900> again<00:00:16.880> takes<00:00:17.880> me<00:00:18.180> between<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:19.699> day<00:00:20.930> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
doing it again takes me between a day to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.359 
doing it again takes me between a day to
three<00:00:22.619> days<00:00:23.660> it<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.720> depends<00:00:25.590> since<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.310> do

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
three days it just depends since I do

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.660 
three days it just depends since I do
have<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.640> lot<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> barns<00:00:27.150> space<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.990> horses<00:00:28.670> so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
have a lot of barns space and horses so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.310 
have a lot of barns space and horses so
what<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.430> I<00:00:32.430> take<00:00:32.960> my<00:00:33.960> entire<00:00:34.620> room<00:00:35.130> and

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
what I do is I take my entire room and

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.780 
what I do is I take my entire room and
measure<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.739> dimensions<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> measure<00:00:41.010> from

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
measure the dimensions so I measure from

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.779 
measure the dimensions so I measure from
my<00:00:41.969> beginning<00:00:42.450> wall<00:00:42.660> here<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.760> way

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
my beginning wall here all the way

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.720 
my beginning wall here all the way
across<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:45.480> end<00:00:45.629> wall<00:00:46.399> all<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:48.390> back

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
across to my end wall all the way back

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.110 
across to my end wall all the way back
to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> back<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.239> wall<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.430> map

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to the back of this wall and I just map

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.630 
to the back of this wall and I just map
it<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.860> make<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> drawing<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
it out I make a drawing of what it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
it out I make a drawing of what it
actually<00:00:56.789> looks<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.449> paper<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.960> then

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
actually looks like on paper and then

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.520 
actually looks like on paper and then
for<00:00:59.100> each<00:00:59.129> while<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> measure<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.629> measure<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
for each while I measure and measure it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.149 
for each while I measure and measure it
in<00:01:01.590> inches<00:01:03.379> once<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.680> all<00:01:04.979> mapped

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
in inches once I have that all mapped

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.539 
in inches once I have that all mapped
out<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.570> barns<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:08.070> measure<00:01:08.280> them

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
out I take my barns and I measure them

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.859 
out I take my barns and I measure them
individually<00:01:09.049> by<00:01:10.049> length<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.710> width<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
individually by length and width so I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.620 
individually by length and width so I
would<00:01:13.140> take<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.470> barn<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:15.210> measure<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> from

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
would take this barn and measure it from

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
would take this barn and measure it from
left<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> right<00:01:16.580> lengthwise<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:19.790> left<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
left to right lengthwise and left to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.219 
left to right lengthwise and left to
right<00:01:21.119> width<00:01:21.780> wise<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:23.840> do<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.110> all<00:01:25.200> my

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
right width wise I do that for all my

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.260 
right width wise I do that for all my
barns<00:01:25.619> including<00:01:26.369> these<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> feed<00:01:27.090> room

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
barns including these in the feed room

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
barns including these in the feed room
and<00:01:28.520> my<00:01:29.520> big<00:01:29.670> barn<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> height<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.579> an

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and my big barn now height is not an

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.210 
and my big barn now height is not an
option<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.689> an<00:01:33.810> issue<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.140> me<00:01:34.350> since<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
option is not an issue for me since this

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.260 
option is not an issue for me since this
is<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.729> fairly<00:01:36.479> high<00:01:36.600> room<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:38.850> probably

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
is a fairly high room and it probably

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390 
is a fairly high room and it probably
won't<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.689> an<00:01:39.810> issue<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.020> most<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.650> unless

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
won't be an issue for most of you unless

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.569 
won't be an issue for most of you unless
Naida<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> bedroom<00:01:42.829> since<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.220> own

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
Naida you're in a bedroom since I my own

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.690 
Naida you're in a bedroom since I my own
room<00:01:44.970> hi<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.110> an<00:01:46.229> issue<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.610> now

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
room hi it's not an issue so for now

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.469 
room hi it's not an issue so for now
we're<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.720> disregard<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.210> once<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
we're going to disregard it so once you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
include pastures I normally say okay I

have my red metal fence
and<00:02:11.060> two<00:02:12.800> long<00:02:13.800> pass<00:02:14.370> defenses<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:16.590> short

pass defense back there then it is all
in<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.510> creativity<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:23.520> have<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.940> be

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
in the creativity you have to be

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.030 
in the creativity you have to be
creative<00:02:24.360> when<00:02:24.690> designing<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.140> Warren<00:02:25.350> it's

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
creative when designing a Warren it's

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.030 
creative when designing a Warren it's
how<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.250> want<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:29.930> see<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.230> just

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
how you want it to be so see and just

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.650 
how you want it to be so see and just
think<00:02:32.280> how<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:33.750> i<00:02:33.810> want<00:02:34.020> my<00:02:34.560> barn<00:02:34.860> fee<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.660> go

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
think how do i want my barn fee and go

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.160 
think how do i want my barn fee and go
from<00:02:36.810> there<00:02:38.600> what<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.630> normally<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:42.140> try<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
from there what I normally do is try and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.110 
from there what I normally do is try and
picture<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.710> room<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:43.980> my<00:02:44.100> head<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.610> picture

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
barn it just takes time and effort just

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.740 
barn it just takes time and effort just
be<00:03:32.310> creative<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.820> be<00:03:32.880> patient<00:03:33.180> you'll<00:03:33.600> get

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
be creative and be patient you'll get

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.080 
be creative and be patient you'll get
there<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:35.370> let's<00:03:35.580> move<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.540> next<00:03:36.570> step

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
there so let's move on to the next step

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.360 
there so let's move on to the next step
now<00:03:39.090> once<00:03:39.959> we<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.260> all<00:03:40.410> our<00:03:40.500> barns<00:03:40.980> put<00:03:41.220> into
