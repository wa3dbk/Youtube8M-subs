00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.190
 well that's it everyone knows merlin 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.560
 and find themselves today for a 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.060
 small multi video on destiny on the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.600
 map the anomaly so on the moon in 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.670
 domination 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.020
 so before I started I was with 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.310
 galade khamis aquagym rent bishop and du 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.890
 this is a video taken from my 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.000
 live twitch we did last night so 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.870
 that's why the sound of the video does not 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.890
 will not be very strong since you 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.149
 hear the voices of my colleagues but 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.260
 So not mine is like that at 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.370
 whenever I capture a video 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.890
 from my live stream we do not hear 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.059
 my voice and suddenly we hear that the one 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.260
 of my friends but at the same time I do not 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.519
 do not answer finally you do not hear me 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.519
 talk to people in the cat and all the 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.480
 short world we do not care and suddenly 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.379
 I 'm doing this little video for you 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.760
 talk a little bit about what's going on 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.710
 move on destiny very soon 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.510
 so to sales started at the level of 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.699
 gameplay it's not the best part 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.659
 that we had done last night it's a 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.920
 part that I find rather funny 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.850
 go see in the middle it would take 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.359
 rather funny that's why I have 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.350
 selected 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.030
 so it starts rather badly you have 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.170
 really get pounded briefly I at 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.870
 level of my weapons I play raptors 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.840
 black so xbox 360 friends and xbox 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.799
 it's a weapon you do not have 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.850
 pity because she is very very very 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.909
 effective is clearly the best 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.990
 revolver brief and suddenly I'm 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.130
 wanted to talked a little bit about what 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.689
 will happen on destiny because as 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.640
 you know the next dlc besides he 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.840
 was postponed to an unknown date but 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.439
 So we will not go out on March 10 and 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 until here 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.189
 Well, it's going to be pretty empty but so 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.420
 here is destiny I do not know too much 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.369
 that I could present you and already 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.810
 I put back in place 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.100
 surely lightswitch yesterday suddenly we have 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.869
 started a little bit it was a little 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.850
 little bit softly but we still 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.140
 redo it's the challenges to subscribe 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.219
 so I explain to you for this tale not 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.719
 followed before on my live tweet I 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.100
 put in place what I call them 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.450
 rotten challenges ie in fact 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.789
 you give us really challenges to the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.930
 con creates a straw poll in speed and 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.280
 blow you really vote actually 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.140
 take the ideas of people in the chat 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.119
 we fear straw poll so a poll is 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.109
 in fact we have some we decide a little of this 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.219
 we must do and we already had 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.539
 delusions kind do the glass vault 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.090
 only with green weapons of the day 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.380
 the gunsmith or only revolver 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.630
 that is, forbidden with a knife at 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.130
 great to heavy to exotic and 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.420
 company fine brief every time we have 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.009
 successful and yesterday I had challenges at the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.840
 con kind play with the view to make a 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.700
 kill with the inverted view or a 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.380
 sensitivity one or things like that 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.060
 short so I'll put this back in place 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.380
 on my lightswitch do not hesitate to 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.250
 to pass it would be once a week I 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.310
 do not know the date yet 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.450
 but I will keep you informed 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.130
 so that's it we'll put this in place 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.690
 I know that it pleases hugely sacred 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.700
 a lot of usability between viewers 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.239
 between us and it's rather funny 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 we see galley 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.360
 short so that's it that's something that 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.200
 I put back in place and I also wanted 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.550
 ask yourself what is it you 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.770
 would like to be sure destiny on 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.420
 my channel I do not know me I you 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.280
 offers a little trick because actually 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.280
 I really have a lot of gameplay that 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 drag in pvp vd more or less good there 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.440
 as I told you it's not even 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.019
 especially the best we did 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.370
 much more huge parts it yesterday we 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.569
 put them a lot more expensive by 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.739
 moments even month there personally I 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.790
 do not specially score crazy but 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.110
 I find that I also found that 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.690
 this part was not bad at the level of 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.000
 teamplay because even though if it's a 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.799
 stuff of something also to personal score 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.620
 on this game it is the advantage also of 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.330
 teamplay that counts short is my opinion 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.599
 So here is and what it looks like you 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.250
 that I put you two or three videos 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.630
 pvp a week but I do not count 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.620
 especially the limit because by force 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.610
 I would always say the same thing there is 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.970
 not especially many things to 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.890
 commented 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.000
 maybe one a week I 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.349
 comment on the gameplay to explain 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.610
 a little what we did see explain a 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.440
 little bit of the strategies we put into 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.549
 place there is no special 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.739
 strategy that you to you one is just 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.359
 get into the heap allawi watched 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.549
 bad big I do not know why I have 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.920
 galley with my sniper so that you 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.850
 also interested I will have videos there 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.320
 had one of the challenges also it was 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.180
 only snipers of the coup I have a 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.400
 video that is very interesting we do 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.180
 Huge sniper carnage by the way 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.859
 I advise you as I admit 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.329
 advise in my previous video the 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.160
 revenge of president so tears of 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.079
 raid of the vault various you have a 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.069
 rate of whip shooting you have six 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.989
 balls in the charger frankly 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.299
 it's monstrous it makes engrave the taf 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.060
 it's really the sniper that I am 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.480
 absolutely advise sure this on this mode 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.639
 pvp 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.930
 short so do not hesitate to tell me if that 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.269
 that would really interest you 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.230
 contest put that up two to three 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.120
 videos maybe it's a lot we're going 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.350
 say two a week and one that I 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.209
 order from time to time because 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.090
 really we have good pvp games that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.530
 drags on so here and I know it's 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.120
 not something we often see pvp 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.630
 on destiny so maybe that could 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.549
 to interest you 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.590
 here we are, do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.030
 the space comment do not hesitate to me 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.630
 give your ideas I know I have 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.430
 asked solo raid frankly 33 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.500
 the first two steps are feasible 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.459
 I have already done 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.760
 I even did it I even made the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.040
 first in livestream more 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.970
 many times so I do not know it's 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.830
 not something that connects me 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.330
 especially especially cros pts in 33 I 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.470
 I'm pretty sure that all alone 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.900
 not possible because we do not have the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.400
 cut of light we went horse 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.930
 we have to deal with any head with a titan 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.850
 who puts a bubble to attract the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.960
 way short I do not know me I know that 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.250
 personally I have no title nor 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.510
 nothing so I really want I think 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.830
 not that it's possible I did not 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.770
 especially want to raise me in 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.790
 no more short to watch this guy there it's 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.020
 super funny that's what I wanted 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.130
 for that you put this video to 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.180
 look at habits elsewhere it is 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.560
 completely left but fucking he gets 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.130
 what's going on I'm pulling there too 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.690
 tell me but shit 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.590
 and there we live we were dead laugh even 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.570
 open eyes stay there but fucking 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.560
 what's going on looking at the ska tipi 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.940
 the other end of the map it is downright 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.040
 out of the map and here we are loved 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.780
 explode the eleven mnr keep the water going it 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.850
 super far besides my heavy weapon 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.560
 that I advise you absolutely because 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.870
 that there since normally I take the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.170
 Adi form exotic but saw that 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.970
 done I have the black raptor who in 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.630
 exotic shot in heavy weapons I 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.610
 have to change 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.110
 I take the hammer of zolder who is 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.980
 a weapon that I doubted during the breakdown 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.260
 the last one to close 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.060
 the penultimate banner to do that is 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.680
 a heavy machine gun there were 26 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.790
 bullets in the feeder but she does 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.260
 engrave the taf according to the ats 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.580
 so it's not speaking because I 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.680
 get fucked but she does 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.960
 extremely bad and I recommend it to you 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.830
 really above all so there we 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.630
 happens towards the end of gameplay like 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.680
 what we put them rather expensive and again 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.880
 as I tell you it's not the part we 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.470
 put their specially dearest I 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.880
 have frankly not precisely selected 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.410
 for the guy who bug express rather 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.450
 fun because it was one of the most 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.590
 short so here we are going to arrive on the 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.490
 end so do not hesitate to me 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.810
