00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.180
 or the two functional sisters that 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 we are in a new video of the series in 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.389
 the one that showed you all the camouflages of 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.429
 the microtransactions in all 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.339
 weapons so that you know if truly 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.709
 it compensates you to buy that camouflage or not 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.870
 on screen you have the camouflage of 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.520
 Wind notes that a camouflage 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.050
 it will appear that you are millionaires 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.360
 although in fact I have already lost money 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.160
 and a quite original camouflage and 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.990
 funny is part of trial since I 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.060
 it's funny that you can have a weapon 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.980
 covered with dependencies and for 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.450
 appear a pimp so if what 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.970
 you want to look like is a gangsta can 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.430
 find this campus before finishing the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.070
 video I would like to ask you like and 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.120
 share this video if you can because I 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.800
 I had to buy all the 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 camouflage just for you because I 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.190
 can use only two of all 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.660
 camouflage surely so I've 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.250
 bought for this series so that you 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 you can see only for you so 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.180
 I would appreciate very much if you saw szalai that 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.550
 compensation 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.270
 the money that has been spent to me and also the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.670
 time that I have to spend on doing the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.500
 videos because I have to put a bonus 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.210
 of a deal with everyone I love planck 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.880
 is doing tests on each map 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:21.310
 et cetera etcetera so I would love it 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.310
