even though I think that I see it that
way<00:01:25.780> because<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.200> know<00:01:26.260> my<00:01:26.890> eyes<00:01:30.660> say<00:01:31.660> I<00:01:31.930> do<00:01:32.350> get

way because I know my eyes say I do get

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.580 
way because I know my eyes say I do get
a<00:01:32.770> little<00:01:32.950> tunnel<00:01:33.460> vision<00:01:33.990> even<00:01:34.990> though<00:01:35.200> it

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
a little tunnel vision even though it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.930 
a little tunnel vision even though it
seems<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.520> be<00:01:36.610> better

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
seems to be better

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.540 
seems to be better
during<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.870> night<00:01:38.080> that<00:01:38.350> during<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.340> day

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
during the night that during the day

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.710 
during the night that during the day
which<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:41.080> don't<00:01:41.350> know<00:01:41.530> about<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
which I don't know about that the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.690 
which I don't know about that the
contact<00:01:44.260> mentions<00:01:44.770> are<00:01:45.930> thick<00:01:46.930> they<00:01:47.860> are<00:01:47.890> a

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
contact mentions are thick they are a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.910 
contact mentions are thick they are a
little<00:01:49.570> bit<00:01:49.870> harder<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:51.780> remove<00:01:52.780> than<00:01:53.170> the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
little bit harder to remove than the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.650 
little bit harder to remove than the
soft<00:01:54.640> lenses<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.740> right<00:01:57.610> now<00:01:57.760> my<00:01:57.940> technique<00:01:58.420> is

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
soft lenses so right now my technique is

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.410 
soft lenses so right now my technique is
using<00:01:59.080> my<00:01:59.410> nails<00:01:59.650> so<00:01:59.950> kind<00:02:00.160> of<00:02:00.250> like<00:02:00.370> pop<00:02:01.240> it

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
using my nails so kind of like pop it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.270 
using my nails so kind of like pop it
out<00:02:01.510> but<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:03.360> don't<00:02:04.360> know

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
out but I don't know

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.090 
out but I don't know
easier<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.360> hard<00:02:06.600> lenses<00:02:07.110> I'm<00:02:07.710> trying

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
easier than the hard lenses I'm trying

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.040 
easier than the hard lenses I'm trying
to<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.340> those<00:02:08.520> suction<00:02:09.030> cups<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:09.869> it's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to get those suction cups to see if it's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.320 
to get those suction cups to see if it's
easier<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.800> remove<00:02:11.100> but<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.180> maybe

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
easier to remove but I don't know maybe

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:31.610 
easier to remove but I don't know maybe
I'll<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:28.190> really<00:02:29.190> recommend<00:02:29.730> them<00:02:30.140> they<00:02:31.140> are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
I'll I really recommend them they are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.460 
I'll I really recommend them they are
much<00:02:31.950> better<00:02:32.190> than<00:02:32.340> fresh<00:02:32.790> look<00:02:33.260> trust<00:02:34.260> me

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
much better than fresh look trust me

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:47.510 
much better than fresh look trust me
I've<00:02:34.650> had<00:02:34.680> them<00:02:42.050> especially<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.650> they're<00:02:47.310> not

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
I've had them especially so they're not

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.090 
I've had them especially so they're not
printed<00:02:47.760> they're<00:02:48.270> handmade<00:02:48.860> that's<00:02:49.860> why<00:02:50.040> it

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
printed they're handmade that's why it

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.590 
printed they're handmade that's why it
takes<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.760> long<00:02:51.060> for<00:02:51.420> them<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.680> deliver<00:02:52.680> them

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
takes so long for them to deliver them

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:06.420 
takes so long for them to deliver them
they're<00:02:54.600> awesome

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.489
