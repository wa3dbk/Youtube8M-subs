what<00:02:06.180> they<00:02:06.300> looked<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.810> begin<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.230> so

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
what they looked like to begin with so

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.739 
what they looked like to begin with so
here's<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.549> breakdown<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.359> a<00:02:09.390> lot<00:02:09.629> of

here's the breakdown of what a lot of

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.239 
here's the breakdown of what a lot of
those<00:02:09.869> projects<00:02:10.379> look<00:02:10.439> like<00:02:10.829> it's<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:11.249 
those projects look like it's not the

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.120 
those projects look like it's not the
exact<00:02:11.609> ingredients<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> good<00:02:12.689> over

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
exact ingredients but a good over

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.160 
exact ingredients but a good over
for<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.550> see<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.910> how<00:02:14.090> they<00:02:14.270> start<00:02:14.630> so

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
for you to see that how they start so

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.320 
for you to see that how they start so
all<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.470> them<00:02:15.590> started<00:02:16.010> with<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.220> base<00:02:16.610> finding

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
all of them started with a base finding

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.120 
all of them started with a base finding
which<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.020> going<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.650> metal<00:02:18.920> stamping

on<00:02:28.010> surface<00:02:28.580> even<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.570> can<00:02:29.750> use<00:02:29.780> domino<00:02:30.530> tiles

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
on surface even you can use domino tiles

that<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.920> can<00:02:34.100> glue<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.580> has<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.940> nice

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
that you can glue on that has a nice

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.050 
that you can glue on that has a nice
flat<00:02:35.570> surface<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:37.310> then<00:02:37.460> what<00:02:37.610> you'll<00:02:37.730> need<00:02:37.940> is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
flat surface so then what you'll need is

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.520 
flat surface so then what you'll need is
a<00:02:38.090> focal<00:02:38.570> point<00:02:38.810> which<00:02:39.020> is<00:02:39.140> going<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.380> be<00:02:39.500> a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
a focal point which is going to be a

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.560 
a focal point which is going to be a
cabochon<00:02:39.980> usually<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.760> doesn't<00:02:40.910> have<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.450> be

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
cabochon usually it doesn't have to be

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.820 
cabochon usually it doesn't have to be
but<00:02:41.750> that's<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.080> easiest<00:02:42.410> way<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.770> a

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
but that's the easiest way and a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.680 
but that's the easiest way and a
cabochon<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.550> going<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.820> be<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.180> nice

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
cabochon is going to be a nice

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.140 
cabochon is going to be a nice
decorative<00:02:45.320> object<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.070> has<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> flat<00:02:46.730> glue

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
decorative object that has a flat glue

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.850 
decorative object that has a flat glue
on<00:02:47.300> back<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.870> has<00:02:48.020> no<00:02:48.290> hole<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.710> it<00:02:48.830> so

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
on back and it has no hole in it so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.500 
on back and it has no hole in it so
unlike<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> bead<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.880> course<00:02:50.090> we're<00:02:50.270> just<00:02:50.300> going

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
unlike a bead of course we're just going

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.150 
unlike a bead of course we're just going
to<00:02:50.570> have<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.720> hole<00:02:50.930> through<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.320> if<00:02:51.770> you<00:02:51.890> don't

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
to have a hole through it if you don't

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.650 
to have a hole through it if you don't
have<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.400> hole<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.850> they're<00:02:52.940> perfect<00:02:53.480> for

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
have a hole and they're perfect for

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.240 
have a hole and they're perfect for
gluing<00:02:53.960> that's<00:02:54.140> actually<00:02:54.500> what<00:02:55.100> they're

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
gluing that's actually what they're

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.640 
gluing that's actually what they're
meant<00:02:55.520> for<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.050> can<00:02:57.200> do<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.500> can

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
meant for and what you can do is you can

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.800 
meant for and what you can do is you can
glue<00:02:57.860> them<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.190> as<00:02:58.460> they<00:02:58.520> are<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.600> if<00:02:59.690> you

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
glue them on as they are so if you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.500 
glue them on as they are so if you
wanted<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.140> just<00:03:00.320> glue<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:00.860> on<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> metal

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
wanted to just glue this on to a metal

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.540 
wanted to just glue this on to a metal
stamping<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:03.020> can<00:03:03.200> do<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.500> or<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.430> can

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
stamping you can do that or you can

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.120 
stamping you can do that or you can
actually<00:03:04.700> mount<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.360> onto<00:03:05.750> another<00:03:06.530> finding

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
actually mount it onto another finding

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.840 
actually mount it onto another finding
and<00:03:08.440> then<00:03:09.440> glue<00:03:09.710> it<00:03:09.740> on<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.400> have<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.640> bunch

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
and then glue it on so you have a bunch

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.570 
and then glue it on so you have a bunch
