00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello youtube today with two glasses 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.179
 disposable we will make this cute trophy 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.179
 for dad do not miss it 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.550
 did you know that the material of which they are 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.680
 made disposable cups and plates 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.240
 it does not integrate the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.280
 nature that can be found 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.140
 intact thousands of years after that 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.440
 they have been used 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.600
 but not so that's why today I present you 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.730
 a craft made with this material 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.980
 so that we use it and we do not leave it 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.989
 to go to the trash I say you have to 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.320
 put our grain of sand many 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.260
 they will say a glass does nothing but a glass 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.420
 of the 200 of the more than 200 thousand flowers and 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.280
 crazy that we are because they are more than 200 thousand 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.050
 glasses so if you want to know how it 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.250
 You do not want this beautiful craft 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.250
 Ideal for Father's Day 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.050
 we will start cutting one of the glasses 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.820
 we will cut approximately 3.5 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.820
 centimeters from bottom to top 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.810
 do not forget to match the edge very well 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.670
 perfect now we have the two parts of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.640
 our trophy the big one is the above 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.410
 and the small the base but not the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.000
 we will join until the end before 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.520
 We will start working with the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 plasticine first we will make two strips 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.220
 thick that will be the handles or ears of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.220
 the cup 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.200
 they should measure approximately 14 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:51.510
 centimeters we put a drop of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:03:01.020
 silicone at the ends and stick them to 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:03.000
 the sides of the big glass will not stick 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.760
 immediately in fact it will be 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.160
 slippery so that it sticks properly so 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.890
 what you will have to do is help with the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.260
 same plasticine scattering the and 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.260
 expanding it towards the glass like this 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:55.189
 when you have your ears 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.650
 now we will stick a strip of plasticine 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:01.359
 around the cup of the big glass and 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.359
 around the base of the small 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.330
 since we finished with the plasticine what 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.849
 what we will do next is very 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.949
 important to conserve and strengthen 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.409
 the plasticine we will cover 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.279
 several layers of white glue is 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:41.310
 say we put a layer we hope to that 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:43.740
 dry and put back another layer that 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.620
 dry and put with about three layers as 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.569
 minimum if you have or find the call 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.210
 for being a pitcher that is very similar to 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.150
 white glue but stronger you can 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.990
 use it with only one layer make sure 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.389
 cover all the plasticine very well and 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:11.669
 when you finish let it dry and remember 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:14.009
 put two more layers when you finish you should 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.669
 to stay like this the plasticine resistant and 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.669
 shiny 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.290
 and what follows is to paint for this use 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.520
 the golden painting and begins to cover 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.320
 all the glass 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.930
 surely you will need two layers of 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:39.270
 paint to cover everything when you finish 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:41.190
 He hopes that he stays and repaints the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.180
 final do not forget to paint it inside 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.360
 also drying everything that follows is 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.890
 join the two pieces by the bases 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.890
 puts silicon and the glues 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.980
 while drying the silicone you can do 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.080
 a medal like this that is made 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.330
 with decorative paper down foami 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.880
 yellow above and a ribbon is 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.539
 medallita will be perfect to decorate 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.969
 The throphy 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.709
 and you're finished 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.589
 you can put them candy and give it to 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:35.569
 your dad and then he can use it 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:37.759
