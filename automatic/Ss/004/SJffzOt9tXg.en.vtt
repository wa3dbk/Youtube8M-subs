 opac my market sector 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.690
 I would not say 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.130
 I did last year games just closed our 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.040
 I am married well 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.410
 for my industry for my company 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.130
 concert to 2010 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.670
 done what we are already experiencing 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.960
 even if we are the same age 9 it will be difficult to be a very difficult year 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.630
 mine even though my numbers are still keeping it short 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.110
 they are crossed and we are looking for 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.190
 ddd increase ground increase to deal with any 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.559
 crisis 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.559
 whatever I say site where I am still 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.279
 present and on the horizon 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.159
 certainly 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.849
 and the more you get out of the crisis I think they are 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.539
 an assumption can survive 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.519
 she is creativity 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.650
 that the basis of

 Our mother is also one of ours 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.919
 the good competitors of this sector 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:51.189
 creativity is fundamental innovation certainly it would take a little longer 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:57.949
 but I believe that it is the first that creativity undoubtedly is a 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.759
 prerequisite for survival 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.199
 innovation instead probably oooh 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.449
 There is no good way to overcome the crisis and perhaps innovation in the textile sector 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.929
 lot 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.929
