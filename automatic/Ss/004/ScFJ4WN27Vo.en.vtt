00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
are stretched to I think double zero but

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.749 
are stretched to I think double zero but
i<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.879> at<00:01:03.180> half<00:01:03.449> an<00:01:03.600> inch<00:01:03.839> but<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.769> lost<00:01:05.009> my

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
i was at half an inch but then I lost my

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.450 
i was at half an inch but then I lost my
plugs<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> show<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.320> never<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:08.310> went

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
plugs at a show so I never really went

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.920 
plugs at a show so I never really went
back<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.659> let<00:01:09.810> them

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
back to it and I just kind of let them

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.200 
back to it and I just kind of let them
close<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> every<00:01:11.759> time<00:01:11.820> they<00:01:12.060> close

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
close and then so every time they close

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.029 
close and then so every time they close
they<00:01:12.479> never<00:01:12.659> close<00:01:12.840> fully<00:01:13.289> so<00:01:13.680> they're<00:01:13.830> always

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
they never close fully so they're always

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.649 
they never close fully so they're always
at<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.399> double<00:01:14.700> zero<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.149> not<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.450> mean

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
at a double zero and it's not I mean

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.300 
at a double zero and it's not I mean
they're<00:01:15.990> always<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> zero<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.159> hard

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
they're always at a zero on this so hard

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.550 
they're always at a zero on this so hard
to<00:01:17.399> get<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> double<00:01:17.970> zero<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:18.450> they're<00:01:19.229> double

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to get to double zero so they're double

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.419 
to get to double zero so they're double
zero<00:01:19.770> i<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.159> septum<00:01:20.520> pierced<00:01:22.399> my<00:01:23.399> tongue
