00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.630
 c 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.579
 ends the cup america uruguay champion was consecrated and this is criminal 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.659
 the protagonists at the end of the game 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.659
 yes 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.449
 we want to end it has nothing to do the tie does not give us 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.800
 no guarantee 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 we do not also talk about global power has not given us any guarantee for the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.069
 America Cup 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.829
 2 we must rely on other things to prepare well I think we did 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.590
 the city of mexico does not correspond to the generala and I think we made a good 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.980
 preparation 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.430
 and we went 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.420
 Acquiring shooting during the competition 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.640
 the studies that we do indicated to us that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 well for example when Argentina was very well 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.960
 and today 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960
 maybe I do not have any matches but 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.799
 eta or like to play a final of the type we play 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.300
 I really think that 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.520
 He was especially in the first time where he manifested more 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.200
 the difference 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.420
 this 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.330
 percent Uruguay had more intensity than us not 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 in the party of that and with two forwards 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.350
 this really very good ones were making the difference of the match i by 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.200
 this I think that in the second time we matched it a bit we had our 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.990
 chances 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.900
 always to the best yes 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.730
 if the distance was shortened in in the play in which riveros 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.100
 is the best this or could not book and we could put 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.490
 emotionally a little better how to try to reach parity 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.220
 but always amended a party where percent in rent in better moments 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 and in another, not better is ours, the predominance was from Uruguay, even when 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.270
 we were just in attack it felt that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.760
 that Uruguay lost it had it controlled 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.620
 very much debate and obviously that one personally always try to 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.740
 make the best 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 that this city the team is going with cobos denied assistance to an act in the 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.049
 last out 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.049
 I have no choice but to leave it to diego guarded by cabrera and vÃ­ctor marquez 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.139
 and short-sighted and probably a young girl knows that she has a lot to give and and 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:24.769
 the prize depends on ages on the whole team note that he took with her 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:25.849
 yes
