00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
going on up here anyways so basically I

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.040 
going on up here anyways so basically I
follow<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.640> backyard<00:01:46.060> Boyer's<00:01:46.390> instructions

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
follow the backyard Boyer's instructions

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.090 
follow the backyard Boyer's instructions
on<00:01:47.370> filing<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.520> bow<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:49.560> left<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.710> handle

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
on filing the bow I left the handle

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.240 
on filing the bow I left the handle
squished<00:01:52.060> sort<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.720> like<00:01:52.810> on<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.050> side<00:01:53.230> so<00:01:54.130> it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
squished sort of like on the side so it

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.350 
squished sort of like on the side so it
has<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:56.070> flush<00:01:57.070> locum<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.730> pressure<00:01:58.000> with

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
has that a flush locum a pressure with

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.110 
has that a flush locum a pressure with
the<00:01:58.390> correct<00:01:58.690> term<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.410> then<00:02:00.250> basically<00:02:00.520> I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
the correct term is and then basically I

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.960 
the correct term is and then basically I
decided<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.960> go<00:02:02.110> ahead<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.860> use<00:02:03.070> twine<00:02:03.520> which

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
decided to go ahead and use twine which

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.730 
decided to go ahead and use twine which
I<00:02:04.150> use<00:02:04.330> for<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.630> string<00:02:04.870> as<00:02:04.990> well<00:02:05.170> it's<00:02:05.590> really

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
I use for the string as well it's really

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.490 
I use for the string as well it's really

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
always seems to get away that's probably

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.120 
always seems to get away that's probably
some<00:05:09.000> technique<00:05:09.510> error<00:05:09.690> that<00:05:09.900> i<00:05:09.930> have<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:11.100> i

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
argot yeah but the comfortable range to

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.780 
argot yeah but the comfortable range to

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.700 

like<00:06:00.360> 15<00:06:01.050> yards<00:06:01.740> to<00:06:02.520> maybe<00:06:02.790> 20<00:06:03.270> yards<00:06:03.710> that's

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
like 15 yards to maybe 20 yards that's

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
where you don't have to be in a row like

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.800 
where you don't have to be in a row like
that<00:06:07.340> as<00:06:08.340> for<00:06:08.880> citing<00:06:09.300> ah<00:06:09.510> i<00:06:11.420> basically<00:06:12.420> hold

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
that as for citing ah i basically hold

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.470 
that as for citing ah i basically hold
it<00:06:12.960> at<00:06:13.200> the<00:06:13.260> very<00:06:13.410> bottom<00:06:13.800> and<00:06:14.160> then<00:06:15.090> I<00:06:15.120> my

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
it at the very bottom and then I my

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.540 
it at the very bottom and then I my
arrow<00:06:15.630> rests<00:06:16.080> here<00:06:16.320> and<00:06:16.530> then<00:06:17.070> I<00:06:17.100> just<00:06:17.340> use

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
arrow rests here and then I just use

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.940 
arrow rests here and then I just use
this<00:06:17.820> sort<00:06:18.090> of<00:06:18.180> bumped<00:06:18.540> as<00:06:18.660> a<00:06:19.380> sighting<00:06:19.860> it

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
this sort of bumped as a sighting it
