really<00:03:32.729> all<00:03:32.939> in<00:03:33.120> all<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.299> nice<00:03:33.569> little<00:03:33.810> flash

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
really all in all a nice little flash

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.219 
really all in all a nice little flash
coming<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.769> at<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:34.919> nice<00:03:35.129> price<00:03:35.489> i<00:03:36.049> believe<00:03:37.049> it

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
coming in at a nice price i believe it

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.789 
coming in at a nice price i believe it
is<00:03:37.409> slightly<00:03:38.069> over<00:03:38.189> $300<00:03:39.150> MSRP<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.319> actually

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
is slightly over $300 MSRP so actually

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.409 
is slightly over $300 MSRP so actually
probably<00:03:41.250> even<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.609> little<00:03:41.790> i<00:03:42.000> camera<00:03:42.269> more

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
probably even a little i camera more

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.360 
probably even a little i camera more
