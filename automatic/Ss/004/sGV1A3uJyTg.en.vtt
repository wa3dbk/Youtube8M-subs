00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.070
 I 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.070
 the lava earth is bound on which we go 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 study in this tutorial 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 feels lonely 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.170
 He made to feel that I am using right 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.930
 in this group that I played I'm 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.610
 using driving being full and one flight 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.160
 recently felt the pivot soon in the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.170
 beginning and in the soils all just put the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.840
 blow or we'll know how I 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.230
 I do this by using the driving and pivot 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.690
 same time a shame until well friends is 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.170
 the first one, let's talk about the pivot 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.750
 Let's remember a tutorial that I launched 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:53.260
 which is driving with the pivot you use 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.360
 this cutting edge movement now to use 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.260
 this simple driving technique with the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:04.270
 simple sixteenth-note pedal and using the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.430
 pivot you do not use this pivot technique 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.400
 here you will use another technique that 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.220
 I'll show you this technique now 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.110
 use the heel and point 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:21.450
 that is the alternating movement in your foot 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:27.100
 so the pivot has to come out the same sound 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:32.260
 even the sound of this one got here has to leave 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.750
 It's just the same 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.890
 so if I drive 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.890
 I'll do a driving here. 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.920
 I'll feel 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.070
 I'm doing the pivot right with the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.610
 heel and making agreement only with winning 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.750
 if I try to make this move 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.600
 I 'm going to mess up with all certainty. 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.010
 then the technique is to put the 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.290
 heel into account to make the pilot 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.760
 play for the sake of the morning and little for 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.700
 do the driving 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.720
 Okay, so this is what I'm going to do. 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.720
 slower a little bit 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.380
 so this is it folks 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.630
 is this movement and then you just go 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.010
 show with the drums in taubatÃ© gave 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.380
 to feel the way you do 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.240
 I'm going to make some solos here some 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.830
 exercises for you to do with 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.830
 drums pay close attention 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.440
 the name already says brook I hope you 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.690
 enjoy this information and make a good 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.690
 I work with her until the next
