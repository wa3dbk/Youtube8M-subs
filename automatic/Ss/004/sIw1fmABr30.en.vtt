chest area one fun fact is that the head

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.469 
chest area one fun fact is that the head
is<00:01:43.170> magnetic<00:01:43.620> so<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.010> you<00:01:44.130> ever<00:01:44.420> bumped<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
is magnetic so if you ever bumped the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.880 
is magnetic so if you ever bumped the
table<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:45.870> something<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:46.260> head<00:01:46.409> doesn't<00:01:46.620> come
