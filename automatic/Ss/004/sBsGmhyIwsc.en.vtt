salt<00:01:51.229> yeast<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:57.700> water<00:02:02.320> now<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:04.280> water<00:02:04.520> are

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
salt yeast and water now the water are

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.350 
salt yeast and water now the water are
going<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.420> bring<00:02:05.690> everything<00:02:06.170> together<00:02:07.360> I'm

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
going to bring everything together I'm

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
the flour its starch and protein as I

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.810 
the flour its starch and protein as I
add<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.150> water<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.770> protein<00:02:28.250> become<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
add the water the protein become a

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.500 
add the water the protein become a
