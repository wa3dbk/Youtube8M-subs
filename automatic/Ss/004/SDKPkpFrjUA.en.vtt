00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 we know more about the surface of the 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.480
 Mars as a million miles away 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.480
 over the 800 meters distant deep sea 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.900
 before I get to the first fish yet 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.849
 once the memory is the deep sea 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 the hammer she starts from one 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.510
 Water depth of 800 meters 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.250
 here it is really pitch dark and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
 nevertheless there live quite a few fish 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.670
 an estimated 15 to 20 percent 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.590
 all fish 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.300
 that would be as if all indians 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.439
 live in the deep sea and we know 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.119
 all about indians 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 So let's all over the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.930
 learn deep sea and therefore you should 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.190
 The following guys are more accurate 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.140
 look the leprechaun heath bimbam is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.670
 the boy ugly but it comes up 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 the inner values ​​and that should be real 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.050
 to be a correct type the leprechaun icahn 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.260
 be up to four and a half meters long and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.210
 lies in a low between 100 and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 1300 meters similarly built ancestors of the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.430
 Kobolds already have 100 million 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 lived during the Cretaceous Period 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.399
 his characteristic is of course his 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 unnecessarily big snout while the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.910
 Of course, its purpose fulfilled 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.799
 the hai has many 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.350
 Senses cells every little one 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.740
 Movement of other fish in the area 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.600
 locate 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.790
 By the way, this chance has grandiose 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 name roche tower so and now poses 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.299
 You have such a big time in front of you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.670
 a big nose or so, too 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.439
 mega impractical to bite the will 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.150
 yes constantly in the way and you think 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.189
 Be smarter than 100 million years 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.380
 old beings are you likely 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.659
 Nevertheless, nature has a trick for 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 that's what the lobster can do 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.329
 mouth out and its reach 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.710
 extend that much 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.600
 the next candidate in deep see 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.240
 Creepy Cabinet already wears the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.220
 matching names ghost fish exactly 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.530
 said that is a fiche family the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.810
 one of them consists of 18 species 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.930
 glass of head fish or simply expressed 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.850
 macro pienaar micro thoma the name glass 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.950
 head fish is program he owns 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.899
 namely a transparent head he 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.460
 feeds on zooplankton and lives 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.439
 up to a kilometer deep 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.360
 one thought for a long time the fish would have 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.009
 but there is a tunnel view 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.540
 The fish can be severely cut 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.000
 namely even look in all directions 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.979
 because his head just fucking transparent 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.979
 So he just has his eyes 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.950
 and he already knows something next to him 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.900
 in front of him 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.239
 it happens to him or her as well 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.980
 his head is transparent with it every 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.890
 not so small with him 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.890
 arrives we come to the absolute 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.470
 classic among the deep-sea fish 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.239
 Deep sea devil as the dear god the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.670
 created must have precisely at a 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.860
 be a blatant death metal phase 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.290
 He belongs to the angler fish and the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.040
 That's what they call a kind of angel 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.810
 the head grows 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.239
 At the end is not organ 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.220
 with which they just attract prey and if 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.170
 the prey then is near stops 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.069
 the frogfish the oxygen supply to the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.989
 to shine 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.970
 does it go up it goes out and the 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.010
 booty floats in the open mouth and 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.360
 Although in the mouth of the female 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.150
 most famous pictures of the frogfish 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.400
 namely make all females the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.650
 only one percent of the weight of a male weighs 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.630
 weight of females the little ones 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.549
 cute male biting each other in 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.530
 the big ugly female by it 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.810
 fused her bloodstreams and such 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.640
 The male is even with the female 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.290
 so I only need one more 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.930
 eight and a half tons of female and black 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.299
 Do I make the load close here 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.489
 wipper fish has its name because its 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.920
 bitten a snake he resembles 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.930
 hang his jaw and so on 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.319
 devour larger prey animals when 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.600
 one of the sharp teeth 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.730
 breaks down just grows after being 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.079
 body is full of light garner around even 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.630
 to attract booty 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.060
 and if you have a viperfish alive 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.400
 touched his body shines probably well 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.350
 in a pulsating light and that 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.739
 light brightens the environment two meters 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.440
 far 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.180
 they are up to 35 inches long and 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.760
 live in a water depth of 400 to 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.960
 1800 meters over fish are real 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.480
 ugly 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.310
 my last point is not fish 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.960
 but if you talk about the deep sea 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.720
 That should not be missing 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.450
 black smokers are small volcanoes 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.400
 the deep sea virtually the valves of the earth 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.710
 from the black smoke constantly takes 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.840
 water heated by magma 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.120
 minerals and other substances solved 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.000
 are and the toxic acid exiting 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.980
 water is up to 450 degrees hot the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.090
 surrounding water temperature is but 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.190
 just under 2 degrees 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.500
 and despite this incredible extreme 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.310
 there are life and volcanoes on this 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.470
 not too short 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.330
 There, whole ecosystems are formed 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.800
 Life energy is not here as at the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.870
 water surface over light so 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.270
 but won over photosynthesis 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.280
 chemosynthesis bacteria use the 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.500
 hydrogen sulfide around the smoker 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.110
 to generate energy and if there down 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.670
 Bacteria can exist naturally 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.520
 Other species such as mussels 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.150
 Shrimp stir worms or even fish 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.800
 to survive 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.170
 researchers also hope for this 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.720
 answer to the question after the beginning 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.760
 of life because there are conditions 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.400
 rule the earth like in ancient times 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.500
 high temperatures no oxygen high 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.180
 water pressure incredibly exciting and 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.820
 really unbelievable that we too 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.080
 probably just under a percent of the deep sea 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.210
 really explored 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.490
 yet the deep sea makes 70 percent 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.780
 of the entire ocean so I think 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.460
 the theme really exciting 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.370
 and I want to know more about you now 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.210
 if you have one of those deep sea super powers 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.500
 could have 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.780
 which ones would you choose? 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.390
 is it the glassy head or not? 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.960
 rather the light bulb on the forehead 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.940
 write the answer to this 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.370
 Sonic question in the stupid 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.830
 comments click here 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.070
 subscribe to this comment from 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.630
 Torben ho luca were you determined 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.250
 already the attack I feel that 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.150
 In addition , you use your blog camera 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.130
 as a weapon 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.990
 Here's the five most spectacular ones 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.430
 art robbery if you look for more 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.630
 funny animals then look interested 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.520
 here still in the smart ass because 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.260
 over comes instagram from me 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.450
 until thursday there is also the 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.920
 first poetry album entry really cool 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.850
 that something actually arrived 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.850
 stay healthy
