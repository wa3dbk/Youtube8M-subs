technology that enables to deliver safe
and<00:01:24.009> effective<00:01:24.250> for<00:01:24.490> darker<00:01:25.090> skin

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and effective for darker skin

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.889 
and effective for darker skin
the<00:01:27.460> lasers<00:01:27.940> really<00:01:28.330> had<00:01:28.509> too<00:01:28.720> much

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
the lasers really had too much

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.190 
the lasers really had too much
absorption<00:01:29.530> on<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.770> top<00:01:29.950> layer<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.520> skin

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
absorption on the top layer of the skin

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.350 
absorption on the top layer of the skin
so<00:01:32.200> when<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.619> skin<00:01:32.860> is<00:01:32.950> darker<00:01:33.399> there<00:01:33.970> is<00:01:34.090> even

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
so when the skin is darker there is even

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.650 
so when the skin is darker there is even
more<00:01:34.539> of<00:01:34.660> that<00:01:35.069> you<00:01:36.069> end<00:01:36.310> up<00:01:36.429> with<00:01:36.490> burn<00:01:36.910> you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
more of that you end up with burn you

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.240 
more of that you end up with burn you
end<00:01:37.929> up<00:01:38.080> with<00:01:38.229> discoloration<00:01:38.619> of<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.160> skin

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
end up with discoloration of the skin

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.820 
end up with discoloration of the skin
because<00:01:40.209> you<00:01:40.330> end<00:01:40.539> up<00:01:40.660> activating<00:01:41.319> pigments

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
because you end up activating pigments

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.410 
because you end up activating pigments
and<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.380> now<00:01:44.590> we're<00:01:44.979> bypassing<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.849> danger

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
and so now we're bypassing that danger

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.600 
and so now we're bypassing that danger
zone<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.929> way<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.410> we<00:01:47.860> deliver<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.459> energy

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
zone in a way and we deliver the energy

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.850 
zone in a way and we deliver the energy
underneath<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.509> skin<00:01:49.780> where<00:01:50.380> we<00:01:50.560> need<00:01:50.770> to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
underneath the skin where we need to

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.650 
underneath the skin where we need to
deliver<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.399> energy<00:01:51.819> in<00:01:51.970> order<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.270> see

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
deliver the energy in order to see

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.529 
deliver the energy in order to see
effect<00:01:53.459> long<00:01:54.459> last<00:01:54.819> effect<00:01:55.240> is<00:01:55.360> almost
