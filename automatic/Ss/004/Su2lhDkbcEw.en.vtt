to 500 steps going down that means it's

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.200

because we we found it you know I I was

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.460 
because we we found it you know I I was
starting<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.449> wonder<00:04:56.599> myself<00:04:56.840> but<00:04:57.229> when<00:04:57.349> you

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
starting to wonder myself but when you

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.980 
starting to wonder myself but when you
when<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.830> do<00:04:57.979> a<00:04:58.009> grid<00:04:58.580> search<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:59.150> like<00:04:59.720> how<00:04:59.960> I

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
when you do a grid search and like how I

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.080 
when you do a grid search and like how I
do<00:05:00.139> it<00:05:00.440> if<00:05:00.919> it's<00:05:01.250> there<00:05:01.400> I'll<00:05:01.550> find<00:05:01.849> it<00:05:01.970> it

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
do it if it's there I'll find it it

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.430 
do it if it's there I'll find it it
takes<00:05:02.360> sometimes<00:05:02.599> it<00:05:02.870> takes<00:05:03.020> longer<00:05:03.229> I<00:05:03.380> think

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
takes sometimes it takes longer I think

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.620 
takes sometimes it takes longer I think
possibly<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.490> rake<00:05:04.699> did<00:05:04.970> get<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.300> down<00:05:05.449> a<00:05:05.479> bit

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
possibly the rake did get it down a bit

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.180 
possibly the rake did get it down a bit
deeper<00:05:06.020> because<00:05:06.139> that's<00:05:06.349> a<00:05:06.440> small<00:05:06.740> gold<00:05:06.979> ring

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
deeper because that's a small gold ring

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.110 
deeper because that's a small gold ring
and<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:07.909> went<00:05:08.120> down<00:05:08.360> so<00:05:08.810> deep<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.440> uh<00:05:10.060> thank<00:05:11.060> you

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
and it went down so deep so uh thank you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.850 
and it went down so deep so uh thank you
happy<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.570> find<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.229> it's<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.620> beautiful
