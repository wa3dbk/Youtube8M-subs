and<00:05:03.539> right<00:05:03.719> I<00:05:03.959> don't<00:05:04.110> know<00:05:04.229> how<00:05:04.349> we're<00:05:04.469> doing

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:04.559 
and right I don't know how we're doing

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.949 
and right I don't know how we're doing
on<00:05:04.740> time<00:05:05.039> here<00:05:05.099> so<00:05:05.729> all<00:05:05.939> I'm<00:05:06.059> gonna<00:05:06.179> do<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:06.389> I

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:06.959 
on time here so all I'm gonna do is I

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.839 
on time here so all I'm gonna do is I
should<00:05:07.529> thought<00:05:07.709> as<00:05:07.830> far<00:05:07.979> as<00:05:08.099> they<00:05:08.249> just<00:05:08.669> take

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
should thought as far as they just take

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.449 
should thought as far as they just take
spark<00:05:09.179> plugs<00:05:09.419> out<00:05:09.830> and<00:05:10.830> get<00:05:10.979> them<00:05:11.129> out<00:05:11.279> of<00:05:11.399> the

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:11.459 
spark plugs out and get them out of the

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:21.079 
spark plugs out and get them out of the
way<00:05:11.659> and<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:12.809> gas<00:05:13.050> cap<00:05:19.639> guess<00:05:20.639> that<00:05:20.819> looks<00:05:20.939> the

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:21.089 
way and the gas cap guess that looks the

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:24.060 
way and the gas cap guess that looks the
English<00:05:21.360> shape

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.460 

spark<00:05:24.730> plug<00:05:24.940> for<00:05:25.060> Mitchum<00:05:25.450> is<00:05:25.600> mismatched<00:05:26.110> set

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
spark plug for Mitchum is mismatched set

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.750 
spark plug for Mitchum is mismatched set
so<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:28.300> looks<00:05:28.450> like<00:05:28.510> an<00:05:28.660> old<00:05:28.810> old<00:05:29.080> j4o<00:05:30.040> you<00:05:30.550> see

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
so it looks like an old old j4o you see

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.440 
so it looks like an old old j4o you see
that<00:05:32.190> made<00:05:33.190> me<00:05:34.410> champion<00:05:35.410> j4<00:05:35.920> I<00:05:36.390> don't<00:05:37.390> know

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
that made me champion j4 I don't know

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.450 
that made me champion j4 I don't know
where<00:05:37.600> we're<00:05:37.690> at<00:05:37.810> in<00:05:37.960> time<00:05:38.230> I<00:05:38.740> lost<00:05:39.160> track<00:05:39.340> of

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
where we're at in time I lost track of

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.490 
where we're at in time I lost track of
time<00:05:39.790> when<00:05:40.000> we<00:05:40.120> had<00:05:40.270> our<00:05:40.300> own<00:05:40.510> mishap<00:05:40.960> there<00:05:41.170> so

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
time when we had our own mishap there so

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.710 
time when we had our own mishap there so
you<00:05:42.310> gonna<00:05:42.490> shut<00:05:42.670> this<00:05:42.850> down<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.360> then<00:05:43.450> then

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
you gonna shut this down and then then

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.900 
you gonna shut this down and then then
we'll<00:05:44.620> start<00:05:44.920> another<00:05:45.100> video<00:05:45.630> all<00:05:46.630> righty
