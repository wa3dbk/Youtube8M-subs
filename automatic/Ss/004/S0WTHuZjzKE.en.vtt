00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 the list is already bigger I think than us 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.250
 technology format 742 well, let's go team 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.559
 na'vi defends itself on the cliff again for 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.530
 protection was tankers all here chosen 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.940
 top base well, and unity, as always, here in 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.940
 the yellow color in this match will be 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.730
 attack from the bottom base well and the first 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.779
 the question is what will be the departure of the team 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 na'vi 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.519
 Well, all these different setup and have no arts 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.960
 unity makes them probably cheerfully 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.710
 leave aggressive again and so 2 2 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.050
 2 2 on the map the cliff in a match mayn't mind 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.350
 virtus.pro and the guys goes there on 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.140
 Kharkov map, but we are just beginning 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.629
 as they say the second set of rock 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.329
 change of sides and now let's see what 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.460
 cost navi protection and unity in the hotel arklit 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.309
 It seems to me that I think it will be 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 double attack because we see 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.550
 hard push-up cage teams and in 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.039
 Now the center is just a hurricane Well 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.920
 I am more question where will go fun 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.320
 natus vincere commands because unity 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.180
 again not arta no pt they have gravity 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.520
 ltshke 1390 but I do not forget to show 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.430
 deluxe probably looked a mop pt will 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.009
 work copy 50b breaks ahead here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.720
 so u but it seems to me the law can 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.490
 punish for that here look at three 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.170
 object 4 objects takes an explosion on 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.259
 Center here does the same unity 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.560
 get how many times two three something and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.079
 and but it's lightly on each 50b video there 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.970
 almost impossible to hide with 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.060
 its dimensions needed st-shku there 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.040
 send something guys have gone too far 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.680
 Well, here's the answer went some from unity 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.270
 gets and strike cyrilloid objects under 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.549
 blow but more under blow 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 really 50b which has already been taken away and 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.899
 already most of the technique hung 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.649
 on the right anatolich look how sank on 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.210
 1390 he is already vanshot bulkin on the object here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.740
 so hidden here and trying to play 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.240
 you require and now the technology is equal 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.600
 and art can throw watch over and 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.250
 clips for not forgetting what he is waiting for 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:12.170
 that's just luci code eclipse this and 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:14.609
 flew how many if not 6 not 700 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.230
 Well, we are waiting for the development of events here he 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.790
 sphere gets cyrilloid attacks 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.700
 Bulkina now show you the whole thing 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.950
 guys but it doesn't cost too much 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.200
 aggressively play cyril food after all 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.959
 an object on an object almost two times 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.959
 less than 13 darren arina get right now 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.549
 I wonder how the situation will be resolved to me 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.370
 it seems that you still need Cyrilloid 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.189
 Cyrilloid is already out of sight 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.419
 Bulkin has a chance of 800 and 800 with something 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:47.909
 flies in diodorov it temporarily about 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:50.220
 They took from us 13 90 ss Anatolyevich and 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.900
 strike has come to the aid of Kirill go 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.909
 now they will take more together 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.549
 one object is just in bulkin under 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.889
 blow a diode center 480 nuclear like 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.200
 it would be almost a full environment but the guys have everything 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.189
 equal will be more deluxe problem on 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.349
 american fri-patches control here 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:09.780
 center on e4 but I won't show you here 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.969
 fear for crossed bulkina what is 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.479
 let's go here perfectly ram gets 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:18.359
 strike bulkina -26 art covers power 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:20.909
 the slide is very cool here it seemed to him 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.620
 Now he will take the diode but it is a gift 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.750
 this clip cool moment here was on 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.030
 Movie literally on pea-slide slide clips and 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.359
 taken away and not a tank but what about ren 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.099
 buttercup and nuclear against seven units 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.780
 technicians of the na'vi team will not speak 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.199
 tanks because there and artillery 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.209
 Fri-shka is already already given 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:42.239
 Well, by the way I should note that again 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.790
 still sdf accidents sparta here it is only 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.729
 eclipse showed you well 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.970
 now just throws well divinely 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:52.199
 Yes, we see that the protection of art is very, very 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.370
 for the time being 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:57.090
 Well, slowly Nari very carefully 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.909
 I understand all the same 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.680
 that this is not 8 all the same shaft and here as 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.329
 you can lose a step very quickly 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.370
 step by step I predict attack 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.430
 repartition came from the blind 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.049
 artillery renan he did not hit this 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.329
 he will do now he understands that 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.799
 the center is busy with the enemy and apparently 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.130
 he will try to get around them from behind 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.070
 until this time also you have two e-shki in 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.100
 nest 2 area 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.440
 object 140 is buttercup and nuclear now 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.210
 this is the standard standard position then 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.250
 There is for counter center I do not understand what 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.120
 now will push and try somehow 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.040
 play in 113 apparently 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.190
 decided to reach the end of the beacon and 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.290
 try to go back to the middle tanks 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.390
 the enemy will now show what's up 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.240
 novels a couple slides down the slide is also very 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.230
 neatly meetings or slats oh how there 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.880
 slipped straight so rina rina hundred 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.520
 percent even now take strike 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.030
 but if he doesnâ€™t come it hurts 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.340
 climbed strike but not Arina will not go away 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.650
 an hour arthas is carried on him and in the back of his head 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.090
 he must be called upon or there are slides in the USA 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.830
 which already goes down on him 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:12.910
 quietly already slide taken into it 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.910
 time human artillery gets rena 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.170
 this is what we were waiting for poems 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.260
 artillery will spoil the mood 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.120
 heavy tank yes yes yes but maybe you 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.860
 just the clip we were waiting open here 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.190
 the other guys are yours and probably 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.600
 too hard to exclude you like Lucia 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.000
 only the clip can even be able to 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.630
 shoot if the houses there do not interfere but 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.390
 that inspector 390 street seems to me 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.770
 alpha is still not enough for him 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.290
 pick up so he can calmly 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.710
 go out and get to 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.820
 and youyuyuyu from this here it could be worth 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.060
 navi tank 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.400
 this shot 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.950
 No, I still risked Liu Cyc not 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.580
 it turned out he is so brazenly second 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.630
 times inspire cheers get and goes second 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.760
 inspira tank 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.620
 well what will be there all the same help 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.419
 apparently already left-handed because it does not fall into 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.760
 nuclear from the hill followed him at this time 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.710
 well then time pours on explodes us 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.650
 time - object 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.990
 well and here it was painful it was 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.639
 penetration landmine gentlemen, that is, if 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.020
 she would even have one and a half thousand 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.020
 you would still go to
