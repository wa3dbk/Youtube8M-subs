00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.240
 afternoon the attention was almost once 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.700
 continued in the house of Mr. 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.040
 and we are here to show the place 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.660
 If you want to stay, we'd have 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.090
 started talking 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:32.930
 The interesting thing about the African 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.480
 interesting to the segment of the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.570
 African sicride line within the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.690
 charisma is edson some if it is for 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.840
 put links is the best ever taken to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.350
 one incognito for 1 for those who like 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.770
 Talk this already has some experience 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.870
 because they are fish but have not been 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.800
 the more delicate you have to deal with 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.710
 they are not 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.070
 what they before the cycle of Africans 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.250
 which are fish we talk about only found in 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.659
 a place in nature as in the case in 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.560
 africa and right sides are divided 113 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.679
 in one Malawi lake of america and another 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.429
 with the reform only that it broadens what more 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:22.190
 there is a diversity of leaves that has to 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.070
 500 to more than a thousand species 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.350
 Africa is a Malawi lake from which it is 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.740
 found in the mirrors of that 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.810
 within the classification of these cichlids 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.560
 feeding them are carnivores with 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.680
 books and I books are not annotating the format 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.980
 the mouth of some of them already is with the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.440
 over the years there was a change for him 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.050
 eat something that develops in the stones 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.120
 huh 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.340
 here in this case are the parent fish nem 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.630
 where they reproduce mass like me 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.140
 He said had some problems with water 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.570
 huh 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.300
 but healthy fish have more 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.460
 four years of life is not this fish 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.680
 blue and I think if I'm not mistaken it's 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.410
 a trophy and blue 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.840
 you do not fool me are many and are 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.880
 more than 130 thousand species is very 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.250
 decorate everyone else I know it 's a 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.950
 venom trulÃ© bigger problem females 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.140
 matrices in nature reaches 25 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.510
 centimeters but this 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.860
 ecosystem develops both in the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.260
 size but it's fine and these 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.650
 other yellow correct on the flag 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.020
 black on top are electric and the ne 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.470
 The two are from the same Malawi Lake 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.830
 found in Africa and these fish they 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.570
 They always ate my whole life up to me. 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.459
 and will not even hear some things that 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.060
 changed the engine when the nation gives 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.980
 even to our capital that ended 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.220
 taking the problem just ends up that we 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:01.430
 we want first on saline neco 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.070
 has been elaborated but the ideal is to 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.489
 same once every 30 days, 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.790
 The right thing to do is to change the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.890
 20% water, which is where the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.690
 concentration of traffic must play a 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.459
 A little bit of the action here I want to have touched 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.630
 for example I want to see how they are 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.580
 eating 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.580
 so I got something to wrap myself around 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.350
 in this one they adapted very well is the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.340
 first that they actually 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.230
 They are eating and I'm eating very well. 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.590
 interesting of the sanction so here by 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.130
 ministry she is award also has all 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.990
 the questions that the ministry asks for 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.000
 vote for this rating 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.569
 interesting is that the protein source 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.870
 she is from squid mollusk shrimp cost 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.700
 I create mussel function only seafood 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.200
 very interesting for 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.580
 cycling is a line of the tropical 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.010
 a new Polish relationship here coal 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.140
 has to be changed once every 30 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.600
 days will not be with the purchase a 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.230
 package of this exchange but no longer exchange 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.350
 at once 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.609
 conditioner when it is already a 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.140
 the best in the world in the segment is 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.180
 where I know the largest multinational in 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.950
 world in the segment has nothing of this 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.870
 brand does this but the product is very 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.020
 good because it should condition 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.990
 the water ie take chlorine and chlorophyll 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.240
 he does more of it he draws chlorine 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.490
 chloramine and heavy metals 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.970
 it also reduces the level of tomorrow between 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.970
 I treat them as toxic elements help 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:48.570
 if you find in the rabbit lair and some 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:52.020
 10 price is also better is another example 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.590
 Success understood is simple. 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.570
 today it is no longer expensive to maintain a 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.970
 logical has an expense 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.360
 it will depend on the style of fish that 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.280
 You follow are sent to the court but 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.480
 we all have the same diversity 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.520
 cool huh 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.410
 but what do we like to attack like this? 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.590
 It's how it looks neat inside the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.080
 enclosure 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.100
 inside the house passes the tranquility to 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:26.130
 people live a new destiny 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:28.260
 we look more for people who 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.800
 They are in the house so it's very interesting. 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.330
 pass mexico pet not early in the day 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.310
 Lenten just finished speaking so 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.940
 that the Buddhist monks used to 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.940
 meditate but it's really good
