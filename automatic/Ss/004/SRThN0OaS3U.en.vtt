00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.920
 in a saloon 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.490
 almost 5 meters 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.490
 with a 420 horsepower v8 turbo engine 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.840
 imagine the benefits of what is 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.360
 able this car 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.550
 above this is the RS6 with 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.550
 One hundred, almost one hundred and one more horses 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.519
 but 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.280
 we are holy 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.410
 for a car with these characteristics 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.600
 we always say that the power never 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.230
 leftover etcetera etcetera 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.450
 but is that in this case the v8 turbo with 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.550
 this power with 420 horses 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.230
 it's enough for this car we 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:13.570
 we imagine that the rs6 everything is much more 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.270
 massive power delivery 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.470
 but for those who do not want to do the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.180
 disbursement 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.710
 to have the rs 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.370
 in this version 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.370
 it does not have everything 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.549
 we can drive this car in two 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.230
 gentle ways that does not suppose any 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.190
 problem 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.680
 and an address 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.690
 very direct that 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.330
 we have to get used 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.970
 If we do not eat more than one curb 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.950
 spinning 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.950
 thinking that it rotates less than it rotates 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.040
 and has another one that is the sporting part 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.990
 which is when we really checked 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.570
 in the sport construction part 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.700
 to take it very very fast 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.009
 or take it when the limit of the car 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.750
 what's that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.880
 it is a very high limit 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.130
 you have to have fast and good hands 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.700
 reflexes because it's a car 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.800
 in the limit it becomes becomes 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.380
 nervous 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.380
 and it has reactions a little cruises 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.690
 especially with regard to braking 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.410
 the braking becomes the rear axle is 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.819
 he becomes nervous 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.799
 It does not move 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.750
 We do not know if the state of the 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:45.610
 tires of the concrete unit 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.610
 or because it is that this vehicle is like this 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.470
 the exit 6 inside is like any 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.780
 like any audi a6 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.780
 with a s line finish 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.260
 Has aluminum plastic or good leather 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.590
 quality 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.560
 Alcantara seats is a car with 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.930
 a luxury finish 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.930
 but except for the anagrams s 6 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.500
 the revolution counter 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 the seats and on the steering wheel the interior 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.000
 it's like any other audio there's nothing 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.000
 who is here 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.030
 really all the people who saw the 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:42.280
 car said 'how nice audi a6 and nobody 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.280
 he realized that the car was a 16 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.569
 and the surprise comes look at the engine on 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.230
 engine is what the internet marks 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.230
 means mind 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.040
 in addition the s6 mounted to suspension 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.040
 pneumatics 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.990
 a very effective pneumatic suspension 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.920
 which gives us 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.610
 and a lot of comfort 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.840
 is tremendously in line with those of much 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.480
 with the mode with the select auditors 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.959
 selecting the dynamic mode that is the 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.959
 harder 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:29.300
 with a tire profile of 35 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.300
 We have not had any problems 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.300
 according 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 and that filters very well all the banks and 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.110
 the herbs and regularities 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.980
 with that profile of the tire with a 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.960
 conventional suspension 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.960
 we would be hitting safe boats 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.760
 the benefit and then I'm going to say 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.100
 They are impressive 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.639
 with this engine this car is one of those 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.400
 you hit the seat every time you accelerate 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.669
 Y 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.150
 and clear that the consumption goes in consonance 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.190
 if you step on it consume 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.120
 we have come to see a consumption 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.860
 28 liters medium 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.150
 very specific conditions although it is 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:27.160
 true stepping on it by stepping on the area in the 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.160
 acceleration in a straight line for example 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.700
 the average consumption that we have marked 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.230
 we are around 11 liters 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.110
 and that's going 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.800
 normal 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.400
 and very slow and very light normal 11 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.030
 liters that for a 420 v8 engine 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.620
 horses 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.820
 it's a really good figure 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.180
 Anyway we have taken to mark 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.569
 95 liters 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.249
 in a consumption 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.720
 in a calm rhythm 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:08.600
 but for a round 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.600
 not going from 120 on highway 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.210
 although the s6 is a very good car 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.520
 isolated when we put it in mode 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.090
 dynamics and shifter in mode 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.810
 sport we notice that something happens 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.810
 changes 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.180
 changes in the engine 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.680
 well we are standing and we are going to leave 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.680
 so you can see how the engine sounds 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.080
 we are already doing 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.320
 before I talked to you about consumption as 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.590
 that buying this car did not matter 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.830
 much what you consume stops consuming 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.870
 the only discomfort is 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.670
 in case you have a car like this is 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.370
 the times that you are going to take the deposit of 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:39.010
 fuel during the journey 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.010
 because having this car so as not to step on it 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.400
 better for that you'll buy yourself about 6 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.350
 diesel 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.530
 or less powerful 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.710
 but have this potential and do not use 

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.550
 of the 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.550
 dont have much sense 

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.340
 there are people who can buy the car 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:01.550
 and use it for whatever you want 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:05.330
 but drive this guy 

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:08.200
 is to be able to use it and be able to take everything 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.200
 the potential that it carries within 

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:13.469
 many years
