00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.570 
that's basically the pattern of it
that's<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.350> lot<00:02:39.470> more<00:02:39.590> cool<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:39.890> in<00:02:42.430> which<00:02:43.430> can

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
that's a lot more cool it in which can

00:02:43.580 --> 00:03:07.509 
that's a lot more cool it in which can
work<00:02:51.130> back<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.160> a<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:06.739> solo<00:03:07.100> you

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
work back to a and a and the solo you

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.949 
work back to a and a and the solo you
want<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.730> solo<00:03:08.000> basically<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.540> based<00:03:08.720> off<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
want to solo basically is based off the

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.630 
want to solo basically is based off the
pentatonic<00:03:09.319> scale<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.310> remember<00:03:10.610> this

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
pentatonic scale if you remember this

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.949 
pentatonic scale if you remember this
it's<00:03:11.030> all<00:03:11.330> fives<00:03:12.700> like<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.180> then

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
it's all fives like that and then
