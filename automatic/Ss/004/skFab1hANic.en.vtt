00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 a huge hello to everyone and so today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.040
 videos for girls who love to wear 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.860
 loose hair but sometimes I know what 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.170
 bothers just straight hair and and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.450
 girls who are very long 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.480
 very hard to do any hairstyle 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.820
 or a very long twist but I know that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.189
 many like it what do i sometimes i 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.150
 curling up just the end already hairstyle 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.150
 looks wrong but somehow monotonous 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 a little bit different fresher is better and 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.730
 the effect is that you really 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.920
 twisted beautiful hair 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.260
 although you twist only the end and 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.570
 today i will show how i do it with 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.870
 using what I do and let's 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.340
 let's see the first and most important thing I take 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.320
 thermal protection for hair 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.760
 I have already processed my hair and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 you will do the same 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
 if you still have n't the same thermal protection 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.680
 please go and buy and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.670
 it is very necessary and it is very important 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 for your hair 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.129
 I also use a regular comb for 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.989
 hair and i have such small 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.700
 crocodiles who do not have such 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.549
 crocodile can use 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.619
 ordinary not see glasses for hair and yet 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.799
 if you want your hairstyle your 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.049
 curls at the ends of the hair held long 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.470
 you can spray varnish i will show now 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 as 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 I've been using my ploy for half a year now 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.150
 babyliss pro it 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.909
 cone curling she is such a Willian 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.150
 here to the base expands and to the end 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.110
 she narrows in what a definite plus of this 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.259
 the blocks first come out here 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.880
 wire 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.670
 yes, that is, you don't constantly 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.420
 gets confused and it's generally super and wire 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.370
 not experienced so it will not spoil 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.900
 she is not so expensive 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.840
 professional bad but i have to 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.150
 say she's on a level with them 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.390
 so I strongly advise this firm and I 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.050
 I have already looked at myself and a couple more playa and I 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.180
 I think that soon I will buy them myself 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.080
 how i sprinkled and heat my hair 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.120
 I thoroughly comb the ends and in 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.080
 principle, all the hair to make it easier for them 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.970
 to separate and not to be confused further I separate 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.110
 you can start from the end i usually 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.080
 I like to start at the end of the strand in principle 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.990
 you can take strands that go out 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.750
 if you want more curls 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.700
 take strands fatter if you want to 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.710
 smaller british slightly thicker 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:36.450
 I basically take the average strand and and 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:40.710
 I wind them about like this 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.490
 i hold down i'm so used and u hold 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.170
 about 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.130
 not even knowing perhaps ten seconds 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:51.410
 15 just this time is enough for that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.410
 so that they twist well 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.159
 after they are who they are after 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.920
 how the strand is ready you her 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.599
 descend on the palm and now you 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.069
 you will need temples 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.349
 Why am I doing this business in order to curl 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.400
 while i'm gonna twist the other hair he's not 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.719
 I bloomed like this and thread 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.969
 leave it so hang out girls 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.790
 who want to keep curls 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:28.659
 longer before use before 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:34.239
 how to wind your curl sprinkle it 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:37.709
 a little varnish and wind on 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.919
 effect pedal will be much better and 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.079
 strands will last longer than i like 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.780
 what I do not like to wind the end 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.000
 Firstly it is faster than cheating 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.919
 all hair is really faster and during 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.519
 second if you do yourself then 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:57.639
 high beautiful tail it is very 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.530
 will be somehow so girlish very 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.810
 beautiful and tender look because of 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.030
 the tail will subside such are not easy when 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:09.479
 my hair and very twisted ends 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:15.790
 beautiful effect and i take again 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:19.120
 crocodile unscrew beds done 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.009
 in the mirror that's why it's very hard for me 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.139
 looking so periodically down 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.600
 because without this of course it's hard 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.750
 go through my exact hair 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.180
 raskar anus still i what i do i always 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:41.410
 I twist my hair in different directions 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:44.980
 keep on i'll cheat 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.220
 without you ends and show you the final 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.720
 the result is how did I get it 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.580
 how you finished winding your 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.050
 hair let them cool for a few minutes 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.650
 then your curls will hold 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.510
 much better i have already done a few 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.240
 minutes my hair just lay down and 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.760
 Now I will take riveters 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.560
 crocodiles 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.010
 nothing special we do and just 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.010
 take off 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.319
 if but it takes me from 40 minutes to 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.139
 one and a half hours twisting the ends 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:45.659
 really takes about 10 minutes and when you already 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.300
 go to work at school in 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.340
 University your hairstyle does not look 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.900
 as usual till the hair is not just straight 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.840
 they are so lively 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.879
 a little playful and I think it's on 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.849
 really very cool and that can be 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:02.699
 do often enough and if still you 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.710
 lift up and then your hair in a ponytail 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.110
 look how cool it will be 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.180
 look your your right now i don't 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.900
 I do because I now need to 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.639
 loose hair but tail twisted 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.639
 ends just looks awesome 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.169
