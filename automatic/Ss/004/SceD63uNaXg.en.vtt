00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
over there it's on top of a hill so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
over there it's on top of a hill so
that's<00:01:49.380> pretty<00:01:49.590> cool<00:01:49.799> alright<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.909> here

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that's pretty cool alright so here

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.609 
that's pretty cool alright so here
there's<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:51.479> Pig<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.780> often<00:01:52.049> clearing<00:01:52.439> over

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
there's some Pig is often clearing over

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
there's some Pig is often clearing over
here<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.119> let's<00:01:54.119> see<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> button<00:01:54.720> pops<00:01:54.899> up

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
here and let's see if a button pops up

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.560 
here and let's see if a button pops up
or<00:01:55.259> anything<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.710> no<00:01:56.280> button<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.939> I'm

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
or anything like that no button and I'm

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.330 
or anything like that no button and I'm
probably<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.350> hit<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.860> tap

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
probably going to just hit them if I tap

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.120 
probably going to just hit them if I tap
it<00:01:59.520> or<00:01:59.579> hold<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.229> no<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.040> of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it or hold it down no it's just kind of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.350 
it or hold it down no it's just kind of
whacking<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.180> hitting

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
whacking that on but it's not hitting

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.469 
whacking that on but it's not hitting
them<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.219> can't<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.909> tap<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
them and I can't just like tap it on the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.320 
them and I can't just like tap it on the
pig<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.890> hits<00:02:08.069> them<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.030> there's<00:02:09.209> no

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
pig now it hits them so and there's no

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210 
pig now it hits them so and there's no
button<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.379> unfortunately<00:02:11.009> can't

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
button for it so unfortunately can't

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.559 
button for it so unfortunately can't
ride<00:02:11.400> pigs<00:02:11.700> yet

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
ride pigs yet

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.030 
ride pigs yet
and<00:02:12.689> I<00:02:12.719> haven't<00:02:13.140> seen<00:02:13.230> horses<00:02:13.469> yet<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:13.950> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and I haven't seen horses yet so you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.220 
and I haven't seen horses yet so you
definitely<00:02:14.310> can't<00:02:14.459> ride<00:02:14.579> horses<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.930> that's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
definitely can't ride horses but that's

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.470 
definitely can't ride horses but that's
kind<00:02:16.469> of<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:17.010> guess<00:02:17.099> like<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> hint<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.150> it's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
kind of a I guess like a hint that it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.869 
kind of a I guess like a hint that it's
going<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.689> be<00:02:18.780> out<00:02:18.959> soon<00:02:19.290> I'm<00:02:20.189> not<00:02:20.489> sure<00:02:20.700> is

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
going to be out soon I'm not sure is

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.250 
going to be out soon I'm not sure is
going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.120> horses<00:02:21.359> or<00:02:21.569> pigs<00:02:21.780> but<00:02:22.079> that's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
going to be horses or pigs but that's

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.229 
going to be horses or pigs but that's
