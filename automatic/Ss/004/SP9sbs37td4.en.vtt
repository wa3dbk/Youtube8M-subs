2<00:00:03.929> weapon<00:00:04.080> guide<00:00:04.259> where<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:04.830> talk<00:00:05.009> about<00:00:05.040> some

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
2 weapon guide where I talk about some

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.650 
2 weapon guide where I talk about some
of<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.430> weapons<00:00:05.580> statistics<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.540> how<00:00:06.629> I

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
of the weapons statistics and how I

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.330 
of the weapons statistics and how I
think<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:06.960> might<00:00:07.080> be<00:00:07.109> used<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.529> game<00:00:07.710> also

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
think it might be used in the game also

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.680 
think it might be used in the game also
if<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.490> guys<00:00:08.639> didn't<00:00:08.880> notice<00:00:09.150> from<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.480> last

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
if you guys didn't notice from the last

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.690 
if you guys didn't notice from the last
video<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> shotguns<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.889> ditched<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> idea

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
video on the shotguns I ditched the idea

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.580 
video on the shotguns I ditched the idea
of<00:00:11.790> giving<00:00:11.910> them<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.210> grade<00:00:12.420> because<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.080> kind<00:00:13.440> of

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
of giving them a grade because I kind of

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.930 
of giving them a grade because I kind of
found<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.830> pointless<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.370> grade<00:00:14.519> them<00:00:14.700> already

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
found a pointless to grade them already

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.340 
found a pointless to grade them already
and<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.360> person<00:00:15.690> actually<00:00:15.780> commented<00:00:16.199> that

and one person actually commented that

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.540 
and one person actually commented that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
asking you know what's the fire rate

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.160 
asking you know what's the fire rate
how's<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> recoil<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
how's the recoil but you have to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.509 
how's the recoil but you have to
remember<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.619> lot<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.039> guns<00:00:26.310> aren't

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
remember that a lot of these guns aren't

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.920 
remember that a lot of these guns aren't
even<00:00:26.699> around<00:00:26.970> yet<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.630> them<00:00:27.779> are

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
even around yet and a lot of them are

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.599 
even around yet and a lot of them are
either<00:00:28.019> made<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.470> or<00:00:28.680> based<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.160> weapons<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
either made up or based on weapons that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.339 
either made up or based on weapons that
might<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.939> used<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> future<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.080> I'm<00:00:31.230> gonna

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
might be used in the future so I'm gonna

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.930 
might be used in the future so I'm gonna
do<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> much<00:00:31.710> more<00:00:31.920> detailed<00:00:32.130> weapons<00:00:32.759> guide

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
do a much more detailed weapons guide

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.280 
do a much more detailed weapons guide
when<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> game<00:00:33.360> finally<00:00:33.750> does<00:00:33.899> go<00:00:34.050> public

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
when the game finally does go public

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.080 
when the game finally does go public
where<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.010> cover<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> recoil<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.850> fire

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
where I can cover the recoil the fire

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.819 
where I can cover the recoil the fire
rates<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> hip<00:00:36.719> fire<00:00:36.899> spreads<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> damage

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
rates the hip fire spreads the damage

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.049 
rates the hip fire spreads the damage
differences<00:00:38.280> through<00:00:38.430> different<00:00:38.700> materials

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
differences through different materials

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.819 
differences through different materials
and<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.750> stuff<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.230> I'm<00:00:40.530> gonna<00:00:40.680> wait

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829

and all that stuff but I'm gonna wait
till<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.070> information<00:00:41.489> will<00:00:41.579> actually

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
till that information will actually

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.729 
till that information will actually
become<00:00:41.910> useful<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.870> series<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.590> just

honestly talking about black ops 2 is
more<00:00:47.100> fun<00:00:47.309> than<00:00:47.399> playing<00:00:47.579> water<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.090> three<00:00:48.300> at

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.060 
boys anyway so let's do it so starting
off<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.390> got<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> MK<00:01:12.990> 48<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.710> increased

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
off we got the MK 48 with increased

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
off we got the MK 48 with increased
damage<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.640> range<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.420> boasts<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> best

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
damage and range and it boasts the best

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
damage and range and it boasts the best
stats<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> LMGs<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.520> the

12-point mobility which will stay

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
damage range and accuracy but I didn't

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.730 
damage range and accuracy but I didn't
really<00:01:23.610> liked<00:01:23.909> MK<00:01:24.270> 46<00:01:24.570> mph<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:25.170> three<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> I

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
really liked MK 46 mph at three and I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.109 
really liked MK 46 mph at three and I
don't<00:01:26.159> think<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.430> gonna<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.880> gun

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
don't think I'm gonna like this gun

either<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.869> when<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.229> higher<00:01:28.439> stats

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860

either just when you have higher stats
you'd<00:01:29.070> usually<00:01:29.250> presume<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.210> had<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> bad

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you'd usually presume that it had a bad

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
you'd usually presume that it had a bad

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
recoil or a rate of fire but I'm just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.010 
recoil or a rate of fire but I'm just
gonna<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.119> wait<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.479> make<00:01:33.509> an<00:01:33.750> accurate

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
gonna have to wait to make an accurate

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

and<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.079> weapon<00:01:37.350> doesn't<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:37.680> even

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and this weapon doesn't actually even

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.539 
and this weapon doesn't actually even
exist<00:01:38.340> yet<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:39.119> had<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> l86<00:01:39.689> LSW<00:01:40.200> mw3<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.460> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
exist yet we had the l86 LSW mw3 but I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.429 
exist yet we had the l86 LSW mw3 but I
doubt<00:01:41.610> there's<00:01:41.970> any<00:01:42.090> connection<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.750> LSW

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
doubt there's any connection there LSW

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.289 
doubt there's any connection there LSW
simply<00:01:43.920> means<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.189> light<00:01:44.340> support<00:01:44.670> weapon<00:01:44.759> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
simply means a light support weapon so

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.700 
simply means a light support weapon so
you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.509> basically<00:01:45.659> tack<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.200> onto<00:01:46.350> any<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
you can basically tack that onto any of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.889 
you can basically tack that onto any of
these<00:01:46.799> LMGs<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.909> has<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> worst<00:01:48.360> stats<00:01:48.689> at

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
these LMGs but it has the worst stats at

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
these LMGs but it has the worst stats at
11<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.409> damage<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.860> range<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.250> 12<00:01:50.640> for

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
11 for damage and range and 12 for

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.460 
11 for damage and range and 12 for
accuracy<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.689> makes<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.170> with<00:01:52.290> its

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
accuracy but it makes up for with its

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.050 
accuracy but it makes up for with its
fire<00:01:52.710> rate<00:01:52.950> which<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> fastest

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
fire rate which is actually the fastest

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
fire rate which is actually the fastest
out<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> LMGs<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.619> however<00:01:55.770> I'm

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
out of all the LMGs but however I'm

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
out of all the LMGs but however I'm
still<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> biggest<00:01:56.969> fan<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.180> LMGs<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
still not the biggest fan of LMGs that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.749 
still not the biggest fan of LMGs that
shoot<00:01:58.020> ridiculously<00:01:58.649> fast<00:01:58.979> I'd<00:01:59.250> much<00:01:59.729> rather

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
shoot ridiculously fast I'd much rather

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.550 
shoot ridiculously fast I'd much rather
prefer<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.689> more<00:02:00.840> accurate<00:02:01.350> with

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
prefer one that was more accurate with

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.039 
prefer one that was more accurate with
lower<00:02:01.740> recoil<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.759> next<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> lmg<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.960> I

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
lower recoil but next to the lmg that I

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.510 
lower recoil but next to the lmg that I
think<00:02:04.290> might<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.560> better<00:02:04.740> than<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.369> rest

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
think might be better than all the rest

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
think might be better than all the rest
and<00:02:05.850> that's<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> ls<00:02:06.509> 80<00:02:06.990> whose<00:02:07.530> description

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
and that's the ls 80 whose description

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520 
and that's the ls 80 whose description

like that word versatile because i like

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
humbling an assault rifle as it can be

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.390 
humbling an assault rifle as it can be

because at that point is just a

freakishly strong assault rifle but this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.900 
freakishly strong assault rifle but this
weapon<00:02:19.770> has<00:02:19.800> pretty<00:02:20.040> good<00:02:20.190> stats<00:02:20.400> with<00:02:20.700> four

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
weapon has pretty good stats with four

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.670

teens across damage range and accuracy

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920 
teens across damage range and accuracy
which<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.460> slightly<00:02:23.730> lower<00:02:24.030> than<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.390> MK<00:02:24.690> 48

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900 
which is slightly lower than the MK 48
but<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> give<00:02:25.740> up<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.980> point<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.520> there<00:02:26.640> for

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
but I give up a point here and there for

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.910 
but I give up a point here and there for
a<00:02:26.940> more<00:02:27.120> overall<00:02:27.510> well-balanced<00:02:28.170> weapon<00:02:28.500> but

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
a more overall well-balanced weapon but

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.280 
a more overall well-balanced weapon but
on<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> last<00:02:29.430> LNG<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.150> got<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.450> H<00:02:30.600> AMR

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
on to the last LNG we got the H AMR

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.840 
on to the last LNG we got the H AMR
which<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.890> assume<00:02:32.160> everyone<00:02:32.490> will<00:02:32.580> call<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
which I assume everyone will call the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.730 
which I assume everyone will call the
hammer<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.810> found<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.230> very

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
hammer and I found this one very

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.380 
hammer and I found this one very
interesting<00:02:35.070> because<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.850> its<00:02:35.970> description

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
interesting because of its description

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.570 
interesting because of its description

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
which reads reduces fire rate over time

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.970 
which reads reduces fire rate over time
becoming<00:02:39.210> more<00:02:39.480> accurate<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.560> I'm<00:02:40.800> guessing

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
becoming more accurate so I'm guessing

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.920 
becoming more accurate so I'm guessing
at<00:02:41.250> first<00:02:41.550> squeeze<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.030> trigger<00:02:42.120> bolts

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
at first squeeze of the trigger bolts

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.510 
at first squeeze of the trigger bolts
will<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.230> be<00:02:43.320> pouring<00:02:43.890> out<00:02:44.040> constantly

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
will just be pouring out constantly

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.370 
will just be pouring out constantly
which<00:02:45.330> will<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.540> very<00:02:45.750> effective<00:02:46.020> against

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
which will be very effective against

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.200 
which will be very effective against
people<00:02:46.620> rushing<00:02:46.860> at<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.100> close<00:02:47.340> quarters<00:02:47.760> but

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
people rushing at you close quarters but

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.610 
people rushing at you close quarters but
as<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.360> try<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.510> pick<00:02:48.690> off<00:02:48.810> people<00:02:49.080> long-range

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
as you try to pick off people long-range

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.650 
as you try to pick off people long-range
the<00:02:50.010> fire<00:02:50.250> rate<00:02:50.400> goes<00:02:50.550> down<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.180> your<00:02:51.480> shot

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
the fire rate goes down and your shot

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.970 
the fire rate goes down and your shot
will<00:02:51.810> become<00:02:52.050> more<00:02:52.170> accurate<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.860> can

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
will become more accurate so you can

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.460 
will become more accurate so you can
land<00:02:53.160> more<00:02:53.340> shots<00:02:53.820> on<00:02:54.090> your<00:02:54.300> target<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.200> it's

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
land more shots on your target so it's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.800 
land more shots on your target so it's
kind<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.160> PP<00:02:56.640> 90<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.180> morphs<00:02:57.540> into<00:02:57.600> an

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
kind of like a PP 90 that morphs into an

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.480 
kind of like a PP 90 that morphs into an
MP<00:02:58.050> 7<00:02:58.410> when<00:02:58.530> you're<00:02:58.650> shooting<00:02:58.830> at<00:02:59.040> long<00:02:59.220> range

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
MP 7 when you're shooting at long range

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.000 
MP 7 when you're shooting at long range
which<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.090> awesome<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:00.900> totally<00:03:01.410> speculation

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
which is awesome but totally speculation

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.590 
which is awesome but totally speculation
going<00:03:02.550> over<00:03:02.760> its<00:03:02.880> stats<00:03:03.120> they're<00:03:03.390> pretty

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
going over its stats they're pretty

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.510 
going over its stats they're pretty
average<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:04.110> has<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> 13<00:03:04.680> point<00:03:04.830> damage<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.430> a

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
average it has a 13 point damage in a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.370 
average it has a 13 point damage in a
12-point<00:03:05.820> range<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.390> accuracy<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.260> think

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
12-point range and accuracy so I think

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.290 
12-point range and accuracy so I think
this<00:03:07.590> gun<00:03:07.800> will<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.040> very<00:03:08.280> good<00:03:08.520> overall<00:03:09.000> as

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
this gun will be very good overall as

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.970 
this gun will be very good overall as
well<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.020> hope<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.320> guys<00:03:10.470> enjoyed<00:03:10.830> this

down<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> comments<00:03:15.780> because<00:03:16.020> I

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
down in the comments because I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.560 
down in the comments because I
personally<00:03:16.830> really<00:03:17.250> don't<00:03:17.640> but<00:03:18.150> anyways<00:03:18.390> I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
personally really don't but anyways I

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.880 
personally really don't but anyways I
thought<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:18.930> was<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.170> second<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.860> last

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
thought this was the second to last

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.890 
thought this was the second to last

pre-release weapon guide I was gonna do
but<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.260> remember<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> secondaries<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.459> I'm

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
but I remember the secondaries so I'm

but I remember the secondaries so I'm
