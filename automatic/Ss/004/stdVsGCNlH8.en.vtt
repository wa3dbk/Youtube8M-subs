00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.520
 we already made our entrance that are those 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.050
 vegetable pancakes that we have in the 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.700
 vegetable we have this protein of origin 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.280
 animal with the fish that is already 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.990
 cooking has the oven and well 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.210
 we need a bit of cereal 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.070
 then for the cereal and to have that 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.739
 balanced menu and very rich because the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.480
 truth is that the one that is balanced does not 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.369
 it means that we criticize taste we have 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.390
 been eating delicious and we have been 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.609
 included all food groups 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.019
 but what we lack is the cereal and 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.089
 cereal this time we're going to 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.679
 get with the rice so this is 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.609
 rice pudding plus dessert is left 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.960
 wonderful 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.910
 what do you think if we take note because 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.830
 let's see the ingredients for this 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.170
 rice pudding we're going to need a 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.310
 can of evaporated milk a can of 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.300
 condensed milk 4 cups cooked rice 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.820
 with a slice of cinnamon 4 eggs 2 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.640
 Scoops of Cinnamon Vanilla Essence 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 powder to decorate and also in 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.740
 red fruits to decorate this mobile from 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.510
 rice the truth is that it is also super 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.190
 simple and is 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.500
 now yes that one of the desserts that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.089
 we have to do at home frequently 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.979
 because I think everyone likes 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.409
 It's a version of rice pudding but 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.479
 a little bit modified and in a way 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.600
 different presentation then we go 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.610
 to prepare this rice pudding that good 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.899
 it is super simple the most important thing 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.729
 is that we have to have already cooked 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.549
 our rice if we already have rice 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.009
 well cooked well that is soft and 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.470
 we are on the other side we have the rice 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.090
 that we only cook it or what 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.310
 we met with water and a sprig of 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.229
 cinnamon nothing more and that is all that 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.000
 we need is the main ingredient 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.789
 so once the rust is 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.399
 cooked let's go here in the blender to 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.659
 put a right can condensed by 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.659
 course a milk can 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.890
 evaporate one of each vapor will make 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.289
 one of them started I'm here adding the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.909
 condensed you need the condensed 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.280
 in the thick one that is that his every time 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.350
 sweetened condensed milk 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.110
 so here we have the can of 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.969
 condensed milk condensed milk 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.530
 the rice that we have cooked I'm going to 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.000
 add to the end I'll put here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.540
 the eggs the four eggs 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 the vanilla is already ready let's go and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.500
 when all this and we are going to add 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.720
 after the rice 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.000
 at the end because because I like that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.220
 suddenly this rice pudding has a 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.960
 little bit of rice texture and if you read it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.540
 as from the beginning good 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.330
 then we can not handle so dental 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.100
 also if we want to get a little bit of 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.050
 rice texture let's add now 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.380
 if the rice to our blender and 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.090
 let's liquefy it slightly if 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.010
 they want more smooth if they want nothing more 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.110
 get the taste of rice so in 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.580
 rice pudding smoother because 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.280
 then they will leave it more time in the 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.930
 blender if they want the pudding that 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.690
 have slightly the texture of rice 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.970
 milestone then let's give it a few 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.900
 small liquefied and we're going to leave you there 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.280
 a few small groups of rice 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.190
 this 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.500
 when they want to do so what they want 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.720
 I suggest there is a magician in the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.660
 blender that nothing else is that ignites and 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.660
 turn off then let's go here to learn 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.850
 let's give it a little taps 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.280
 with the blender 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.650
 and that the grains of rice are unraveled 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.870
 but as you can see here there are still 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.180
 these little groups of rice that 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.240
 I like them very much so we're going 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.720
 Now here let to use 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.000
 put some of this mixture on planets 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.460
 on planets but we're going to cook them at 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.320
 bain- marie in the oven taking advantage of 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.290
 we already have the fish in the oven or 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.540
 another way of doing it is also in the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.550
 pot express if you do not like the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.100
 oven then in pot express too 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.620
 you can prepare it you have today express 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.440
 it also works very well or in orbyt or 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.860
 electric are also quite rich 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.660
 see nothing else in the mouth let's 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.890
 cover them with aluminum foil nothing more 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.890
 to prevent him from entering 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.310
 and then we're going to take around 60 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.900
 Baked minutes please bain marie 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.540
 like the water bath we have the one 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.609
 necessary if it reached the uita that 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.320
 has a little water just to the 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.720
 height of a quarter of the way to 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.220
 Do not jump too much and let's cover up 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.830
 all the way the general with a bit of 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.830
 aluminum foil and I said that I tell them that 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.860
 rice is the second most serial 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.350
 grown in the world after wheat 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.240
 the first is wheat and the second is 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.780
 the rice if it is that good they are data 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.780
 curious and interesting 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.940
 let's go here to cover this flannery is 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.280
 of course see here I have more mixture 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.230
 this means that this portion is going 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.970
 to yield around 6 to 8 servings 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:01.409
 let's now take it to the oven as you 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.809
 I said 60 minutes at 180 degrees centigrade 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.389
 is ready our pedestrian is cooking 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:09.179
 let's leave there the two of us let's go 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.879
 to read a booklet to enjoy a 

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:13.319
 little bit of the telenovela and with this we 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.139
 we go straight to the table in restitution 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:19.089
 so it's that comrades 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.409
 step by step rice pudding liquefies the 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.909
 two types of milk with rice 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.049
 eggs and vanilla pours some 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.209
 the mixture on the individual planets 

00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:27.009
 slightly fat bakes marie 

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.809
 for 60 minutes or until the 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.669
 introduce a stick this one comes out clean 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:34.199
 offers sprinkling with cinnamon in 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.199
 powder and decorate with fruits
