00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.259 
and he managed to convince me to try the
program<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.130> did

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.749 

because<00:00:23.269> I<00:00:23.630> think<00:00:24.320> everyone<00:00:25.130> should<00:00:25.160> detox

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
because I think everyone should detox

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.179 
because I think everyone should detox
once<00:00:26.029> in<00:00:26.179> a<00:00:26.269> while<00:00:26.480> because<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:27.679> food<00:00:28.009> now

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
once in a while because the food now

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.700 
once in a while because the food now
this<00:00:28.429> thing<00:00:28.460> is<00:00:28.820> not<00:00:29.119> as<00:00:29.269> pure<00:00:29.539> as<00:00:29.840> 20<00:00:30.529> years

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
this thing is not as pure as 20 years

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.250 
this thing is not as pure as 20 years
ago<00:00:31.160> you<00:00:31.220> know<00:00:31.489> every<00:00:31.970> food<00:00:32.239> even<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:32.989> fruits

organic otherwise our foods and

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.500 
organic otherwise our foods and
vegetables<00:00:38.540> are<00:00:39.140> you<00:00:39.620> do<00:00:39.800> food<00:00:40.040> parasites<00:00:41.030> and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
vegetables are you do food parasites and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.840 
vegetables are you do food parasites and
all<00:00:41.720> sorts<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:42.019> chemicals<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.890> our<00:00:43.370> meat<00:00:43.640> now

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
all sorts of chemicals and our meat now

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.240 
all sorts of chemicals and our meat now
this<00:00:44.149> is<00:00:44.420> also<00:00:44.930> you<00:00:44.989> know<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.559> angelicum

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
this is also you know the angelicum

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.649 
this is also you know the angelicum
hormones<00:00:46.760> chickens<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.690> cows<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:49.940> believe

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
hormones chickens and cows so I believe

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.240 
hormones chickens and cows so I believe
that<00:00:50.839> you<00:00:51.050> know<00:00:51.229> once<00:00:51.409> in<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:51.620> while<00:00:51.800> too<00:00:51.979> hot

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
that you know once in a while too hot

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.950 
that you know once in a while too hot
for<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:54.050> body<00:00:54.260> is<00:00:54.530> necessary

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.160 

I<00:01:00.050> think<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.010> process<00:01:01.340> of<00:01:01.940> this<00:01:02.660> five<00:01:02.899> days

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
I think the process of this five days

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.830 
I think the process of this five days
detox<00:01:03.739> is<00:01:03.980> much<00:01:04.519> easier<00:01:04.760> than<00:01:05.269> expected

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
detox is much easier than expected

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.469 
detox is much easier than expected
although<00:01:06.440> at<00:01:07.220> first<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.940> know<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.119> have<00:01:08.330> to

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
although at first you know you have to

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.690 
although at first you know you have to
stop<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.110> not<00:01:09.290> go<00:01:09.830> on<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.979> liquid<00:01:10.159> diet<00:01:10.369> for

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
stop and not go on a liquid diet for

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.460 
stop and not go on a liquid diet for
five<00:01:11.000> days<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.300> mean<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.810> was<00:01:11.960> tough<00:01:12.170> for<00:01:12.200> me<00:01:12.440> I
