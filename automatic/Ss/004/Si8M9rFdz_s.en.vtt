00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
ability at full health to destroy that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.490 
ability at full health to destroy that
wall<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.760> think<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.540> what<00:02:57.780> costs<00:02:58.320> him

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
wall and I think that is what costs him

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.800 
wall and I think that is what costs him

something you should be targeting

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.949 
something you should be targeting
especially<00:03:08.670> when<00:03:08.820> all<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.209> troops<00:03:09.510> were

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.690 
god what is going to happen but you see
skeleton<00:03:22.260> traps<00:03:22.530> are<00:03:22.709> popping<00:03:23.040> up<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.310> I

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
skeleton traps are popping up and I

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.220 
skeleton traps are popping up and I
guess<00:03:23.880> maybe<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.329> skeleton<00:03:24.720> traps<00:03:24.959> were<00:03:25.110> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
guess maybe the skeleton traps were the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.590 
guess maybe the skeleton traps were the
reason<00:03:25.530> why<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.709> raid<00:03:26.130> went<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.850> but

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
reason why this raid went to but

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.840 
reason why this raid went to but
