00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.469
 Let's get over there 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.910
 So what I showed him is the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 face is the right way to learn 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.829
 I know it 's cool to get to Manaus there. 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.989
 and give standing and get a smoke 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.120
 this is a front kick feedback but 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.030
 To get there, there's a way to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.520
 start from the ideal zero is this can get 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.559
 the direct skate train funai but there there 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.960
 at the front when you come face-to-face with a 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.780
 curve 70 per hour and not knowing a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.340
 decent position not knowing the limit of the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.010
 scream of the earth wheel great band and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.170
 Caciqueando , you'll miss it. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 start here and influence the time of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.489
 make the curves in the big is doing 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.619
 the curves in the tank at speedy and who 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.110
 knows how to do it from here well who passed 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.090
 for this school you will learn much more 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.340
 faster than the guy who went straight to 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.580
 Speedy and did not do this school 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.409
 then understood I'm dumb if the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.340
 he walks on his right foot in the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.409
 front 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.229
 What is the right positioning? I'm going to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.790
 put your hand on the floor and hold 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.340
 behind the leg 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.990
 usually the guys that are starting 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.369
 sure here looks ridiculous of one 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.170
 pause up to our boston that's what it is 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.689
 ridiculous is the galera knows 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.420
 popularly sorocaba avoid 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.909
 sorocaba do not be ashamed even ridiculous 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.700
 For the photo, then, guys, hold on. 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.270
 here behind hand on the floor remember 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 ghriba between the foot and the leg can also 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.119
 do without taking anything there only in elegance 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 role of the landu guys backside to 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.090
 me i'm booth 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.320
 We'll show you in the other one later. 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.320
 basic fatty east 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.350
 I enjoy holding 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.470
 on the side of the front foot there are people 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.860
 that even with him he comes here to give a 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.840
 best hand grip here foot with time 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.180
 it will come to the edge or closer 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.690
 the edge that is not so good here but 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:31.890
 first round goes well this way is the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:34.740
 time it will walk more than the front of the hand 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.750
 on the ground and going to practice will make a 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.209
 turn left until you pick up the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.660
 foot is loose on the skateboard and 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.850
 I'm starting to look a little ridiculous like this but 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.790
 evolution is to get here until 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:54.600
 then kicking a beck slide only gives one 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.239
 push and then go guys face 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.400
 Are you learning how to walk and what are you doing? 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.880
 your shit and what we showed is annoying 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.160
 for high fucking on but it is important 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.530
 also know how to fall from there as I have no 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.989
 Aging my foot is new I go 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:22.280
 ask the Fat East to teach how to 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:25.260
 wear knee well will wait for the best 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.440
 comes running and jumps from knee and 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.150
 first this is stupid thing o 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.370
 legacy has to have one less screw 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.320
 but this is how you will learn that there come 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.510
 running off the skateboard that running 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.340
 no sick and playing throws body to 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.070
 behind will not play forward 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.230
 scrap quickly and skateboard skips 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.390
 hitting leg has a speed that goes 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.630
 fall no knee brace is for that time 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.170
 that your leg does not win more touch of 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.739
 knee dont be toulouse is a fan 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.660
 I want to stay in the routine is and still more. 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.090
 My mother to her, right? 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.220
 the swamp that does not use better that was in the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.920
 goalkeeper guy 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.049
 folks it's not a shame to be caught all over 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.750
 world has been caught one day there are people who are 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.750
 forever smarter 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:25.290
 This gay kiss reminds nobody until 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.360
 who dies 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.410
 people are not ashamed nobody is born 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.419
 knowing 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.630
 nobody was born knowing how to walk talk 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.440
