with the Meath is that it it feels like

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.710 
with the Meath is that it it feels like
the<00:04:27.130> best<00:04:27.400> place<00:04:27.760> friend<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.180> know<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.450> feels

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
the best place friend I know it feels

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.780 
the best place friend I know it feels
like<00:04:29.020> it's<00:04:29.500> unlocking<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.310> best<00:04:30.520> that<00:04:30.760> she

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
like it's unlocking the best that she
