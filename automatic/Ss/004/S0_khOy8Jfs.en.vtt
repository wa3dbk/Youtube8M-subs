00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello and I want you today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.359
 show how fast a few choco 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.260
 you need professionals for that 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.049
 first of all boiling water cornflakes 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.370
 two spoons of different jams 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.310
 You can choose either 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.619
 white or brown chocolate you can 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.920
 Of course, then also did take bitter 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.289
 so who tastes ok and a bowl 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 in baking tray and baking paper first 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.320
 of course I take the white chocolate 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.320
 because i would like to be wise chocolate 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 cookies man and man went to melt 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.730
 and of course the jam completely 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.579
 it takes just a moment to break up 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.170
 small eternity and in time you can 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.079
 yes ever prepare the baking sheet 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.410
 with baking paper interpret around the well 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.410
 to place chocolate cookies on it 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.780
 so now is my wise jam 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.930
 molten 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:09.439
 then i can do my more complex now 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.830
 We always take 200 like that 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.830
 actually enough 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:27.579
 I hear that correctly that the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:39.340
 complex what of the white jam 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:42.429
 gets 200 and not always one 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:51.939
 a bit more complex jam on more like that 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:57.009
 was much on it and places it on the 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:59.200
 better off so and the chocolate cookies 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.090
 I leave now so dry about one 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.270
 half an hour until they are really hard 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.670
 It also varies in the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.140
 temperature of the room so sometimes one 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.399
 half an hour need the or one 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.640
 three quarters of an hour is always complete 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.930
 so after a good half 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.560
 hour I can already the chocolate cookies 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.000
