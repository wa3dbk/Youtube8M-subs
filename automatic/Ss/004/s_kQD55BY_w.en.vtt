00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
the same pace because if a guy like

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.530 
the same pace because if a guy like

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
Mikula gets too far of our lead we're

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.659 
Mikula gets too far of our lead we're
watching<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.019> computer<00:02:42.560> system<00:02:42.919> and<00:02:43.129> making

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
sure that he's not running too hot

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.959 
sure that he's not running too hot
meaning<00:02:45.590> his<00:02:45.680> rpms<00:02:46.219> are<00:02:46.370> over<00:02:46.639> thirty<00:02:46.909> six
