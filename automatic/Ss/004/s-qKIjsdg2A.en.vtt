it now this didn't come with the clip
and<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.960> probably<00:00:52.320> would<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.800> been<00:00:52.890> better

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

that open up not the ones that I put

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599 
that open up not the ones that I put
those<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.649> stick<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
those in there to kind of stick to it I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.820 
those in there to kind of stick to it I
tried<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> plastic<00:01:03.840> bag<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.589> didn't

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
tried the plastic bag that one didn't

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.260 
tried the plastic bag that one didn't
work<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.189> slipping<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.030> think

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
work it was slipping off but I think

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.270 
work it was slipping off but I think
saran<00:01:06.600> wrap<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> work<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
saran wrap is going to work and the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.160 
saran wrap is going to work and the
reason<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.580> using<00:01:08.640> saran<00:01:09.150> wrap<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.930> I

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
reason I'm using saran wrap is because I

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.480 
reason I'm using saran wrap is because I
want<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.590> able<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> protect<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.250> hair

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
want to be able to protect my hair

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.950 
want to be able to protect my hair
because<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:12.000> my<00:01:12.119> understanding<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.869> I've

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
because for my understanding what I've

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
because for my understanding what I've
been<00:01:13.080> hearing<00:01:13.320> wigs<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.490> chemicals<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
been hearing wigs have chemicals in it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.560 
been hearing wigs have chemicals in it
and<00:01:15.540> dies<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.820> hair<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.060> fight

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and dies in it that your hair will fight

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.840 
and dies in it that your hair will fight
against<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
against it and so it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.820 
against it and so it
not<00:01:19.939> really<00:01:20.210> good<00:01:20.510> for<00:01:20.540> your<00:01:20.750> hair<00:01:21.020> but<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:21.740> a

not really good for your hair but it's a
