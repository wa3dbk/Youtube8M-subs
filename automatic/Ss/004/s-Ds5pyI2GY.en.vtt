00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.059
 we start with you complex 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
 functional exercises in modern 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.990
 fitness is the most 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
 effective kind of training due to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.900
 what are you building neutral 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.490
 body position you connect 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 more muscle groups as 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.220
 our stabilizers and decide right away 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.689
 several tasks for this exercise 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.609
 put your legs on the width of your pelvic bones 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.040
 feet must be parallel to each other 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.930
 knees slightly flattened align 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.140
 back and take a neutral position 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.480
 back shoulders down lowering the shoulder blades 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.790
 and tighten abdominal muscles failure should 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 stay parallel while holding 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.710
 knees on the spot moves us back 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.059
 starting work with squats 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.950
 knees should stay in place for 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.300
 This transfer weight more on the back 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.010
 part of the foot that is on the heels 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.850
 in the next progression we will add 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.230
 balance through lifting your knees in front of you 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.980
 raise your knee holding us 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.250
 parallel with the floor slowly down and slowly 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.150
 no need to hurry up every complication 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.460
 try to perform 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:17.030
 8 to 20 times when moving up we do 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.060
 exhale deep breath in and out exhale 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.610
 next complication we add 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.630
 extra work of muscle groups is 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.140
 handcuffing do not forget 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:34.550
 that spreading our arms to the sides we direct 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.610
 palm up so we are even better 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.660
 cheers align our posture add 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.500
 static mode 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.509
 this pause and hold pause also 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:52.640
 controls neutral posture 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:55.190
 with a sedan from the next progression we 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.009
 you add body twisting this 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.020
 our study to systems at CEC 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.009
 lifting the right leg we curl 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:08.610
 to the right and also when climbing left through 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.780
 deep breath curl left 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:17.850
 by analogy with the previous and and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:23.730
 exercises performed 8 to 20 times 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.730
 shoulders down thigh parallel
