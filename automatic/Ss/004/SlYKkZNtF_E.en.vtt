in<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.620> lesson<00:00:01.829> we'll<00:00:02.070> give<00:00:02.220> an

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
in this lesson we'll give an

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.490 
in this lesson we'll give an
introduction<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:03.090> editable<00:00:03.449> geometry<00:00:04.290> and

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
introduction to editable geometry and

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.530 
introduction to editable geometry and
how<00:00:04.529> we<00:00:04.890> can<00:00:05.100> manipulate<00:00:05.339> their<00:00:05.879> sub<00:00:06.150> object

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
how we can manipulate their sub object

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.640 
how we can manipulate their sub object
modes<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.170> begin<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.560> modeling<00:00:07.980> process<00:00:09.650> now

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
modes to begin the modeling process now

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.499 
modes to begin the modeling process now
before<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.130> begin<00:00:11.280> our<00:00:11.460> project<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.179> think<00:00:12.240> it's

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
before we begin our project I think it's

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.660 
before we begin our project I think it's
really<00:00:12.900> really<00:00:13.080> important<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> solid

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
really really important to have a solid

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.760 
really really important to have a solid
understanding<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.570> how<00:00:15.719> editable<00:00:16.170> geometry

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
understanding of how editable geometry

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.700 
understanding of how editable geometry
behaves<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.640> order<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.570> create<00:00:19.080> some<00:00:19.380> stunning

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
behaves in order to create some stunning

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.910 
behaves in order to create some stunning
3d<00:00:20.250> geometry<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.320> said<00:00:22.560> let's<00:00:22.800> go

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
3d geometry so with that said let's go

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.400 
3d geometry so with that said let's go
ahead<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.279> create<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:23.990> primitives<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.230> our

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
ahead and create some primitives in our

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.650 
ahead and create some primitives in our
scene<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.099> actually<00:00:26.430> discover<00:00:26.910> how<00:00:27.630> we

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
scene so we can actually discover how we

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.750 
scene so we can actually discover how we
can<00:00:27.990> convert<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> an<00:00:28.740> editable<00:00:28.980> geometry

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
can convert it to an editable geometry

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.510 
can convert it to an editable geometry
to<00:00:30.029> start<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> modeling<00:00:30.869> process<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.369> we're

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
to start the modeling process so we're

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.340 
to start the modeling process so we're
going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.149> create<00:00:33.540> panel<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
going to go to the create panel and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.049 
going to go to the create panel and
we're<00:00:35.070> gonna<00:00:35.190> make<00:00:35.370> sure<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.550> we're<00:00:35.790> under

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we're gonna make sure that we're under

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.060 
we're gonna make sure that we're under
geometry<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> where<00:00:37.469> our<00:00:37.500> 3d

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
geometry because this is where our 3d

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
geometry because this is where our 3d
primitives<00:00:38.640> are<00:00:38.820> actually<00:00:39.239> held<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.840> then

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
primitives are actually held and then

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
primitives are actually held and then
we're<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.890> go<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.059> box<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.540> can

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
we're going to go to just a box you can

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
we're going to go to just a box you can
use<00:00:42.690> really<00:00:43.079> any<00:00:43.170> primitive<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> want

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
use really any primitive that you want

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
use really any primitive that you want
here<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.390> gonna<00:00:45.510> drag<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> box<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.739> I'm

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here but I'm gonna drag out a box so I'm

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770 
here but I'm gonna drag out a box so I'm
just<00:00:46.980> gonna<00:00:47.190> use<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:47.520> left<00:00:47.910> mouse<00:00:48.120> button<00:00:48.149> hold

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
just gonna use my left mouse button hold

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.130 
just gonna use my left mouse button hold
it<00:00:48.960> down<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.469> drag<00:00:49.640> out<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.149> base<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it down and drag out the base of this

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.880 
it down and drag out the base of this
box<00:00:52.789> once<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> desired<00:00:54.600> size<00:00:55.260> I'm<00:00:55.800> going

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
box once I have a desired size I'm going

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.380 
box once I have a desired size I'm going
to<00:00:56.070> go<00:00:56.160> ahead<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.460> release<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.789> left<00:00:57.210> mouse

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to go ahead and release that left mouse

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.790 
to go ahead and release that left mouse
button<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.840> you'll<00:00:58.020> notice<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.620> we're

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
button and you'll notice that as we're

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400 
button and you'll notice that as we're
moving<00:00:59.160> our<00:00:59.280> mouse<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.850> down<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.960> giving

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
moving our mouse up and down it's giving

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.310 
moving our mouse up and down it's giving
us<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.770> height<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.460> our<00:01:02.489> box<00:01:03.000> now<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> actually

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
us a height for our box now to actually

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.530 
us a height for our box now to actually
finalize<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.339> height<00:01:05.549> we'll<00:01:05.850> click<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.510> time

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
finalize the height we'll click one time

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.719 
finalize the height we'll click one time
with<00:01:06.990> our<00:01:07.020> left<00:01:07.320> mouse<00:01:07.409> button<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
with our left mouse button and now the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.350 
with our left mouse button and now the
box<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.680> finalized<00:01:10.790> now<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> do

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
box is finalized now what I want to do

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
box is finalized now what I want to do
at<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.570> point<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.930> go<00:01:13.080> ahead<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.350> maximize

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
at this point is go ahead and maximize

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.990 
at this point is go ahead and maximize
this<00:01:14.580> viewport<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
this viewport so I'm going to do that

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.160 
this viewport so I'm going to do that
just<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.960> bit

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
just so we can see this a little bit

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
just so we can see this a little bit
easier<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.420> do

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
easier and what I really like to do

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.719 
easier and what I really like to do
whenever<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.049> start<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> modeling<00:01:22.920> process<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
whenever I start the modeling process is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.649 
whenever I start the modeling process is
show<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:25.049> edge<00:01:25.259> faces<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.490> model<00:01:26.970> because

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
show my edge faces on my model because

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
show my edge faces on my model because
this<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.049> shows<00:01:28.439> me<00:01:28.740> how<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.640> model<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
this really shows me how this model is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.249 
this really shows me how this model is
made<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.770> hit<00:01:31.920> f4<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.700> my<00:01:32.850> keyboard

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
made up so if I hit f4 on my keyboard

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.319 
made up so if I hit f4 on my keyboard
you'll<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> edge<00:01:34.740> faces<00:01:35.340> turns<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you'll see the edge faces turns on and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.109 
you'll see the edge faces turns on and
you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.439> top<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.070> model<00:01:38.310> now

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you can see them on top of the model now

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.660 
you can see them on top of the model now
this<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.780> allows<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.890> how<00:01:41.430> this

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this really allows you to see how this

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.560 
this really allows you to see how this
piece<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.090> geometry<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.470> made<00:01:43.740> okay<00:01:44.640> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
piece of geometry is really made okay so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
piece of geometry is really made okay so
let's<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:45.990> ahead<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.560> modify

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
let's go ahead and go to our modify

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.990 
let's go ahead and go to our modify
panel<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.790> start<00:01:48.240> editing<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.960> geometry<00:01:50.000> so

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
panel and start editing this geometry so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
panel and start editing this geometry so
if<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.750> modify<00:01:52.350> panel<00:01:52.619> you'll<00:01:52.950> notice

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
if I go to my modify panel you'll notice

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.600 
if I go to my modify panel you'll notice
that<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.670> box<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:55.350> box<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:56.009> really

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that this box is just a box it's really

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.270 
that this box is just a box it's really
not<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:57.090> edible<00:01:57.450> piece<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.960> geometry<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.860> yet

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
not an edible piece of geometry just yet

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.490 
not an edible piece of geometry just yet
the<00:01:59.939> only<00:02:00.270> thing<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.840> edit<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.320> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the only thing that I can edit at this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.249 
the only thing that I can edit at this
point<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.979> they<00:02:02.159> length<00:02:02.430> width<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.450> height<00:02:03.540> as

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
point is they length width and height as

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.459 
point is they length width and height as
well<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.740> any<00:02:04.920> segments<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.119> box<00:02:06.420> okay

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
well as any segments on this box okay

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.859 
well as any segments on this box okay
so<00:02:08.220> let's<00:02:08.700> go<00:02:08.819> ahead<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.119> convert<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.690> over

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
so let's go ahead and convert this over

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.229 
so let's go ahead and convert this over
to<00:02:10.110> an<00:02:10.200> editable<00:02:10.500> piece<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.950> geometry<00:02:11.250> in

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
to an editable piece of geometry in

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.850 
to an editable piece of geometry in
Street<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.810> try<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.110> work<00:02:13.379> this<00:02:13.560> out

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
Street and try to work this out

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.520 
Street and try to work this out
here<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.550> let's<00:02:14.730> go<00:02:14.820> ahead<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.060> right-click

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
here so let's go ahead and right-click

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.960 
here so let's go ahead and right-click
we're<00:02:16.530> going<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.710> go<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.950> convert<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.670> and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
we're going to go to convert to and

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.760 
we're going to go to convert to and
you'll<00:02:18.720> notice<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:19.410> some<00:02:19.590> different

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
you'll notice that we get some different

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.250 
you'll notice that we get some different
selections<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.850> choose<00:02:21.090> from<00:02:21.390> we

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
selections that we can choose from we

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.860 
selections that we can choose from we
can<00:02:22.440> convert<00:02:22.740> this<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.100> an<00:02:23.220> editable<00:02:23.340> mesh<00:02:23.870> but

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
can convert this to an editable mesh but

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.690 
can convert this to an editable mesh but
what<00:02:25.140> we're<00:02:25.290> going<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.560> use<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.920> editable<00:02:26.400> poly

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
what we're going to use is editable poly

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.780 
what we're going to use is editable poly
now<00:02:27.510> editable<00:02:28.140> poly<00:02:28.470> has<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> lot<00:02:29.250> more<00:02:29.520> tools

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
now editable poly has a lot more tools

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.850 
now editable poly has a lot more tools
than<00:02:30.120> editable<00:02:30.540> mesh<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.650> why

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
than editable mesh and so that's why

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.490 
than editable mesh and so that's why
we're<00:02:32.100> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> use<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.790> more<00:02:33.110> often<00:02:34.110> than

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
we're going to use it more often than

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.890 
we're going to use it more often than
not<00:02:34.530> inside<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.400> 3ds<00:02:35.610> max<00:02:35.790> you're<00:02:36.540> actually

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
not inside of 3ds max you're actually

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.560 
not inside of 3ds max you're actually
going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.170> using<00:02:37.500> editable<00:02:38.130> poly<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.390> let's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
going to be using editable poly so let's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.680 
going to be using editable poly so let's
go<00:02:39.690> ahead<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.840> choose<00:02:40.020> editable<00:02:40.410> poly<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
go ahead and choose editable poly and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.300 
go ahead and choose editable poly and
you'll<00:02:42.690> now<00:02:42.840> notice<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.830> no<00:02:44.130> longer

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
you'll now notice that this is no longer

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.360 
you'll now notice that this is no longer
a<00:02:44.640> box<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.720> now<00:02:45.900> an<00:02:46.170> editable<00:02:46.560> poly<00:02:46.680> piece

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
a box it is now an editable poly piece

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.660 
a box it is now an editable poly piece
of<00:02:47.550> geometry<00:02:47.850> okay<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.830> whenever<00:02:50.070> we<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:50.400> an

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
of geometry okay so whenever we have an

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.449 
of geometry okay so whenever we have an
editable<00:02:50.970> poly<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.959> actually<00:02:52.170> access<00:02:52.770> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
editable poly we can actually access the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.790 
editable poly we can actually access the
different<00:02:53.790> pieces<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.900> geometry<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
different pieces of this geometry and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.010 
different pieces of this geometry and
those<00:02:56.340> different<00:02:56.730> pieces<00:02:56.940> are<00:02:57.270> called<00:02:57.420> sub

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
those different pieces are called sub

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.340 
those different pieces are called sub
objects<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.550> if<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.940> expand<00:03:00.450> out<00:03:00.630> my<00:03:00.930> editable

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
objects so if I expand out my editable

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.100 
objects so if I expand out my editable
poly<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.580> can<00:03:02.760> see<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.090> we<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.390> vertices

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
poly you can see that we have vertices

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.580 
poly you can see that we have vertices
edges<00:03:05.030> borders<00:03:06.030> polygons<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:07.170> well<00:03:07.440> as

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
edges borders polygons as well as

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.340 
edges borders polygons as well as
elements<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:09.120> these<00:03:09.390> different<00:03:09.810> sub<00:03:09.989> object

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
elements of these different sub object

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.040 
elements of these different sub object
modes<00:03:10.590> okay<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.330> let's<00:03:12.660> go<00:03:12.780> ahead<00:03:12.959> and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
modes okay so let's go ahead and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.949 
modes okay so let's go ahead and
discover<00:03:13.410> each<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.790> these<00:03:14.970> well<00:03:15.660> actually

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
discover each one of these well actually

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.090 
discover each one of these well actually
I'm<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.200> going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.500> talk<00:03:16.590> about<00:03:16.709> three<00:03:17.070> of

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
I'm just going to talk about three of

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.320 
I'm just going to talk about three of
these<00:03:17.250> I'm<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.580> talk<00:03:17.670> about<00:03:17.790> vertex

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
these I'm going to talk about vertex

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.840 
these I'm going to talk about vertex
first<00:03:18.709> we're<00:03:19.709> going<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.920> talk<00:03:20.070> about<00:03:20.100> edge<00:03:20.489> and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
first we're going to talk about edge and

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.880 
first we're going to talk about edge and
then<00:03:21.030> we'll<00:03:21.150> talk<00:03:21.299> about<00:03:21.360> polygons<00:03:22.110> as<00:03:22.440> well

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
then we'll talk about polygons as well

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.220 
then we'll talk about polygons as well
because<00:03:23.580> these<00:03:23.730> are<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.090> major<00:03:24.390> sub<00:03:24.840> object

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
because these are the major sub object

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.870 
because these are the major sub object
modes<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.530> you'll<00:03:25.680> be<00:03:25.830> dealing<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.280> during

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
modes that you'll be dealing with during

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.780 
modes that you'll be dealing with during
the<00:03:26.970> modeling<00:03:27.360> process<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:29.070> let's<00:03:29.580> go<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the modeling process so let's go to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.940 
the modeling process so let's go to
vertex<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.540> you'll<00:03:31.320> notice<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.769> whenever

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
vertex and you'll notice that whenever

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.759 
vertex and you'll notice that whenever
we<00:03:32.250> highlight<00:03:32.730> vertex<00:03:33.239> or<00:03:33.510> activate<00:03:34.230> vertex

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
we highlight vertex or activate vertex

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.970 
we highlight vertex or activate vertex
mode<00:03:35.040> you'll<00:03:36.000> see<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.510> we<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.380> click<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
mode you'll see that we can click on the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.759 
mode you'll see that we can click on the
different<00:03:38.220> points<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.840> geometry<00:03:40.290> and

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
different points of this geometry and

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
we are moving vertices around we are

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.130 
we are moving vertices around we are
moving<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.530> smallest<00:03:47.010> point<00:03:47.519> possible<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.630> an

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
editable piece of geometry now notice

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.750 
editable piece of geometry now notice
the<00:03:51.690> behavior<00:03:52.290> you'll<00:03:53.040> notice<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.549> whenever

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
the behavior you'll notice that whenever

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.210 
the behavior you'll notice that whenever
we<00:03:54.000> are<00:03:54.120> moving<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:54.660> vertex<00:03:55.110> we<00:03:55.680> are<00:03:55.799> also

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
we are moving this vertex we are also

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.120 
we are moving this vertex we are also
adjusting<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.299> edges<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.410> are<00:03:58.560> connected

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
adjusting the edges that are connected

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.210 
adjusting the edges that are connected
to<00:03:59.340> this<00:03:59.580> vertex<00:04:00.299> okay<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.830> you'll<00:04:02.010> notice

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
to this vertex okay so you'll notice

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.270 
to this vertex okay so you'll notice
that<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.670> one<00:04:03.390> below<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.989> is<00:04:04.200> getting<00:04:04.980> longer

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
that the one below it is getting longer

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.509 
that the one below it is getting longer
as<00:04:05.970> well<00:04:06.209> as<00:04:06.390> these<00:04:06.570> are<00:04:06.780> changing<00:04:07.290> direction

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
as well as these are changing direction

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.090 
as well as these are changing direction
okay<00:04:08.690> now<00:04:09.690> let's<00:04:09.989> go<00:04:10.110> ahead<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.410> move<00:04:10.530> over<00:04:10.769> to

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
okay now let's go ahead and move over to

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.660 
okay now let's go ahead and move over to
edge<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:12.360> we've<00:04:13.320> kind<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.650> touched<00:04:14.430> on<00:04:14.610> this

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
edge and we've kind of touched on this

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.390 
edge and we've kind of touched on this
just<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.120> little<00:04:15.269> bit<00:04:15.560> but<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:16.709> we<00:04:16.859> select<00:04:17.070> an

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
just a little bit but if we select an

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.380 
just a little bit but if we select an
edge<00:04:18.590> we<00:04:19.590> can<00:04:19.769> move<00:04:19.979> this<00:04:20.370> let<00:04:21.060> me<00:04:21.150> grab<00:04:21.359> that

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
edge we can move this let me grab that

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.630 
edge we can move this let me grab that
again<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:22.229> can<00:04:22.410> move<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.770> up<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.130> down<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
again we can move this up and down and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.310 
again we can move this up and down and
you'll<00:04:23.760> notice<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.419> is<00:04:24.630> now<00:04:24.840> moving

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
you'll notice that this is now moving

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.670 
you'll notice that this is now moving
this<00:04:25.830> corner

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
this corner

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.010 
this corner
well<00:04:26.770> as<00:04:26.919> this<00:04:27.100> corner<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:28.389> an<00:04:28.540> edge<00:04:28.750> is

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
well as this corner so an edge is

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.290 
well as this corner so an edge is
actually<00:04:29.259> made<00:04:29.740> up<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:30.160> at<00:04:30.490> least<00:04:30.850> two

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
actually made up of at least two

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.279 
actually made up of at least two
vertices<00:04:31.810> on<00:04:32.290> each<00:04:33.040> end<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:34.050> you'll<00:04:35.050> notice

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
vertices on each end so you'll notice

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.140 
vertices on each end so you'll notice
that<00:04:35.560> as<00:04:35.740> I'm<00:04:35.949> editing<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.639> I'm<00:04:36.880> actually

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
that as I'm editing this I'm actually

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.090 
that as I'm editing this I'm actually
editing<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.990> little<00:04:38.289> bit<00:04:38.410> more<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.949> the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
editing a little bit more of the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.279 
editing a little bit more of the
geometry<00:04:39.850> than<00:04:40.539> compared<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.229> vertex<00:04:41.979> mode<00:04:43.289> so

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
geometry than compared to vertex mode so

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.499 
geometry than compared to vertex mode so
let's<00:04:44.500> go<00:04:44.650> ahead<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.889> move<00:04:45.130> on<00:04:45.310> up<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.520> polygon

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
let's go ahead and move on up to polygon

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.010 
let's go ahead and move on up to polygon
mode<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:47.639> let<00:04:48.639> me<00:04:48.729> select<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.210> polygon<00:04:49.449> here

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
mode and let me select a polygon here

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.469 
mode and let me select a polygon here
and<00:04:50.199> you'll<00:04:50.650> notice<00:04:50.889> that<00:04:51.190> this<00:04:51.340> is<00:04:51.400> going<00:04:52.270> to

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
and you'll notice that this is going to

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.159 
and you'll notice that this is going to
move<00:04:52.690> four<00:04:53.590> edges<00:04:54.220> at<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.669> same<00:04:54.910> time<00:04:55.210> or<00:04:55.449> even

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
move four edges at the same time or even

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.790 
move four edges at the same time or even
four<00:04:56.440> vertices<00:04:57.070> at<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.970> same<00:04:58.210> time<00:04:58.539> so<00:04:59.410> what

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
four vertices at the same time so what

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.820 
four vertices at the same time so what
we're<00:04:59.979> doing<00:05:00.010> here<00:05:00.280> is<00:05:00.610> we're<00:05:00.760> actually<00:05:00.970> added

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
we're doing here is we're actually added

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.820 
we're doing here is we're actually added
editing<00:05:02.830> more<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:03.910> mass<00:05:04.530> now<00:05:05.530> whenever

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
editing more of the mass now whenever

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.830 
editing more of the mass now whenever
we're<00:05:06.190> working<00:05:06.550> with<00:05:06.699> polygons<00:05:07.300> during<00:05:07.750> the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
we're working with polygons during the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.260 
we're working with polygons during the
modeling<00:05:08.080> process<00:05:08.800> we're<00:05:09.520> actually<00:05:09.760> trying

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
modeling process we're actually trying

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.290 
modeling process we're actually trying
to<00:05:10.539> edit<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:11.110> major<00:05:11.380> masses<00:05:12.190> of<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.729> object

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
to edit the major masses of the object

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.240 
to edit the major masses of the object
so<00:05:13.479> what<00:05:13.660> we're<00:05:13.810> trying<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.289> do<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.830> just

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
so what we're trying to do is just

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.629 
so what we're trying to do is just
trying<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.550> get<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:16.060> rough<00:05:16.960> idea<00:05:17.650> of<00:05:17.949> this

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
trying to get a rough idea of this

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.460 
trying to get a rough idea of this
object<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.240> we're<00:05:19.449> trying<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.870> create<00:05:20.050> so

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
object that we're trying to create so

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.170 
object that we're trying to create so
let's<00:05:20.650> say<00:05:20.770> we're<00:05:20.919> trying<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.310> create<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.849> trash

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
let's say we're trying to create a trash

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.800 
let's say we're trying to create a trash
can<00:05:22.479> we<00:05:23.229> can<00:05:23.410> move<00:05:23.650> polygons<00:05:24.340> around<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:25.570> get

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
can we can move polygons around to get

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.930 
can we can move polygons around to get
just<00:05:26.139> kind<00:05:26.289> of<00:05:26.410> a<00:05:26.500> rough<00:05:26.800> idea<00:05:27.220> of<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.460> look<00:05:27.759> of

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
just kind of a rough idea of the look of

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.909 
just kind of a rough idea of the look of
it<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.210> then<00:05:28.990> we'll<00:05:29.169> move<00:05:29.320> into<00:05:29.500> edge<00:05:29.889> mode

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
it and then we'll move into edge mode

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.760 
it and then we'll move into edge mode
and<00:05:30.580> vertex<00:05:31.419> mode<00:05:31.660> to<00:05:31.900> get<00:05:32.020> some<00:05:32.260> of<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.470> finer

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
and vertex mode to get some of the finer

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.080 
and vertex mode to get some of the finer

you're going to hear whenever we're

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.930 
you're going to hear whenever we're
working<00:05:42.220> with<00:05:42.760> polygons<00:05:43.590> okay<00:05:44.590> so<00:05:45.280> with<00:05:45.729> this

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
working with polygons okay so with this

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.659 
working with polygons okay so with this
polygon<00:05:46.449> selected<00:05:47.169> you<00:05:47.740> may<00:05:47.979> hear<00:05:48.280> me<00:05:48.430> say

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
polygon selected you may hear me say

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.339 
polygon selected you may hear me say
okay<00:05:49.090> let's<00:05:49.389> go<00:05:49.539> ahead<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:49.840> select<00:05:50.199> this

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
okay let's go ahead and select this

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.520 
okay let's go ahead and select this
triangle<00:05:51.250> now<00:05:52.030> all<00:05:52.449> I'm<00:05:52.810> talking<00:05:53.050> about<00:05:53.349> is

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
triangle now all I'm talking about is

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.939 
triangle now all I'm talking about is
selecting<00:05:54.340> a<00:05:54.490> polygon<00:05:55.090> that<00:05:55.510> has<00:05:56.020> three<00:05:56.680> sides

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
selecting a polygon that has three sides

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.740 
selecting a polygon that has three sides
okay<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.789> triangle<00:05:58.919> now<00:05:59.940> you<00:06:00.940> might<00:06:01.180> also<00:06:01.210> hear

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
okay a triangle now you might also hear

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.080 
okay a triangle now you might also hear
me<00:06:01.930> talk<00:06:02.169> about<00:06:02.500> let's<00:06:02.860> select<00:06:03.190> this<00:06:03.400> quad<00:06:03.760> or

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
me talk about let's select this quad or

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.409 
me talk about let's select this quad or
this<00:06:04.300> polygon<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:06.150> basically<00:06:07.150> what<00:06:07.330> I'm

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
this polygon and basically what I'm

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.870 
this polygon and basically what I'm
saying<00:06:07.449> is<00:06:08.080> we're<00:06:08.560> selecting<00:06:09.039> a<00:06:09.130> polygon<00:06:09.610> with

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
saying is we're selecting a polygon with

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.350 
saying is we're selecting a polygon with
four<00:06:10.240> sides<00:06:10.860> now<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:11.889> quad<00:06:12.430> is<00:06:12.820> something<00:06:13.210> that

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
four sides now a quad is something that

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.689 
four sides now a quad is something that
we<00:06:13.510> really<00:06:13.539> want<00:06:14.229> to<00:06:14.289> strive<00:06:14.620> for<00:06:14.680> during<00:06:15.520> our

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
we really want to strive for during our

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.790 
we really want to strive for during our
modeling<00:06:16.270> process<00:06:16.870> we<00:06:17.110> want<00:06:17.260> to<00:06:17.380> try<00:06:17.560> and<00:06:17.590> keep

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
modeling process we want to try and keep

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.180 
modeling process we want to try and keep
all<00:06:18.070> polygons<00:06:18.760> quads<00:06:19.270> as<00:06:19.720> much<00:06:20.349> as<00:06:20.560> possible

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
all polygons quads as much as possible

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.159 
all polygons quads as much as possible
because<00:06:21.760> this<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.240> really<00:06:22.539> going<00:06:22.659> to<00:06:22.720> help<00:06:22.960> out

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
because this is really going to help out

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.770 
because this is really going to help out
whenever<00:06:23.409> we<00:06:23.650> start<00:06:24.039> smoothing<00:06:24.479> some<00:06:25.479> of<00:06:25.630> our

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
whenever we start smoothing some of our

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.629 
whenever we start smoothing some of our
different<00:06:26.229> objects<00:06:26.830> and<00:06:27.130> we'll<00:06:27.280> talk<00:06:27.490> about

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
different objects and we'll talk about

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.680 
different objects and we'll talk about
smoothing<00:06:28.270> in<00:06:28.419> in<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:29.020> later<00:06:29.229> lessons<00:06:29.830> okay

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
smoothing in in the later lessons okay

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.990 
smoothing in in the later lessons okay
now<00:06:31.690> another<00:06:32.050> term<00:06:32.830> that<00:06:32.860> you<00:06:33.159> might<00:06:33.430> hear<00:06:33.789> is

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
now another term that you might hear is

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.339 
now another term that you might hear is
called<00:06:34.330> end<00:06:34.750> gonns

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
called end gonns

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.800 
called end gonns
and<00:06:35.500> an<00:06:35.860> end<00:06:36.070> gonn<00:06:36.340> is<00:06:36.550> basically<00:06:36.969> a<00:06:37.120> polygon

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
and an end gonn is basically a polygon

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.499 
and an end gonn is basically a polygon
that<00:06:38.139> has<00:06:38.710> more<00:06:39.130> than<00:06:39.310> four<00:06:39.639> side

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:40.509 
that has more than four side

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.040 
that has more than four side
so<00:06:41.370> whenever<00:06:42.370> we<00:06:42.550> have<00:06:42.880> in<00:06:43.120> Gon's<00:06:43.419> we<00:06:43.720> can<00:06:43.870> have

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
so whenever we have in Gon's we can have

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.870 
so whenever we have in Gon's we can have
five<00:06:44.349> six<00:06:44.949> you<00:06:45.610> know<00:06:45.729> even<00:06:46.479> 20<00:06:46.900> sides<00:06:47.229> on<00:06:47.710> a

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
five six you know even 20 sides on a

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.339 
five six you know even 20 sides on a
polygon<00:06:48.880> and<00:06:49.270> this<00:06:49.960> could<00:06:50.169> be<00:06:50.199> really

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
polygon and this could be really

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.909 
polygon and this could be really
destructive<00:06:52.110> especially<00:06:53.110> if<00:06:53.199> this<00:06:53.440> model<00:06:53.830> is

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
destructive especially if this model is

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.129 
destructive especially if this model is
going<00:06:54.039> to<00:06:54.099> be<00:06:54.190> used<00:06:54.490> for<00:06:54.580> animation<00:06:55.240> so

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
going to be used for animation so

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:57.779 
going to be used for animation so
whenever<00:06:56.470> we<00:06:56.740> have<00:06:56.770> end<00:06:57.220> gonns

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
whenever we have end gonns

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.290 
whenever we have end gonns
those<00:06:58.569> that<00:06:58.990> that<00:06:59.380> one<00:06:59.710> end<00:06:59.979> gone<00:07:00.190> may<00:07:00.490> tear<00:07:01.120> up

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
those that that one end gone may tear up

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.050 
those that that one end gone may tear up
it<00:07:01.509> may<00:07:01.780> pinch<00:07:02.139> in<00:07:02.440> weird<00:07:02.680> places<00:07:02.889> so<00:07:03.849> we

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
it may pinch in weird places so we

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.350 
it may pinch in weird places so we
really<00:07:04.509> really<00:07:04.720> want<00:07:04.990> to<00:07:05.050> strive<00:07:05.349> for<00:07:05.440> quads

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
really really want to strive for quads

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.170 
really really want to strive for quads
whenever<00:07:07.360> we're<00:07:07.599> modeling<00:07:08.020> okay<00:07:08.490> so<00:07:09.490> in<00:07:10.000> this

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
whenever we're modeling okay so in this

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.999 
whenever we're modeling okay so in this
lesson<00:07:10.479> we've<00:07:10.840> really<00:07:11.229> taken<00:07:11.620> a<00:07:11.680> look<00:07:11.860> at

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.009 
lesson we've really taken a look at

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.850 
lesson we've really taken a look at
editing<00:07:12.360> and<00:07:13.360> how<00:07:13.690> we<00:07:13.750> can<00:07:14.020> manipulate<00:07:14.319> some

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 
editing and how we can manipulate some

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.379 
editing and how we can manipulate some
of<00:07:14.949> those<00:07:15.039> different<00:07:15.460> sub<00:07:15.669> object<00:07:16.030> modes<00:07:16.210> and

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389 
of those different sub object modes and

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:19.020 
of those different sub object modes and
how<00:07:16.449> they<00:07:16.750> behave<00:07:16.960> and<00:07:17.620> in<00:07:18.370> the<00:07:18.490> next<00:07:18.729> lesson

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
how they behave and in the next lesson

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.399 
how they behave and in the next lesson
we're<00:07:19.360> going<00:07:19.479> to<00:07:19.539> get<00:07:19.690> an<00:07:19.780> introduction<00:07:20.380> to

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:20.409 
we're going to get an introduction to

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:23.610 
we're going to get an introduction to
splines<00:07:21.039> and<00:07:21.490> how<00:07:22.060> we<00:07:22.120> can<00:07:22.479> use<00:07:22.690> them<00:07:23.050> during

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:23.620 
splines and how we can use them during

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.729 
splines and how we can use them during
the<00:07:23.740> modeling<00:07:23.949> process
