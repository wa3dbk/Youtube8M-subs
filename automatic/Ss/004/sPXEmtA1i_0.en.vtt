00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.120
 I'm here straight from the river senai 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.609
 January for the first meeting of the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.220
 Brazil closes the event promoted by 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.619
 cetic that will transform the life of nine 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
 fashion students from all over the country 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.019
 here they will participate in meetings 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.199
 with the curators consultant stylists 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.000
 fashion best known today 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.190
 the idea is that at the end of three meetings 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.149
 they are prepared for a great 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.219
 parade where top renowned models will 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.160
 enter the catwalk with your creations 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:51.539
 and we are here to see all this 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:55.070
 question how do you discover a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.070
 talent is the big question 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.580
 the activity we look at drawings 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.309
 and the idea is to choose the best 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.870
 among those who passed through Siena or 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.550
 who are still studying in Siena I 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.350
 encounter that no one here is teaching 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.570
 nothing to anyone 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.030
 It's an exchange but we 're counting. 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.070
 very particular experiences of 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.590
 how it all happened and get in touch with 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.870
 these enriching stories not only 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.680
 for students but for those who 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.660
 they are not influenced by 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.760
 weight of the fashion they are sure to make 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.170
 different in the future our history 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.240
 told by the experiences that we 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.619
 we can see the moments images 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.040
 this is an experience that has everything 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.070
 adding to all governments give 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.920
 watershed 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.440
 the theme of the collection will be Brazil and today 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.080
 each of the students receives material 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.750
 for modeling and sewing one day of 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.729
 rules and rules of Brazil foot dirty and 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.759

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.810

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.869
 in the area have long been missed smoking foul 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.550
 Now I believe it's going to be a moment. 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.820
 The most that I have to know everything 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.670

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.780

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.470
 very happy you are participating in a 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.990
 unique opportunity 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.270
 the realization of a dream to believe 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.180

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.690
 That's it. This was just the first day. 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.550

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.800

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.800
