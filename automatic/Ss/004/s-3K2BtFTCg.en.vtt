found in Microsoft Windows well that is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.260 
found in Microsoft Windows well that is
the<00:00:57.780> math<00:00:57.930> input<00:00:58.350> panel<00:00:58.530> where<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.270> type

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the math input panel where you can type

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.050 
the math input panel where you can type
in<00:01:00.480> any<00:01:00.780> equation<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:04.489> I'll<00:01:05.489> try<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> type<00:01:05.909> in

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.220 

and<00:01:21.230> it's<00:01:22.160> actually<00:01:22.610> pretty<00:01:23.150> accurate<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.840> if

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it does make a mistake you can just

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.480 
it does make a mistake you can just
select<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.920> item<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.310> need<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.460> fix<00:01:28.760> and

change it to whatever it's supposed to

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900 
change it to whatever it's supposed to
be<00:01:33.080> in<00:01:33.830> some<00:01:34.070> cases<00:01:34.310> when<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.700> doesn't

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
be in some cases when it doesn't

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.580 
be in some cases when it doesn't
recognize<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:37.190> can<00:01:37.370> just<00:01:37.400> erase<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.590> write

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
recognize it you can just erase it write

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.990 
recognize it you can just erase it write
it<00:01:39.740> again<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:42.070> it<00:01:43.070> still<00:01:43.400> doesn't<00:01:43.580> recognize

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
it again and it still doesn't recognize

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.780 
it again and it still doesn't recognize
it<00:01:45.220> okay<00:01:46.220> there<00:01:46.400> we<00:01:46.490> go

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
it okay there we go

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.200 
it okay there we go
and<00:01:48.400> fix<00:01:49.400> other<00:01:49.610> things<00:01:49.910> like<00:01:51.160> this<00:01:52.160> helps<00:01:53.090> for

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
and fix other things like this helps for

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.790 
and fix other things like this helps for
-<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.810> other<00:01:56.930> than<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.560> looks<00:01:57.590> like

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
- and so other than that it looks like

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.249 
- and so other than that it looks like
you<00:01:57.950> got<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.250> pretty<00:01:58.400> good<00:01:58.460> except<00:01:59.140> most<00:02:00.140> of

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:23.290 

microsoft<00:04:13.570> windows<00:04:16.299> 7<00:04:18.910> .<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.060> can<00:04:23.180> see

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
microsoft windows 7 . so you can see

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.360 
microsoft windows 7 . so you can see
that<00:04:23.450> it's<00:04:23.660> actually<00:04:23.960> pretty<00:04:24.110> accurate<00:04:24.370> it's

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
that it's actually pretty accurate it's

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.840 
that it's actually pretty accurate it's
actually<00:04:25.640> very<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:27.100> but<00:04:28.100> if<00:04:28.220> you're<00:04:28.430> gonna<00:04:28.670> be

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
actually very and but if you're gonna be

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.490 
actually very and but if you're gonna be
talking<00:04:29.000> at<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.330> fast<00:04:29.540> rate<00:04:29.690> i<00:04:29.840> would<00:04:30.140> recommend

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
talking at a fast rate i would recommend

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.530 
talking at a fast rate i would recommend
something<00:04:30.680> like<00:04:30.800> dragon<00:04:31.340> natural<00:04:31.910> reader<00:04:32.150> and

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
something like dragon natural reader and

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.480 
something like dragon natural reader and
so<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:33.380> pretty<00:04:33.560> much<00:04:33.650> concludes<00:04:33.890> all<00:04:34.340> the

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
so that pretty much concludes all the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.980 
so that pretty much concludes all the
applications<00:04:35.060> you're<00:04:35.240> going<00:04:35.420> to<00:04:35.510> find<00:04:35.750> when

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
applications you're going to find when

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.250 
applications you're going to find when
you<00:04:36.080> upgrade<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.790> Windows<00:04:37.790> 7

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.750 

now<00:04:45.260> I'm<00:04:45.410> sure<00:04:45.620> talking<00:04:46.130> about<00:04:46.250> games<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.700> very

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.450 
now I'm sure talking about games is very
unimportant<00:04:47.390> for<00:04:47.780> this<00:04:47.900> review<00:04:48.230> but<00:04:48.860> I'm<00:04:49.220> sure

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
unimportant for this review but I'm sure

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
unimportant for this review but I'm sure
there's<00:04:49.640> someone<00:04:49.850> out<00:04:49.940> there<00:04:49.970> that<00:04:50.150> wants<00:04:50.300> to

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.840 
know so we'll look at the games next and
built-in<00:04:54.470> are<00:04:54.770> all<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.280> normal<00:04:55.550> things<00:04:55.610> that

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
hearts solitaire and the only new ones

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.370 
hearts solitaire and the only new ones
really<00:05:01.310> are<00:05:01.640> chest<00:05:02.240> tightens<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.990> mahjong

really are chest tightens and mahjong

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.700 
really are chest tightens and mahjong
tightens<00:05:03.830> and<00:05:04.190> they<00:05:05.090> are<00:05:05.360> actually<00:05:05.710> designed

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
tightens and they are actually designed

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.680 
tightens and they are actually designed
very<00:05:06.950> well<00:05:07.040> so<00:05:07.970> we'll<00:05:08.150> look<00:05:08.330> at<00:05:08.480> chest

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
very well so we'll look at chest

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.860 
very well so we'll look at chest
tightens<00:05:08.990> for<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.260> example<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.750> has<00:05:11.840> a

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
tightens for the example and so it has a

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.570 
tightens for the example and so it has a
very<00:05:11.960> nice<00:05:12.260> three-dimensional<00:05:12.680> look<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:13.430> can

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
very nice three-dimensional look you can

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.909 
very nice three-dimensional look you can
even<00:05:13.730> customize<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.660> look<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.140> the<00:05:15.290> board<00:05:15.500> and

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
even customize the look of the board and

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
to play online

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.120 
to play online
and<00:05:49.100> of<00:05:49.310> course<00:05:49.550> you<00:05:49.820> cannot<00:05:50.180> have<00:05:50.540> a<00:05:51.130> Windows

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
and of course you cannot have a Windows

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.740 
and of course you cannot have a Windows
computer<00:05:52.340> without<00:05:52.870> minesweeper<00:05:54.699> so<00:05:55.750> that's

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
computer without minesweeper so that's

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.659 
computer without minesweeper so that's
even<00:05:56.960> enhanced<00:05:57.470> a<00:05:57.530> little<00:05:57.740> bit<00:05:57.889> and<00:05:58.520> I've

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
even enhanced a little bit and I've

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.360 
even enhanced a little bit and I've
never<00:05:58.850> really<00:05:59.150> understood<00:05:59.510> how<00:05:59.660> to<00:05:59.690> play<00:05:59.900> this

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
never really understood how to play this

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.350 
never really understood how to play this
but<00:06:01.370> that's<00:06:01.520> okay

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.080 

and<00:06:07.449> city<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.979> pretty<00:06:10.490> much<00:06:10.580> covers<00:06:10.820> them

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
and city so that pretty much covers them

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.360 
and city so that pretty much covers them
all<00:06:11.240> purple<00:06:12.139> place<00:06:12.350> might<00:06:12.740> be<00:06:13.040> a<00:06:13.070> game<00:06:13.340> that

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
all purple place might be a game that

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.270 
all purple place might be a game that
appeals<00:06:13.850> to<00:06:13.970> a<00:06:14.510> younger<00:06:14.900> female<00:06:15.770> audience<00:06:16.370> and

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
appeals to a younger female audience and

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.860 
appeals to a younger female audience and
so<00:06:19.810> that<00:06:20.810> should<00:06:21.080> keep<00:06:23.620> younger<00:06:24.620> children

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
so that should keep younger children

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.360 
so that should keep younger children
more<00:06:26.870> entertained<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:29.560> that<00:06:30.560> is<00:06:31.039> pretty<00:06:31.280> much

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
more entertained and that is pretty much

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.950 
more entertained and that is pretty much
all<00:06:31.520> the<00:06:31.639> games<00:06:31.820> that<00:06:31.910> come<00:06:32.120> with<00:06:32.270> it<00:06:32.300> not

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
all the games that come with it not

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.200 
all the games that come with it not
really<00:06:33.199> a<00:06:33.229> big<00:06:33.440> deal<00:06:33.470> if<00:06:33.919> you're<00:06:34.340> into<00:06:34.850> games

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
really a big deal if you're into games

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.810 
really a big deal if you're into games
then<00:06:35.680> you're<00:06:36.680> probably<00:06:37.100> not<00:06:37.400> going<00:06:38.360> to<00:06:39.820> play

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
then you're probably not going to play

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.570 
then you're probably not going to play
the<00:06:40.940> ones<00:06:41.120> to<00:06:41.270> come<00:06:41.419> with<00:06:41.570> it<00:06:41.690> but<00:06:41.930> still

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
the ones to come with it but still

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.449 
the ones to come with it but still
that's<00:06:43.580> what<00:06:43.789> comes<00:06:44.180> with<00:06:44.300> it
