00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
see we have some really proximity on

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.960 
see we have some really proximity on
some<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.680> these<00:03:02.740> margins<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.520> they're<00:03:03.640> really

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
some of these margins and they're really

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.810 
some of these margins and they're really
tough<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.360> cut<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.830> some<00:03:06.100> food<00:03:06.280> for<00:03:06.430> thought<00:03:06.490> to

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
tough to cut so some food for thought to

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.710 
tough to cut so some food for thought to
follow<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:09.190> regards<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.700> cutting<00:03:10.270> really

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
follow in with regards to cutting really

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.780 
follow in with regards to cutting really
close<00:03:11.140> margins<00:03:12.010> these<00:03:12.220> two<00:03:12.400> theorem<00:03:12.670> was

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
close margins these two theorem was

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.850 
close margins these two theorem was
touching<00:03:13.410> all<00:03:14.410> right

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
touching all right

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.840 
touching all right
hope<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.940> helps<00:03:16.300> Cheers
