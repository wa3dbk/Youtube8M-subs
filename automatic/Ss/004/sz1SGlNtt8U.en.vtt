00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello everyone, you are a payer and now I 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:11.509
 teach you grievances distant fan 14 is on 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.519
 really very simple for that you 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.890
 you will need a punch button and a joystick on 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.949
 which you run and everything just take 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.010
 run well here you can quick button 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.410
 Vegam for power strike take run 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.710
 run we hold the joystick up and spin 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.250
 in the far corner a ball like this 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.200
 ball so twist it just some 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.360
 building or near corner from that 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 depends on buildings or external debt be 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.780
 twist let's say we run up to here and here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.149
 of this flank if you want to twist 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.579
 the far corner you have to run 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.260
 hold the key up before hitting and he 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.820
 close to the far if you want 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.370
 here from here you are near 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.659
 have to press down 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.430
 now tried to put him but caught 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.439
 in fact in a normal match you can 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.810
 can i even tell you in the usual match 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.750
 kill out of half the field because 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.950
 goalkeepers there usually come out here and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 score is easier than it is now in training and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 here and so here we are let's say cape 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.590
 let's try them to score and shot so 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.950
 Here we take the run will hit the far corner 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.729
 we press the button upward punch and crossbar 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.259
 Sorry for the Essenes of rotary 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.299
 here actually saw how the blow 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.810
 flew goalkeeper had been slightly lower 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.700
 he would not have caught already let's score 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.460
 so now we will turn the far corner 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.649
 this key down by squeezed it just 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.540
 need to twist twirl as I have 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.180
 told depending on which angle 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.750
 my key up or down so here 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.040
 messi 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:08.679
 did neimar goal it was kind of wrong 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.750
 let's enemy pedro run we clamp 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.300
 key up punch and back to 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.260
 hide but above the gate unfortunately 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.470
 let us once a few times will be able to 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.960
 I will show you three times and that's it. 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.870
 I think because I explained at the very 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.080
 In fact, in matches such blows are pretty 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.940
 often fly well as one hundred percent 50 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.040
 may well depending on where you beat 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.690
 what goalkeepers 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.810
 on the core, here we run ig 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.030
 Now I just press a key on 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.959
 rose up before the blow if he is behind 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.100
 the key turned the far corner of the Neymar 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:54.730
 push the joystick up punch and past 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:58.690
 let's take another long shot and now i'm 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.660
 I will show you and think everything I explained 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:06.310
 the main thing you are already trying to try 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.489
 be the main train on he that you notes 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.760
 in training because the right to Dampen 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.730
 may not start may not work out well 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.709
 Now I think you showed how separate 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.030
 blows on it all with you was a carpenter 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.820
