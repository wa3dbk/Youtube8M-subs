 Low-fat mozzarella cheese is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.840
 Ideally, if they do not have cheese 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.780
 mozarella normalito leek 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.490

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.200
 and also pepper 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.970
 to make the tortilla we are going to use a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.970
 teaspoon butter 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.150
