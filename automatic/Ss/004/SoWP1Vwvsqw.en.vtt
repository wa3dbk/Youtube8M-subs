00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:13.120
 By the way, it is another month until the Tokyo marathon held on the 23rd of next month 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:18.940
 Murakami-san actually I will also participate in charcoal this year's Tokyo marathon

 I know well because I like piano and how much distance today I was able to run or today 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.230
 I have heard good story to say that I'm going to equally 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.989
 I 'm still practicing right now 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:34.960
 Finally 36,000 runners will run the city of Tokyo where the runner of the time now 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.960
 We have been interviewing what kind of preparation we should do 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:46.699
 Finally one month left until the Tokyo marathon training also has become a full-scale 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.829
 Today I went to the training studio I am attending and useful information for runners 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.829
 I went Well then you tell Mars 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:02.899
 Training studio located in the Minato-ku, platinum Uno 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.899
 In this studio where a lot of runners go , I am training once a week 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:14.659
 This is the third time to challenge the Tokyo marathon 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.070
 Last year I recorded 3 hours 35 minutes 03 seconds which is my best 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.040
 Well then 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.480
 I love you 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.320
 Please 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:30.190
 The trainer is the representative of this studio Nozomi Umehara 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.190
 An athlete who runs a full marathon in 2 hours and 30 minutes 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:40.909
 For According to Uehara teacher is now time to create a body that can withstand the full marathon 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.250
 It says that there is a need to strength training, such as the arms and legs 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.640
 It 's time to do Bravely 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.770
 Go with 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.960
 I will train you 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.250
 Although this training looks monotonous , it takes a little load 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.350
 You tired more than to see eyes 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:08.240
 You will come to your arms, but this is hey, but when you run that, it's your hand 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.240
 This is my best surely believe that should be able to help me with pretend you the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:17.580
 This training is a mana to make the body learn straight arm 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.010
 When you get this , your arms will swing naturally 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.010
 Will support the power to move forward 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.490
 If you do it alone, let's put a tube on a pillar etc. and train it 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.270
 West is straight 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:40.310
 Gently pull this from the state towards the navel 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.030
 Ku from bone health without the only Kou rather it flying hand at the time of the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.630
 You will receive 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.360
 While being careful not to roll or shave your body 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.360
 I say that it is effective to do 100 times reading 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:03.750
 Also , when training your legs , slowly go up and down with half your toes on the stairs etc. 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.750
 Let's repeat the exercise about 30 times 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:14.340
 On the other hand, you have to pay attention to the diet as the production approaches 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.280
 We will begin what's called carbohydrate restriction 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.990
 Especially to 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.460
 Rice or pasta 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.210
 Udon to is such a thing 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:31.000
 Because it is easy to change to energy and fat is also easy to attach 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:33.590
 Let's create a body the minute protein for generous I am dressed night 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.069
 A week before the race 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:44.770
 It is ideal to have fallen about 3 km 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:51.350
 It is ideal to lose weight to guide the 3 km by reducing the carbohydrate 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:53.819
 And I change eating habits from one week before the production 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:00.060
 Weight 8 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:02.650
 If you keep falling, you will be deprived of your physical strength, so as a final fatigue recovery 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.670
 Carbo loading 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.420
 No 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:12.550
 Take out the carbohydrates for the race 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:15.880
 As I mentioned earlier, it is pasta and rice , mainly for such meals 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.900
 I think if you can assemble the menu 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:24.710
 By doing so 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:27.490
 Those that have been reduced by 3 kilometers before the race day have returned 1 kilo and are now around 2 kilos 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.490
 It seems to be 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.759
 One month to Tokyo marathon 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.759
 Let's encourage training for each goal 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.440
 I also train at the gym but it's totally different 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.820
 The say you were muscle for the proper marathon training in that marathon 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.490
 I understand that it is necessary well I seem to look sober at first glance, but quite 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.870
 It was effective, I was sweaty . 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.650
 Although the sister I have been running longer that in addition to this kind of strength training 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.449
 In After all cold season of the now 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:05.820
 Since the after before training and then note that the only but have been firmly stretch 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.820
 Let's enjoy running everyone
