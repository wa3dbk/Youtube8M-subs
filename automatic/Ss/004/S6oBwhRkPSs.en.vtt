freely in real time in game so that's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
freely in real time in game so that's
good<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.390> also<00:01:27.600> noticed<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> combat

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.460 
good I also noticed that the combat
seems<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.790> free-flowing<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> flows

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
seems to be free-flowing so it flows

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.219 
seems to be free-flowing so it flows
into<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.860> next<00:01:32.070> move<00:01:32.310> looks<00:01:32.970> natural<00:01:33.600> more

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
into the next move looks natural more

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
into the next move looks natural more
realistic<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.979> non-repetitive<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:35.939> looks

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
realistic and non-repetitive which looks

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.050 
realistic and non-repetitive which looks
interesting<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> game<00:01:37.229> focuses<00:01:37.590> around<00:01:38.100> free

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
interesting the game focuses around free

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.850 
interesting the game focuses around free
running<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.689> there's<00:01:39.900> elements<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.470> climbing

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
running so there's elements of climbing

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.069 
running so there's elements of climbing
buildings<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.060> vantage<00:01:42.450> points
