and now if you can see how well the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.220 
and now if you can see how well the
ballast<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.000> soaking<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.720> sand<00:00:27.960> cement

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
after putting the wet water on but it is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.319 
after putting the wet water on but it is
pretty<00:00:32.700> cool<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> watch<00:00:34.850> how<00:00:35.850> does<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> get

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
pretty cool to watch how does it get

an imminent camera there so that's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.139

probably the off camera huh let me go
pan<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.989> pull<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.530> back<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:57.710> you

right

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.789 

just<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> works<00:01:17.130> pretty<00:01:17.219> slick

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
just like that and it works pretty slick

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.340 
just like that and it works pretty slick
do<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> other<00:01:20.130> way<00:01:21.439> here<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.929> you<00:01:25.079> don't

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
end up with quite as much ballast on

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.980 
end up with quite as much ballast on
your<00:01:28.829> turnouts<00:01:32.899> you<00:01:33.899> can<00:01:34.049> always<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.530> over<00:01:35.990> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
your turnouts you can always go over it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.870 
your turnouts you can always go over it
again<00:01:37.079> sprinkle<00:01:37.859> some<00:01:38.039> more<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.700> hit

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
again sprinkle some more on in hit

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.669 
again sprinkle some more on in hit
someone<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.359> some<00:01:39.569> more<00:01:39.719> scenic<00:01:39.990> cement<00:01:40.259> but

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
someone with some more scenic cement but

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.289 
someone with some more scenic cement but
I<00:01:40.920> tend<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.429> go<00:01:41.609> a<00:01:41.640> little<00:01:41.819> bit<00:01:42.030> light<00:01:42.270> on

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I tend to go a little bit light on

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
I tend to go a little bit light on
ballasting<00:01:43.109> my<00:01:43.259> turnouts<00:01:43.709> just<00:01:43.950> because

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
ballasting my turnouts just because

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
ballasting my turnouts just because
there's<00:01:44.549> too<00:01:44.729> many<00:01:44.819> places<00:01:45.060> where<00:01:45.450> these

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
there's too many places where these

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.460 
there's too many places where these
chunks<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.489> foul<00:01:47.489> things<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.630> yeah<00:01:49.439> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
chunks can foul things up so yeah I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.789 
chunks can foul things up so yeah I
think<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.709> just<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:50.099> just<00:01:50.670> enough<00:01:51.799> ballast

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
think you just want just enough ballast

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
think you just want just enough ballast
there<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.219> be<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:54.500> thin<00:01:55.500> layer<00:01:55.939> just<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.060> show

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
there to be a thin layer just to show

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.699 
there to be a thin layer just to show
that<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.630> ballast<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.319> you<00:01:58.469> don't<00:01:58.590> want

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
that it's ballast it but you don't want

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.410 
that it's ballast it but you don't want
to<00:01:58.799> go<00:01:59.539> too<00:02:00.539> overboard<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:02.489> complete

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
to go too overboard and have a complete

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.440 
to go too overboard and have a complete
thick<00:02:03.959> layer<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.379> ballast<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.399> your<00:02:06.030> turnout

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
thick layer of ballast on your turnout

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.529 
thick layer of ballast on your turnout
so<00:02:06.959> at<00:02:07.349> least<00:02:07.530> I'd<00:02:07.890> rather<00:02:08.209> rather<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.390> more

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
so at least I'd rather rather be more

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.339 
so at least I'd rather rather be more

but you can see the scenic cement just

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.949 
but you can see the scenic cement just

ballast stick to the top when we want to

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.480 
ballast stick to the top when we want to
clean<00:05:25.760> those<00:05:25.940> off<00:05:26.240> and<00:05:26.510> that's<00:05:27.310> fairly<00:05:28.310> easy

to<00:05:28.850> do<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.860> usually<00:05:30.860> just<00:05:30.980> take<00:05:31.130> my<00:05:31.310> finger<00:05:31.730> and

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
to do I usually just take my finger and

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.060 
to do I usually just take my finger and
rub<00:05:32.060> it<00:05:32.920> along<00:05:33.920> the<00:05:34.250> top<00:05:34.490> there<00:05:35.710> or<00:05:36.710> you<00:05:36.920> could

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
rub it along the top there or you could

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.300 
rub it along the top there or you could
probably<00:05:37.610> use<00:05:37.970> just<00:05:38.240> a<00:05:38.330> regular<00:05:38.860> eraser<00:05:39.860> and

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
probably use just a regular eraser and
