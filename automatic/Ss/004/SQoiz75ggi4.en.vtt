and i believe now this case is actually
1495<00:00:27.269> i<00:00:27.599> could<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.169> said<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.470> their<00:00:28.560> name<00:00:28.769> row

but i believe it's an i blason case so
the<00:00:33.120> link<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.570> description<00:00:33.690> would<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
the link in the description would be the

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.880 
the link in the description would be the
below<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.790> case<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.360> five<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:37.079> touch

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
below for this case it's a five I touch

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150 
below for this case it's a five I touch
5th<00:00:38.550> generation<00:00:38.790> armor<00:00:39.540> box<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:40.080> case<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
5th generation armor box on case and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
5th generation armor box on case and
it's<00:00:41.310> in<00:00:41.430> black<00:00:41.580> and<00:00:41.700> they<00:00:42.240> also<00:00:42.390> have

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it's in black and they also have

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.640 
it's in black and they also have
different<00:00:42.960> other<00:00:43.290> colors<00:00:44.690> for<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.720> case<00:00:46.020> so

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
different other colors for the case so

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.080 
different other colors for the case so
it's<00:00:46.890> depending<00:00:47.310> on<00:00:47.400> your<00:00:47.490> preference<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it's depending on your preference I

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.460 
it's depending on your preference I
could<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.360> went<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> blue<00:00:49.020> because<00:00:49.320> I

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
could have went with the blue because I

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.030 
could have went with the blue because I
got<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.740> blue<00:00:49.950> ipod<00:00:50.190> touch<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:52.140> guess<00:00:52.740> I

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
got the blue ipod touch but I guess I

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.390
