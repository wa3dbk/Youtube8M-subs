00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.190
 How do you say hi Chasse Chamorro 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.410
 web and well then today I'm going to tell you how 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.200
 is that you will be able to know who 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.630
 must be an effective seller or a 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.199
 seller what are the qualities that 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.689
 must have and well then nothing else I go 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 to fully enter the subject and especially 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.239
 Well, I'm going to tell you that you're 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.529
 skills also has internet 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.759
 is that although it seems that it is not 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.919
 possible because the internet is not a 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.079
 person as a seller believe me if 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.559
 it's possible and I'm going to tell you why 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.589
 well the key point is that every seller 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.750
 must have security security is 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.179
 without a doubt the only thing that will do 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.350
 excel the seller in the environment in 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:49.929
 the one who is immersed is dedicated to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.940
 transmit that security because if the 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.920
 customer who is facing the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.749
 that you have in front of you see that certain 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.030
 security presents good as our 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.339
 seller will also feel safe 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.809
 buy then like this in terms 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.180
 simple the seller must externalize 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.009
 security because it 's that same security 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.480
 it will be transmitted to the client 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.450
 potential facing you 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.040
 you should also have sympathy this is 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.290
 the virtue of being nice to the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.360
 others and for example a seller who 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.980
 has the gift of people is given the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.740
 ease by the open all that good 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.120
 Well, he has that liking for the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.580
 clients when you are going to visit them 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.620
 etcetera on my internet a way to 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.990
 reflect sympathy is through your 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.540
 site mayor of the internet or through 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.510
 of design let's say in a general way 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.040
 talking through the design of where 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.890
 you are going to transmit your message be a 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.840
 website be a blog be a 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.820
 channel and so on everything you are going to 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.500
 convey through being nice 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.110
 for the client is through design 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.210
 he must also be an observer seller 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.920
 that is, he has to analyze the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.260
 body language of the client to whom 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.810
 is directing and also interpreting it 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.960
 in the way that it best achieves a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.400
 communication that matches then 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.710
 good on the internet what we can do 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.900
 is that there are different ways of 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.210
 be aware of the client but 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.190
 in addition to the visual means that can 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.440
 be through a video call from a 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.720
 online conference there are dem in the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.960
 textual media that are chat 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.970
 larios and spaces for comments or 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.050
 scoring levels and so on by 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.640
 mention some and it depends 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.740
 regardless of the channel that you 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.900
 choose these are the main ones in 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.200
 which you can have attention to 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.150
 interaction with the client just the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.190
 another aspect is the ease of words 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.530
 I already told him that this will help him too 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.570
 engage in sympathy then it seems that a 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.660
 seller already know the types of 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.180
 clients that there are if they are liabilities that 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.670
 if they are restless that if they are rude they 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.590
 if you are impatient and so on all those 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.890
 types of customers to the seller already 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.270
 they will have made a special layer for 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.440
 be able to serve them 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.520
 then on the internet the same thing happens but 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.500
 through the information that 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.430
 transmit on the internet, hierarchical 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.050
 information and is presented to the client 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.090
 understanding that as they go to the 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.200
 reading as the presentation of the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.790
 video and so on 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.140
 regardless of the channel I repeat 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.780
 you will know at what time 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.760
 present to the client that then 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.709
 good depending on that information that 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.330
 we want to transmit depends on 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.120
 the importance we give you depending 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.010
 of the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.049
 etcetera is how you are going to be able 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.360
 interpret their ease of speech to 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.549
 through the internet the other element is 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.170
 persuasion this is a virtue that 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.400
 many of us would like to have but 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.500
 some of us have to work for 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.379
 develop it and others are born with it 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.870
 is this to persuade is to try to 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.780
 convince another through arguments 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.190
 valid is that is total or is not it 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.739
 let's tell lies we 'll have to 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.329
 present valid arguments then a 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.670
 seller this is what has capacity 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.650
 of doing and on the internet always 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.209
 will find the means or the material 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.489
 to try to convince the user 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.680
 Internet is very kind and will give us 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.769
 many channels to convince 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.079
 our partner then there is the key 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.790
 serenity the seller's ability is 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.190
 precisely be patient of the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.989
 difficult clients on the internet rarely 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.420
 is going to be able to find you then this 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.730
 feature but only internet 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.109
 is going to be limited to spread the message and 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.609
 although of course there is a way to 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.049
 interact with people and 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.090
 we mentioned good you can also 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.880
 receive opinions that do not necessarily 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.979
 have to share however the pgje of 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.690
 you have to receive the purchase you have 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.430
 to keep calm something 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.900
 fast and that is a very clear example is 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.930
 that through social networks you 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.210
 can go into crisis and the best way 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.680
 of treating them is first calming down and 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.360
 then taking the necessary measures 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.250
 for that situation in the networks 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.440
 so do not spread and do not give 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.260
 a bad reputation to your brand this is 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.730
 a very clear example the sincerity as 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.710
 I already told a salesman when he 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.420
 presents has to give security but 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.190
 You also have to be honest because the 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.620
 arguments that it gives have to be 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.840
 true then for example in 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.480
 internet the same does a simple user 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.760
 have to find the information something 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.370
 true something that has many sources 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.560
 have support that are easy to 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.180
 corroborate etcetera then through 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.280
 internet you can give this case the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.160
 celerity the other aspect is the 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.510
 responsibility a seller has to 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.430
 be responsible and not just a 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.110
 seller but all people but 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.850
 talking about the sellers he is 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.560
 responsible for giving you the 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.960
 client and that if the client buys it 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.640
 he has to promise everything 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.470
 possible and have to give it everything 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.420
 I promised you then it's important 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.460
 know that if we are going to promise 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.380
 something that can be met and on the internet 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.050
 well then we compare it with 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.200
 and all forms and all means 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.960
 that offers us to hold 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.480
 those who give us the sources an example 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.760
 is that good there are several activities 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.950
 advertising and internet 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.300
 the internet police is also in 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.810
 each site has its best 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.490
 privacy policies and so on 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.560
 mentioning some is the way in which 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.230
 for example on the internet is carried out 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.510
 the responsibility and finally the 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.390
 ambition this last characteristic of 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.430
 seller is for a person who is 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.930
 dedicated to the medium, so satisfy all 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.940
 the needs that the client seeks and 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.950
 for this you have to work with the 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.560
 reason for obtaining better profits and 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.940
 then higher profits through 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.160
 that a seller knows that he is 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.750
 going well that out there goes in very good 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.090
 path has to work constantly 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.290
 to achieve the same results well 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.510
 Well, there are the 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.700
 characteristics of how a seller should 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.730
