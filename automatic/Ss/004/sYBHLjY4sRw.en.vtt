okay<00:00:02.399> in<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:02.760> video<00:00:02.939> I'm<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.389> explain

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay in this video I'm going to explain

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.269 
okay in this video I'm going to explain
to<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:04.020> how<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.170> install<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.710> crank<00:00:05.130> angle

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
to you how to install a crank angle

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.560 
to you how to install a crank angle
sensor<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.569> SR<00:00:06.990> 20<00:00:07.580> so<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.120> yes<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
sensor in SR 20 so what the yes the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.620 
sensor in SR 20 so what the yes the
first<00:00:09.780> has<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.960> do<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.260> get<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.530> TDC<00:00:11.130> which

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
first has to do is get it to TDC which

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.369 
first has to do is get it to TDC which
is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.840> second<00:00:13.170> mark<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> left<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:15.379> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
is the second mark from the left and the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.429 
is the second mark from the left and the
camshaft<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.250> face<00:00:17.550> outwards<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:19.109> first

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
camshaft to face outwards you first

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.490 
camshaft to face outwards you first
first<00:00:20.250> lender<00:00:20.640> instead<00:00:21.630> facing<00:00:22.080> inwards<00:00:22.410> then

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
first lender instead facing inwards then

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.429 
first lender instead facing inwards then
you<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.100> more<00:00:23.130> rotation<00:00:24.439> now

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
you have to go one more rotation now

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.120 
you have to go one more rotation now
this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> our<00:00:26.699> cast<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.859> see

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
this is our cast so as you can see

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.550 
this is our cast so as you can see
there's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.609> line<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.900> I've<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.320> put

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
there's a line there and I've just put

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.049 
there's a line there and I've just put
white<00:00:31.920> paint<00:00:32.250> pen<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.550> there<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.880> easy

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
white paint pen on there so it's easy

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.479 
white paint pen on there so it's easy
for<00:00:33.239> guys<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.780> there's<00:00:34.770> two<00:00:35.070> dots<00:00:35.219> there's

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
for guys to see there's two dots there's

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.459 
for guys to see there's two dots there's
one<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.120> there's<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.719> there<00:00:36.870> she

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
one there and there's one there she

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.780 
one there and there's one there she
probably<00:00:37.710> made<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.010> worth<00:00:38.160> putting<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.610> dawn

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
probably made it worth putting up dawn

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.860 
probably made it worth putting up dawn
but<00:00:39.480> anyway<00:00:39.860> we<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.489> line<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.840> up

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
but anyway we have to do is line that up

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:53.500 
but anyway we have to do is line that up
with<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.500> dot<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.390> then<00:00:45.390> slide<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.050> in

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.160 

with<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> center<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.660> slot<00:00:58.020> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
with this in the center so this slot is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.430 
with this in the center so this slot is
in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> center<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.829> those<00:00:59.010> holes<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> get

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
in the center of those holes so you get

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:11.649 
in the center of those holes so you get
all<00:01:01.620> lined<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:04.339> it's<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.880> bit<00:01:06.920> stiff

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.010 

okay<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> center<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
okay so that's in the center there and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.490 
okay so that's in the center there and
as<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.700> it's<00:01:17.700> off<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.229> has<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
as you can see it's off so it has to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.690 
as you can see it's off so it has to
pull<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:20.210> go<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> way<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:25.220> then<00:01:26.220> try

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
pull it out go all the way and then try

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.770 
pull it out go all the way and then try
again

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.090 

so<00:01:32.780> line<00:01:33.080> up<00:01:33.290> with<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.500> mark<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.920> right

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
so line up with the mark on the right

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.730 
so line up with the mark on the right
then<00:01:34.850> when<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.030> slide<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.479> it'll<00:01:36.170> go<00:01:36.320> to

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
then when you slide it in it'll go to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.960 
then when you slide it in it'll go to
one<00:01:36.950> on<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.190> left<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.610> in<00:01:40.820> the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
one on the left and that is in the

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.750 
one on the left and that is in the
center<00:01:41.390> about<00:01:41.510> there<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.250> now<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.340> can<00:01:43.430> see

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
center about there and now you can see

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.870 
center about there and now you can see
that<00:01:44.030> blind<00:01:44.450> marks<00:01:44.930> up<00:01:45.080> with<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.350> dot<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.790> you

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
that blind marks up with that dot so you

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.940 
that blind marks up with that dot so you
have<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.180> bolt<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.479> in<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.750> exact<00:01:48.410> center

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
have to bolt this in the exact center

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.080 
have to bolt this in the exact center
and<00:01:49.220> that<00:01:49.850> will<00:01:49.940> be<00:01:50.000> 15<00:01:50.450> degrees<00:01:50.869> more<00:01:51.500> or<00:01:51.650> less

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
and that will be 15 degrees more or less

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.190 
and that will be 15 degrees more or less
you<00:01:53.090> obviously<00:01:53.450> will<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:53.660> to<00:01:53.810> check<00:01:53.960> with<00:01:54.170> a

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
you obviously will have to check with a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.440 
you obviously will have to check with a
timing<00:01:54.590> light<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.979> get<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.250> correct<00:01:55.640> but<00:01:56.150> this

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
timing light to get it correct but this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.140 
timing light to get it correct but this
will<00:01:56.630> give<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.930> base<00:01:57.560> timing<00:01:57.950> really<00:01:58.280> so

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
will give you a base timing really so

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.420 
will give you a base timing really so
line<00:01:59.900> up<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.259> line<00:02:00.560> with<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.009> line<00:02:01.190> on<00:02:01.220> the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
line up that line with the line on the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.450 
line up that line with the line on the
right<00:02:01.810> put<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.900> dot<00:02:03.080> on<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.259> right<00:02:03.470> then

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
right put the dot on the right then

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.190 
right put the dot on the right then
slide<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:05.450> will<00:02:05.539> light<00:02:05.720> with<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.020> dot

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
slide it in and it will light with a dot

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.590 
slide it in and it will light with a dot
on<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.470> left<00:02:06.710> if<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.610> slightly<00:02:08.149> out<00:02:08.270> you

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
on the left if it's slightly out you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.560 
on the left if it's slightly out you
might<00:02:08.780> be<00:02:08.959> one<00:02:09.289> tooth<00:02:09.649> out<00:02:09.830> on<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.520> cam<00:02:10.850> so

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
might be one tooth out on the cam so

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.850 
might be one tooth out on the cam so
just<00:02:11.750> turn<00:02:11.930> over<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.230> little<00:02:12.440> bit<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.650> try

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
just turn over a little bit and try

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.270 
just turn over a little bit and try
again<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:14.260> when<00:02:15.260> those<00:02:15.410> two<00:02:15.680> dots<00:02:15.830> align<00:02:16.130> up

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
again and when those two dots align up

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.590 
again and when those two dots align up
this<00:02:16.400> has<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.640> be<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.850> center<00:02:17.180> if<00:02:17.330> your

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
this has to be in the center if your

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.690 
this has to be in the center if your
cast<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.020> like<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:18.470> when<00:02:19.220> they're<00:02:19.370> lined<00:02:19.550> up

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
cast is like this when they're lined up

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.030 
cast is like this when they're lined up
your<00:02:20.270> one<00:02:20.510> tooth<00:02:20.780> out<00:02:20.959> so<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.830> try

your one tooth out so you have to try
again<00:02:22.360> might<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.570> little<00:02:23.600> bit<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.930> fiddling

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
again might a little bit of fiddling

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.330 
again might a little bit of fiddling
around<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.650> should<00:02:24.769> be<00:02:24.800> able<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.100> get<00:02:25.220> it

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
around but it should be able to get it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.330 
around but it should be able to get it
and<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:26.300> if<00:02:26.390> you'll<00:02:26.540> sweet<00:02:26.840> like<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.340> so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
that's how you put in a crank and sensor

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.930 
that's how you put in a crank and sensor
and<00:02:30.380> sr20<00:02:30.890> which<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.190> what<00:02:31.370> can<00:02:31.489> go<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.640> catch

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and sr20 which is what can go in catch

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.120 
and sr20 which is what can go in catch
little
