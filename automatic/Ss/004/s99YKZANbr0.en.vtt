00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:10.210
 the fault mainly and of the mothers 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.839
 because I mean the player the 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.700
 talent the champion is born champion 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.800
 what makes me strange with the media 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.080
 of the clubs that are all in Italy 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.090
 those who work masters 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.210
 collaborators in the average of the circles 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.789
 that are more or less 350 400 per region 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.269
 there is difficulty pull out these 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.269
 guys here 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.880
 I coach and then I make available 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.990
 of those who have passion and those 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.730
 who want to play tennis 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.470
 therefore you must distinguish the two phases well 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.270
 the people who come here sardinia for 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.770
 take a tennis holiday but then there is also the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.730
 group of kids for those that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.730
 they want to try 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.040
 kept the same but did not change 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.190
 physical the material then these these 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.750
 big boys here are much bigger 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.390
 pulling harder coming first on the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.880
 ball so you see less played than 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 talent less played veils of hay like 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.020
 there was 15 20 years ago 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.579
 Yup 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.630
 pillowcases with the talent that I think you like 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.400
 to 70 80 percent of tennis players who 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.840
 then on his part and on the side of 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.600
 nadal 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.150
 I must say that Murray surprised me 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.940
 Olympics is rising in quality 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.920
 began to put a brake on it 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.820
 his passages empty and then physically 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.770
 so he too is a wardrobe 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.910
 great talent that can do well 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.910
 also members less 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.570
 I don't like talking about what I have 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.370
 however played in the memories since it 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.020
 they speak many often and willingly me 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.100
 I can put some in too 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.100
 I did a good result too 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.390
 we are always because we have the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.610
 memories in black and white 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.590
 this is the place behind the end 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.840
 where i 'm better 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.580
 however, it is difficult to think of it when 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.500
 when I train as I am training now 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.620
 and still a moment where I can 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.170
 mentally remove not thinking about many 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.640
 life problems is a task 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.640
 difficult this anyway 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.350
 not always the same fire as 20 years ago 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.740
 but with the experience now a 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.270
 youth provision therefore then 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.110
 having a wonderful baby has me 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.110
 improved a lot
