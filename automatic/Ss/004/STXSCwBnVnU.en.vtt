and<00:02:00.850> make<00:02:01.000> sure<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.390> doesn't<00:02:01.660> go

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
and make sure that it doesn't go

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.730 
and make sure that it doesn't go
anywhere

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.230 

the<00:02:07.740> tricky<00:02:08.039> part<00:02:08.070> now<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.550> doing<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.880> detail

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
the tricky part now is doing the detail

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.669 
the tricky part now is doing the detail
so<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> want<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> take<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> eyeliner<00:02:10.380> and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so you want to take the eyeliner and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.710 
so you want to take the eyeliner and
first<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.340> sketch<00:02:11.670> out<00:02:11.910> rough<00:02:12.150> sea<00:02:12.420> shapes

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
first just sketch out rough sea shapes

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.970 
first just sketch out rough sea shapes
which<00:02:12.990> connect<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> line<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
which connect to the line that you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.340 
which connect to the line that you
previously<00:02:14.220> drew<00:02:14.900> you're<00:02:15.900> going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.080> start

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
previously drew you're going to start

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.110 
previously drew you're going to start
out<00:02:16.530> with<00:02:16.890> them<00:02:17.040> larger<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.550> outer<00:02:17.760> corner

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
out with them larger on the outer corner

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.910 
out with them larger on the outer corner
and<00:02:18.300> slowly<00:02:18.570> getting<00:02:18.870> smaller<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.560> smaller

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
and slowly getting smaller and smaller

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.900 
and slowly getting smaller and smaller
as<00:02:20.100> we<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:20.459> further<00:02:20.700> into<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.120> inner<00:02:21.330> corner

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
as we get further into the inner corner

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.100 
as we get further into the inner corner
once<00:02:23.910> you've<00:02:24.120> sketched<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.600> shape<00:02:24.870> go

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
once you've sketched out the shape go

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.390 
once you've sketched out the shape go
over<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.440> again<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.709> make<00:02:26.010> sure<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
over it again and make sure that the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.490 
over it again and make sure that the
lines<00:02:26.580> are<00:02:26.730> really<00:02:26.850> visible<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.810> now<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
lines are really visible and now for the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.050 
lines are really visible and now for the
lower<00:02:28.650> outer<00:02:28.920> corner<00:02:29.340> we're<00:02:29.520> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.730> start

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
lower outer corner we're going to start

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.050 
lower outer corner we're going to start
with<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.900> largest<00:02:31.260> circle<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:32.820> getting

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
with the largest circle and then getting

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.630 
with the largest circle and then getting
into<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> medium-sized<00:02:33.959> C<00:02:34.410> shape<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.100> finally

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
into a medium-sized C shape and finally

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.760 
into a medium-sized C shape and finally
stopping<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.360> really<00:02:36.690> small<00:02:36.870> C<00:02:37.290> shape<00:02:37.530> and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
stopping on a really small C shape and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.979 
stopping on a really small C shape and
finish<00:02:38.610> off<00:02:38.790> we're<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.510> three<00:02:39.750> dots

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
finish off we're going to do three dots

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:49.950 
finish off we're going to do three dots
going<00:02:40.770> from<00:02:41.040> larger<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:42.000> medium<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.750> small

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.690 

now<00:02:50.960> on<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.200> three<00:02:51.440> larger<00:02:51.860> outer<00:02:52.070> seas<00:02:52.430> we're

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
now on the three larger outer seas we're

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.310 
now on the three larger outer seas we're
going<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:52.880> start<00:02:53.120> doing<00:02:53.240> smaller<00:02:53.720> seas<00:02:53.990> just

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
going to start doing smaller seas just

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.920 
going to start doing smaller seas just
lining<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.070> line<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.520> then<00:02:56.480> which<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.720> going

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
lining the line and then which is going

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.720 
lining the line and then which is going
to<00:02:56.990> do<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> series<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.560> Criss<00:02:57.860> crosses<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:58.580> to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
to do a series of Criss crosses just to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.880 
to do a series of Criss crosses just to
fill<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.030> in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.990 

now<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.100> rest<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.550> see<00:03:09.700> shapes

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
now for the rest of the see shapes

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.820 
now for the rest of the see shapes
you're<00:03:10.210> just<00:03:10.390> going<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.570> do<00:03:10.750> Criss<00:03:10.990> crosses<00:03:11.440> so

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
you're just going to do Criss crosses so

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.650 
you're just going to do Criss crosses so
just<00:03:12.070> draw<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> series<00:03:12.580> of<00:03:12.730> lines<00:03:13.060> going

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
just draw a series of lines going

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.900 
just draw a series of lines going
towards<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> left<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.560> then<00:03:15.370> same<00:03:15.640> for<00:03:15.850> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
doing this all the land in a corner now

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.810 
doing this all the land in a corner now
for<00:03:29.830> around<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.130> design<00:03:30.430> you're<00:03:30.610> going<00:03:30.640> to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
for around the design you're going to

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.610 
for around the design you're going to
draw<00:03:30.940> dots<00:03:31.270> just<00:03:31.600> in<00:03:31.780> between<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.170> dips<00:03:32.410> in

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620

between<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:32.980> see<00:03:33.160> shapes<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.840> then<00:03:34.960> over

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
between the see shapes and then over

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.510 
between the see shapes and then over
this<00:03:35.320> you're<00:03:35.560> going<00:03:35.740> to<00:03:35.830> take<00:03:35.980> some<00:03:36.010> lash<00:03:36.310> glue

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
this you're going to take some lash glue

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.480 
this you're going to take some lash glue
going<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.300> apply<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.600> over<00:03:37.960> the<00:03:38.170> dots<00:03:38.490> and

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
going to apply this over the dots and

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.860 
going to apply this over the dots and
once<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.760> gets<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:40.000> little<00:03:40.090> bit<00:03:40.390> tacky<00:03:40.600> you're

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
once it gets a little bit tacky you're

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.570 
once it gets a little bit tacky you're
going<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.140> apply<00:03:41.380> rhinestones<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:42.160> top<00:03:42.400> and

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
going to apply rhinestones on top and

going to apply rhinestones on top and
you<00:03:42.850> know<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.090> lash<00:03:43.240> glue<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.570> tacky<00:03:43.780> once<00:03:44.110> it

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
you know the lash glue is tacky once it

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.630 
you know the lash glue is tacky once it
starts<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.560> go<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.710> bit<00:03:44.800> of<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.040> light<00:03:45.310> bluish
