don't think the update will be released
next<00:04:22.570> week<00:04:22.720> but<00:04:23.199> chances<00:04:23.949> are<00:04:24.099> the<00:04:24.310> update

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
next week but chances are the update

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.700 
next week but chances are the update
will<00:04:24.760> be<00:04:24.789> submitted<00:04:25.479> next<00:04:25.720> week<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.080> maybe<00:04:26.380> we

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
will be submitted next week so maybe we

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.350 
will be submitted next week so maybe we
can<00:04:26.800> see<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.070> update<00:04:27.340> in<00:04:27.520> two<00:04:27.760> weeks<00:04:28.000> from<00:04:28.150> now

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
can see the update in two weeks from now

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.320 
can see the update in two weeks from now
or<00:04:28.680> sooner<00:04:29.680> if<00:04:29.710> Apple<00:04:30.400> decides<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.789> prioritize

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
or sooner if Apple decides to prioritize

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.200 
or sooner if Apple decides to prioritize
one<00:04:31.539> of<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.690> most

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
one of the most

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.140 
one of the most
apps<00:04:32.509> ever<00:04:32.919> on<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:34.160> App<00:04:34.280> Store<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:34.729> think<00:04:35.030> that

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
apps ever on the App Store I think that

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.640 
apps ever on the App Store I think that
makes<00:04:35.360> sense<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:35.870> hopefully<00:04:36.199> we<00:04:36.289> can<00:04:36.440> see<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.620> a

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
makes sense so hopefully we can see it a

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.800 
makes sense so hopefully we can see it a
little<00:04:36.740> bit<00:04:36.919> sooner<00:04:37.160> than<00:04:37.280> later<00:04:37.430> but<00:04:38.150> that's

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
little bit sooner than later but that's

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.240
