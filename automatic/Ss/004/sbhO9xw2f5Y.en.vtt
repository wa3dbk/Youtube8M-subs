00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
down it's switching out Cynthia because

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.319 
down it's switching out Cynthia because
I<00:03:55.380> figured<00:03:55.709> okay<00:03:55.950> intimidate<00:03:56.790> has<00:03:56.970> already

I figured okay intimidate has already

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.420 
I figured okay intimidate has already
been<00:03:57.450> activated<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.260> Cynthia<00:03:59.010> does<00:03:59.220> have

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
has super power so he probably doesn't

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.010 
has super power so he probably doesn't
have<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:40.950> absolute<00:04:41.400> max<00:04:41.610> Special<00:04:42.030> Attack<00:04:42.090> but

are<00:04:48.120> mostly<00:04:48.390> there<00:04:48.630> for<00:04:49.260> for<00:04:49.500> time<00:04:49.680> weakness

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
are mostly there for for time weakness

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.790 
are mostly there for for time weakness
you<00:04:50.250> know<00:04:50.310> they're<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:50.670> there<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.150> be<00:04:51.800> used

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
you know they're not there to be used

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.460 
you know they're not there to be used
for<00:04:53.280> standard<00:04:54.180> damage<00:04:54.360> because<00:04:54.810> really<00:04:55.140> when

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
for standard damage because really when

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.140 
for standard damage because really when
it<00:04:55.560> comes<00:04:55.590> down<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.920> on<00:04:56.010> step<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.550> really<00:04:56.970> does

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
it comes down to on step it really does

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.840 
it comes down to on step it really does
not<00:04:57.300> take<00:04:57.360> down<00:04:57.750> anything<00:04:58.140> so<00:04:58.950> a<00:04:59.250> camera<00:04:59.610> is

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
not take down anything so a camera is

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.190 
not take down anything so a camera is
probably<00:05:00.030> something<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.810> he<00:05:00.990> would<00:05:01.080> the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
probably something that he would the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.600 
probably something that he would the

that I was thinking that's gonna be the
case<00:05:11.220> but<00:05:11.820> anyways<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.480> heated<00:05:12.900> switch<00:05:13.200> he

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
case but anyways the heated switch he

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.260 
case but anyways the heated switch he
did<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.770> switch<00:05:14.370> out<00:05:14.550> while<00:05:14.790> plume<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.150> then
