00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it's really really easy to do like I say

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.630 
it's really really easy to do like I say
and<00:01:07.590> once<00:01:07.799> you're<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.130> part<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.610> I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and once you're in this part what I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
and once you're in this part what I
recommend<00:01:09.030> doing<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.390> crouching<00:01:09.750> obviously

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
recommend doing is crouching obviously

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
recommend doing is crouching obviously
that<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:10.950> puts<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> right<00:01:11.310> inside<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
that actually puts you right inside the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.390 
that actually puts you right inside the
rock<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.780> people<00:01:12.960> can't<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
rock so then people can't see you but to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.499 
rock so then people can't see you but to
make<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.610> even<00:01:14.760> better<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.420> were

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
