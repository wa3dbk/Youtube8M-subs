00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
now is if we just get out of chair we

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
now is if we just get out of chair we
can<00:01:10.590> actually<00:01:10.860> rotate<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.510> place

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
can actually rotate them so if we place

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.140 
can actually rotate them so if we place
it<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.119> that

because<00:01:51.600> whoever<00:01:52.140> ported<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.710> over<00:01:53.040> who

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
because whoever ported it over who

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730 
because whoever ported it over who
didn't<00:01:53.909> actually<00:01:54.060> use<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> correct<00:01:55.380> model

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
didn't actually use the correct model

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.830 
didn't actually use the correct model
but<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.159> fixed<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.479> wouldn't<00:01:57.780> even

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
but it's fixed now and you wouldn't even

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.179 
but it's fixed now and you wouldn't even
notice<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.710> we're<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.100> the

kitchen<00:02:25.530> counters<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.310> again<00:02:26.670> these<00:02:26.880> are

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
kitchen counters and again these are

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.200 
kitchen counters and again these are
pretty<00:02:27.240> awesome<00:02:27.690> because<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:28.320> act<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
pretty awesome because they act like the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.150 
pretty awesome because they act like the
the<00:02:30.210> PC<00:02:30.810> version<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> mud<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.950> can

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the PC version of the mud so you can

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.640 
the PC version of the mud so you can
place<00:02:32.370> them<00:02:32.670> however<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.990> like<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:34.590> we

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
place them however you like so if we

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.370 
place them however you like so if we
come<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.010> way<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:36.120> see<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.390> we've

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
come this way you can see that we've

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.660 
come this way you can see that we've
kind<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.770> back<00:02:38.010> bit<00:02:38.280> but<00:02:38.460> then<00:02:38.580> we've

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
kind of this back bit but then we've

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.760 
kind of this back bit but then we've
also<00:02:38.880> got<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.180> lip<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.020> edge<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.590> and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
also got this lip on the edge here and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.950 
also got this lip on the edge here and
that<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.160> gives<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:42.000> counter<00:02:42.450> effect<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
that just gives that counter effect and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.130 
that just gives that counter effect and
then<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.160> also<00:02:44.810> make<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.840> come

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
then and then you can also make it come

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.900 
then and then you can also make it come
sideways<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.340> see<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.850> is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
sideways here and you can see that it is

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.440 
sideways here and you can see that it is
adjusting<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.310> adjacent<00:02:50.640> counters

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
adjusting to the adjacent counters

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.020 
adjusting to the adjacent counters
correctly<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.410> then<00:02:52.860> also<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.760> else<00:02:53.850> can

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
correctly and then also what else can

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.340 
correctly and then also what else can
you<00:02:54.060> do<00:02:54.240> oh<00:02:54.420> yeah<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.630> can<00:02:54.900> actually<00:02:54.990> create

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
you do oh yeah you can actually create

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.050 
you do oh yeah you can actually create
an<00:02:55.500> island<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.460> want<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.730> create<00:02:56.880> like

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
an island so if you want to create like

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.620 
an island so if you want to create like
an<00:02:57.180> island<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.690> would<00:02:57.750> put<00:02:57.990> one<00:02:58.020> there<00:02:59.630> put

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
an island you would put one there put

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.120 
an island you would put one there put
one<00:03:00.840> there<00:03:01.850> put<00:03:02.850> one<00:03:03.030> there<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.300> then<00:03:04.100> put<00:03:05.100> one

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
one there put one there and then put one

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.030 
one there put one there and then put one
there<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.940> then<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.690> lip<00:03:07.080> all<00:03:07.470> around

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
there and then you have a lip all around

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.150 
there and then you have a lip all around
the<00:03:08.550> entire<00:03:09.380> counter<00:03:10.380> here<00:03:10.620> now<00:03:10.770> if<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.950> were

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
the entire counter here now if you were

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.560 
the entire counter here now if you were
to<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.520> like<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.970> or<00:03:12.150> something<00:03:12.450> like

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
to do it like this or something like

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.130 
to do it like this or something like
that<00:03:13.130> as<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:15.270> can<00:03:15.360> see<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.780> doesn't<00:03:15.990> work

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
that as you can see it doesn't work

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.050 
that as you can see it doesn't work
properly<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.830> only<00:03:16.980> got<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.190> lip<00:03:17.490> on<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.820> side

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
properly we only got a lip on this side

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.400 
properly we only got a lip on this side
and<00:03:18.209> then<00:03:18.330> we<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:18.600> got<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> gap<00:03:19.170> in

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and then we just got like a gap in

direction each time you place them oh

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.660 
direction each time you place them oh
yeah<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.620> kitchen<00:03:26.010> counters<00:03:26.459> we've

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.780 
as well and I think you guessed it no
functionality<00:03:42.530> but<00:03:43.530> we've<00:03:44.160> basically<00:03:44.370> got

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
functionality but we've basically got

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.600 
functionality but we've basically got
the<00:03:44.820> books<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:46.230> renders<00:03:46.650> added<00:03:47.010> we've

they will change the render depending on

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.900

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
around then it won't render those middle

get block launcher and then test it out
for<00:04:48.990> yourself<00:04:49.410> which<00:04:49.590> would<00:04:49.740> be<00:04:49.860> really<00:04:50.070> cool

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
for yourself which would be really cool

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.040 
for yourself which would be really cool
and<00:04:50.460> then<00:04:50.760> we<00:04:50.970> could<00:04:51.120> also<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.600> would<00:04:51.690> be<00:04:51.810> good

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
and then we could also it would be good

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.840 
and then we could also it would be good
to<00:04:52.080> find<00:04:52.440> bugs<00:04:52.740> as<00:04:53.010> well<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.430> if<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.670> found

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
to find bugs as well so if you found

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.960 
to find bugs as well so if you found
bugs<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:55.500> could<00:04:55.680> go<00:04:55.860> ahead<00:04:55.980> and<00:04:56.280> submit<00:04:56.520> so

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
bugs you could go ahead and submit so

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.540 
bugs you could go ahead and submit so
we'll<00:04:57.210> submit<00:04:57.810> them<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.620> github<00:04:58.830> repo<00:04:59.400> and

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
we'll submit them on the github repo and

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.450 
we'll submit them on the github repo and
then<00:04:59.700> we<00:05:00.270> can<00:05:00.450> deal<00:05:00.630> with<00:05:00.660> them<00:05:01.020> later<00:05:01.710> but

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
then we can deal with them later but

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.430 
then we can deal with them later but
anyway<00:05:02.820> that's<00:05:03.240> going<00:05:03.480> to<00:05:03.570> end<00:05:03.690> off<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.050> I

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
anyway that's going to end off and I

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.230 
anyway that's going to end off and I
will<00:05:04.650> see<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:04.920> guys<00:05:05.070> next<00:05:05.310> time<00:05:05.490> for<00:05:06.090> another

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
will see you guys next time for another

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.300 
will see you guys next time for another
video<00:05:06.510> which<00:05:06.930> will<00:05:07.110> most<00:05:07.320> likely<00:05:07.500> be<00:05:08.280> a

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
video which will most likely be a

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.480 
video which will most likely be a
redstone<00:05:08.700> tutorial<00:05:09.860> because<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:11.130> actually

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
redstone tutorial because I actually

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.250 
redstone tutorial because I actually
record<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.060> redstone<00:05:12.420> tutorial<00:05:12.840> before<00:05:13.110> this

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
record a redstone tutorial before this

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.530 
record a redstone tutorial before this
but<00:05:13.560> at<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.980> end<00:05:14.160> of<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.460> tutorial<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:15.030> tested

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
but at the end of the tutorial I tested

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.290 
but at the end of the tutorial I tested
the<00:05:15.750> machine<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.680> didn't<00:05:17.040> work<00:05:17.150> which<00:05:18.150> is

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
the machine and it didn't work which is

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.970 
the machine and it didn't work which is
really<00:05:18.630> unfortunate<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.500> I<00:05:19.620> built<00:05:19.860> it

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
really unfortunate and I built it

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.760 
really unfortunate and I built it
exactly<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.850> same<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.450> actually<00:05:21.630> looked<00:05:22.500> I

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
exactly the same I actually looked I

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.770 
exactly the same I actually looked I
went<00:05:23.370> back<00:05:23.640> and<00:05:23.790> forth<00:05:24.030> between<00:05:24.210> these<00:05:24.540> two

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
went back and forth between these two

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.990
