00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.689
 Today I teach you to make the flower of fire 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.689
 of super mario bros 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.350
 for today you need red green felt 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.430
 yellow black and white thread in the 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.150
 same colors scissors glue something 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.940
 to mark the fabric a polo stick 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.030
 needles and pins and synthetic stuffing 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.860
 my employer 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.719
 once you have the whole pattern 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.000
 cut in fabric let's start 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.769
 joining the first four pieces what 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.600
 first thing we're going to do is paste the 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:48.550
 eyes with some glue and starting 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.379
 from here you have two options to follow 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.570
 gluing the layers with glue or 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.070
 sew them with thread and needle I'm going to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.659
 do the two ways for you to see 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.670
 how it is done and choose the one that most 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:02.010
 like the first one with a little 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.010
 glue and the second sewn by hand 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.870
 when we have finished sewing or gluing 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.120
 those pieces put on the other piece 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.890
 red you have left and sew around to 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.850
 exception of a couple of centimeters that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.850
 we will leave without sewing 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.510
 already attached to turn it carefully 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.780
 through the gap we had left 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:39.750
 fill what 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.000
 and sew the opening when you have the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.310
 head list leave it aside and start 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.570
 with the bottom part what we're going to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.030
 do is sew all the pieces 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.770
 around with one point back except 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.580
 of the stem in which we will leave one of its 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.830
 ends without sewing once we have 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.570
 the stitched pieces we will take the stem and 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.869
 we will introduce the stick by the end 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.820
 without sewing and cut the excess with 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.289
 this will get a very stiff stem 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.390
 that immediately we will get to the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.830
 back of the head now just you 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.300
 the leaves remain sewn in the part 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.110
 back just like you did with the stem and 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.300
 ready 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.980
 You've finished your fire flower I this 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.140
 stuffed toy I'm going to use to decorate 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.370
 I bought a small pot and I'm going 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.980
 to put between my collection of 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.780
 old video games and you where 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.060
