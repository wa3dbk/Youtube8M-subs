brain you know if you slice his brain
here<00:04:22.779> this<00:04:23.349> is<00:04:23.529> where<00:04:23.710> his<00:04:23.919> eyes<00:04:24.130> would<00:04:24.430> be<00:04:24.700> and

here this is where his eyes would be and

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.070 
here this is where his eyes would be and
what<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.710> neural

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
what the neural

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.469 
what the neural

in that orbital frontal region that same

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.730 
in that orbital frontal region that same
region<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.389> brain<00:04:35.599> then<00:04:36.319> these<00:04:36.530> aren't

physically holes it's a functional brain

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.529 
physically holes it's a functional brain
scan<00:04:39.289> so<00:04:39.530> again<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.400> same<00:04:40.669> brain<00:04:40.969> argument

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
scan so again the same brain argument

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.110 
scan so again the same brain argument
could<00:04:41.689> apply<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.319> kinko<00:04:43.009> here<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.580> if<00:04:44.000> you

could apply to kinko here and if you

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.629 
could apply to kinko here and if you
