00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.060
 but today it's time for 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.219
 verdict on hard snow it's 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.910
 dangerous and it's also now that 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.910
 the medal is played 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.330
 you still imagine yourself a little bit 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.350
 worse except that we must not think that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
 inevitably it will become in the head 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.400
 imagine you fall on your head 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.920
 you just have to go through your head 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.200
 and that it comes out and after to try 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.580
 not to think about that I think about the 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.290
 technique I took I must do that I 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.790
 have to do that and I'm talking to myself for 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.960
 evacuate I tell myself so who are you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.970
 shoots you make attack 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.190
 you stay in a hard reception 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.940
 all that means I do not have time 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.440
 to be afraid and by the time I leave I 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.330
 keep telling me I keep going 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.680
 repeat it and I have no time to have 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.360
 scared I have no time to be a little 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.360
 little paralyzed by fear we will say 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.830
 all 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.240
 and not usually that 's the date 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.469
 of arrival and poor Swiss guardian 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.659
 double it looks like he's going to make a 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.390
 warrior a jump there is a help to 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.520
 men because he's like that and strength 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.229
 like a sick 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.110
 I am here to work a little 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.549
 little soft switches and so I try to 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.649
 find the technique to get there 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.539
 because for now it's not 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.890
 still that 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.080
 I put myself a few boxes I am 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.520
 with greg there that they knew the 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.429
 find the solutions for me to arrive 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.630
 well done two days that I try to 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.829
 days that I put myself on the back 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.450
 I would like today if you 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:21.680
 put on the feet I wait for the end I 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:24.430
 drives men to view 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.430
 m 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:38.380
 look it's a phew thing when I have 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:40.560

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.560
