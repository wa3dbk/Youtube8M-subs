00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.760
 When I wait it looks like that 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:13.019
 you what that means that means it is 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:15.420
 We are doing so openly today 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.250
 So what's cool is how it is always 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.010
 today there is dutch oven crust roast 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.010
 and was with a black pants 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.490
 So we start with a bowl and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.929
 a few sips of black beer and 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.850
 take a crusty roast of this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.800
 crust roast here is about one 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.020
 kilogram heavy and comes from 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.710
 Swabian-style hog 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.129
 excellent quality 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.760
 this is worthwhile with the saving 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.570
 in the bottom of the bowl give something else 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.460
 pour black beer and for three to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.460
 four hours cold 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.780
 that is fully ready after three to four hours 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.980
 then the black looks like that 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.980
 dab once well dry 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.430
 and then we take care of the seasoning 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.730
 I have coarse sea salt and there 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.040
 I mix some ground caraway with me 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:45.840
 in and now we put the rind 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.260
 carelessly at all times with this salt 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260
 mixture 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.790
 when that's done, we'll take care of it 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.890
 our dutch oven i have something 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.840
 pig's lard pig's lard 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.840
 difficult word lard 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 prepared 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.170
 about six to seven coco briquettes 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.170
 put under 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.209
 and when the lard melted 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.660
 is getting more difficult 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.640
 we give an onion to fit this 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.500
 briefly stew a little and then give 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.500
 another clove of garlic behind 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.980
 Now we leave the amount something 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.540
 steam and then we give the same 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.569
 already our crust roast with it 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.160
 in that case I always do it like that 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.470
 I make crusty roast in the germanhof 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.480
 logically, the costs are higher 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.729
 shows and not just short customers with 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.440
 after a few seconds he will be 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.479
 also from below we indicated one 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.479
 decent sip of black beer 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.080
 the rest is really huge now 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.090
 Do not make any last cover on it 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.240
 Clue 10 carbons on top and let 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.250
 the whole then rooted itself 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.650
 in between, after about 45 minutes 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.480
 namely usually the first time 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.610
 core temperature from the roast as soon as possible 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.380
 this 65 degrees has reached namely the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.460
 Cover again and leave something else 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.550
 reduce the sauce 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.650
 that looks like there are about 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.570
 we almost finished already yes me 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.820
 white is dark in Germany around the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.290
 clock-four thirty does that with us 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.230
 really downhill I hope you 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.950
 can recognize it anyway 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.950
 I'll take you with me here 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.960
 you just have to do it a bit 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.060
 Be careful not to overdo it 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.750
 coal on top has that one 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.220
 the saved not charred directly but 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.950
 if that looks like you have certainly 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.240
 a lot done right so i hope you 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.470
 You can see a little bit what you can 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.980
 In any case, that I know here 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:41.280
 falsely against the fiber 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.670
 so cut the whole thing up 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.670
 from the side 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.590
 in between times also like to try 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.970
 I like to thank everyone 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.260

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.900

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.980
 tried dutch open crust roast in 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.980
 black biggest sensations 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:11.740
 if you end up with something of that 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.720
 have a reduced sauce bottled that 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.070
 Excellent with a few dumplings 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.440
 and my red cabbage yesterday 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.570
