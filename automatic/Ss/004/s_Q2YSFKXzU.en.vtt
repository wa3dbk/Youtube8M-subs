especially between cloud nine for things
I<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.840> maybe<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> best<00:00:43.649> team

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
I for the up maybe one of the best team

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.889 
I for the up maybe one of the best team
in<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:45.120> world<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.670> think<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.899> they'll

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
in in world at what I think the they'll

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.979 
in in world at what I think the they'll
probably<00:00:49.200> stronger<00:00:49.500> than<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> Chinese<00:00:50.520> team

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
probably stronger than the Chinese team

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
probably stronger than the Chinese team

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
what a best-of-five brings to the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.350 
what a best-of-five brings to the
balance<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.430> comparison<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.030> best-of-three

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
balance in comparison to a best-of-three

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.310 
balance in comparison to a best-of-three
for<00:02:20.660> example<00:02:21.880> best<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.030> three<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.750> even<00:02:24.110> do<00:02:24.260> is

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
for example best of three can even do is

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.110 
for example best of three can even do is
not<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.890> best<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.160> fun<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.460> can<00:02:25.610> still<00:02:25.820> choose

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
not the best of fun you can still choose

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.690 
not the best of fun you can still choose

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
this one and in a best-of-three a weaker

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.460 
this one and in a best-of-three a weaker
team<00:02:52.550> can<00:02:52.940> still<00:02:53.210> win<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.930> better<00:02:54.080> team

but<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.130> don't<00:02:55.400> think<00:02:55.520> in<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.390> best-of-five<00:02:56.690> it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
but I don't think in the best-of-five it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.950 
but I don't think in the best-of-five it
can<00:02:57.080> happen<00:02:57.940> okay<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.300> occasion<00:02:59.660> more<00:02:59.750> about

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
can happen okay so occasion more about

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.170 
can happen okay so occasion more about
