really we went from giving up 66

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.840 
really we went from giving up 66
probably<00:00:59.579> six<00:00:59.910> yards<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.660> play<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.050> change<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
probably six yards of play and change to

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.280 
probably six yards of play and change to
one<00:01:02.850> point<00:01:03.149> nine<00:01:03.210> yards<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> play<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
one point nine yards of play for the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.020 
one point nine yards of play for the
entire<00:01:04.559> second<00:01:05.040> half<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
entire second half it was one of the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
entire second half it was one of the
most<00:01:06.180> impressive<00:01:06.600> halftime<00:01:07.260> turnarounds<00:01:07.890> by

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
most impressive halftime turnarounds by

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.820 
most impressive halftime turnarounds by
unit<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> I've<00:01:08.760> seen<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.799> really

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.550 
unit that I've seen and you know really
I<00:01:11.189> think<00:01:11.659> defensively<00:01:12.659> those<00:01:13.110> guys<00:01:13.350> are

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
I think defensively those guys are

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.249 
I think defensively those guys are
excited<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.010> play<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:15.259> relaxed

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
excited to play but they just relaxed

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.039 
excited to play but they just relaxed
and<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.369> did<00:01:18.030> their<00:01:18.180> deal<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.689> know<00:01:18.810> just

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and and did their deal you know just

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830 
and and did their deal you know just
really<00:01:19.920> changed<00:01:20.490> body<00:01:21.030> language<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.689> little

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
really changed body language a little

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.260 
really changed body language a little
and<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.979> played<00:01:23.220> together<00:01:23.400> well<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and really played together well and I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
and really played together well and I
think<00:01:24.540> they<00:01:24.689> were<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:24.990> key<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.500> our
