 observe and not fall into the situation 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.330

 It is not new 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.230
 and then 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 I hear you let's talk and the truth 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.129
 that you do not come here is in trasmirÃ¡s that

 the championship has started 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:43.970
 but does not recognize that the majority 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:12.769
 but it's not bad because my mouth 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.700
 animal 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.700
 what is wrong 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.720

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:42.830
 It is a quilombo
