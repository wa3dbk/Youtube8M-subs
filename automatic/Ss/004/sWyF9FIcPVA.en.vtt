 maps of which we will speak today the sexy map 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.419
 an add-on that replaces our 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.090
 current typical minimap by another with a 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.369
 much more colorful appearance for it 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.830

 the general configuration of the side does not 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.550
 we have to block the minimap and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.379
 move it where we want crack to screen 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.530
 to prevent it from being displaced by others 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.170
 addons rotate minimap so that instead of 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.729
 rotate our character arrow rotate 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.710
 the area where we are and always 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.390

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 configurations where they already come 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.840
 configured some examples with 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 effects and others that we can use 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.220
 we have for example the solar ring 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.790
 in the portal rooney co 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.410
 the electric type etc being 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.900
 default settings of the own 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.150
 addon then to the right we have the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.170
 presets or special configurations 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.300
 like the clouds 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.710

 the first tab that we see is the one 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.720
 borders that in every configuration that 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.880
 we choose we can modify it freely 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.700
 above we see current edges and pre 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.700
 configuration let's choose the blue one 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.009
 room steel care for example in borders 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.470
 current we see that we have all the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.270
 information of that type starting with the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.179
 shape of the map of which we have 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.939
 enough to choose as we see 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.370
 well on the edges we can modify 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:16.159
 everything about this guy in this 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.140
 case in fader is where we see the inside 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.810
 the type of layer to activate or deactivate 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.650
 the rotation and so on that are very 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.260
 specific and change in each presents 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.510
 we have the bottom or edge and then the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.819
 runes in this case where we can 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.730
 choose the color mainly the 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.349
 rotation speed and scale but 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.819
 let's go with the presets that are coming 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.510
 more than enough to not have to 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.580
 reconfigure them again 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.519
 we go to the next tab the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.409
 buttons the first important thing is if 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.750
 we want the buttons to control 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.170
 own given and the radius in which they are going to 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.569
 be of this 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.550

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.160
 the sexy more control the visibility of 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.680
 the buttons if we do we can 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.020
 configure it manually so that it 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.360
 always see them when they see the 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.200
 mouse over or that are always 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.810
 hidden 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.030
 we have the standard calendar buttons 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.060
 finder buttons to enlarge decrease 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.620
 the map etc. the dynamic ones and then 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.440
 those of each addon that we have in the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.630
 mini map 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.690
 once configured we go to the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.780
 next tab the clock setting 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.880
 typical text color positioning and 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.100
 as before if we want it to be always 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.500
 visible when you mouse over or 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.930
 the following tab is hidden 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.630
 we have is sorted by enabling 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.490
 we can return them where we want 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.510
 change the font color the type the 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.400
 background and we all go to the have map that 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.980
 although it is not used much we will see the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.260
 less for what purpose when activating it 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.290
 our mini-map will disappear and 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.330
 will set wallpaper according to 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.700
 let's go forward it will be left marked 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.160
 our tour this option comes very 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.680
 well at the time of using the npc scan the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.470
 gatt erez then helper or other addons 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.480
 deformed or follow-up since it will use all 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.670
 our screen as if a map were 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.190
 try knowing where we have been since 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.130
 or where we would miss to go 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.470
 we went to the movers that basically is 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.870
 by unlocking the three types that 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.780
 we have information the longest is 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.180
 the text of emissions the medium 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.340
 of the vehicle and the smallest of the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.870
 durability of the armor itself 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.170
 we want to move them to another side more than 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.270
 nothing the ping tab as well indicates 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.760
 is in case someone uses a ping on the minimap 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.640
 follow the model in the chat that 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.290
 show and do not show it etcetera and 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.800
 then the last tab that is the 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.720
 text area that is to modify the type 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.630
 of the upper text area of ​​the maps 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.030
 the font color the type the background 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.620
 etcetera and of course if we want 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.330
 always be seen when you mouse over 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.430
 over hide it 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.530
 well this is the configuration that 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.840
 has the sexy map currently that is 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.669
 pretty simple as we can see with 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.490
 a few adjustments we will have the minimap 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.080
