00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.320 

a<00:05:35.800> lot<00:05:36.610> of<00:05:36.790> lot<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.360> really<00:05:37.960> noise<00:05:38.170> there<00:05:38.560> to<00:05:38.740> me

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
a lot of lot of really noise there to me

00:05:39.330 --> 00:06:08.990 
a lot of lot of really noise there to me
now<00:05:40.330> these<00:05:40.540> come<00:05:40.870> back

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.220 

good<00:06:10.000> sound<00:06:10.300> I'm<00:06:10.480> really<00:06:10.720> happy<00:06:10.900> with<00:06:11.020> that

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
good sound I'm really happy with that

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.180 
good sound I'm really happy with that
sound<00:06:11.530> when<00:06:12.190> Jim<00:06:12.430> first<00:06:12.790> sold<00:06:13.450> me<00:06:13.630> the<00:06:13.720> speaker

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
sound when Jim first sold me the speaker

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.440 
sound when Jim first sold me the speaker
he<00:06:15.190> says<00:06:15.370> if<00:06:15.520> you're<00:06:15.610> like<00:06:15.880> the<00:06:16.030> sound<00:06:16.270> now

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
he says if you're like the sound now

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.080 
he says if you're like the sound now
wait<00:06:16.840> till<00:06:17.050> you<00:06:17.140> hear<00:06:17.320> about<00:06:17.590> 20<00:06:18.310> hours<00:06:18.520> after

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
wait till you hear about 20 hours after

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.760 
wait till you hear about 20 hours after
playing<00:06:19.300> it<00:06:19.480> I<00:06:19.570> guess<00:06:19.810> something<00:06:20.440> about<00:06:20.530> the

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
playing it I guess something about the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.440 
playing it I guess something about the
speaker<00:06:21.040> opens<00:06:21.490> up<00:06:21.640> or<00:06:21.850> breaks<00:06:22.090> in<00:06:22.330> or

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
speaker opens up or breaks in or

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.000 
speaker opens up or breaks in or
something<00:06:22.660> like<00:06:22.870> that<00:06:22.930> I<00:06:23.260> hadn't<00:06:23.800> really

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
something like that I hadn't really

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.000 
something like that I hadn't really
believing<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.720> I<00:06:25.720> did<00:06:26.470> but<00:06:26.560> I<00:06:26.620> bought<00:06:26.830> it

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
believing and I did but I bought it

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.070 
believing and I did but I bought it
because<00:06:27.130> I<00:06:27.400> did<00:06:28.030> like<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.390> sound<00:06:28.630> of<00:06:28.780> them<00:06:28.960> and

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
because I did like the sound of them and

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.950 
because I did like the sound of them and
but<00:06:29.440> he's<00:06:29.620> right<00:06:29.890> after<00:06:30.460> I<00:06:30.880> probably<00:06:31.330> got<00:06:31.540> 50

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
but he's right after I probably got 50

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.590 
but he's right after I probably got 50
hours<00:06:32.290> on<00:06:32.500> this<00:06:32.850> no<00:06:33.850> I<00:06:33.880> probably<00:06:34.180> got<00:06:34.360> a<00:06:34.420> lot

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
hours on this no I probably got a lot

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.970 
hours on this no I probably got a lot
more<00:06:34.630> than<00:06:34.840> 50<00:06:35.170> hours<00:06:35.410> on<00:06:35.560> they'll<00:06:35.770> come<00:06:35.950> to

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
more than 50 hours on they'll come to

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.670 
more than 50 hours on they'll come to
think<00:06:36.250> of<00:06:36.310> it<00:06:36.430> now<00:06:36.580> but<00:06:37.290> probably<00:06:38.290> when<00:06:38.410> I<00:06:38.440> had

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
think of it now but probably when I had

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.220 
think of it now but probably when I had
about<00:06:38.890> 20<00:06:39.280> hours<00:06:39.310> I<00:06:39.880> I<00:06:40.090> did<00:06:40.480> hear<00:06:40.690> a<00:06:40.720> difference

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
about 20 hours I I did hear a difference

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.380 
about 20 hours I I did hear a difference
just<00:06:41.560> one<00:06:41.770> day<00:06:41.950> I<00:06:41.980> thought<00:06:42.370> bother<00:06:42.940> that

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390 
just one day I thought bother that

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.110 
just one day I thought bother that
speaker<00:06:43.690> really<00:06:44.020> is<00:06:44.110> expressive<00:06:44.770> so<00:06:45.120> anyway

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
speaker really is expressive so anyway

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.970 
speaker really is expressive so anyway
