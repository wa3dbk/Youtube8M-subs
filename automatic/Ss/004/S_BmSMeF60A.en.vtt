00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
lot of oil to them as Hilsa is a very

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
lot of oil to them as Hilsa is a very
oily<00:00:54.360> fish<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> once<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.800> start<00:00:56.160> frying<00:00:56.550> them

it kind of oozes out the oil and that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.470 
it kind of oozes out the oil and that
makes<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.170> curry<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:01.770> special<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.180> since
