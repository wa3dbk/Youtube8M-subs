00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
of it so doesn't really make sense but

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.440 
of it so doesn't really make sense but
it's<00:01:18.830> anyway<00:01:19.830> say<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.909> killed<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.330> the

ghosts and now we just went through the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
ghosts and now we just went through the
maze<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.430> did<00:01:23.610> fast-forward<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> suckers<00:01:24.659> I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
on walking around so and I'm not really

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.320 
on walking around so and I'm not really
sure<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:21.250> works<00:02:21.460> for<00:02:21.670> everyone<00:02:22.000> like<00:02:22.150> this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
sure it works for everyone like this

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.000 
sure it works for everyone like this
site<00:02:22.570> if<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.900> takes<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.260> 10<00:02:23.470> minutes<00:02:23.740> because<00:02:23.830> I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
site if it takes in 10 minutes because I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.250 
site if it takes in 10 minutes because I
had<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.460> he<00:02:24.610> just<00:02:24.820> was<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.540> respawns<00:02:26.050> and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
had that he just was like respawns and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.140 
had that he just was like respawns and
sneak<00:02:26.590> for<00:02:26.770> some<00:02:26.920> people<00:02:27.250> as<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.910> see<00:02:28.060> you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
sneak for some people as you see you

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.910 
sneak for some people as you see you
feed<00:02:28.390> them<00:02:28.540> whilst<00:02:29.140> looking<00:02:29.350> towards<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
feed them whilst looking towards the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.410 
feed them whilst looking towards the
hole<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.520> don't<00:02:30.670> really<00:02:30.790> see<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.060> from<00:02:31.240> my

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
hole you don't really see it from my

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.730 
hole you don't really see it from my
angle<00:02:31.540> because<00:02:31.840> there's<00:02:31.990> too<00:02:32.140> many<00:02:32.260> zombies

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
angle because there's too many zombies

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.890 
angle because there's too many zombies
