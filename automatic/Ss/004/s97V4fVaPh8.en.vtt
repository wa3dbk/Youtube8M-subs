00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.119
 good we are going to present the 2013 range 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.349
 of spiuk footwear in this case we have 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.070
 caught the top of range with reference z 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.070
 15 rc 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.110
 let's first show the shoe 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.150
 We are going to explain the three 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.810
 main characteristics of the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.300
 stepper stepper 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:43.690
 we started with the sole in this model 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.210
 we have chosen a 100% carbon sole 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.570
 what brings a lot of rigidity to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.570
 sneakers 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.969
 It is available for every light 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.850
 and good and that is very light 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.430
 as for the cover the cover the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.010
 fabric used in perforated microfiber 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.170
 confirms and configures me is a fabric we 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.170
 brings great comfort 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.590
 and well the perforated what it has is that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.590
 is giving us a ventilation 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.369
 on the shoe 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.670
 on the cover we have also used 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.350
 the molded thermos that is a fusion that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.090
 it is made by injection to microfiber 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.789
 with the molded thermos what we get 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.909
 is that the shoes do much better 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.370
 our foot especially good for 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.480
 people who can reach 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.220
 to suffer problems in it we get 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.990
 best fit 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.660
 the molded volume we are doing 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.409
 by preheating in about 60 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.760
 degrees for 15 minutes 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.040
 in those which in the 15 minutes 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.380
 the deck loses everything its 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.120
 properties and it deforms in such a way 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.120
 that when we take it out of the oven 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.590
 and we put it on again pedaling 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.500
 for another 20 minutes we got that 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.660
 recover its normal temperature and it 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.930
 adapt 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.299
 to our skin 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.060
 the third great advantage that this has 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:27.329
 Sneaker are the two closures 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.450
 micrometers that incorporates roulette 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.629
 with the two closures what we got 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.299
 is that the shoe makes an adjustment 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.370
 complete and uniform both for the part 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.049
 superior as the bottom of such 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.620
 way that when we adjust it to 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:46.740
 our foot point to point the tension that 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.650
 is offering us is the correct 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.830
 and then also good to tell you that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.540
 the time to remove the foot 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.490
 turning in the opposite direction to 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.600
 clock hands has an opening 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.600
 easy and fast 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.430
 The thread is a kevlar thread with which 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.860
 we get more rigidity and not lose 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.459
 no flexion when climbing 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.459
 large ports 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.280
 also incorporates two types of 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.430
 templates 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.880
 one for winter with all the part 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.260
 bottom closed to avoid loss of 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.620
 foot heat and cold air intake 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.060
 and one of summer we are completely 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.640
 perforated from the bottom so that 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.010
 let the air circulate and let us have our foot 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.810
 completely refrigerated 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.580
 this particular model is made in two 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.580
 green and red colors 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.200
 the set of the three characteristics 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.870
 it is explained both of closure and 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.910
 Deck and sole makes this shoe 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.910
 be one of the lightest on the market 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.180
 in the mountain model 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.430
 the characteristics are the same with the 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.810
 difference of sole sole same 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.660
 incorporates a 100% carbon sole for 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.229
 give us rigidity and lightness and then a 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.229
 taco hado 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.189
 good adventures to be able to 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.289
 get the neighborhood to go well and not 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:32.289
 we have loss of traction 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.340
 the name that we have given to the 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:43.560
 reference of 15 we have given it because 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.420
 this is the 15th anniversary that we make and 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.110
 good with us is a pretty year 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.110
 important
