course<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.500> course<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> starting<00:01:15.030> off<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.360> got

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
course of course so starting off as got

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
course of course so starting off as got
intel<00:01:16.170> cpu<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.430> AMD<00:01:17.909> cpu<00:01:18.659> sorry<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.380> video<00:01:19.920> GPU

intel cpu the AMD cpu sorry in video GPU

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.300 
intel cpu the AMD cpu sorry in video GPU
and<00:01:20.850> AMD<00:01:21.509> GPU<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> minimum

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and AMD GPU and this is the minimum

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.640 
and AMD GPU and this is the minimum
requirements<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
requirements here and this is the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.560 
requirements here and this is the
predicted<00:01:26.040> requirements<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.450> is

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
predicted requirements here this is

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.550 
predicted requirements here this is
based<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.290> game<00:01:28.500> debate<00:01:29.040> website<00:01:29.700> so

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
based on the game debate website so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.060 
based on the game debate website so
entail<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:32.490> duo<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:33.630> 1.8<00:01:34.200> giga<00:01:34.350> hertz<00:01:34.590> roughly

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
entail to duo was 1.8 giga hertz roughly

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.510 
entail to duo was 1.8 giga hertz roughly
to<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.579> AMD<00:01:36.299> 64<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.439> roughly<00:01:37.829> eat<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
to the AMD 64 which is roughly eat I

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.460 
to the AMD 64 which is roughly eat I
think<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.939> reform<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.479> sure<00:01:39.780> I'm<00:01:40.259> not

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
think it's to reform not sure I'm not

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.719 
think it's to reform not sure I'm not
really<00:01:40.650> sure<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.159> let's<00:01:41.369> check<00:01:41.400> into

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
really sure about that let's check into

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.660 
really sure about that let's check into
