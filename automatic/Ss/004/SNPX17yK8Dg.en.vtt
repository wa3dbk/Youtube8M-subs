00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.990 
rather have super speed or the ability
to<00:04:12.020> teleport<00:04:12.350> anywhere<00:04:12.890> now<00:04:13.670> this<00:04:13.820> is<00:04:13.940> a

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
to teleport anywhere now this is a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.790 
to teleport anywhere now this is a
really<00:04:14.480> good<00:04:14.630> question<00:04:14.780> because<00:04:15.140> both<00:04:15.560> are

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
really good question because both are

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.500 
really good question because both are
really<00:04:16.070> similar<00:04:16.520> you<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:16.940> get<00:04:17.090> from<00:04:17.270> one

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
really similar you can get from one

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.400 
really similar you can get from one
place<00:04:18.080> to<00:04:18.470> another<00:04:19.210> extremely<00:04:20.210> fast<00:04:20.720> but

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
place to another extremely fast but

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.690 
place to another extremely fast but
teleport<00:04:21.980> you<00:04:22.100> could<00:04:22.250> go<00:04:22.400> through

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
teleport you could go through

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.100 
teleport you could go through
wall<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.330> I'm<00:04:23.420> going<00:04:23.480> to<00:04:23.600> go<00:04:23.690> ahead<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.900> go

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
wall so I'm going to go ahead and go

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.050 
wall so I'm going to go ahead and go
with<00:04:24.140> teleport<00:04:25.040> because<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.580> think<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:25.910> would

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
with teleport because I think that would

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.430 
with teleport because I think that would
be<00:04:26.120> very<00:04:26.210> awesome<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.080> get<00:04:27.320> yourself

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
be very awesome and you get yourself

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.740 
be very awesome and you get yourself
into<00:04:27.860> places<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.610> you<00:04:28.850> normally<00:04:29.270> couldn't

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
into places that you normally couldn't

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.350 
into places that you normally couldn't
even<00:04:30.110> with<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.410> super<00:04:30.770> speed<00:04:31.040> our<00:04:32.030> next

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
even with the super speed our next

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.020 
even with the super speed our next
question<00:04:32.540> comes<00:04:32.750> from<00:04:32.960> Super<00:04:33.410> Bee<00:04:33.560> 884<00:04:34.490> hey

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
used to watch like the original

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.130 
used to watch like the original
transformers<00:04:52.120> like<00:04:53.120> Michael<00:04:53.570> Bay<00:04:53.720> ones<00:04:53.990> I

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
transformers like Michael Bay ones I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.110 
transformers like Michael Bay ones I
used<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.410> watch<00:04:54.530> his<00:04:54.800> just<00:04:55.070> just<00:04:55.490> as<00:04:55.640> action

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
used to watch his just just as action

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.120 
used to watch his just just as action
scenes<00:04:56.420> like<00:04:56.600> I'd<00:04:56.750> skip<00:04:57.080> forward<00:04:57.620> through<00:04:58.010> the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
up here with the sunburn that I got so I

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.300 
up here with the sunburn that I got so I
wanted<00:05:41.660> to<00:05:41.750> keep<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:42.050> short<00:05:42.440> because<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:43.070> feel
