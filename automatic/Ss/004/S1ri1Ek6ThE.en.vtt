have volunteered to participate in this
project<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.780> what<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.440> here<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.889> this

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
project and what I do here in this

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.829 
project and what I do here in this
little<00:00:14.250> lab<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.610> test<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.120> nitrate<00:00:15.599> and

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
little lab is test for nitrate and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.290 
little lab is test for nitrate and
phosphate<00:00:16.080> runoff<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.980> their<00:00:17.220> water<00:00:17.760> that's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
phosphate runoff in their water that's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.570 
phosphate runoff in their water that's
coming<00:00:18.660> off<00:00:18.779> their<00:00:19.020> farms<00:00:19.470> these<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.400> two

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
coming off their farms these are the two

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.099 
coming off their farms these are the two
samples<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.060> I've<00:00:21.240> been<00:00:21.330> given<00:00:21.660> from<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
samples that I've been given from a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.269 
samples that I've been given from a
farmer<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.630> standard<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.619> this

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
farmer and this is the standard and this

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.060 
farmer and this is the standard and this
is<00:00:26.460> my<00:00:26.580> D<00:00:26.640> mineralized<00:00:27.599> water<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.619> I'll<00:00:28.769> use

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
is my D mineralized water that I'll use

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.700 
is my D mineralized water that I'll use
for<00:00:29.099> my<00:00:29.400> blank<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> first<00:00:30.900> process<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
for my blank so the first process is I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
for my blank so the first process is I
take<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.160> mill<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.610> each<00:00:32.759> sample<00:00:33.590> say<00:00:34.590> 1<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.380> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
take a mill of each sample say 1 and you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:47.470 
take a mill of each sample say 1 and you
put<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.960> that's<00:00:40.200> gotten<00:00:40.590> rid<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.990 

mill<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.960> standard<00:00:49.590> every<00:00:50.430> time<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> run<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
mill of the standard every time I run a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
mill of the standard every time I run a
tests<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.629> nitrates<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.530> standard<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
tests of nitrates that standard and a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830 
tests of nitrates that standard and a
blank<00:00:53.430> has<00:00:53.610> done<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> blanks<00:00:54.270> done<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.809> if

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
blank has done the blanks done to see if

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.869 
blank has done the blanks done to see if
you<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.110> contamination<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.399> standards

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you have contamination the standards

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.279 
you have contamination the standards
done<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.449> sure<00:00:57.480> you're<00:00:57.840> keeping<00:00:58.020> that

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
done to make sure you're keeping that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.860 
done to make sure you're keeping that
same<00:00:58.590> level<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> time<00:00:59.609> otherwise<00:01:00.539> if

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
same level all the time otherwise if

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.450 
same level all the time otherwise if
it's<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.260> different<00:01:01.500> you've<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.250> sort

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it's way different you've got some sort

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.700 
it's way different you've got some sort
of<00:01:02.520> contamination<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.320> my

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of contamination so then this is my

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.800 
of contamination so then this is my
demineralized<00:01:05.610> water<00:01:05.760> which<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.450> blank

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
demineralized water which was my blank

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.200 
demineralized water which was my blank
and<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.979> filled<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> 20<00:01:09.030> mil

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and it's just filled up to the 20 mil

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.560 
and it's just filled up to the 20 mil
mark<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.580> you're<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.270> sure

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
mark and you're just going to make sure

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.240 
mark and you're just going to make sure
that<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.990> meniscus<00:01:13.470> line<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.189> underneath<00:01:16.250> so

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that the meniscus line is underneath so

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:27.450 
that the meniscus line is underneath so
that's<00:01:17.400> 120<00:01:18.390> mil<00:01:20.090> if<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.480 

and<00:01:27.790> then<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:28.570> just<00:01:28.780> put<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.290> my<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:30.070> agent

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
and then I just put in my the agent

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.470 
and then I just put in my the agent
power<00:01:30.900> each<00:01:31.900> sample<00:01:32.590> gets<00:01:32.770> this<00:01:33.480> whatever

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
power each sample gets this whatever

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.180 
power each sample gets this whatever
happens<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.110> sample<00:01:35.500> from<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.710> farmer

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
happens to the sample from the farmer

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:51.480 
happens to the sample from the farmer
also<00:01:36.520> happens<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.180> other<00:01:37.330> two<00:01:50.460> right

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
also happens to the other two right

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.080 
also happens to the other two right
that's<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.600> first<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.520> three<00:01:54.520> notes<00:01:54.760> next

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
that's the first of the three notes next

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.109 
that's the first of the three notes next
one<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.840> that's<00:01:55.990> gotten<00:01:56.380> rid<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.760> this<00:01:57.760> is<00:01:57.970> the

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
one and that's gotten rid of this is the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.590 
one and that's gotten rid of this is the
tablet<00:01:58.510> that<00:01:58.750> helps<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.530> mix<00:02:00.430> this<00:02:00.640> up<00:02:00.850> you'll

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
tablet that helps to mix this up you'll

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.719 
tablet that helps to mix this up you'll
see<00:02:01.720> what<00:02:02.050> I<00:02:02.080> do<00:02:02.200> in<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.530> moment<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:03.220> each<00:02:03.520> one

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
see what I do in a moment so each one

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:13.800 
see what I do in a moment so each one
gets<00:02:04.030> one<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.270> these<00:02:04.360> one<00:02:12.060> these<00:02:13.060> then<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.690> to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
gets one of these one these then have to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.460 
gets one of these one these then have to
be<00:02:13.930> shaken<00:02:14.410> up<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.739> minute<00:02:15.040> each<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.540> you

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
be shaken up for a minute each and you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.690 
be shaken up for a minute each and you
start<00:02:17.739> always<00:02:17.980> got<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> remember<00:02:18.310> where

eventually<00:02:43.900> after<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.260> minute<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.590> might

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
eventually after the minute you might

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.150 
eventually after the minute you might
hear<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.549> just<00:02:46.000> integrates<00:02:46.269> in

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.350 

and<00:02:51.160> now<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.790> wait<00:02:51.970> for<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.299> to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
and now I have to wait for that to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.820 
and now I have to wait for that to
settle<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.019> has<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.350> sit<00:02:53.560> there<00:02:53.799> for

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
settle and that has to sit there for

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.670 
settle and that has to sit there for
until<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.910> has<00:02:55.090> happened<00:02:55.540> after<00:02:56.230> two

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
until that has happened after two

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.460 
until that has happened after two
minutes<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.130> decant<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.910> right<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.290> that

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
minutes I decant it right now so that

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.780 
minutes I decant it right now so that
there's<00:02:59.620> none<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.070> powder<00:03:00.310> sitting<00:03:00.700> on

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
there's none of the powder sitting on

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.110 
there's none of the powder sitting on
top<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.209> lid<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:02.019> have<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:03.340> then<00:03:04.030> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
top of the lid you have to and then you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.830 
top of the lid you have to and then you
leave<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.330> go<00:03:04.600> again<00:03:07.260> okay<00:03:09.690> see<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
leave it go again okay see the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.080 
leave it go again okay see the
difference<00:03:11.549> from<00:03:12.549> what<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:12.940> was<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.850> poly

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
difference from what it was the poly

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.569 
difference from what it was the poly
intest<00:03:16.510> each<00:03:16.900> test<00:03:17.560> has<00:03:17.799> its<00:03:17.980> own<00:03:18.130> reading

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
intest each test has its own reading

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.830 
intest each test has its own reading
nitrate<00:03:19.239> is<00:03:19.390> 23<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:21.310> said<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.090> 570

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
nitrate is 23 and you said it on the 570

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.410 
nitrate is 23 and you said it on the 570
there<00:03:23.049> with<00:03:23.620> phosphates<00:03:24.130> 28<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.030> said<00:03:25.299> it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
there with phosphates 28 and you said it

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.300 
there with phosphates 28 and you said it
to<00:03:25.540> 640<00:03:26.110> but<00:03:26.320> yeah<00:03:26.890> there's<00:03:27.160> all<00:03:27.280> different

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
to 640 but yeah there's all different

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.660 
to 640 but yeah there's all different
types

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
types

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.870 
types
and<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.510> have<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.840> clear<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:31.220> top<00:03:31.460> of<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.730> lid

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
and you have to clear the top of the lid

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.809 
and you have to clear the top of the lid
of<00:03:32.030> any<00:03:32.180> residue<00:03:32.930> or<00:03:33.080> gain<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.680> powder<00:03:33.950> so

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
of any residue or gain of that powder so

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.580 
of any residue or gain of that powder so
you're<00:03:34.970> not<00:03:35.120> transferring<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.930> into<00:03:36.020> your<00:03:36.380> new

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you're not transferring it into your new

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.220 
you're not transferring it into your new
so<00:03:37.310> then<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.550> have<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.819> fill<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.660> 10<00:03:38.990> mil

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
so then I have to fill that to a 10 mil

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:54.449 
so then I have to fill that to a 10 mil
which<00:03:39.709> can<00:03:39.980> be<00:03:40.160> very<00:03:40.400> hard

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.430 

then<00:03:55.459> that<00:03:55.700> process<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.510> finished<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.200> first

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
then that process is finished that first

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.509 
then that process is finished that first
part<00:03:58.000> then<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.150> next<00:03:59.420> part<00:03:59.690> is<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.950> reagents

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
part then the next part is the reagents

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.369 
part then the next part is the reagents
is<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.760> second<00:04:02.180> step<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.629> have<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.810> add<00:04:03.080> one

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
is the second step you have to add one

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.809 
is the second step you have to add one
of<00:04:03.410> these<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:04.099> each<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.269> your<00:04:05.360> samples<00:04:06.670> so<00:04:07.670> it's

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
of these to each of your samples so it's

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:18.970 
of these to each of your samples so it's
just<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.209> matter<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:08.569> putting<00:04:09.349> them<00:04:09.590> in

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.630 

and<00:04:19.980> then<00:04:20.780> you<00:04:21.780> have<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.170> crush<00:04:23.040> each<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
and then you have to crush each of the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.670 
and then you have to crush each of the
little<00:04:23.820> tablets<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.420> always<00:04:24.930> do<00:04:25.290> my<00:04:25.410> blank

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
little tablets I always do my blank

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.140 
little tablets I always do my blank
first<00:04:25.980> so<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:26.310> has<00:04:26.460> more<00:04:26.640> time<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.060> develop<00:04:27.330> so

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
first so it has more time to develop so

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.310 
first so it has more time to develop so
see<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.270> little<00:04:30.450> table<00:04:30.720> in<00:04:30.810> there

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
see the little table in there

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.960 
see the little table in there
I'm<00:04:31.620> going<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:32.070> crush<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:38.490> just<00:04:38.670> have<00:04:38.760> to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
I'm going to crush it you just have to

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.180 
I'm going to crush it you just have to
smash<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.960> until<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:40.320> have<00:04:40.440> nothing<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.980> there

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
smash it until you have nothing in there

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.010 
smash it until you have nothing in there
basically<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.180> try<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.480> get<00:04:42.570> rid<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:42.870> all

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
basically and try and get rid of it all

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:51.850 
basically and try and get rid of it all
and<00:04:43.170> then<00:04:43.290> you<00:04:43.410> shake<00:04:43.620> what<00:04:44.570> else<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:45.960> there

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:03.770 

that's<00:04:52.860> pretty<00:04:53.190> clear<00:04:54.980> just<00:04:55.980> paddle<00:04:56.430> in<00:05:02.780> now

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
that's pretty clear just paddle in now

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.020 
that's pretty clear just paddle in now
that's<00:05:04.170> my<00:05:04.350> blank<00:05:04.650> if<00:05:04.920> I<00:05:05.040> had<00:05:05.190> contamination

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
that's my blank if I had contamination

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.210 
that's my blank if I had contamination
they'll<00:05:06.270> go<00:05:06.480> Spink<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:07.710> not<00:05:07.890> so<00:05:08.130> that's

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
they'll go Spink and it's not so that's

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.640 
they'll go Spink and it's not so that's
good

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
good

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.260 
good
that's<00:05:10.650> very<00:05:10.890> good<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.490> next<00:05:11.760> one<00:05:11.910> is<00:05:12.060> more

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
that's very good the next one is more

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.240 
that's very good the next one is more
standard<00:05:12.510> so<00:05:12.930> I'll<00:05:12.990> just<00:05:13.230> get<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.710> developing

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
standard so I'll just get it developing

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.330 
standard so I'll just get it developing
as<00:05:14.430> well<00:05:15.560> it's<00:05:16.560> going<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.830> crush<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.130> little

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
as well it's going to crush that little

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.100 
as well it's going to crush that little
table<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:17.970> again<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.450> this<00:05:18.540> one<00:05:18.750> will<00:05:18.960> have

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
table it again and this one will have

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.130 
table it again and this one will have
color<00:05:19.470> in<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.830> because<00:05:20.240> it's<00:05:21.240> my<00:05:21.450> standard<00:05:21.990> and

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
color in it because it's my standard and

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.040 
color in it because it's my standard and
it's<00:05:22.580> meant<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.640> be<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.970> same<00:05:24.000> toss<00:05:24.720> around

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
it's meant to be the same toss around

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.400 
it's meant to be the same toss around
the<00:05:25.440> same<00:05:25.680> every<00:05:26.100> time<00:05:26.130> I<00:05:26.460> do<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.640> list<00:05:30.170> so<00:05:31.170> this

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
the same every time I do a list so this

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:42.040 
the same every time I do a list so this
contains<00:05:31.860> so<00:05:32.370> much<00:05:32.550> knowledge<00:05:33.360> right

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.840 

right<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.320> now<00:05:43.440> I<00:05:43.470> just<00:05:43.560> have<00:05:43.920> to<00:05:43.950> leave<00:05:44.640> them

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
right and now I just have to leave them

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.870 
right and now I just have to leave them
sit<00:05:45.150> again<00:05:45.450> to<00:05:45.750> develop<00:05:45.930> again<00:05:46.470> and<00:05:47.040> then<00:05:47.310> the

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
sit again to develop again and then the

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.660 
sit again to develop again and then the
machine<00:05:48.300> that's<00:05:48.690> when<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:48.900> start<00:05:49.170> reading<00:05:49.470> them

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
machine that's when I start reading them

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.040 
machine that's when I start reading them
but<00:05:50.670> as<00:05:50.850> you<00:05:50.970> can<00:05:51.120> see<00:05:51.180> like<00:05:51.450> that<00:05:51.690> that's

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
but as you can see like that that's

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.570 
but as you can see like that that's
obviously<00:05:52.500> got<00:05:52.650> night<00:05:52.830> training<00:05:53.160> up<00:05:53.370> that

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
obviously got night training up that

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.910 
obviously got night training up that
these<00:05:53.790> two<00:05:54.150> which<00:05:55.050> are<00:05:55.200> from<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.410> farmer

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
these two which are from the farmer

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.160 
these two which are from the farmer
they've<00:05:56.130> got<00:05:56.610> hardly<00:05:56.970> there'll<00:05:57.780> be<00:05:57.840> I'd<00:05:58.140> be

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
they've got hardly there'll be I'd be

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.570 
they've got hardly there'll be I'd be
very<00:05:58.410> surprised<00:05:58.830> if<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.040> get<00:05:59.130> a<00:05:59.190> reading<00:05:59.520> on

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
very surprised if you get a reading on

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.610 
very surprised if you get a reading on
them<00:05:59.820> right<00:06:00.420> so<00:06:00.660> all<00:06:00.870> you<00:06:01.020> do<00:06:01.140> first<00:06:01.410> off<00:06:01.590> is

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
them right so all you do first off is

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.740 
them right so all you do first off is
you<00:06:01.860> put<00:06:02.040> your<00:06:02.070> blank<00:06:02.730> in<00:06:02.970> so<00:06:03.360> it<00:06:03.570> like

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
you put your blank in so it like

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.050 
you put your blank in so it like
calibrate<00:06:04.410> your<00:06:04.590> machine<00:06:04.920> on<00:06:05.100> to<00:06:05.370> and<00:06:05.790> it<00:06:05.970> will

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
calibrate your machine on to and it will

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.690 
calibrate your machine on to and it will
read<00:06:06.300> it<00:06:06.650> right<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:07.920> then<00:06:08.040> I<00:06:08.070> just<00:06:08.400> place<00:06:08.670> that

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
read it right and then I just place that

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.060 
read it right and then I just place that
again<00:06:09.270> it's<00:06:09.480> telling<00:06:09.630> me<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:09.900> insert<00:06:10.380> a<00:06:10.410> sample

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
again it's telling me to insert a sample

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.420 
again it's telling me to insert a sample
to<00:06:11.820> sample<00:06:12.120> one<00:06:12.540> from<00:06:12.900> farmer<00:06:13.350> and<00:06:13.770> then<00:06:14.070> press

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
to sample one from farmer and then press

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.310 
to sample one from farmer and then press
back<00:06:14.460> and<00:06:15.360> it<00:06:15.510> will<00:06:15.630> tell<00:06:15.840> you<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.080> reading

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
back and it will tell you the reading

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.130 
back and it will tell you the reading
which<00:06:16.860> is<00:06:17.040> nothing<00:06:17.640> so<00:06:18.630> sample<00:06:19.170> two<00:06:20.570> and<00:06:21.570> that

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
which is nothing so sample two and that

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.230 
which is nothing so sample two and that
one<00:06:22.350> will<00:06:22.470> be<00:06:22.500> also<00:06:22.980> yeah<00:06:23.280> there's<00:06:23.730> no<00:06:23.940> color

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
one will be also yeah there's no color

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.780 
one will be also yeah there's no color

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
blank in so you'll see it will read it

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.590 
blank in so you'll see it will read it
just<00:06:31.890> insert<00:06:32.430> a<00:06:32.460> sample<00:06:34.820> there<00:06:35.820> you<00:06:35.880> go<00:06:36.060> point

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
just insert a sample there you go point

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.880 
just insert a sample there you go point
two<00:06:37.170> four<00:06:37.470> so<00:06:37.770> that's<00:06:37.980> that's<00:06:38.490> good<00:06:39.770> when<00:06:40.770> you

two four so that's that's good when you
line<00:06:41.070> them<00:06:41.280> up<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:41.520> you<00:06:41.610> have<00:06:41.760> the<00:06:41.880> twelve

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
line them up and you have the twelve

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.380 
line them up and you have the twelve
there's<00:06:43.260> all<00:06:43.470> varying<00:06:43.890> degrees<00:06:44.250> of<00:06:44.280> pink<00:06:44.820> yes

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
this is how the samples come to me with

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.920 
this is how the samples come to me with
a<00:06:59.280> number<00:06:59.550> on<00:06:59.880> it<00:06:59.910> I<00:07:00.090> don't<00:07:00.150> have<00:07:00.480> a<00:07:00.630> grower
