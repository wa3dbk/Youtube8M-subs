00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
that we have on the website so that they

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.530 
that we have on the website so that they
don't<00:01:57.530> have<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.920> deal<00:01:58.130> with<00:01:58.400> moving<00:01:59.120> through

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
don't have to deal with moving through

getting<00:02:03.020> resources<00:02:03.500> can<00:02:04.130> be<00:02:04.900> challenging<00:02:05.900> so

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
getting resources can be challenging so

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.430 
getting resources can be challenging so
I<00:02:06.200> try<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:07.330> rely<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.810> internet<00:02:09.229> which

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
I try to rely on the internet which

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.590 
I try to rely on the internet which
sometimes<00:02:10.009> it's<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.550> bad<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:11.210> mean<00:02:11.420> there<00:02:11.570> are

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
sometimes it's so bad I mean there are

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.140 
sometimes it's so bad I mean there are
like<00:02:11.780> thousands<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.620> educational<00:02:13.430> areas<00:02:13.880> that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
like thousands of educational areas that

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150 
like thousands of educational areas that
are<00:02:14.300> out<00:02:14.390> there<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.840> some<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.260> them<00:02:15.500> look

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
are out there and some of them look

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.830 
are out there and some of them look
great<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:16.790> have<00:02:16.820> bells<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.450> whistles

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
great and they have bells and whistles

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.900 
great and they have bells and whistles
but<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.410> learning<00:02:19.100> that's<00:02:19.220> involved<00:02:19.730> with

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
but the learning that's involved with

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.170 
but the learning that's involved with
them<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.540> very<00:02:21.160> disconnected<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> things

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
them is very disconnected to the things

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.660 
them is very disconnected to the things
that<00:02:23.450> make<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.780> engaging<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.800> strive<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.130> find

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that make it engaging we strive to find

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.490 
that make it engaging we strive to find
the<00:02:26.000> resources<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.570> are<00:02:26.720> really<00:02:26.990> unique<00:02:27.170> and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
the resources that are really unique and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.050 
the resources that are really unique and
really<00:02:27.560> help<00:02:28.010> teachers<00:02:28.280> push<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.790> boundaries

really help teachers push the boundaries

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.400

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
of what they're able to do in the
