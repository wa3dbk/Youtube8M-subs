apparently for special editions it's the
lightest<00:00:13.950> packs<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.990> um<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.220> hollow

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
lightest packs that um have the hollow

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300 
lightest packs that um have the hollow
I'm<00:00:18.330> not<00:00:18.480> sure<00:00:18.539> why<00:00:18.840> but<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.529> learned<00:00:19.770> my<00:00:19.920> lesson

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
I'm not sure why but I learned my lesson

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.599 
I'm not sure why but I learned my lesson
so<00:00:20.580> today<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> got<00:00:21.689> three<00:00:22.080> cosmo<00:00:22.740> blazer<00:00:22.890> pecs

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
so today I got three cosmo blazer pecs

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.759 
so today I got three cosmo blazer pecs
and<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:25.430> believe<00:00:26.430> these<00:00:26.849> are<00:00:26.910> heaviest<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.019> I'm

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
and I believe these are heaviest so I'm

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.669 
and I believe these are heaviest so I'm
going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.130> ahead<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.400> scale<00:00:29.789> these<00:00:30.679> real

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
going to go ahead and scale these real

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:43.750 
going to go ahead and scale these real
quick<00:00:31.800> um<00:00:34.010> alright<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:37.129> is<00:00:38.360> a<00:00:40.820> 22-point

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
quick um alright so this is a 22-point

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.900 
quick um alright so this is a 22-point
22.2<00:00:45.680> 22.4<00:00:47.809> 647<00:00:48.809> now<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> can't<00:00:49.649> exactly<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.850> if

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
22.2 22.4 647 now I can't exactly see if

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.670 
22.2 22.4 647 now I can't exactly see if
they<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> security<00:00:51.960> tag<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.469> or<00:00:52.590> not

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
they have a security tag in them or not

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470 
they have a security tag in them or not
but<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.070> I'll<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.219> look<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.670> look<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
but so I'll just look at look in the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
but so I'll just look at look in the
light<00:00:54.600> real<00:00:54.870> quick<00:00:55.579> see<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.180> spot<00:00:59.030> one

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
light real quick see if I can spot one

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.020 
light real quick see if I can spot one
but<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> don't<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.800> anything<00:01:02.270> so<00:01:03.409> someone's<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
but I don't see anything so someone's a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:16.460 
but I don't see anything so someone's a
22-point<00:01:06.030> 46<00:01:06.720> let's<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:11.150> um<00:01:14.030> 22.3<00:01:15.470> 7

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
22-point 46 let's see this one um 22.3 7

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:26.899 
22-point 46 let's see this one um 22.3 7
and<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:22.009> 820<00:01:23.509> 2.56<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.520> think<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and this one is 820 2.56 so I think this

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.870 
and this one is 820 2.56 so I think this
one<00:01:27.150> might<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> security<00:01:28.439> tag<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.790> i'm

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
one might have a security tag but i'm

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.210 
one might have a security tag but i'm
not<00:01:30.030> sure<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.329> i<00:01:30.630> open<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.380> lightest<00:01:32.009> one

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
not sure but i open up the lightest one

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.120 
not sure but i open up the lightest one
first<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.079> i<00:01:34.079> actually<00:01:34.229> open<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> middle

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
first so i actually open up the middle

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.789 
first so i actually open up the middle
one<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:36.180> one's<00:01:36.920> 22.4<00:01:37.920> six<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.439> ahead<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
one this one's 22.4 six so go ahead and

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.680 
one this one's 22.4 six so go ahead and
open<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.399> up

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.390

all right so get it out I'm d-lister
back<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.940> I'll<00:01:58.150> scale<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:59.130> again<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.650> guys

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
back and I'll scale it again if you guys

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.010 
back and I'll scale it again if you guys
want<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.010> see<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.160> scale<00:02:03.490> there<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.080> um<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
want to see a scale there it is um the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.080 
want to see a scale there it is um the
justices<00:02:08.530> first<00:02:08.860> edition<00:02:09.399> or<00:02:09.520> something<00:02:09.910> I

don't know 12-point through 12 sorry
twelve<00:02:17.200> point<00:02:17.380> three<00:02:17.440> six<00:02:18.930> alright<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.610> we'll

put<00:02:21.790> up<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.150> one<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:23.490> think<00:02:24.490> this<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:24.940> was<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
put up this one I think this one was the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.740 
put up this one I think this one was the
lightest<00:02:27.010> one<00:02:27.220> out<00:02:27.460> of<00:02:27.640> them<00:02:27.790> oh<00:02:30.240> no<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.450> messed

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750

lightest one out of them oh no I messed
up<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.020> blister<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:35.970> yeah<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.000> kind

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.730 
up the blister on this one yeah I kind
of<00:02:37.330> messed<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.660> up<00:02:37.720> oh<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.220> then<00:02:42.430> get<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.940> out

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
of messed it up oh and then get it out

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.300 
of messed it up oh and then get it out
come<00:02:44.740> on<00:02:45.840> come<00:02:46.840> hope<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.500> didn't<00:02:47.770> damn<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.100> don't

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
come on come hope I didn't damn I don't

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.180 
come on come hope I didn't damn I don't
up<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.520> card<00:02:48.820> inside<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.560> heaviest

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
up the card inside and the heaviest

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.840 
up the card inside and the heaviest
sludge<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.560> these<00:02:53.560> do<00:02:53.890> not<00:02:53.920> have<00:02:54.370> security

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
sludge and these do not have security

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.880 
sludge and these do not have security
tags<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:55.330> guessing<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:56.020> is<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.260> security

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
tags I'm guessing this is the security

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.890 
tags I'm guessing this is the security
tag<00:02:57.570> so<00:03:01.590> hopefully<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.739> doesn't<00:03:02.950> make

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
tag so hopefully that doesn't make

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.330 
tag so hopefully that doesn't make
hopefully<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.080> glue<00:03:05.290> that's<00:03:05.320> used<00:03:05.920> on<00:03:06.130> that

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
hopefully the glue that's used on that

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.150 
hopefully the glue that's used on that
doesn't<00:03:06.640> make<00:03:06.700> too<00:03:06.910> much<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.300> difference

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
doesn't make too much of a difference

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.660 
doesn't make too much of a difference
because<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.340> would<00:03:09.489> suck<00:03:09.850> if<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.209> did

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
because that would suck if it did

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.810 
because that would suck if it did
alright<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.750> let's<00:03:13.989> see<00:03:14.500> scale<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.340> heaviest

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
alright so let's see scale the heaviest

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:27.009
