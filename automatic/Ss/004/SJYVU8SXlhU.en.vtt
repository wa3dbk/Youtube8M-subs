prey<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.370> hides<00:01:35.610> inside<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:37.010> what<00:01:38.010> are

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
prey and then hides inside it what are

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.790 
prey and then hides inside it what are
you<00:01:38.160> saying<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.910> all<00:01:38.940> of<00:01:39.240> us<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.510> human<00:01:39.800> could

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
be any of us we can't have this thing

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.140 
be any of us we can't have this thing
leave<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> makes<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.760> out<00:01:53.910> of<00:01:53.940> here
