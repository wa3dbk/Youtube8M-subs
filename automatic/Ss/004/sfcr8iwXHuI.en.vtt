of replacing mine but you can pull the
switch<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.689> once<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> take<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.400> screw<00:01:11.400> out

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
switch out once you take that screw out

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
switch out once you take that screw out
and<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:13.680> little<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:17.780> hole<00:01:18.780> in

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and this little that little hole in

and this little that little hole in
there<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.540> flathead

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
there you can just put a flathead

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780 
there you can just put a flathead
screwdriver<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.220> actually<00:01:23.340> turn

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
screwdriver and you can actually turn

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
screwdriver and you can actually turn
that<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> point<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> car<00:01:26.340> will

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that to the point that the car will

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.740 
that to the point that the car will
start<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.890> simple<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.750> this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
start that it's as simple as that this

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.350 
start that it's as simple as that this
is<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> 2001<00:01:31.619> Ford<00:01:31.979> Courier<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.210> ever

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
is a 2001 Ford Courier so if you ever

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.460 
is a 2001 Ford Courier so if you ever
get<00:01:33.570> stuck<00:01:33.630> where<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.560> key<00:01:34.799> won't<00:01:35.759> turn<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
get stuck where your key won't turn and

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.399 
get stuck where your key won't turn and
turn<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.650> car<00:01:38.750> there<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:39.900> other<00:01:40.110> things

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
turn on your car there are other things

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.280 
turn on your car there are other things
that<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.860> cause<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:42.360> mind<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> contacts

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that can cause that in mind the contacts

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.039 
that can cause that in mind the contacts
in<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> switch<00:01:43.799> actually<00:01:44.189> wore<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.049> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
in the switch actually wore out so the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.370 
in the switch actually wore out so the
key<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.409> turn<00:01:47.180> but<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.659> contacts<00:01:49.229> were

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
key would turn but the contacts were

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.960 
key would turn but the contacts were
worn<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.310> hard<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
worn so it was really hard to get the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.550 
worn so it was really hard to get the
car<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> start<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.899> key<00:01:55.170> doesn't

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
car to start but if your key doesn't

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.639 
car to start but if your key doesn't
turn<00:01:56.509> then<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.689> chances<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.259> you've<00:01:58.469> got<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
turn then the chances are you've got a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.580 
turn then the chances are you've got a
problem<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> barrel<00:02:00.140> with<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.560> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
problem with the barrel with with that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.190 
problem with the barrel with with that
not<00:02:01.979> working<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:03.450> might<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
not working and it might not be the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.639 
not working and it might not be the
switch<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.820> try<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.409> if

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
switch so you can try this to see if

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.479 
switch so you can try this to see if
your<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.610> will<00:02:08.849> start<00:02:09.860> without<00:02:10.860> having<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
your you will start without having to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.290 
your you will start without having to
replace<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.390> barrel<00:02:12.720> in

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
replace the barrel in
