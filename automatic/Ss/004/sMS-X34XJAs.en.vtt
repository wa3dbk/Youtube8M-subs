understand<00:02:05.359> you<00:02:05.420> can<00:02:05.509> just<00:02:05.659> download<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.990> from

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
understand you can just download it from

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.859 
understand you can just download it from
another<00:02:06.289> but<00:02:07.179> Germany<00:02:08.179> for<00:02:08.270> example<00:02:08.330> only<00:02:08.630> has

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
another but Germany for example only has

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.630 
another but Germany for example only has
one<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.590> was<00:02:09.890> an<00:02:10.009> understand<00:02:10.429> just

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
one so that was an understand just

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
one so that was an understand just
refresh<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.570> percentage<00:02:11.870> will<00:02:12.110> be

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
refresh it and the percentage will be

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.590 
refresh it and the percentage will be
different<00:02:12.560> probably<00:02:13.520> lower<00:02:13.700> if<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.210> was<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.390> tad

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
different probably lower if it was a tad

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.080 
different probably lower if it was a tad
percent<00:02:15.080> because<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.350> can't<00:02:15.530> be<00:02:15.680> higher<00:02:16.090> but

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
percent because it can't be higher but

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.570 
percent because it can't be higher but
yeah<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.900> would<00:02:18.020> just<00:02:18.110> click<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.440> here<00:02:18.590> click

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
yeah you would just click it here click

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.760 
yeah you would just click it here click
download<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.150> then<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.110> page<00:02:21.320> will<00:02:21.470> open<00:02:21.560> up

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
download and then this page will open up

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.730 
download and then this page will open up
so<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.550> wait<00:02:22.730> four<00:02:23.210> seconds

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
so just wait four seconds

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.310 
so just wait four seconds
second<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.340> second<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:24.910> second<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:26.260> you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
second to second one second and now you

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.490 
second to second one second and now you
can<00:02:26.500> download<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.570> yeah<00:02:28.570> it's<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.020> dot<00:02:29.290> zip

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
can download and yeah it's just dot zip

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
can download and yeah it's just dot zip
file<00:02:30.840> but<00:02:31.840> that's<00:02:32.170> how<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.410> got<00:02:32.620> rack<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
file but that's how you got rack and the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.890 
file but that's how you got rack and the
dollars<00:02:33.700> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.060> take<00:02:34.210> less<00:02:34.540> than<00:02:34.570> 30

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
dollars going to take less than 30

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.320 
dollars going to take less than 30
minutes<00:02:35.220> probably<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.700> took<00:02:36.820> me<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.060> 15

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
minutes probably it took me in 15

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.640 
minutes probably it took me in 15
minutes<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.810> might<00:02:37.930> take<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.200> 30<00:02:38.380> minutes

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
minutes it might take you 30 minutes

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.830 
minutes it might take you 30 minutes
just<00:02:39.550> depends<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.090> your<00:02:40.150> internet<00:02:40.720> connection

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
just depends on your internet connection

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.640 
just depends on your internet connection
and<00:02:41.290> computer<00:02:41.710> i<00:02:41.740> guess<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:43.120> then<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
and computer i guess but then the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.400 
and computer i guess but then the
unzipping<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.300> file<00:02:46.300> will<00:02:46.630> also<00:02:47.290> take

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
unzipping of the file will also take

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.310 
unzipping of the file will also take
about<00:02:47.620> 10<00:02:47.860> minutes<00:02:47.890> extra<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:49.600> that's<00:02:50.200> not<00:02:50.260> a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
about 10 minutes extra but that's not a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.600 
about 10 minutes extra but that's not a
big<00:02:50.380> problem<00:02:50.530> because<00:02:50.890> that's<00:02:51.130> only<00:02:51.250> 40

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
big problem because that's only 40

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.340 
big problem because that's only 40
minutes<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.210> usually<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.750> would<00:02:52.810> take<00:02:52.990> four

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
minutes and usually it would take four

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.080 
minutes and usually it would take four
hours<00:02:53.560> though<00:02:53.950> that's<00:02:54.220> 40<00:02:54.490> minutes<00:02:54.760> maximum

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
hours though that's 40 minutes maximum

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.120 
hours though that's 40 minutes maximum
by<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.360> way<00:02:55.480> not<00:02:55.690> 40<00:02:56.050> minutes<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.980> it's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
by the way not 40 minutes so it's

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.470 
by the way not 40 minutes so it's
probably<00:02:57.310> gonna<00:02:57.490> take<00:02:57.580> all<00:02:57.910> together<00:02:58.180> about

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
probably gonna take all together about

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.150 
probably gonna take all together about
half<00:02:58.780> an<00:02:58.930> hour<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.290> usually<00:02:59.590> takes<00:02:59.830> four

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
half an hour and usually takes four

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.340 
half an hour and usually takes four
hours<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.970> that's<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.330> very<00:03:01.600> big<00:03:01.810> plus<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:02.320> my

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
hours so that's a very big plus in my

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.650 
hours so that's a very big plus in my
opinion<00:03:03.010> well<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:04.000> can<00:03:04.150> also<00:03:04.270> choose<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
opinion well you can also choose the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.510 
opinion well you can also choose the
down<00:03:04.780> from<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.110> stop<00:03:05.290> next<00:03:05.470> page<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:06.400> this

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
down from the stop next page but this

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.950 
down from the stop next page but this
works<00:03:06.760> perfectly<00:03:07.150> fine<00:03:07.420> i'm<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:07.780> going<00:03:07.900> to

works perfectly fine i'm just going to

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.810 
works perfectly fine i'm just going to
open<00:03:08.020> it<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.440> show<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.650> i<00:03:08.920> can't<00:03:09.430> log<00:03:09.580> on<00:03:09.700> at

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
the moment cuz my account is bad for

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.160 
the moment cuz my account is bad for
hacking<00:03:11.590> for<00:03:11.800> two<00:03:11.920> more<00:03:12.070> days<00:03:12.240> because<00:03:13.240> i<00:03:13.540> used

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
hacking for two more days because i used

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.780 
hacking for two more days because i used
them<00:03:14.350> because<00:03:14.620> i<00:03:14.710> didn't<00:03:15.010> want<00:03:15.040> plenty<00:03:15.580> full
