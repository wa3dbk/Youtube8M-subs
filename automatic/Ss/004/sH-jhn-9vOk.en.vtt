00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 today 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.930
 Ok, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.360
 freeze strawberries or what fruit in your 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.650
 preference in this case of strawberries 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.680
 because we are in season here in 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.300
 tijuana always take out the most mature and 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.370
 those and those that we finished leave them in 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.500
 the box so that they ripen we're going to 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.110
 freeze the well-ripened ones that are 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.660
 washing disinfected and free poses 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.400
 a towel to dry let 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.000
 remove those from behind this form of 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 do what 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.809
 the first is with a knife 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.380
 that is, we remove it like that and the other way is 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.020
 so with a straw we introduce it in the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.260
 pure half 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.000
 and we push 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.739
 and the strawberry leaf comes out ok since 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.359
 we removed the real strawberries her 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.699
 I like it more than the traditional way with 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.670
 the knife in a common dish and 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.299
 current we are going to put a little bit of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.180
 sugar and right there we are going to go 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.640
 accommodating strawberries that do not touch 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.740
 one over the other that are separated and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.570
 rates because they are already accommodated because 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.060
 I put sugar because as I took them 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.710
 the back part I remove the tail the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.990
 same thousand and it is going to stick in the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.210
 dish when I froze it they are going to stick and 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.670
 the sugar does not stick together now 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.190
 We put the freezer out the phrase 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.340
 of the freezer see how easy it takes off 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.240
 nor stuck they are for the sugar we can 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.670
 be a disrespectful if I do not use 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.799
 bags of one kilo thick bags bring 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.649
 many that are very cheap we get 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.649
 in the bag we close the return lap 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.030
 and we go around 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.320
 and we already have all our fruit 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.750
 frozen list and it's never going to stick 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.560
 for many months 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.560
 Christ
