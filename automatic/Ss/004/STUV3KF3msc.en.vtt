 the main part of which made 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.250
 technical changes excluding

 live ammunition including metal 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.540
 equipment that is to say simple 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.399
 by language 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.810
 blew loading and which is intended 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.539
 for use by exercise 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.209

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.060
 with the ability to simulate a shot of him 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.850
 patrons holy sound action so 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.270
 what is changed in this machine 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.220
 let's start with the store capacity 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.220
 This magazine is 10 rounds 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.429
 again according to the gun law any 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.709
 civilian weapons must have a capacity 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.220
 Store drums no more than 10 rounds and 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:01.310
 eliminate bursts of fire yes this 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.429
 machine gun does not shoot the queue for shooting 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.200
 use 762 by 39 rounds 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.289
 millimeters of light noise 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.230
 there are also about weapons 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.040
 which can shoot 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.970
 building cartridges further 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:24.239
 weapons have soda made in Russia 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.450
 on the right side of the model marking 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.630
 what is this weapon written off with reverse 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.959
 hand there are us serial year number 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.860
 release and marking of the plant as we see 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.690
 dovetail mount 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.620
 missing since at the time they are not 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.459
 still put this machine as you can 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.650
 notice the 1904 release as you could 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.489
 notice the slide frame is not in 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.829
 extreme position 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.680
 what is the reason let's find out for 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.980
 it is necessary to disassemble the machine disassembly 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.269
 carried out like a combat machine 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.069
 from removing the store we remove the cover 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.180
 the receiver as we see 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.430
 return spring is in place everything is in place 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.639
 remove the return spring 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.170
 or take out the gate shutter frame 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.750
 as you noticed 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.819
 shutter is fun in one position 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.010
 the slide frame is made to 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.200
 to eliminate the possibility of locking 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.569
 barrel bore like on 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.769
 fighting machine 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:34.560
 there is also a label written off on 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:38.100
 gate frame and number that matches 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.769
 with the number on the receiver also with 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.290
 steel receiver and barrel 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.840
 boiled two pins to avoid 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.030
 loading the combat cartridge well and 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.960
 accordingly according to the law loading 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.040
 from the muzzle side 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.130
 and so and tass so kind while we collect our 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.210
 automatic machine for this set 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.640
 bolt carrier with bolt in place 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:14.240
 we install a spring and we put on a cover 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:17.060
 hard carrot everything snaps nicely but 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.960
 I repeat this is not a toy when buying 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.360
 this product 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.850
 make sure you have a passport 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.800

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.750
 rework from certificate layout 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.060
 matching 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.190
 in order to avoid problems with the law 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.010
 the passport looks like this 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.140
 salty little book which is described 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.330
 main characteristics for information 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.850

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.990

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.630
 50 degrees 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.780
 I also want to warn those who wish 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.760
 independently make changes to this 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:55.220
 product and either in the mock mass 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:58.370
 overall if you wish to install 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.710
 automatic fire or remove 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.200
 limiter well zam case if you 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.950
 remove the limiter make it more 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.680
 number of rounds 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.230
 you can get off fine otherwise 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.240
 case any change 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.620
 fall under article 223 criminal 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.920
 Code of the Russian Federation 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.670
 in short from 3 to 5 years I repeat it 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.160

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.909

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.400
