00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.600
 Maritza is my river 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.020
 As the Seine is yours 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.140
 But it's only my father 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.420
 Now who can remember 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040
 Sometimes 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.460
 When the horizon was too dark 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 All the birds are gone 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.380
 On the paths of hope 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.240
 And we followed them, 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.700
 In Paris
