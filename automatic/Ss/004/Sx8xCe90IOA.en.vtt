00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
do it for quantity but quality is also

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.700 
do it for quantity but quality is also
important<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.199> I'm<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.410> talk<00:00:31.590> about

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
going to get crooked over that for

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
going to get crooked over that for
instance<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.380> need<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> pay<00:01:16.710> attention<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
instance so we need to pay attention to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.050 
instance so we need to pay attention to
this<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:19.070> number<00:01:20.070> 20<00:01:22.340> in<00:01:23.340> addition<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
this that's one number 20 in addition to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
this that's one number 20 in addition to
a<00:01:24.090> lineman<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:25.460> we<00:01:26.460> want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> absorb<00:01:28.040> Earth's

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
a lineman on we want to absorb Earth's

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.760 
a lineman on we want to absorb Earth's
gravitational<00:01:29.700> force<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.900> our<00:01:31.110> musculature

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
gravitational force with our musculature

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
gravitational force with our musculature
our<00:01:32.159> muscles<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.360> want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.570> sleep<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
our muscles so we want to sleep a

our muscles so we want to sleep a
deflection<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.860> instance<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:37.340> right

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
deflection for instance this right

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.780 
deflection for instance this right
headed<00:01:38.790> by<00:01:38.909> flex<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:42.439> Funplex<00:01:43.439> for<00:01:44.430> instance

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
headed by flex this Funplex for instance

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
headed by flex this Funplex for instance
and<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> sleep<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.020> side<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.710> I'm

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and if you sleep on your side and I'm

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
and if you sleep on your side and I'm
not<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.100> flexion<00:01:47.640> where's<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.659> right

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
not a flexion where's it going right

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.120 
not a flexion where's it going right
chronic<00:01:49.380> side<00:01:49.590> sleeping<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.759> cause<00:01:52.130> pressure

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
chronic side sleeping can cause pressure

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.370 
chronic side sleeping can cause pressure
damage<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> hips<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> shoulders

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
damage to the hips into the shoulders

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.209 
damage to the hips into the shoulders
for<00:01:55.770> instance<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.960> probably<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.829> really

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
for instance so we probably don't really

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.800 
for instance so we probably don't really
want<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> sleep<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.790> our<00:01:59.909> side<00:02:00.119> too<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.570> so

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
want to sleep on our side too much so

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.830 
want to sleep on our side too much so
what<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.110> want<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:02.119> here's<00:02:03.119> an<00:02:03.299> idea<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
what do we want to do here's an idea and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.590 
what do we want to do here's an idea and
this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.549> back<00:02:06.090> sleeping

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
this is just what I do so back sleeping

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.979 
this is just what I do so back sleeping

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
so there's a lot of reasons or it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.030 
so there's a lot of reasons or it's
going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.660> sleep<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.080> back<00:02:19.260> without<00:02:19.860> a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
going to sleep on the back without a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.010 
going to sleep on the back without a
pillow<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:20.580> smart<00:02:20.910> because<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.330> keeps<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
pillow that's smart because it keeps the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.720 
pillow that's smart because it keeps the
spine<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.380> alignment<00:02:23.190> throughout<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.550> night

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
spine and alignment throughout the night

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.400 
spine and alignment throughout the night
a<00:02:24.620> lot<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.650> people<00:02:25.770> hate<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.780> belly<00:02:27.780> sleeping

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
a lot of people hate on belly sleeping

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.760 
a lot of people hate on belly sleeping
because<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:29.460> can<00:02:29.960> throw<00:02:30.960> your<00:02:31.140> spine<00:02:31.440> out<00:02:31.650> of

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
because it can throw your spine out of

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.370 
because it can throw your spine out of
alignment<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.850> shrink<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.720> organ<00:02:34.110> space

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
alignment it can shrink your organ space

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.980 
alignment it can shrink your organ space
but<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.760> fan<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.390> consider<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.870> a

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
but on the fan of it I consider it a

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.310 
but on the fan of it I consider it a
skill<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.210> can<00:02:39.360> definitely<00:02:39.630> keep<00:02:40.110> your

spine<00:02:40.590> aligned<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.000> need<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.210> alternate

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
spine aligned but you need to alternate

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.740 
spine aligned but you need to alternate
