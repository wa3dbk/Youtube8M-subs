00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.400
 Hey, the film we are going to shoot today is about not knowing someone’s name at the party. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.140
 - Yes, I still have this happening until now - I am also 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.000
 I remember their names before, but I forgot 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.480
 I don't want them to know that I forgot, so I said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you, buddy." 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.280
 I hope that you also have bad memories, just like us. 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.460
 That is, you can’t remember everyone’s name at all. 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.368
 Do you remember our name? 

00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:32.232
 What is our name? 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.920
 Anthony and Ian, in case you don't remember 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.062
 Ok, let's take this shit. 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 Do you remember the people at the party... 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.068
 Hey, I’m wrong, I’m partying. 

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:42.852
 That person appeared, and we don't remember his name...&amp;%"* 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.720
 If he comes over and we don't remember his name, we will be like a @*%# 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.620
 We are playing with the lens 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.040
 You seem to be liked and surprised. 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.050
 This is my usual face 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.960
 Where the gloomy guy will not mark himself into his photo 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 Suck (哔) guy 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.160
 Damn little monk 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.620
 There are 7 to 8 younger brothers in his mouth, I don’t want to make friends with him. 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.540
 That is... hot dog sausage, not a younger brother 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.700
 Then I said Vienna sausage (also has the meaning of a younger brother) 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.860
 The sausages of Vienna are almost the same thing, okay? 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.520
 Shanye and Olivia want to fill their mouth with the Vienna sausage (little brother). 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.660
 Let's watch it. 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.800
 what do you think 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.660
 what… 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.160
 Ok 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.680
 1,2,3 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.140
 Oh no 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.160
 I stuffed 4 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.360
 Well done, Olivia 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.480
 The Vienna intestine (little brother) I put down is twice as many as Olivia. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.640
 Is 8 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.800
 Oh, God, have you practiced? 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.943
 Yes, I practice every day. 

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:38.991
 One today, two tomorrow? 

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:40.919
 Yes, when I finally got 8 of them, they called this trick to be an "octagonal" 

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:42.319
 The mouth of the eight-claw Vienna sausage (little brother)? 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.400
 Eight-clawed Vienna sausage (little brother) 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.440
 Moonrammer (Note 1) 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.700
 That is $%#... that's weird 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.760
 No, that is definitely not a real name. 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.920
 A failed national singer 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.340
 Wait, I played the wrong 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.180
 Wait, wait, I know 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.920
 Oh shit! Why can't I do it? 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.360
 In case he returns, we can't remember his name again. 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.140
 We seem to be like two bastards who don’t (stay) fold (come) 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.380
 We seem to be like... 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.809
 Now I have the picture in my whole mind. 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.549
 My dear 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.749
 Go to you, don't 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.320
 Please, accept my touch. 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.240
 Moonrammer! 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.915
 What is it! ! 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.340
 What do you want? 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.600
 Hey, Moonrammer, get up and cheer. 

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.266
 No, I don't need chicken soup now. 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.620
 It’s full of git, and there are foods like those donated by others. 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.172
 God, this is the worst week! 

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:33.112
 Moonrammer, you don't have to be so angry. 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.840
 To shut up! ! 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.120
 I want to draw a mustache and glasses on Ian's face. 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.340
 In fact, I painted very well. 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.800
 Sorry, I laughed. 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.040
 OK, fill it now 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.820
 This is the transformation I made, he must be the focus of the party. 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.583
 Say, this is the real glasses. 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.319
 what? Are you serious? 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.060
 That's really great. 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.680
 Full-fledged guy 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.260
 It looks like a brand of Costco (Note 2). 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.680
 Cut the lens, he is really git 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.600
 He may have a very junk name, such as Carter 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.460
 Or Chek 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.100
 Or is it...Kyle 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.060
 Or is Brony 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.980
 ...damn it 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.100
 Probably... these names are not enough garbage 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.600
 Dude! 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.280
 Good name, dude. 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.300
 The full name is "Brother. B. Johnson III." 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.520
 Anyone who asks me to do anything, I will do it. 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.300
 I am quite amazing, and it is quite annoying. 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.580
 The above is the story of our father’s name. 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.640
 We brought all the food and tried to make it like a party 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.780
 I want to eat those dinosaur chickens that are trapped waiting to be cooked. 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.640
 They are cool 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.380
 Well done, everyone, well done. 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.001
 What is his name? 

00:04:10.553 --> 00:04:12.553
 Nobody knows 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.594
 See you next week. 

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:17.540
 Bye~
