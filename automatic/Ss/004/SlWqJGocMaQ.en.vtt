checking all all all the spawns just
trying<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.480> pick<00:02:00.630> off<00:02:00.780> some<00:02:00.960> easy<00:02:01.170> kills<00:02:01.500> but

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
trying to pick off some easy kills but

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.360 
trying to pick off some easy kills but
without<00:02:02.160> getting<00:02:02.490> noticed<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> mp7<00:02:04.890> is

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
without getting noticed and the mp7 is

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.980 
without getting noticed and the mp7 is
actually<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:06.000> best<00:02:06.210> submachine<00:02:06.690> guns

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
actually one of the best submachine guns

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.540 
actually one of the best submachine guns
which<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.830> probably<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.430> the<00:02:08.520> reasons

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
which is probably one of the reasons

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.370 
which is probably one of the reasons
that<00:02:08.850> didn't<00:02:09.180> take<00:02:09.270> me<00:02:09.420> too<00:02:09.630> long<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.020> get<00:02:10.200> this

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
that didn't take me too long to get this

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.160 
that didn't take me too long to get this
