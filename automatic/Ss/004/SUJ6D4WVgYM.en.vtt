00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
 to wanna rock and roll now time to 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.750
 every day 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.220
 hello if it is not recognized yet 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.290
 I am the erroneous antonio of lessons of 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.190
 modern puntocom guitar today we look 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.050
 to this riff in the style of kiss a 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.870
 how simple we are using gods 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.940
 stage and inversions of the triads on 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.070
 rhythm to how interesting we go to 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.590
 see this piece is divided into 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.510
 different sections we have an intro of two 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.420
 jokes we have a verse of four then 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.860
 we have a korus and then we have a tail 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.530
 we start from the whole where we find 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.240
 now a riff that will then repeat itself 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.560
 several times in this passage in this 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.500
 short piece and the peculiarity of this 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.270
 of this example the fact that I am a 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.450
 we play on the first beat so there is 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.330
 pause ii and start on the second 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.830
 beat that makes it a little more 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.960
 interesting the agreement we are 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.670
 indeed it makes using all the missionaries 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.149
 riff and then we go to analyze the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.149
 agreements 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.549
 so what are we doing? 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.120
 practically playing two chords at a 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.040
 so senate soul agreement 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.350
 this theory now the second third e 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.460
 fourth string now played no no 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.369
 seventh and eighth key 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.290
 this is the agreement of the sol while the 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.750
 step are in the rack indeed is a sol 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.759
 with the king of bass and the other deal that 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.980
 we are using and this quaestor 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.540
 triad always say on the second third e 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.939
 fourth string 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.430
 now played with this semi bars on 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:21.210
 seventh rate practically lancet is already 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 turati has moved on setting castro 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.160
 ok so for it to the beat 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.590
 we start on the second beat where 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:36.360
 we do three or four so we play 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.610
 on the beat of 2 on the various of 3 1 2 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.010
 3 and 4 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.490
 then in the second bar we go up 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.490
 superintendent 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.770
 which has low bass effects 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.060
 only in the therefore it is a king with the di 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.489
 low and let's make one 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.540
 and then on two according to the third beat 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.540
 let's take this step 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.450
 so let's go from solo to king then 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.450
 just beat find now 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.610
 an eighth pause on the fourth beat e 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.930
 raise we play in there 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.379
 out 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.129
 and this introduces us brings us all 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:22.400
 towards this example now this 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.739
 ball remains for three parties then we have 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.120
 this scratch on the 4 and on the various ones 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:33.460
 we play an anticipated mii pouchot 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.950
 the seventh key of the fifth string 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.500
 we do the same thing to return 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.190
 on 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.190
 later again 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.480
 then let's lift for 4 beats 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.060
 of the fourth measure of the verse 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.290
 let's go to this network 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.290
 then 4 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 234 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.000
 this monitor this phase here 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.000
 area to his time is knowing how to analyze it 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.370
 ok practically we play the deal on 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.370
 various of the previous bar a 4 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.550
 412 then on 2 we play the sixth 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.290
 now with the little finger then for 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.630
 this attitude of the stage where 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.580
 we are punished and fifth 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:39.230
 let's add the sixth and the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:42.680
 let's stop this noise again on 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.380
 4 beat and on the we play who we are 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.600
 he therefore anticipated and played a riff 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.440
 similar to the one we played on 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.440
 repower cod 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.770
 these are the leak boogie boogies 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.660
 that is, that they are typical of blues but that 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.970
 they have been used a lot since 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.240
 70s rock 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.240
 then 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.150
 and then we play our ref 12 34 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:21.490
 4 then we go during this 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.759
 example 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.169
 and here again to create a little more 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.380
 interest 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.169
 we have a quarter base on the first 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.980
 left and then we play the deal on 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:42.560
 second then 1 Jun 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:44.960
 423 therefore lasts for almost all and 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.750
 two beats then part on the second 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.300
 beat and then comes to the third beat 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.370
 of the next bar on the fourth 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.080
 a quarter of an eighth break on 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.770
 then beat on the various we go to the king 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:04.580
 where we play that riff again ok 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.169
 just note that I'm not here with the medium 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.380
 playing no note but i'm 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.690
 simply trying to stop the 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.340
 same string to vibrate so don't get upset 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.410
 actually displacing the hit and already tour e 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.700
 of these agreements and only these two 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.700
 wheels that is therefore 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.700
 let's go to my again very similar to 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.090
 the previous one 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.040
 just asking 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.040
 we hear this sentence here 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.000
 then we go to a power corp 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:49.279
 at a stage 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.009
 and then we close with our famous ref 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.009
 13 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.470
 only we call I made a mini 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.630
 free course for all those 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.479
 they want to deepen their knowledge 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.620
 on the tool to take advantage of 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.810
