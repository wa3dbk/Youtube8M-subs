00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.080
 all right 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.490
 [Music] 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 good 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.920
 and freedom that sm kabul in the next 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.390
 video I bring you like having codes of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.560
 48 hours through the Japanese and good 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.869
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.000
 open our 2000 dotcom pages 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.380
 to create an account I do not have in 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.690
 that name does not matter 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.620
 age have to be over age 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.289
 preference 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.160
 mail no matter one thing that 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.210
 matter is that you must hotmail.com 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.280
 and as you can see is when the dotcom 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.110
 is in the japan region or truth this is 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.480
 a very important point if they do not put 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.739
 Japan is not going to serve anything the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.719
 Zip code is also very important 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.800
 is 150 script 23 45 once what 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.800
 we have accept 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.550
 let's meat 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.940
 and then we're going to go into a page 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.630
 web for indiscretion of the description 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.390
 of this page 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.930
 the dotcom adif box but in Japanese and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.759
 good here is going to look direct directito 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.930
 will appear all Japanese letters what 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.539
 only they have to do is accept 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.909
 the terms spent on popcorn 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.840
 situation as well as demonstrates not 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.730
 will move nothing to others must accept 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.730
 in the gamer to mark ok 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.140
 once having this we go to the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.140
 console to recover the profile 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.740
 and well I'm already recovering 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.269
 he has asked me for nothing 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.870
 and here is the mat of cane does not matter 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.200
 now if you played we are not games 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.069
 and right we have 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.010
 We are here to download 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.260
 it's quick the downloads increases less in 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.260
 second because we lower it 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.499
 this mirror 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.680
 ok we work our demo and now we're going 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.680
 to open to play 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.490
 let's go to our games 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.950
 and we choose the we see 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.760
 well in who thinks it begins what 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.760
 interesting so pay attention to 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.430
 this game what we are going to be able to play 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:53.599
 it only helps us to get the code 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.599
 and we press until 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.019
 to nothing 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.579
 ok here we are in the cursor that we have 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.540
 from the little part on top of the side 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.150
 left 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.600
 we move it with the nastic we're going to 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.400
 go down 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.000
 in the part where it tells us that we have 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.000
 what to write 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.299
 the code that we have a part of 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:21.970
 up and we will move it until we have 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.750
 right until you have the numbers 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:30.430
 although now I'm going to explain 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:32.780
 this point what I put like the numbers 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.470
 I came here explained how and from where 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.470
 I took it out 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.810
 although exposing them 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.290
 is that I'm looking for the values ​​of 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.410
 every decade good Japanese letters 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.410
 numbers 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.120
 once I have them, press until 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.630
 Y 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.640
 I'll give you the click 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.800
 immediately I will generate the code 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.990
 is the code that imports them from 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.249
 up below is the demo but not 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:18.520
 we have to play us and good 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:21.320
 this now as he says to get them out 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.710
 to know the numbers 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:31.210
 ok then use this tablet 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.129
 in this tablet come the drawings and the 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.919
 values ​​of each one this 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:39.739
 I recommend that when you have the 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.989
 values you good the number the 

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:46.099
 Japanese number I wrote down I did not take a 

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:48.499
 picture this already after you have the photo or 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.949
 have them annotated they are looking for one 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:53.449
 one the value of each this pool in the 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.340
 code 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.180
 and ready download and you will have your code 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.490
 48 hours and well then that's all for 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.439
 today I hope you liked it and 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.339
 serve them a lot 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:09.620
 this is and always still and they are 48 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:13.449
 I hope you enjoy it, do not forget 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.449
 subscribe and give light we are
