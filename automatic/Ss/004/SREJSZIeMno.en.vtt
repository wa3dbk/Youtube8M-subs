00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.090
 answering the questions from the video of 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.269
 the review from the cell phone 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:15.150
 huawei place or videos x 3 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.500
 they ask how to be ruth or how to win 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.789
 administrator privileges on the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.150
 mobile 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.610
 It is very simple but they are several steps 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.560
 the first thing is obviously to have the driver 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.869
 of the cell phone because you need a 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.650
 computer to do this then I 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.810
 I put a link to the driver of the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.090
 cellular for windows platform 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.900
 since they installed the driver and counting 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.050
 the cell phone by usb 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.480
 are going to go to the configuration of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.560
 cellular in applications and here they will 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.130
 leave a fast boot option on 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.720
 fast that they should disable and not the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.290
 I have this is another version of 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.220
 Android since they were enabled in the 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.820
 facebook come out 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.580
 they can even turn it off 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.580
 and they take away the battery a few seconds 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.380
 since they took away the batteries they are going to 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:22.150
 put to learn it use the volume 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 down and the power button 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.820
 and they leave it tight for a few seconds 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.760
 until what 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.930
 they stay an initial screen 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.110
 and does not load android completely stays 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.650
 like half then since they are in 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.650
 that screen 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.650
 cure in a file that I also put them 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.610
 annexed 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.190
 in the tablet of how to be fruit there 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.220
 a file called installer point 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.690
 bat then run in that and there's a 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.310
 guide of 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.580
 then give any key to 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.130
 continue cellular this is with the cell 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.350
 already connected to a usb and turned on 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.220
 this form 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.600
 with that they are going to do 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.700
 over the phone 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.750
 already being root you can do other 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.500
 things 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.140
 I recommend you install a 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.580
 application that is called super and usher or 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:38.320
 are going to be found in the marketplace of 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.180
 android for this application to take 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.060
 the civilians of rudy can give them to 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.060
 other applications as an uninstaller 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.849
 of magician system applications 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.750
 or it is in order there are not several applications 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.120
 like the atf and the one that removes the banners 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.150
 of advertising need privileges of 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.890
 root and those have to be granted a 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.550
 program as top zero 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.980
 or some similar similarity sometimes 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.980
 I also recommend that you try a 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.940
 with a special android version for 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.940
 this cell phone called eclipse rom 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.830
 and there are others also like 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.569
 well I send them the link of a forum is 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.549
 in German but you can translate it 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.739
 they are practically pure links of 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:40.329
 Android versions for this cell phone 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:42.219
 that they can try if it's in the 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.280
 startup screen as it should be 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:50.280
 when we did this and from this 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.140
 screen is when you can install things 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.390
 is what is used to restore the 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.170
 Android in case it stops working 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.190
 so 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.190
 being like this 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.989
 they run the bat point installer and they must 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.520
 have administrator privileges 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:13.430
 after that turning it on with the 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.400
 with the other sequence that would be volume 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.410
 upwards 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.410
 well then to remove the game again 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.419
 since it is rooted and run a 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.300
 point bat installer will install them 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.260
 besides giving them root privileges 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.260
 and they will install a small 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.210
 is a boot operating system 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.840
 applying the other sequence that is 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.260
 volume up she 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.030
 and the power button are going to have this 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.790
 what is the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.840
 clockwork 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.840
 very rich bay 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.130
 they navigate with the arrows to make volume 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.370
 up and down then here 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.650
 is where they can 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.139
 and install another android another version of 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:17.050
 android then first they are 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:19.849
 recommends cleaning the cache clean 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.939
 the data and then 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:26.289
 install a zip the psib must contain the 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.289
 operating system 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.599
 choose the sip that should be in a 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.599
 microsd card 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.320
 and ready 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.320
 they tell him that they want to install it 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.770
 it takes more or less in the two minutes 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:55.319
 and well that's it for how to root 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.269
 and also how to install it in a 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.479
 different version of android to which 

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:59.479
 bring 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.090
 solve your doubts and if you can not 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.190
 get into the forums that I put them 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.190
 the links on the door below the video
