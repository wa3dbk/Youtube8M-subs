out to be say this this is what
mine<00:00:42.570> came<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.469> might<00:00:43.800> look

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
mine came out to be this one might look

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.600 
mine came out to be this one might look
like<00:00:44.870> that's<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.410> rendered<00:00:47.070> lace<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
like that's how you I rendered lace I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.690 
like that's how you I rendered lace I
mean<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.030> never<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.329> dead<00:00:48.600> lays<00:00:48.840> before<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
mean I never a dead lays before so I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.580 
mean I never a dead lays before so I
don't<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.989> came<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.230> ready

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
don't know but I think I came up ready

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
don't know but I think I came up ready
okay<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.910> one<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.120> drawings

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
okay and then this is one of my drawings

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.590 
okay and then this is one of my drawings
that's<00:00:57.719> almost<00:00:58.079> done<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:59.129> done

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
that's almost done but not really done

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.520 
that's almost done but not really done
yet<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> lace<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:04.019> unless<00:01:04.409> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
yet with the lace on it and unless you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
yet with the lace on it and unless you
can<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.070> next<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:05.729> penciled

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
can see the one next to it has penciled

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
can see the one next to it has penciled
it<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.170> need<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.439> make<00:01:07.590> sure<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it in because I need to make sure the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.399 
it in because I need to make sure the
pattern<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.150> good<00:01:09.420> before<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.869> start<00:01:10.200> curling

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
pattern is good before I start curling

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.320 
pattern is good before I start curling
it<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.130> takes<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> time<00:01:12.170> but<00:01:13.170> I

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
it in so it takes a lot of time but I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
it in so it takes a lot of time but I
laid<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> color<00:01:15.960> where<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> lace<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
laid out the color where the lace is

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.280 
laid out the color where the lace is
gonna<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.549> under<00:01:17.790> color<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
gonna be the under color on some of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.620 
gonna be the under color on some of
these<00:01:19.350> already<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> do

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
these already so that all I have to do

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.990 
these already so that all I have to do
is<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> lacing<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:24.740> what<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
is just do the lacing and what are you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.190 
is just do the lacing and what are you
well<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.240> used<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.869> peach<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.930> well<00:01:30.930> I'm

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
well I used to like peach and well I'm

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.450 
well I used to like peach and well I'm
not<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.500> using<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> black<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
not really using the black because this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
not really using the black because this
is<00:01:32.579> really<00:01:32.820> thick<00:01:33.150> even<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> fine<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:35.040> is

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
is really thick even the fine one is

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.330 
is really thick even the fine one is
thick<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.390> used<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.439> plant<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.860> make<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
thick but I used to plant to make the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
thick but I used to plant to make the
sample<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> print<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.570> bigger

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
sample one because the print is bigger

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.480 
sample one because the print is bigger
here<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:42.090> make<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.159> used<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:45.259> micron

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
here but to make this I used a micron

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.450 
here but to make this I used a micron
which<00:01:48.290> 105<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:50.729> outline<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> first<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
which 105 to outline in the first then I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.850 
which 105 to outline in the first then I
used<00:01:54.240> 203<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:56.369> color<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.030> all<00:01:57.860> medium-sized

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
used 203 to color in all medium-sized

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.450 
used 203 to color in all medium-sized
lines<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.750> eight<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.979> talk<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
lines and or eight to just talk in the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.600 
lines and or eight to just talk in the
bigger<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.540> bigger<00:02:03.689> bolder<00:02:04.110> parts<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.040> then

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
bigger the bigger bolder parts and then

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.820 
bigger the bigger bolder parts and then
I<00:02:05.700> went<00:02:05.850> again<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.810> sides<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
I went again with all sides and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.590 
I went again with all sides and
the<00:02:07.920> little<00:02:08.250> lines<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.150> cross-hatching<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
the little lines and cross-hatching and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.780 
the little lines and cross-hatching and
all<00:02:12.600> that<00:02:12.900> stuff<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.620> make<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.400> look<00:02:14.580> like

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
