part of the movie i think it makes a lot

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.560 
part of the movie i think it makes a lot
of<00:02:19.250> sense<00:02:19.370> when<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.790> look<00:02:19.820> at<00:02:20.060> Superman<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
of sense when you look at Superman and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.760 
of sense when you look at Superman and
Batman<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:20.990> parallels<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.650> their

Batman and the parallels and their
stories<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.790> importance<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.300> their

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
stories and the importance of their

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.180 
stories and the importance of their
fathers<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:24.140> each<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.470> their<00:02:24.650> or<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.070> know

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
fathers in each of their or you know

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.980 
fathers in each of their or you know
fatherhood<00:02:26.000> as<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.390> general<00:02:26.750> theme<00:02:26.960> is

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
fatherhood as a general theme is

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.660 
fatherhood as a general theme is
important<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.650> both<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.920> them<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.520> makes

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
important to both of them so it makes

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.950
