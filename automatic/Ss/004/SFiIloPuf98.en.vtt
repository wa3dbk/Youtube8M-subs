00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
here out by the forty engineering team

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.359 
here out by the forty engineering team
and<00:00:27.630> where<00:00:28.500> did<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.710> bring<00:00:28.860> us<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.070> it's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and where did you bring us here it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.970 
and where did you bring us here it's
pretty<00:00:29.580> cool<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.850> a<00:00:30.210> house<00:00:30.480> photo<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.860> we

pretty cool that a house photo so are we

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
pretty cool that a house photo so are we
gonna<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.400> here<00:00:32.580> yeah<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> more<00:00:33.330> up<00:00:33.420> it's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
gonna do here yeah so the more up it's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.350 
gonna do here yeah so the more up it's
smoother<00:00:34.080> scientific<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.309> we're<00:00:35.970> about<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
smoother scientific and we're about to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000 
smoother scientific and we're about to
run<00:00:36.540> some<00:00:37.200> all-wheel-drive

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
lane change in slalom events we're gonna

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.229 
lane change in slalom events we're gonna
get<00:00:40.949> a<00:00:41.010> feel<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.670> stability<00:00:42.059> control

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
get a feel for the stability control

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
get a feel for the stability control
system<00:00:42.720> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> vehicle<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.860> helps<00:00:44.070> us

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
system on the vehicle how it helps us

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.290 
system on the vehicle how it helps us
guide<00:00:44.340> us<00:00:44.370> through<00:00:44.519> as<00:00:44.850> well<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
guide us through as well as how the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
guide us through as well as how the
all-wheel-drive<00:00:45.629> system<00:00:45.900> make<00:00:46.739> sure<00:00:46.769> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
all-wheel-drive system make sure that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
all-wheel-drive system make sure that
we've<00:00:47.309> powered<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.239> rear<00:00:48.600> wheels<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.080> that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
we've powered the rear wheels so that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.960 
we've powered the rear wheels so that
the<00:00:49.500> vehicle<00:00:49.949> can<00:00:50.070> turn<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.370> adequately<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
the vehicle can turn in adequately and

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.759 
the vehicle can turn in adequately and
make<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> through<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> lane<00:00:51.900> change<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.440> slalom

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
make it through a lane change in slalom

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.470 
make it through a lane change in slalom
type<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.280> okay<00:00:53.550> oh<00:00:53.580> and<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.330> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
type of that okay oh and we are in a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.190 
type of that okay oh and we are in a
play<00:00:54.809> day<00:00:55.410> 14<00:00:56.120> 2013<00:00:57.120> Ford<00:00:57.629> Escape<00:00:57.719> all-wheel

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
play day 14 2013 Ford Escape all-wheel

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.370 
play day 14 2013 Ford Escape all-wheel
drive<00:00:58.469> okay<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.340> great<00:00:59.700> to<00:00:59.879> see

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.899 

and<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.620> sure<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> things

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and we I'm sure that I can do the things

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
and we I'm sure that I can do the things
but<00:01:09.299> let's<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.600> another<00:01:09.780> driver<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.610> react

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
but let's see another driver can react

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.510 
but let's see another driver can react
to<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.740> we<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.860> similarly<00:01:14.250> any<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to this thing so we are similarly any to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
to this thing so we are similarly any to
say<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.000> write<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.840> write<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.500> cones

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
say I like to write they write the cones

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.530 
say I like to write they write the cones
that<00:01:17.010> are<00:01:17.070> set<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.610> front<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.909> us<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.510> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that are set up in front of us are for a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
that are set up in front of us are for a
time<00:01:19.500> an<00:01:19.590> emergency<00:01:20.040> lane<00:01:20.250> change<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:20.700> we're

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
time an emergency lane change so we're

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.910 
time an emergency lane change so we're
gonna<00:01:20.880> start<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:22.200> babies<00:01:22.650> we're<00:01:22.800> about

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
gonna start off what babies we're about

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.990 
gonna start off what babies we're about
20<00:01:23.190> miles<00:01:23.280> per<00:01:23.400> hour<00:01:23.520> where<00:01:23.700> we're<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:23.970> right

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
20 miles per hour where we're at right

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.310 
20 miles per hour where we're at right
now<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.600> we're<00:01:24.690> an<00:01:24.750> accelerate

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
now and then we're an accelerate

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.630 
now and then we're an accelerate
actually<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.800> we<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:26.009> through<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> events<00:01:26.580> of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
actually as we go through the events of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.070 
actually as we go through the events of
course<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> system<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.750> part<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
course that system that will be part of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:38.590 
course that system that will be part of
it<00:01:28.409> 30s<00:01:30.020> tomorrow

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.280 

and<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.689> try<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:41.960> I'm<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.140> try

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and we try to get I'm going to try

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.530 
and we try to get I'm going to try
slalom<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:47.270> hope<00:01:48.270> y'all<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
slalom with that so just hope y'all the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.850 
slalom with that so just hope y'all the
brakes<00:01:48.780> firing<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:51.899> got<00:01:52.049> those<00:01:52.170> inside<00:01:52.530> nails

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
brakes firing I got those inside nails

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.030 
brakes firing I got those inside nails
in<00:01:53.460> order<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> help<00:01:54.479> us<00:01:54.690> maneuver<00:01:55.619> through<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
in order to help us maneuver through the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:14.350 
in order to help us maneuver through the
through<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> cones

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.530 

so<00:02:15.360> these<00:02:15.570> safety<00:02:15.840> technology<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:16.920> helped

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
so these safety technology really helped

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.690 
so these safety technology really helped
the<00:02:18.540> drivers<00:02:19.140> even<00:02:19.290> either<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:20.040> experience

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the drivers even either as experience

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.880 
the drivers even either as experience
and<00:02:21.690> difficult<00:02:22.470> situations<00:02:22.980> with<00:02:24.620> right<00:02:25.620> exam

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and difficult situations with right exam

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.470 
and difficult situations with right exam
weather<00:02:26.070> conditions<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.850> all<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.390> I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
weather conditions and all that and I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.200 
weather conditions and all that and I
was<00:02:27.510> pretty<00:02:28.050> interesting<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.590> hear<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.210> you

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
was pretty interesting to hear that you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.540 
was pretty interesting to hear that you
selling<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.660> lot<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.810> cars<00:02:31.050> not<00:02:31.320> only<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.950> areas

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
selling a lot of cars not only in areas

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.090 
selling a lot of cars not only in areas
where<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.120> snow<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.660> winter<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.110> with<00:02:34.860> snow

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
where the snow the winter is with snow

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.530 
where the snow the winter is with snow
one<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.550> girls<00:02:35.790> are<00:02:35.940> like<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.210> Miami

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
one of that girls are like in Miami

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.600 
one of that girls are like in Miami
right<00:02:36.780> where<00:02:37.230> there's<00:02:37.680> more<00:02:37.890> rain<00:02:38.070> than<00:02:38.310> ten

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
right where there's more rain than ten

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.510 
right where there's more rain than ten
snow<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:40.380> system<00:02:40.710> also<00:02:40.890> works<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.400> those

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
snow but the system also works in those

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.270

understand<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.210> about<00:03:00.300> four<00:03:00.720> times<00:03:00.960> faster

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
understand it's about four times faster

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.640 
understand it's about four times faster
than<00:03:02.160> equally<00:03:02.820> gear<00:03:02.970> even<00:03:03.960> faster<00:03:04.440> than<00:03:04.560> that

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
than equally gear even faster than that

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.230 
than equally gear even faster than that
it's<00:03:04.860> really<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.340> ting<00:03:05.520> conditions<00:03:05.970> every

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
it's really a ting conditions every

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.390 
it's really a ting conditions every
about<00:03:06.450> 16<00:03:06.930> milliseconds

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
about 16 milliseconds

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.130 
about 16 milliseconds
so<00:03:10.400> let's<00:03:10.610> say<00:03:10.790> we<00:03:11.090> win<00:03:11.360> destruction<00:03:11.989> of<00:03:12.110> that

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
so let's say we win destruction of that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.410 
so let's say we win destruction of that
wheel<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.069> system<00:03:13.519> is<00:03:13.700> intelligent

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
wheel so the system is intelligent

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.000 
wheel so the system is intelligent
enough<00:03:14.629> to<00:03:14.690> compensate<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.349> moving<00:03:15.860> the

enough to compensate that moving the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.890 
enough to compensate that moving the

if it sees that we've lost traction on
one<00:03:20.060> side<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.450> will<00:03:20.569> immediately<00:03:20.720> send<00:03:21.110> send

safety<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.260> stability<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:22.280> system<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.669> just

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
safety and stability the system is just

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:35.909 
safety and stability the system is just
always<00:04:23.030> on<00:04:23.240> always<00:04:23.479> doing

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.109 

so<00:04:36.919> what<00:04:37.129> happened<00:04:37.399> if<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.610> like<00:04:37.789> suddenly

computer affiliate again you put in a
lot<00:04:58.249> of<00:04:58.279> work<00:04:58.520> behind<00:04:58.729> that<00:04:59.089> there's<00:04:59.419> a<00:04:59.449> lot<00:04:59.569> of

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
lot of work behind that there's a lot of

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.239 
lot of work behind that there's a lot of
a<00:04:59.809> lot<00:04:59.959> of<00:05:00.080> processing<00:05:00.830> that's<00:05:00.979> going<00:05:01.189> on

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.249 
a lot of processing that's going on

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.159 
a lot of processing that's going on
behind<00:05:01.429> the<00:05:01.580> scenes<00:05:01.639> is<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.599> magic

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.499 

how<00:05:06.169> long<00:05:06.919> did<00:05:07.099> something<00:05:07.849> like<00:05:07.969> this<00:05:08.149> is<00:05:08.360> I

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
how long did something like this is I

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.659 
how long did something like this is I
guess<00:05:08.719> it's<00:05:09.050> constant<00:05:09.469> work<00:05:09.649> because<00:05:10.159> I<00:05:10.399> mean

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
guess it's constant work because I mean

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.189 
guess it's constant work because I mean
you<00:05:10.849> always<00:05:10.999> developing<00:05:11.539> you<00:05:11.659> think<00:05:11.899> but<00:05:12.050> how

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
you always developing you think but how

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.109 
you always developing you think but how
lonely<00:05:12.469> set<00:05:12.770> projects<00:05:13.189> like<00:05:13.309> this<00:05:13.490> well<00:05:13.969> it

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:14.119 
lonely set projects like this well it

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:15.730 
lonely set projects like this well it
depends<00:05:14.689> some<00:05:14.809> of<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:14.990> core<00:05:15.169> technologies

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
depends some of the core technologies

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.469 
depends some of the core technologies
are<00:05:15.949> developed<00:05:16.490> kind<00:05:16.669> of<00:05:16.789> an<00:05:16.879> advanced<00:05:17.240> system

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
are developed kind of an advanced system

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.089 
are developed kind of an advanced system
then<00:05:17.809> about<00:05:18.020> two<00:05:18.169> years<00:05:18.319> before<00:05:18.559> vehicles

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
then about two years before vehicles

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.260 
then about two years before vehicles
launched<00:05:19.430> we<00:05:19.550> start<00:05:19.759> getting<00:05:19.999> our<00:05:20.089> first

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
launched we start getting our first

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.329 
launched we start getting our first
prototypes<00:05:20.809> and<00:05:21.080> applying<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:22.009> system

00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:22.339 
prototypes and applying the system

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:24.790 
prototypes and applying the system
directly<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.789> that<00:05:22.879> and<00:05:23.089> tuning<00:05:23.629> it<00:05:23.719> so<00:05:24.680> it's

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
directly to that and tuning it so it's

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.199 
directly to that and tuning it so it's
usually<00:05:24.860> about<00:05:25.189> a<00:05:25.249> two-year<00:05:25.520> process<00:05:25.729> before

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:26.209 
usually about a two-year process before

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:27.730 
usually about a two-year process before
that<00:05:26.360> vehicle<00:05:26.719> is<00:05:26.809> actually<00:05:27.169> starting<00:05:27.589> to<00:05:27.680> get

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
that vehicle is actually starting to get

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.790 
that vehicle is actually starting to get
launched<00:05:28.069> out<00:05:28.189> to<00:05:28.309> customers<00:05:28.490> well<00:05:28.909> excellent
