00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
couple of the endings on it it's so that

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.960

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
his head and he will not lick the wound

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.420 
his head and he will not lick the wound
so<00:02:45.510> he<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.780> get<00:02:45.870> all<00:02:46.169> better<00:02:46.919> and<00:02:47.159> I'll<00:02:47.220> show
