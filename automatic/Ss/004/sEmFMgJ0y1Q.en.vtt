kill drew then every hit is a bonus
combo<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.930> my<00:02:16.200> Dark<00:02:16.500> Fire<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:17.010> actually

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
combo and so my Dark Fire is actually

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.330 
combo and so my Dark Fire is actually
high<00:02:17.549> enough<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.239> get<00:02:18.870> through<00:02:19.140> her<00:02:19.440> even

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
high enough to get through her even

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.270 
high enough to get through her even
though<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.790> hadn't<00:02:21.299> used<00:02:21.480> nullify<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.980> freeze

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
though I hadn't used nullify but freeze

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.100 
though I hadn't used nullify but freeze
is<00:02:23.489> good<00:02:23.760> because<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.329> get<00:02:24.540> more<00:02:24.750> breaks

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
is good because you get more breaks

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.039 
is good because you get more breaks
freeze<00:02:25.769> boosts<00:02:26.370> Perry's<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.630> your<00:02:27.810> great

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
freeze boosts Perry's so that your great

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.140 
freeze boosts Perry's so that your great
become<00:02:28.500> perfect<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.310> if<00:02:29.820> you've<00:02:29.970> got<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
become perfect and if you've got a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.600 
become perfect and if you've got a
perfect<00:02:30.690> pair<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.049> stun<00:02:31.320> gem<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:32.250> you're

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
perfect pair of stun gem then you're

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.819 
perfect pair of stun gem then you're
immediately<00:02:32.850> get<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.690> break<00:02:33.959> with<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.410> perfect

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
immediately get a break with the perfect

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:35.180 
immediately get a break with the perfect
parry

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
parry

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.310 
parry
however<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.299> didn't<00:02:36.630> actually<00:02:36.750> need<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.140> do

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
however I didn't actually need to do

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.830 
however I didn't actually need to do
that<00:02:37.530> because<00:02:37.920> she<00:02:38.489> was<00:02:38.670> low<00:02:38.880> enough<00:02:38.910> from<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that because she was low enough from the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.410 
that because she was low enough from the
first<00:02:40.110> attack<00:02:40.500> grade<00:02:40.829> that<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.820> could<00:02:42.209> finish

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
first attack grade that I could finish

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.050 
first attack grade that I could finish
her<00:02:42.660> off<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.320> super<00:02:43.739> break<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.700> that's

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
her off with the super break so that's

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.550 
her off with the super break so that's
what<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.299> did<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.989> went<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:47.010> super<00:02:47.489> straight<00:02:47.850> away

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
what I did I went to super straight away

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.309 
what I did I went to super straight away
as<00:02:48.830> our<00:02:49.010> position<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.700> low<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.239> she<00:02:51.110> was

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
as our position is low and she was

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.820 
as our position is low and she was
basically<00:02:51.500> finished<00:02:52.340> off<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:53.290> when<00:02:54.290> you

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
basically finished off and when you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.750 
basically finished off and when you
defeat<00:02:55.220> her

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
defeat her

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.510 
defeat her
that's<00:02:56.239> when<00:02:56.569> she<00:02:56.599> feels<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.800> chest<00:02:58.160> and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
that's when she feels the chest and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.320 
that's when she feels the chest and
where<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.390> math<00:02:59.630> is<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.560> after<00:03:01.370> defeating<00:03:01.760> Lin

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
where the math is so after defeating Lin

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.930 
where the math is so after defeating Lin
J<00:03:02.599> that's<00:03:02.989> how<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.380> get<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.069> map<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.520> heaven

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
J that's how you get the map of heaven

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.870 
J that's how you get the map of heaven
and<00:03:05.150> you'll<00:03:05.690> see<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:06.500> she<00:03:07.190> does<00:03:07.489> actually

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
and you'll see that she does actually

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.570 
and you'll see that she does actually
die<00:03:08.150> Donald<00:03:08.750> mustard<00:03:09.200> confirmed<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:10.160> Syrus

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
die Donald mustard confirmed that Syrus

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.220 
die Donald mustard confirmed that Syrus
does<00:03:10.880> kill<00:03:11.690> her<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.440> scene<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.230> after

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230
