into my piece of luggage just barely I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.210 
into my piece of luggage just barely I
call<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> big<00:01:42.899> little<00:01:43.170> tripod<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
call it a big little tripod I think the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.490 
call it a big little tripod I think the
fact<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.759> has<00:01:44.880> such<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> long<00:01:45.509> first

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
fact that it has such a long first

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
fact that it has such a long first
segment<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.159> makes<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:48.000> stable<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
segment here makes it more stable it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
segment here makes it more stable it
does<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.710> three<00:01:50.009> different<00:01:50.189> positions<00:01:50.820> on

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
would be with it all the way collapsed

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.089 
would be with it all the way collapsed
and<00:02:44.630> with<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.959> legs<00:02:45.200> splayed<00:02:45.560> out<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:45.890> this

so again the faisal ct3 three zero one

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.199 
so again the faisal ct3 three zero one
two<00:02:51.560> hundred<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:51.950> seventy<00:02:52.370> nine<00:02:52.519> dollars<00:02:52.549> at
