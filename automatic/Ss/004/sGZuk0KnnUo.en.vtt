00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.070
 the staff is doing this video here 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.230
 because that's how I have this problem myself 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.540
 I think other people also have né 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.349
 You may have a problem with my choice. 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:36.580
 that the nation did not take but is the problem 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:41.830
 of the food door of the pejô 206 or dismantled 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:44.850
 forsake also dark but the dismounted 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.800
 I forced everything, I left everything clean 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.059
 and this problem happens but not 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:58.840
 back the handle, I know it's for you 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:01:03.940
 Come and meet Luis, he usually 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.560
 stay soft that when you pull the door 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.350
 here in the case disassembled in a 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.040
 handle that happens when you take off the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.619
 lining 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:17.440
 you see that on the back is type 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:19.440
 papillon then as the handle he stays 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.510
 loose screw stay loose 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.290
 When you pull the door to close the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.570
 door 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.020
 You no longer pull the door, you pull. 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.189
 smoke and end up breaking we have cracked 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 here in the lining there is no house here either 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.150
 playing here 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.260
 There, it's all soft, I made it to 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:45.790
 solve this problem and show me here 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.280
 bought fiber do not buy fiber have 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.670
 that the fiber blanket 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.930
 The resin is the catalyst for the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.420
 to harden the resin 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.570
 in case I bought one that said it was 20 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:07.299
 real here next will be a meter 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:13.350
 square of manta is 600 ml of a resin 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:15.489
 I do not know if there is 50 mm in the blood 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.250
 catalyzer of the farm ceres tranquil 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.170
 we do we cut the chain 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.790
 a blanket show here in the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.790
 This is how I've done it here. 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:37.349
 you cut the mount size 71 here does 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.560
 the cut with the scissors does not even prepare 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:44.100
 the resin before because it dries oz and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.360
 karni 10 - they héctor you clean 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.599
 first the whole lishan surface 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.530
 surface left showing others where 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.930
 will be pasted aquino cases and garbage leaves 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.810
 All right, this very clean 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.680
 there you cut the blanket you cut blanket 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.110
 right 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.420
 You can cut some three pieces to 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.720
 practice a very thick layer of fiber 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.670
 to look good even if you 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.549
 cut short blanket several 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.840
 pieces in the case with always breaking this 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.930
 underneath is a handle here 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.700
 called is here as always break 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.660
 this male part you can cut 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.780
 several strips two three strips and put 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.840
 that only down to give a reinforcement 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.310
 So you with the two layers 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.230
 big demand here is so nee 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.709
 You mark where there is a hole here. 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.780
 resin passes the team only around right 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.609
 put the two layers in after you 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.120
 can with multiple layers 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.820
 down here taking the broken one that stays 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.890
 More or less here asking a little to 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.130
 to strengthen the glue but the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.010
 two or three layers in this here and here 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.069
 can you see what's left of the hole that I 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.489
 I did not spend in resin here where the 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.579
 handle is not fluffy then just cut 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.709
 with scissors, then you will be 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:25.160
 way to listen at night to 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.810
 Good lighting but dried up that already sheltered 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.120
 stone 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:40.380
 Right, and we just have to ride it now, we'll have it 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:44.490
 pick up the handles here and here without 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.430
 handle dog here maybe I make a 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.780
 video showing what it does with the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:56.220
 disassembly or assembly of the 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:05.130
 Dark chador is not here the handle there 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:06.720
 from behind thinking it was here in my case 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.280
 that some fishermen who were 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.100
 very small screw why 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.620
 you drop you put a bigger bolt 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.610
 place a reinforcement on the plastic where it 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.680
 For Frank's sake, do not let go. 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.680
 beauty is it 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.020
 activate continue listening to what you did 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:33.120
 explain how it prepares the 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:36.570
 to prepare resin and how do you 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.750
 It is to apply in the case to keep 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.750
 Aquino resin was of door 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:48.840
 the resin is the following you put and 100 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:53.039
 ml resin in the pot and place 15 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.850
 drops of catalyst gives 100 ml of 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.410
 resin in the pot 15 drops of 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.810
 catalyst after you have already 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.860
 prepared to keep the surface clean and 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.430
 everything else 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:09.630
 Then you will arrive with what little 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.800
 get here for ours will come with the 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:17.050
 brush 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.020
 you will apply a resin to the 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:29.949
 surface where it will circulate from the 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:33.120
 will apply everything you will put on the blanket ne 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.710
 You'll get it, you'll apply the bike later. 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.409
 will glue it to the surface where 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.050
 is already wet with resin 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.560
 You will get it will apply more resin 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.110
 on top of this blanket, do not forget not no 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.030
 Does not apply here where a 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.860
 handle right 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.780
 You are seeing here because if you are 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.750
 right here 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.169
 if you want to cut where you can tell and 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:02.650
 Do you know, you apply the other review? 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:05.889
 layer of ese on top of that blanket 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:09.250
 there you put another 1 layer of blanket 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.379
 other back over apply another 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.240
 layer of resin if you want to apply 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.280
 other layers you will do in that 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.599
 same procedure right? 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.419
 The first step is the resin that 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:24.610
 surface glue blanket will apply another 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:28.360
 layer of resin blanket 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:31.240
 surface of this blanket coca other layer 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.560
 of manta and so on 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.029
 right and resin sound only prepares resin 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.360
 after everything is ready from a 

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:42.759
 fifth of the cut and the cml resin of 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.039
 resin and 30 drops of the catalyst 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.879
 catalyst that causes the resin to harden 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:48.129
 huh 

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:50.500
 and be careful that the resin is a memory 

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:52.900
 games of hardening then prepare everything 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.639
 not previously prepare the resin prior to 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.069
 then cut and clean surfaces that 

00:07:54.639 --> 00:08:00.599
 you will lose your resins and it will dry 

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:00.599
 beauty is what it is
