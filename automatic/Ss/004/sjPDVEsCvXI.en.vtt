at the gig everybody loves those so much

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.829 
at the gig everybody loves those so much
but<00:00:36.929> it's<00:00:37.050> multi<00:00:37.769> wattage<00:00:38.420> options<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
but it's multi wattage options and

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.360 
but it's multi wattage options and
overdrive<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.620> channels<00:00:40.979> that<00:00:41.039> kind<00:00:41.339> of

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
overdrive two channels that kind of

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.669 
overdrive two channels that kind of
stuff<00:00:41.609> they<00:00:42.569> decided<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.109> put<00:00:43.409> it<00:00:43.499> into<00:00:43.649> a

combo<00:00:44.069> and<00:00:44.429> with<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.729> couple<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.089> extra

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
combo and with it a couple of extra

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.309 
combo and with it a couple of extra
features<00:00:46.190> namely<00:00:47.190> reverb<00:00:48.319> independent

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:49.319 
features namely reverb independent

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:50.930 
features namely reverb independent
reverb<00:00:49.589> controls<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.159> both<00:00:50.190> channels<00:00:50.639> which

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
reverb controls on both channels which

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.289 
reverb controls on both channels which
is<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.089> really<00:00:51.359> good<00:00:51.479> idea<00:00:51.859> and<00:00:53.030> like<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.149> say

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
is a really good idea and like I say

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:55.879 
is a really good idea and like I say
there<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.659> multiple<00:00:54.870> wattage<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.499> here<00:00:55.620> for

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:55.889 
there is multiple wattage in here for

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.590 
there is multiple wattage in here for
different<00:00:56.249> amounts<00:00:56.639> of<00:00:56.940> gain<00:00:57.179> at<00:00:57.329> different

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
different amounts of gain at different

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
different amounts of gain at different
volumes<00:00:58.219> at<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.339> moment<00:00:59.760> I've<00:00:59.850> got<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.210> on

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
volumes at the moment I've got this on

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.910 
volumes at the moment I've got this on
the<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.469> call<00:01:01.589> the<00:01:01.709> clean

we've<00:01:08.820> got<00:01:10.340> reverb<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.640> overall<00:01:12.479> volume<00:01:12.930> very

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
we've got reverb and overall volume very

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800 
we've got reverb and overall volume very
very<00:01:13.380> simple<00:01:13.799> way<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.369> well<00:01:14.810> I'm

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
very simple way out as well I'm

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.569 
very simple way out as well I'm
currently<00:01:15.990> running<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.619> channel<00:01:17.399> on

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
currently running the the channel on

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.080 
currently running the the channel on
normal<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.799> more<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.130> American

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
normal which is more of your American

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.670 
normal which is more of your American
kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.750> clean<00:01:22.020> sound

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.530 

but<00:01:28.250> there<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.580> top<00:01:28.820> boost<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:29.240> there<00:01:29.390> if<00:01:29.480> you

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
but there is a top boost in there if you

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.760 
but there is a top boost in there if you
want<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.780> go<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:29.900> little<00:01:29.990> bit<00:01:30.260> more<00:01:30.290> British<00:01:30.710> a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
I'll go back to normal

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.109 
I'll go back to normal

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
in the video be more aggressive and down

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.000 
in the video be more aggressive and down
to<00:02:16.060> 15<00:02:21.569> okay<00:02:22.569> so<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.379> green<00:02:23.680> channel

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
to 15 okay so that is the green channel

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.580 
to 15 okay so that is the green channel
or<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.300> clean<00:02:25.510> channel<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.380> foot

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
or the clean channel it is foot

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.080 
or the clean channel it is foot
switchable<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:27.130> there<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.519> footswitch

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
switchable but there is a footswitch

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.949 
switchable but there is a footswitch
jack<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.870> top<00:02:29.650> panel<00:02:29.830> as<00:02:30.580> well<00:02:31.180> going<00:02:31.750> over

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
jack on the top panel as well going over

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.259 
jack on the top panel as well going over
to<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.470> red<00:02:32.860> channel<00:02:33.190> which<00:02:33.400> has<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.849> gain

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
to the red channel which has the gain

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.449 
to the red channel which has the gain
there<00:02:35.019> are<00:02:35.170> three<00:02:35.739> settings<00:02:35.980> for<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
there are three settings for the

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.190 
there are three settings for the
different<00:02:37.180> types<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.450> gain<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:37.959> have<00:02:38.080> on

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
different types of gain you can have on

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.300 
different types of gain you can have on
this<00:02:38.319> amplifier<00:02:39.280> one<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:39.700> tweed<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.840> if<00:02:41.110> you've

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
this amplifier one is tweed so if you've

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
this amplifier one is tweed so if you've
gathered<00:02:42.310> haven't<00:02:42.700> gathered<00:02:42.940> already<00:02:43.060> that's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
gathered haven't gathered already that's

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.630 
gathered haven't gathered already that's
more<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.720> your<00:02:43.810> American<00:02:44.019> blues<00:02:44.590> kind<00:02:45.549> of

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
more of your American blues kind of

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.920 
more of your American blues kind of
sound<00:02:45.849> I'll<00:02:46.000> just<00:02:46.090> play<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.269> little<00:02:46.480> bit<00:02:46.690> with

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
sound I'll just play a little bit with

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.720 
sound I'll just play a little bit with
the<00:02:47.140> gain<00:02:47.709> down<00:02:47.890> fairly<00:02:48.370> low<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:51.220> understand

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the gain down fairly low and understand

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.800 
the gain down fairly low and understand
the<00:02:51.790> master<00:02:52.120> upper<00:02:52.269> bit<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.599> can<00:02:52.690> hear

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
the master upper bit so you can hear

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.900 
the master upper bit so you can hear
what<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.019> doing<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.980> I've<00:02:57.130> got<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.400> at<00:02:57.579> 40

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
what I'm doing and I've got this at 40

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:08.339 
what I'm doing and I've got this at 40
watts<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:06.480> that's<00:03:07.480> actually<00:03:07.630> giving<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.290> a

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
watts so that's actually giving you a

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.960 
watts so that's actually giving you a
little<00:03:08.500> bit<00:03:08.590> more<00:03:08.709> bite<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.190> what<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:09.700> still<00:03:09.940> a

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
little bit more bite on what is still a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.610 
little bit more bite on what is still a
fairly<00:03:10.239> clean<00:03:10.540> sound<00:03:10.810> but<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.140> can<00:03:11.260> push<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.560> a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
fairly clean sound but you can push it a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:20.039 
fairly clean sound but you can push it a
little<00:03:11.650> bit<00:03:11.980> more<00:03:18.510> push<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.750> little<00:03:19.780> bit

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
little bit more push it a little bit

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.740 
little bit more push it a little bit
more<00:03:20.850> I'll<00:03:21.850> just<00:03:22.030> bring<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.269> master<00:03:22.569> down<00:03:22.720> a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
more I'll just bring the master down a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.229 
more I'll just bring the master down a
bit<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.109> we<00:03:23.549> don't<00:03:24.549> blow<00:03:24.730> away<00:03:24.850> our<00:03:25.060> sound

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
bit so we don't blow away our sound

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.479 
bit so we don't blow away our sound
technicians<00:03:25.690> head<00:03:26.139> off<00:03:26.290> that'll<00:03:27.160> push<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.400> all

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
technicians head off that'll push it all

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.670 
technicians head off that'll push it all
the<00:03:27.579> way<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.970> just<00:03:28.480> gradually<00:03:28.690> introduce<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
the way and just gradually introduce the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.319 
the way and just gradually introduce the
master<00:03:30.069> second<00:03:30.459> here<00:03:30.609> what<00:03:30.760> sort<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.000> gain<00:03:31.180> we

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
master second here what sort of gain we

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.400 
master second here what sort of gain we
can<00:03:31.450> get<00:03:31.569> out<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:31.810> in<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.019> real<00:03:32.200> sense

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
can get out of this in a real sense

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:44.090 
can get out of this in a real sense
don't<00:03:35.370> be<00:03:35.430> scared

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.930 

it's<00:03:45.100> gonna<00:03:45.220> leave<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.490> there<00:03:45.610> for<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.760> moment

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
it's gonna leave it there for the moment

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.000 
it's gonna leave it there for the moment
and<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.840> still<00:03:47.050> got<00:03:47.170> along<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.440> Tweed<00:03:47.650> setting

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
and we still got along the Tweed setting

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.130 
and we still got along the Tweed setting
so<00:03:48.370> that's<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.670> fair<00:03:49.300> amount<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.540> gain<00:03:49.750> for<00:03:49.780> that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
so that's a fair amount of gain for that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:58.570 
so that's a fair amount of gain for that
vintage<00:03:50.470> style<00:03:50.800> overdraw

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.600 

well<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.210> flick<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.570> up<00:03:59.780> -<00:04:00.140> there's<00:04:01.070> tweed<00:04:01.370> and

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
well I flick it up - there's tweed and

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.040 
well I flick it up - there's tweed and
there's<00:04:01.730> high<00:04:01.910> one<00:04:02.210> and<00:04:02.240> high<00:04:02.570> -<00:04:02.630> we're

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
there's high one and high - we're

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.940 
there's high one and high - we're
starting<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.350> get<00:04:03.440> into<00:04:03.590> more<00:04:03.740> modern

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
starting to get into more modern

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.880 
starting to get into more modern
territory<00:04:04.460> now<00:04:08.200> hear<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:09.380> thickening<00:04:09.740> up

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
territory now hear that thickening up

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.880 
territory now hear that thickening up
just<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.130> little<00:04:10.160> bit<00:04:10.310> more<00:04:10.520> feedback<00:04:11.890> down

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
just a little bit more feedback down

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.290 
just a little bit more feedback down
then<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.130> master<00:04:13.490> again<00:04:13.610> just<00:04:13.910> second<00:04:14.150> here

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
then the master again just second here

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:22.900 
then the master again just second here
this<00:04:20.920> we're<00:04:21.920> getting<00:04:22.100> in<00:04:22.160> at<00:04:22.280> odo<00:04:22.550> territory

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
this we're getting in at odo territory

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.250 
this we're getting in at odo territory
now<00:04:23.060> for<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.360> Nick<00:04:23.480> position<00:04:23.810> more<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.050> Gary

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
now for the Nick position more you Gary

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:32.710 
now for the Nick position more you Gary
Moorthy<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:30.250> even<00:04:31.250> high<00:04:31.400> again<00:04:31.670> as<00:04:32.540> well

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
Moorthy and even high again as well

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.840 
Moorthy and even high again as well
which<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.050> little<00:04:33.230> bit<00:04:33.320> thicker<00:04:33.700> pull<00:04:34.700> down

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
which is a little bit thicker pull down

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.030 
which is a little bit thicker pull down
the<00:04:34.910> treble<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.360> little<00:04:35.600> bit<00:04:35.720> get<00:04:36.650> more<00:04:36.830> reverb

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
the treble a little bit get more reverb

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.570 
the treble a little bit get more reverb
getting<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.520> bit<00:04:37.910> more<00:04:38.060> 80s<00:04:38.390> in<00:04:38.450> here<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:39.580> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
getting a bit more 80s in here and the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:58.420 
getting a bit more 80s in here and the
master<00:04:40.760> just<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:56.560> really<00:04:57.560> really<00:04:57.740> great<00:04:58.070> sound

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
master just a really really great sound

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.000 
master just a really really great sound
and<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:59.840> can<00:04:59.900> get<00:05:00.080> all<00:05:00.200> that<00:05:00.350> from<00:05:00.500> one<00:05:00.680> unit

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
and you can get all that from one unit

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.090 
and you can get all that from one unit
so<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:01.940> go<00:05:02.090> from<00:05:02.350> pristine<00:05:03.350> clean<00:05:03.650> right<00:05:03.950> over

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100
