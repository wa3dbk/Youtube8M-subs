what<00:00:21.870> makes<00:00:22.200> metal<00:00:22.530> storm<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.250> unique<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
what makes metal storm so unique and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.850 
what makes metal storm so unique and
unlike<00:00:24.150> anything<00:00:24.600> that's<00:00:24.930> ever<00:00:25.170> come<00:00:25.440> before

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
unlike anything that's ever come before

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.250 
unlike anything that's ever come before
is<00:00:26.100> there's<00:00:26.790> basically<00:00:27.210> only<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:27.869> moving

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
is there's basically only one moving

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
is there's basically only one moving
part<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:30.000> bullet<00:00:31.550> metal<00:00:32.550> storms

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

revolutionary<00:00:33.780> design<00:00:34.140> lies<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.890> combining

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
revolutionary design lies in combining

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.869 
revolutionary design lies in combining
the<00:00:35.460> barrel<00:00:35.790> with<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> magazine<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:38.489> bullets

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the barrel with the magazine the bullets

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
the barrel with the magazine the bullets
are<00:00:39.000> preloaded<00:00:39.300> into<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> barrel<00:00:40.320> where<00:00:40.650> they

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
are preloaded into the barrel where they

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.520 
are preloaded into the barrel where they
are<00:00:40.800> lined<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.250> behind<00:00:41.820> each<00:00:42.030> other<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.500> can

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
are lined up behind each other so we can

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.310 
are lined up behind each other so we can
fire<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> much<00:00:44.460> faster<00:00:44.489> rate<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:48.320> these

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
fire at a much faster rate and these

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.410 
fire at a much faster rate and these
bullets<00:00:49.769> are<00:00:49.860> different<00:00:50.519> they're<00:00:51.059> fired
