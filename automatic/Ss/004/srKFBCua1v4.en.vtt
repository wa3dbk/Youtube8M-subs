00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.349 
looks especially interesting it's
completely<00:01:01.500> blank<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.059> means<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
completely blank so that means the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
completely blank so that means the
speakers<00:01:03.690> will<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> front<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.309> the
