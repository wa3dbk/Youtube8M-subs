00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.520
 you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.760
 welcome mattoscacco telesync and today we are talking about modern ash 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.880
 danger they leave in the dm 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.529
 it is one of the branches of the Sicilian defense 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.480
 the most gifted defense against 1 4 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.470
 c5 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.009
 I remind you that this pedestrian push 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.069
 c5 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.069
 in order to counterbalance the center 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.830
 f3 vb6 these are just the houses that moved 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.400
 routine of the Sicilian defense that you will always find 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.740
 f6 horse attacking 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.040
 the pedestrian 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.220
 sky e4 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.100
 Citrak 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.330
 so you enter and the sharingan defense when the two central black pawns do 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.940
 find on who you are and of you can the so-called small center 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 bishop 2 classic move 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.039
 makes playing the back in the future also in f3a after pushing f2f 4 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.880
 now cavallucci saying to create 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 house pressure of 4 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.900
 to the house c5 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.770
 castling 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.910
 Bishop 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.910
 e7 to try deapro care 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 bishop 3 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.549
 let's take the woman off at 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.630
 in defense of the patty horse in this way we have developed the bishop 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.829
 dark field 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.409
 who defends his 4 horse then the woman 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.409
 you can futurarte move 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.020
 castling door 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.950
 primiero 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.590
 s4 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.420
 i get a powerful one 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.760
 control the center in the future alfieri f3 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.980
 and now 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 face when the modern is achieved with this push 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.270
 for this arranged for wine was used by very great - masters 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.919
 like those of the grandis paschi level 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:19.359
 in it was practically what he wants to do with these deinition defense on 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.719
 operation in the center 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:26.289
 without worrying in the least about the weakness that comes in the house of 5 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.010
 obviously as compensation 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.069
 for this weakness 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.429
 uniero 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:38.660
 will get a good horse position assumed in hi5 then 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.989
 the exchange 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.799
 the series of pasta openings those to grant the strong advanced house of 5 la 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.199
 the horse starts 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.999
 to get a good location 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.999
 Indo-China 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.759
 now what happens 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.749
 after 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:00.149
 I exchange 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.919
 hum 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.919
 for s4 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.740
 the weakness of the tenor 4 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.759
 anyway 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:14.029
 without rays we say very obvious and therefore 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:18.879
 will be able to compensate for the weakness of the pawn of 6 after the exchange of this 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.129
 gender 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.320
 the two pedestrians 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.749
 year we say the same weakness 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.529
 how to continue to continue with 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.729
 horse f5 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.619
 bishop for f5 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.619
 etc 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.129
 for f5 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.389
 deeper f4 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.389
 and it really goes for languages 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.719
 or the quieter is certainly the most played eh 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.259
 horse 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.499
 vitra 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.139
 the horse then withdraws 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.559
 has no good either a position 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.559
 who manages to control a woman's body 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:09.779
 for f4 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.209
 not allowing this 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.879
 the advanced 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.879
 of the pedestrian f4f 5 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.019
 this is what we say here 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.829
 the arc line 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.379
 in the previous moderate 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.449
 is trying to see something else besides then 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.719
 ff4 that now there are jambul possible variants 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.939
 that of bishop for s4 that of tower 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.400
 in this video we see which of the fairs we say the most 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.899
 spontaneous we can then say bishop for f4 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.620
 bishop esselle 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.559
 now the white is no longer able to est to impede the push in any way 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:59.300
 d6d 5 alpine weight push release 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.999
 The pedestrian gets the center open against the isolated pawn 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.210
 so I still had a great game account 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.210
 white takes the right precautions 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.349
 d5 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.520
 and the five 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.349
 ie salary line 7 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.539
 betting on this pawn 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.439
 which now surely needs support but since it cannot be 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.599
 caught 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.599
 proceed in this way and with the pawn exchange 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.189
 and the horse 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:33.930
 buondÃ¬ 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.309
 makes i'm 5 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:38.499
 now be it 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.879
 a balanced c4 position to support 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.639
 the center 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.389
 obviously 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.389
 the horse move 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.099
 woman 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.969
 e7 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.279
 that woman of one 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.279
 we lead positions where not only two riders 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.930
 not only do I firmly defend all possible attack targets but 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.680
 they also prevent the construction of white flowers 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.680
 intrare effectively. 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.349
 c4 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.379
 it is absolutely danube 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.760
 bishop g5 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.670
 trying to get the woman in the game after a woman change c1 white 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.599
 does not fit in 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:30.509
 the fair 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.389
 f4 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.389
 and now surely 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.539
 horse for f4 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:42.460
 esselunga absolutely create dynamic propositions 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.030
 so it's a really good protection for you both player 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.860
 self 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:56.889
 driver
