00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.250
 Woofer doctor 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.730
 there were 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.289
 Hello everyone now is 3 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:26.899
 Today's recently purchased pc microphone 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.899
 I would like to review with the Elecom stand Maipu hsmc 01 pk 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.640
 I have been recording such voices before 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:39.710
 I had a microphone itself 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:43.110
 By Mike had things such as Sony's ecm pcv 80 u 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.370
 The microphone here is good but the performance is good 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:52.980
 It was of the type that takes place when putting it 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 We record around the pc, so every time we record , 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:03.190
 It was in a difficult situation where we had to free up space 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:08.610
 Because the English stand microphone purchased this time is a type that takes up less space 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:13.250
 It does not get in the way even if you usually stay near the PC 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.620
 Previous microphones have to clean up around to record 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.680
 It was somewhat troublesome 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:24.159
 Now this voice is also newly purchased by ELECOM 's stand microphone hsmc 01 bk 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.600
 I am recording 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.600
 I think that this sound quality is enough for recording audio normally 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:39.990
 You won't need a higher quality microphone unless you sing 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:47.270
 Evaluation by amazon is also high 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:52.700
 So you can buy in to say the line that it is true IF good quality cheap I think 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:59.350
 If you are thinking of purchasing a mic for dc, please consider 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.350
