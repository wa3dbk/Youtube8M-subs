00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.440
 Hello my name is Alexei hamsters 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.200
 Today we are in a photo studio 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.809
 we have 11 very to the light with which we 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.320
 try to do some different 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.289
 shooting options you'll see see 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.439
 like using a single drawing source 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.689
 lighting make several choices 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.130
 beautiful photography let's get started 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.300
 Today I invited a model Svetlana 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.710
 she will help us to create 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.430
 photos to my right 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.460
 softbox 60 by 60 centimeters and he 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.190
 will help create interesting photos and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.100
 so we have one model one source 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.809
 light let's try 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.870
 photograph the first thing we have to 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.870
 do it put the light source here 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.190
 this software box at a 45 degree angle 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.829
 regarding the model 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.989
 well, it's about like this 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.960
 height by the way, too, you can put 45 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.640
 degrees to achieve optimal 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.390
 result of light and shade you pattern 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:21.070
 leave at this level and look at us 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.620
 first option when the model looks at 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.380
 camera but turned to the side 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.430
 light so we can emphasize 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.180
 and black and white drawing of the face and also 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.850
 focus on the figure if it can 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.830
 be an advertising shoot then we do 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.650
 focus on some accessories or 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.040
 just on what 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.700
 dressed our model let's try 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.190
 the next option is to ask for a model 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.870
 your shoulders turn towards the camera you 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.270
 see that the light is falling now 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.780
 not only on the face but also on the body 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.510
 so she became more prominent 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.380
 in what cases can be used for example 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:10.430
 if you are photographing bodybuilders or 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.570
 some sports people who want 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:18.880
 show shape and relief and in this way 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.410
 we can just increase it a little and 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.620
 the last last scheme we are with 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.560
 you try and if we deploy the body 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.110
 shoulders away from 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.190
 light source but ask the face also 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.800
 turn on the camera you will see that we 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.940
 done so the light only falls on 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.490
 the lateral part of the face of the body is in the shadow 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.630
 what cases can i use here 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.700
 such a turn 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.400
 for example, if you mean a particular shape 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.890
 a girl needs to be made a little slimmer or 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.030
 man so we can turn 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:03.110
 like this, our model needs to be made 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.690
 color focus on the face and body will remain 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.660
 his background is also a great idea 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.870
 so using a single light source and 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.060
 three different variations we were able to do 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.400
 several completely different photos 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.910
 that's all for today, thank you all 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.910
 is happy
