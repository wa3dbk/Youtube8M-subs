00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
wait on your coupler device is a quick

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
wait on your coupler device is a quick
and<00:00:52.379> simple<00:00:52.499> formula<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.699> need<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> do

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and simple formula what you need to do

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.989 
and simple formula what you need to do
is<00:00:54.359> figure<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.739> entire<00:00:56.100> weight<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.850> your

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
is figure out the entire weight of your

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.450 
is figure out the entire weight of your
package<00:00:57.479> rig<00:00:57.839> so<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.679> this<00:00:58.799> case<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.250> would<00:00:59.309> be

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
package rig so in this case it would be

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.349 
package rig so in this case it would be

what you're going to get that is a is a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.090 
what you're going to get that is a is a
number<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.770> pounds<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.500> need<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> compare

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
number in pounds you need to compare

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
number in pounds you need to compare
that<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.549> actual<00:01:26.700> weight<00:01:27.149> that<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> have

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that to the actual weight that you have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210 
that to the actual weight that you have
on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.929> front<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.259> your<00:01:28.319> coupling<00:01:28.709> device<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
on the front of your coupling device and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.529 
on the front of your coupling device and
what<00:01:29.340> I've<00:01:29.429> done<00:01:29.580> here<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.970> I've<00:01:30.090> used<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.330> a

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
what I've done here is I've used just a

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.960 
what I've done here is I've used just a
regular<00:01:30.899> bathroom<00:01:31.289> scale<00:01:31.740> set<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.640> actual

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
regular bathroom scale set at the actual

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.090 
regular bathroom scale set at the actual
heights<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.049> would<00:01:34.350> pull<00:01:34.679> this<00:01:34.830> right

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
heights that I would pull this right

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.620 
heights that I would pull this right
down<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.459> road<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.390> give<00:01:36.509> me<00:01:36.539> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
down the road this would give me a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
down the road this would give me a
number<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> number<00:01:37.830> in<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.280> formula

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
number if the number in my formula

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
number if the number in my formula
matches<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.899> in<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.080> five<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.619> seven<00:01:40.979> percent

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
matches or is in a five to seven percent

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300 
matches or is in a five to seven percent
ratio<00:01:41.640> range<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.539> this<00:01:43.170> number<00:01:43.440> everything's
