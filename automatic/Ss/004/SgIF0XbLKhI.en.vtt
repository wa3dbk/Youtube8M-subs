00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
like I do even though it is work and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
like I do even though it is work and
you're<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.600> getting<00:01:42.869> paid<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.649> choice

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you're not getting paid it's a choice

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.679 
you're not getting paid it's a choice
consequently<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.600> an

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
consequently it's more like to be an

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.380 
consequently it's more like to be an
indentured<00:01:46.290> servant<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.189> maybe<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.180> should

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
indentured servant so maybe we should

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
indentured servant so maybe we should
say<00:01:48.570> let's<00:01:49.140> go<00:01:49.259> indentured<00:01:50.070> servant<00:01:50.490> out

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
say let's go indentured servant out

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.850 
say let's go indentured servant out
unless<00:01:51.000> you're<00:01:51.630> inside<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.409> let's<00:01:52.680> go

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
unless you're inside then let's go

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
unless you're inside then let's go
indentured<00:01:53.340> servant<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.689> long

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
indentured servant in but it's so long

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.350 
indentured servant in but it's so long
and<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.619> takes<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.100> much<00:01:56.250> effort<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:57.210> it's

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and it takes so much effort that it's

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
and it takes so much effort that it's
really<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.840> work<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.590> let's<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.920> call<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
really like work so let's just call it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.370 
really like work so let's just call it
work<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.000> unless<00:02:00.329> you're<00:02:00.750> inside<00:02:01.110> then

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
work it out unless you're inside then

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350 
work it out unless you're inside then
we'll<00:02:01.500> say<00:02:01.710> let's<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.460> work<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> if

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
we'll say let's go work it in and if

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 
we'll say let's go work it in and if
your<00:02:03.479> hands<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.840> cold<00:02:04.079> let's<00:02:04.680> use<00:02:04.920> mittens
