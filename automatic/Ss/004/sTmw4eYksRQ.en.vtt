are the anti bronies they are the fun
away<00:02:06.540> takers<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.129> thought<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.270> was<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
away takers and I thought it was a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.040 
away takers and I thought it was a
pretty<00:02:09.929> funny<00:02:10.319> idea<00:02:10.800> because<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:12.420> idea<00:02:12.599> was

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
pretty funny idea because the idea was

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.550 
pretty funny idea because the idea was
so<00:02:13.230> absurd<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.430> liked<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.629> then<00:02:16.319> I

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so absurd that I liked it but then I

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.780 
so absurd that I liked it but then I
started<00:02:16.920> using

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
started using

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.360 
started using
as<00:02:18.060> an<00:02:18.689> actual<00:02:18.930> phrase<00:02:19.530> whenever<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.189> want

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
as an actual phrase whenever they want

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.080 
everybody I'm this guy and then I come
around<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.389> use<00:04:25.139> a<00:04:25.169> term<00:04:25.710> like<00:04:25.740> soccer<00:04:26.370> mom<00:04:26.700> as

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
around and use a term like soccer mom as

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.260 
around and use a term like soccer mom as
a<00:04:27.150> regular<00:04:28.020> term<00:04:28.440> and

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
a regular term and

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.590 
a regular term and
this<00:04:30.020> is<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:32.110> ultimately<00:04:34.330> generalizing<00:04:35.330> and

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
this is so ultimately generalizing and

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.870 
this is so ultimately generalizing and
so<00:04:35.990> ignorant<00:04:36.530> toward<00:04:36.890> soccer<00:04:37.460> moms<00:04:37.730> because

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
that I kind of took the joke so far that

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.520

conclusion<00:05:58.550> i<00:05:58.910> don't<00:05:59.300> say<00:05:59.600> you<00:05:59.660> always<00:06:00.080> have

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
conclusion i don't say you always have

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.980 
conclusion i don't say you always have
to<00:06:00.860> be<00:06:01.010> hundred<00:06:01.400> percent<00:06:01.760> political<00:06:02.570> correct

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
to be hundred percent political correct

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.250 
to be hundred percent political correct
because<00:06:03.290> this<00:06:03.890> is<00:06:04.160> what<00:06:04.520> the<00:06:05.240> soccer<00:06:05.900> moms

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
because this is what the soccer moms

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.690 
because this is what the soccer moms
always<00:06:06.710> do<00:06:07.610> when<00:06:08.600> you<00:06:08.870> start<00:06:09.710> using<00:06:10.010> in<00:06:10.430> such<00:06:10.670> a

always do when you start using in such a

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.520 
always do when you start using in such a
term<00:06:10.970> on<00:06:11.210> a<00:06:11.240> regular<00:06:11.510> basis<00:06:12.080> you<00:06:12.200> kind<00:06:12.470> of

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
term on a regular basis you kind of

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.050 
term on a regular basis you kind of

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.690 
forget it sooner or later and you start
using<00:06:14.270> it<00:06:14.510> in<00:06:14.690> a<00:06:14.780> serious<00:06:15.320> context<00:06:15.980> this<00:06:16.400> is<00:06:16.670> a

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
using it in a serious context this is a

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.300 
using it in a serious context this is a
point<00:06:17.060> where<00:06:17.480> it<00:06:17.570> is<00:06:17.660> not<00:06:17.870> still<00:06:18.740> a<00:06:18.770> little<00:06:19.100> bit

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
point where it is not still a little bit

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.360 
point where it is not still a little bit
of<00:06:19.520> teasing<00:06:19.880> humor<00:06:20.450> but<00:06:20.690> it<00:06:21.050> became<00:06:21.470> kind<00:06:22.070> of

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
of teasing humor but it became kind of

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.010 
of teasing humor but it became kind of
this<00:06:23.300> way<00:06:23.540> of<00:06:23.720> stigmatization<00:06:24.080> we<00:06:24.980> as<00:06:26.020> bronies

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
this way of stigmatization we as bronies

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.620 
this way of stigmatization we as bronies

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
should really be more aware of because

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.380 
should really be more aware of because
we<00:06:30.470> had<00:06:30.650> to<00:06:30.800> deal<00:06:31.040> with<00:06:31.070> it<00:06:31.370> so<00:06:31.400> much<00:06:31.670> and<00:06:31.910> now
