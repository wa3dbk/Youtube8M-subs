00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.849 
is the twin pod clamp car pilot
admittedly<00:00:16.109> not<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> most

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
admittedly not one of the most

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
admittedly not one of the most
interesting<00:00:17.220> characters<00:00:17.580> from<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> wave<00:00:18.270> but

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
interesting characters from the wave but

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.529 
interesting characters from the wave but
certainly<00:00:18.930> not<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> worst<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.180> it<00:00:21.180> makes<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
certainly not the worst and it makes a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.300 
certainly not the worst and it makes a
decent<00:00:21.660> addition<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.830> collection

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
decent addition to the collection

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.000 
decent addition to the collection
especially<00:00:23.519> considering<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:25.350> hasbro<00:00:25.740> just

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010

especially considering the hasbro just
released<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.960> cloud<00:00:27.960> car<00:00:28.730> in<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> new<00:00:30.029> vintage

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.870 
and this figure is a cool one to get as
well<00:02:05.870> he's<00:02:06.870> got<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.080> very<00:02:07.230> nice<00:02:07.440> sculpt<00:02:08.040> and<00:02:08.310> I'm

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
well he's got a very nice sculpt and I'm

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.730 
well he's got a very nice sculpt and I'm
not<00:02:09.030> too<00:02:09.180> keen<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.660> way<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.290> helmet

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
not too keen on the way that the helmet

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.500 
not too keen on the way that the helmet
overhangs<00:02:11.370> at<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> back<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.240> looks

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
overhangs at the back I think that looks

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.470 
overhangs at the back I think that looks
a<00:02:12.630> little<00:02:12.750> bit<00:02:13.020> out<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.260> place<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:15.030> helmet<00:02:15.390> is

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
a little bit out of place the helmet is

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.500 
a little bit out of place the helmet is
removable<00:02:18.710> he's<00:02:19.710> got<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> decent<00:02:20.130> head<00:02:21.060> sculpt

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
removable he's got a decent head sculpt

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.400 
removable he's got a decent head sculpt
underneath<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:26.600> know<00:02:27.600> quite<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.960> few<00:02:28.050> people

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
underneath I know quite a few people

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.200 
underneath I know quite a few people
actually<00:02:28.740> gonna<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.370> skipping<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.880> figure

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
actually gonna be skipping this figure

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.450 
actually gonna be skipping this figure
because<00:02:30.540> they've<00:02:30.720> said<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:32.250> core

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
because they've said that the the core

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.670 
because they've said that the the core
scheme<00:02:32.790> looks<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.090> little<00:02:33.210> bit<00:02:33.420> silly<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.080> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
scheme looks a little bit silly and I

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.170

an<00:03:16.500> expanded<00:03:16.980> universe<00:03:17.190> figure<00:03:17.730> because<00:03:18.030> it's

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
an expanded universe figure because it's

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.650 
an expanded universe figure because it's
not<00:03:18.480> entirely<00:03:19.080> accurate<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.760> car<00:03:21.420> car

the cloud car pilots and the ones that
we<00:03:30.690> actually<00:03:30.780> see<00:03:31.080> on<00:03:31.200> screen<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.739> it's<00:03:31.890> like<00:03:32.010> a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
we actually see on screen so it's like a

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.170 
we actually see on screen so it's like a
hybrid<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:33.680> movie<00:03:34.680> prop<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.190> concept<00:03:36.030> art

hybrid of movie prop and concept art

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.140 
hybrid of movie prop and concept art
which<00:03:36.630> is<00:03:36.780> pretty<00:03:36.989> interesting<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:38.150> overall

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
which is pretty interesting and overall

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.390 
which is pretty interesting and overall
he's<00:03:39.480> decent<00:03:39.750> figure<00:03:40.200> really<00:03:41.010> like<00:03:41.190> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
he's decent figure really like the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.390 
he's decent figure really like the
sculpt<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:43.470> never<00:03:43.620> know<00:03:43.800> if<00:03:43.950> some<00:03:44.160> point

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
sculpt and you never know if some point

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.040 
sculpt and you never know if some point
I<00:03:44.550> may<00:03:44.760> decide<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.180> pick<00:03:45.330> up<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.540> cloud<00:03:45.750> car

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
I may decide to pick up the cloud car

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.280 
I may decide to pick up the cloud car
and<00:03:46.650> get<00:03:46.920> another<00:03:47.070> one<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.280> these<00:03:47.400> guys<00:03:47.640> and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
and get another one of these guys and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:58.280 
and get another one of these guys and
stick<00:03:49.290> them<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.530> there
