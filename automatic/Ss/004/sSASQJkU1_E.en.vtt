pedal it's a tiny little package all
kinds<00:00:38.260> of<00:00:38.320> tone<00:00:38.530> packed<00:00:38.890> into<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:39.910> let<00:00:40.000> me

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
kinds of tone packed into it and let me

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.910 
kinds of tone packed into it and let me
just<00:00:40.210> show<00:00:40.360> you<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.510> pedal<00:00:40.809> here<00:00:41.050> if<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.739> can

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
just show you the pedal here if I can

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.250 
just show you the pedal here if I can
figure<00:00:42.129> out<00:00:42.250> ah<00:00:43.950> yes<00:00:44.950> here<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.370> is<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:47.110> it<00:00:47.200> is

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
figure out ah yes here it is here it is

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.380 
figure out ah yes here it is here it is
guys<00:00:47.530> this<00:00:47.800> is<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.100> man<00:00:48.280> this<00:00:48.460> little<00:00:48.699> tiny<00:00:49.120> guy

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
guys this is it man this little tiny guy

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.610 
guys this is it man this little tiny guy
I<00:00:49.660> mean<00:00:49.809> compare<00:00:50.050> that<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.379> fret<00:00:50.590> board

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
I mean compare that to the fret board

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.820 
I mean compare that to the fret board
this<00:00:51.580> provides<00:00:52.480> all<00:00:52.809> that<00:00:52.840> power<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.559> tone<00:00:53.800> and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
this provides all that power in tone and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.400 
this provides all that power in tone and
metal<00:00:54.489> so<00:00:54.670> this<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.690> hot<00:00:55.809> tone<00:00:56.019> whip<00:00:56.230> the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
metal so this is the hot tone whip the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.350 
metal so this is the hot tone whip the
hot<00:00:56.559> tone<00:00:56.739> makes<00:00:56.949> all<00:00:57.100> kinds<00:00:57.129> of<00:00:57.610> petals<00:00:58.180> like

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
hot tone makes all kinds of petals like

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.619 
hot tone makes all kinds of petals like
delay<00:00:58.629> chorus<00:00:59.170> Flanders<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.210> name<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.510> they

all<00:02:23.470> right<00:02:23.590> let's<00:02:23.710> move<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.950> up<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.040> 25%

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.550 

let's<00:02:39.980> go<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.129> 50%<00:02:40.580> you'll<00:02:40.940> notice<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.560> large

let's go to 50% you'll notice a large

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.229 
let's go to 50% you'll notice a large
volume<00:02:42.980> boost<00:02:43.250> here<00:02:43.400> once<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:43.670> go<00:02:43.790> up<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:43.970> 50%

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
volume boost here once we go up to 50%

00:02:44.239 --> 00:03:01.030 
volume boost here once we go up to 50%
on<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:44.750> tone

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:21.490 

all<00:03:02.040> right<00:03:02.190> 75

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
all right so that is the tone knob let's

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.940 
all right so that is the tone knob let's
go<00:03:45.230> ahead<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:47.200> let's<00:03:48.200> drop<00:03:48.349> that<00:03:48.410> down<00:03:48.739> back

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
go ahead and let's drop that down back

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.800 
go ahead and let's drop that down back
to<00:03:48.980> 50%<00:03:49.310> let's<00:03:50.120> take<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.300> look<00:03:50.480> at<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.629> game

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
to 50% let's take a look at the game
