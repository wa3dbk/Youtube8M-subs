MELISSA MCCARTHY:
Hi, I'm Melissa.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.445
ELMO: Oh, and Elmo's Elmo.

00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:06.660
MELISSA MCCARTHY: And today we
are going to tell you all

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.690
about a dance word.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.416
ELMO: Oh boy, oh boy!

00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:10.030
Elmo loves dance words.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.250
Because Elmo loves to dance!

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.715
MELISSA MCCARTHY: I love
to dance too, Elmo!

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.940
Yeah, I love to shake
my dancing arms.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.670
I love to shake my
dancing legs.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.450
I love to shake my dancing--

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.824
ELMO: [GIGGLES]

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:23.525
MELISSA MCCARTHY: Elmo?

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:24.595
Why aren't you dancing?

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:28.150
ELMO: Oh, because Elmo and
Miss Melissa have to tell

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.356
everyone today's word.

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:30.560
MELISSA MCCARTHY: Oh,
that's right.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.180
I almost forgot.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.680
Let's tell them the word.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.170
ELMO: OK.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.640
Today's word is--

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.855
ELMO AND MELISSA:
Choreographer.

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:38.430
MELISSA MCCARTHY: Now a
choreographer is someone who

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640
puts together a dance or
makes up dance moves.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.460
I just wish that there was a
choreographer around who could

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.212
make up a dance for us to do.

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:49.665
ELMO: Well, Elmo can get
a choreographer.

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:50.635
MELISSA MCCARTHY: What?

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:52.630
ELMO: Elmo said he can
get a choreographer.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.260
MELISSA MCCARTHY:
Well, get out!

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.495
ELMO: Yeah, it's true!

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:57.990
MELISSA MCCARTHY: You mean to
tell me that you can get

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.240
someone here who makes
up dance moves?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.558
ELMO: Yeah, baby.

00:01:02.558 --> 00:01:03.770
A choreographer!

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.687
[GIGGLES]

00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:06.635
MELISSA MCCARTHY: Well, what
are you waiting for?

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:07.122
ELMO: Oh OK.

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:08.100
MELISSA MCCARTHY: Go get
the choreographer!

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.680
ELMO: OK, Elmo be right back!

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.150
MELISSA MCCARTHY: Oh my gosh!

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.130
I mean, this is so exciting!

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.460
We're gonna get to work with
a choreographer, a real

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.220
choreographer.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280
I wonder what kind of
dance moves the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.270
choreographer will make up?

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.580
Maybe it'll be tap.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.530
Jazz.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.870
Ballet.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.690
I don't know.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.527
It's just really exciting!

00:01:25.527 --> 00:01:26.421
ELMO: Oh ho ho!

00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:27.315
Here's the choreographer.

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:29.090
MELISSA MCCARTHY:
Oh wow, where?

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.590
Where where where?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.570
ELMO: Here.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.820
Here.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.538
MELISSA MCCARTHY: [WHISPERS]

00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:36.022
Elmo?

00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:36.506
ELMO: Huh?

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:38.442
MELISSA MCCARTHY: Elmo,
that's a penguin.

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:42.360
ELMO: A penguin who loves
to make up dance moves!

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.344
PENGUIN: Oh yes, I'm a very
good choreographer!

00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:50.130

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.627
PENGUIN: I call this move the
flapawaddle boom boom, and it

00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:55.150

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.585

00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:58.500
Flapawaddle boom, flapawaddle

ELMO: Oh, Elmo want to do that
flapawaddle boom boom too.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.350
ELMO AND PENGUIN: Flapawaddle
boom, flapawaddle boom boom.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.158

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:10.094
Do the flapawaddle boom boom!

00:02:10.094 --> 00:02:11.460

ABBY: Did it work?

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:47.126
ELMO: No, Elmo doesn't
have a splatter.

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:49.230
ABBY: Oh, I better try again.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.030
KRISTEN BELL: No, I don't
think you should--

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.410
ELMO: Oh, don't worry,
Kristen.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.110

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.150
I just should have reinforced
my shoe.
