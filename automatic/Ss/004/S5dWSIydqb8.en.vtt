00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
hi how you doing Justin here welcome to

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.760 
hi how you doing Justin here welcome to
minor<00:00:08.220> chord<00:00:08.820> scale<00:00:09.090> relations<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.620> this

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 
minor chord scale relations and in this

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.290 
minor chord scale relations and in this
lesson<00:00:11.010> we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.520> to<00:00:11.610> be<00:00:11.700> looking<00:00:11.970> at<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
lesson we're going to be looking at the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.170 
lesson we're going to be looking at the
relationship<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.410> C<00:00:13.650> major<00:00:13.980> scale<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
relationship of the C major scale to the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.470 
relationship of the C major scale to the
chords<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.809> minor<00:00:16.410> E<00:00:16.710> minor<00:00:17.370> and<00:00:17.610> D<00:00:18.030> minor<00:00:18.300> which

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
chords a minor E minor and D minor which

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.530 
chords a minor E minor and D minor which
are<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> three<00:00:18.990> chords<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> key<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.860> C

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
are the three chords in the key of C

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.670 
are the three chords in the key of C
we're<00:00:21.540> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.750> look<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.140> exactly<00:00:22.530> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
we're going to look at it exactly the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.770 
we're going to look at it exactly the
same<00:00:22.710> way<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.370> we<00:00:23.700> looked<00:00:23.940> at<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.390> major

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
same way as we looked at the major

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.020 
same way as we looked at the major
chords<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> C<00:00:25.860> major<00:00:26.040> scale<00:00:26.190> so<00:00:26.850> let's

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
chords and the C major scale so let's

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.370 
chords and the C major scale so let's
get<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> close-up<00:00:27.600> and<00:00:27.870> check<00:00:27.930> out<00:00:28.170> how<00:00:28.320> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
get to a close-up and check out how to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.250 
get to a close-up and check out how to
do<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.180> very<00:00:30.510> quickly<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:31.200> going

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
do this so just very quickly we're going

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.619 
do this so just very quickly we're going
to<00:00:31.440> revise<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.830> C<00:00:32.340> major<00:00:32.579> scale<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.450> have

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
to revise the C major scale so we have

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:41.060 
to revise the C major scale so we have
this<00:00:33.809> G<00:00:34.559> f<00:00:34.890> e<00:00:35.480> d<00:00:36.480> c<00:00:36.510> b<00:00:37.339> a<00:00:38.339> g<00:00:39.559> m-e

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
this G f e d c b a g m-e

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.260 
this G f e d c b a g m-e
d<00:00:41.820> c<00:00:42.690> b<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:43.679> g<00:00:44.570> F<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.109> E

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.640 

so<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.810> chords<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.170> we're<00:00:52.350> looking<00:00:52.440> at

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
so the chords that we're looking at

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.930 
so the chords that we're looking at
today<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> first<00:00:53.220> one<00:00:53.310> is<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.640> minor

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
today the first one is a minor

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.970 
today the first one is a minor
and<00:00:56.030> we're<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:56.930> looking<00:00:57.140> at<00:00:57.440> how<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.680> play

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
and we're now looking at how to play

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.979 
and we're now looking at how to play
that<00:00:58.250> scale<00:00:58.609> kind<00:00:58.969> of<00:00:59.059> based<00:00:59.269> around<00:00:59.600> our<00:00:59.840> a

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
that scale kind of based around our a

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.459 
that scale kind of based around our a
minor<00:01:00.260> chord<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:00.649> we<00:01:00.890> have<00:01:01.039> here<00:01:01.510> G<00:01:02.510> just<00:01:03.320> with

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
minor chord so we have here G just with

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.490 
minor chord so we have here G just with
a<00:01:03.500> little<00:01:03.649> finger<00:01:03.949> nice<00:01:04.190> easy<00:01:04.430> one<00:01:05.200> to<00:01:06.200> get<00:01:06.320> the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
a little finger nice easy one to get the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.850 
a little finger nice easy one to get the
F<00:01:06.740> note<00:01:07.070> our<00:01:07.790> first<00:01:08.090> finger<00:01:08.360> has<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.320> just<00:01:09.680> lie

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
F note our first finger has to just lie

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.980 
F note our first finger has to just lie
over<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.930> then<00:01:11.930> back<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.590> normal<00:01:12.950> for<00:01:13.549> re<00:01:13.940> none

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.730 

on<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:19.159> second<00:01:19.580> string<00:01:20.320> little<00:01:21.320> finger<00:01:21.590> just

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
note B next string we just play the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.499 
note B next string we just play the
regular<00:01:37.759> note<00:01:37.970> for<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.300> lift<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.289> off<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.560> G<00:01:43.509> now

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
regular note for a lift it off the G now

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.359 
regular note for a lift it off the G now
we<00:01:44.780> don't<00:01:44.960> tend<00:01:45.319> to<00:01:45.380> use<00:01:45.470> these<00:01:45.800> other<00:01:46.009> ones<00:01:46.220> as

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
we don't tend to use these other ones as

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.410 
we don't tend to use these other ones as
much<00:01:46.550> but<00:01:46.819> we've<00:01:46.940> also<00:01:47.119> got<00:01:47.300> em<00:01:47.840> e<00:01:48.140> D<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:50.210> can't

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
much but we've also got em e D we can't

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.760 
much but we've also got em e D we can't
really<00:01:50.539> play<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.960> C<00:01:51.170> there<00:01:51.409> because<00:01:51.649> it

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
really play the C there because it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.420 
really play the C there because it
interrupts<00:01:52.190> with<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.429> root<00:01:52.759> note<00:01:52.940> so

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.490 

that's<00:01:58.430> generally<00:01:59.150> all<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.870> ones<00:02:00.050> we<00:02:00.260> play

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
that's generally all of the ones we play

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.340 
that's generally all of the ones we play
we<00:02:00.680> don't<00:02:00.890> tend<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.280> play<00:02:01.520> those<00:02:02.230> well<00:02:03.230> that's

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
we don't tend to play those well that's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.140 
we don't tend to play those well that's
worth<00:02:03.590> noticing<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.670> might<00:02:04.820> want<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.000> do<00:02:05.120> a

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
worth noticing you might want to do a

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.479 
worth noticing you might want to do a
little<00:02:05.390> rundown<00:02:05.510> like<00:02:05.870> that<00:02:06.020> sometime

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.280 

sounds<00:02:09.090> kinda<00:02:09.359> funky

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:26.869 

just<00:02:15.189> explore<00:02:15.640> just<00:02:15.879> like<00:02:16.090> I'm<00:02:16.239> doing<00:02:16.480> now

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.910 

and<00:02:27.269> see<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.749> way<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.170> scale<00:02:28.499> and<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.890> a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
and see the way that the scale and the a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.759 
and see the way that the scale and the a
minor<00:02:29.370> chord<00:02:29.640> kind<00:02:29.999> of<00:02:30.150> locked<00:02:30.299> together<00:02:30.769> so

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
minor chord kind of locked together so

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.440 
minor chord kind of locked together so
the<00:02:31.920> second<00:02:32.310> chord<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.849> we're<00:02:33.030> looking<00:02:33.329> at

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the second chord that we're looking at

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.250 
the second chord that we're looking at
today<00:02:33.719> is<00:02:33.749> a<00:02:34.079> minor

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
today is a minor

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.530 
today is a minor
now<00:02:36.860> generally<00:02:37.459> for<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.849> particular<00:02:38.180> one

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
now generally for this particular one

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.180 
now generally for this particular one
you<00:02:38.720> want<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:38.989> be<00:02:39.080> using<00:02:39.290> your<00:02:39.560> second<00:02:40.069> and

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
you want to be using your second and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.339 
you want to be using your second and
third<00:02:40.400> fingers<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:41.030> there's<00:02:41.239> other<00:02:41.780> options

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
third fingers but there's other options

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.990 
third fingers but there's other options
as<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.620> know<00:02:42.769> with<00:02:42.950> E<00:02:43.160> minor<00:02:43.430> chord<00:02:43.519> you<00:02:43.849> can

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
as you know with E minor chord you can

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.449 
as you know with E minor chord you can
play<00:02:44.209> with<00:02:44.450> any<00:02:44.629> two<00:02:45.620> kind<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.099> consecutive

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
play with any two kind of consecutive

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.979 
play with any two kind of consecutive
fingers<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.150> you're<00:02:47.239> going<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.420> be<00:02:47.540> fine

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
fingers and you're going to be fine

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:59.080 
fingers and you're going to be fine
but<00:02:48.349> because<00:02:48.680> our<00:02:48.800> melody<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:56.500> based<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:58.090> it

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
but because our melody is based here it

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.460 
but because our melody is based here it
makes<00:02:59.360> sense<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.780> use<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.080> middle<00:03:00.319> two

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
makes sense to use the middle two

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.830 
makes sense to use the middle two
fingers<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:01.970> course<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.269> level<00:03:02.510> finger

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
fingers so of course the level finger

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.130 
fingers so of course the level finger
first<00:03:03.560> finger<00:03:03.799> open<00:03:04.360> little<00:03:05.360> finger<00:03:05.690> first

don't<00:03:21.049> tend<00:03:21.349> to<00:03:21.670> although<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:22.880> course<00:03:22.940> just

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
don't tend to although of course just

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:46.080 
don't tend to although of course just
like<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.900> minor

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.400 

just<00:03:47.090> have<00:03:47.300> a<00:03:47.330> bit<00:03:47.599> of<00:03:47.629> an<00:03:47.780> experiment<00:03:48.110> that's

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
just have a bit of an experiment that's

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.320 
just have a bit of an experiment that's
all<00:03:48.680> I'm<00:03:49.010> asking<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.640> do<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.120> play

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
all I'm asking you to do is to play

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.040 
all I'm asking you to do is to play
around<00:03:50.599> with<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.959> relationship<00:03:53.050> between

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
around with the relationship between

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.559 
around with the relationship between
this<00:03:54.650> scale<00:03:55.599> and<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.830> chord<00:03:58.099> of<00:03:58.280> E<00:03:58.370> minor<00:03:58.580> now

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
this scale and the chord of E minor now

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.070 
this scale and the chord of E minor now
there's<00:03:59.750> one<00:03:59.959> more<00:03:59.989> minor<00:04:00.440> chord<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.860> look<00:04:01.010> at

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
there's one more minor chord to look at

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.809 
there's one more minor chord to look at
to<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.170> D<00:04:03.380> minor<00:04:03.680> now<00:04:03.920> D<00:04:04.130> minor<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.580> open

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
to the D minor now D minor in open

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.160 
to the D minor now D minor in open
position<00:04:04.910> with<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:05.390> C<00:04:05.540> major<00:04:05.720> scales<00:04:06.080> a

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
position with the C major scales a

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.690 
position with the C major scales a
little<00:04:06.380> bit<00:04:06.500> awkward<00:04:06.620> because<00:04:06.980> it's<00:04:07.550> only

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
little bit awkward because it's only

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.250 
little bit awkward because it's only
using<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.150> thinnest<00:04:08.450> four<00:04:08.630> strings<00:04:08.930> anyway

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
using the thinnest four strings anyway

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
using the thinnest four strings anyway
so<00:04:10.250> we<00:04:10.400> can<00:04:10.550> get<00:04:13.239> we've<00:04:14.239> got<00:04:14.390> that<00:04:14.540> much

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.650 

but<00:04:19.280> we<00:04:19.430> don't<00:04:19.670> tend<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.060> use<00:04:21.790> because<00:04:22.790> the

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
but we don't tend to use because the

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.320 
but we don't tend to use because the
user<00:04:24.170> has<00:04:24.950> to<00:04:25.070> require<00:04:25.400> some<00:04:25.670> kind<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.940> pretty

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
user has to require some kind of pretty

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.850 
user has to require some kind of pretty
weird<00:04:26.600> stretching<00:04:27.080> things<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.440> get<00:04:27.530> there<00:04:27.710> so

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
weird stretching things to get there so

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.490 
weird stretching things to get there so
generally<00:04:28.610> you'd<00:04:29.210> want<00:04:29.420> to<00:04:29.480> do<00:04:29.600> D<00:04:29.870> minor<00:04:30.140> using

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
generally you'd want to do D minor using

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.710 
generally you'd want to do D minor using
your<00:04:30.620> first<00:04:30.770> second<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.190> third<00:04:31.430> fingers

be able to attend to avoid this call

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:01.529 
be able to attend to avoid this call
because<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.759> unless<00:05:00.759> I'm<00:05:00.969> just<00:05:01.179> doing<00:05:01.419> those

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
because it unless I'm just doing those

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:08.190 
because it unless I'm just doing those
kind<00:05:01.839> of<00:05:01.929> simple

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.860 

this<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.370> know<00:05:09.490> there's<00:05:09.940> different<00:05:10.420> ways<00:05:10.690> of

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
this you know there's different ways of

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.260 
this you know there's different ways of
playing<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.170> melodies<00:05:11.620> there<00:05:11.830> but<00:05:12.270> there's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
playing the melodies there but there's

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.170 
playing the melodies there but there's
not<00:05:13.540> that<00:05:14.440> many<00:05:14.650> as<00:05:14.890> there<00:05:15.040> are<00:05:15.220> for<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.880> other

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
not that many as there are for the other

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.560 
not that many as there are for the other
chords<00:05:17.520> then<00:05:18.520> we<00:05:18.700> have<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.060> chord<00:05:19.360> scale

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
chords then we have the chord scale

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.050 
chords then we have the chord scale
relationships<00:05:20.440> between<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:21.250> C<00:05:21.580> major<00:05:21.820> scale

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
relationships between the C major scale

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.680 
relationships between the C major scale
are<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:22.900> minor<00:05:23.290> E<00:05:23.560> minor<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:24.190> D<00:05:24.970> minor<00:05:25.240> chords

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
are a minor E minor and D minor chords

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.840 
are a minor E minor and D minor chords
like<00:05:26.410> I've<00:05:26.650> mentioned<00:05:26.980> before<00:05:27.010> really<00:05:27.640> what<00:05:27.820> I

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
like I've mentioned before really what I

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.460 
like I've mentioned before really what I
want<00:05:28.090> you<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.210> do<00:05:28.420> is<00:05:28.540> just<00:05:28.570> experiment<00:05:29.440> a

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
want you to do is just experiment a

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.020 
want you to do is just experiment a
little<00:05:29.560> bit<00:05:29.770> see<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.250> way<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.670> scale

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
little bit see the way that the scale

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.930 
little bit see the way that the scale
fits<00:05:31.810> with<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.710> chord<00:05:33.010> shapes<00:05:33.340> that's<00:05:33.610> really

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
fits with the chord shapes that's really

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.700 
fits with the chord shapes that's really
important<00:05:34.420> to<00:05:34.510> be<00:05:34.630> able<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:34.960> understand<00:05:35.530> this

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
important to be able to understand this

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.580 
important to be able to understand this
idea<00:05:35.920> there's<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.730> lot<00:05:37.480> a<00:05:37.510> lot<00:05:38.050> of<00:05:38.200> ground<00:05:38.470> that

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
idea there's a lot a lot of ground that

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.070 
idea there's a lot a lot of ground that
this<00:05:38.830> covers<00:05:39.190> when<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.490> understand<00:05:40.090> the<00:05:40.780> the

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
this covers when you understand the the

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.780 
this covers when you understand the the
relationship<00:05:41.350> between<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.250> chords<00:05:42.610> and<00:05:42.730> the

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
relationship between the chords and the

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.040 
relationship between the chords and the
scales<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.360> way<00:05:43.480> you<00:05:43.540> can<00:05:43.780> put<00:05:43.960> it

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
scales and the way you can put it

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.600 
scales and the way you can put it
together<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.860> get<00:05:45.040> all<00:05:45.190> sorts<00:05:45.550> of

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
together you get all sorts of

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.980 
together you get all sorts of
interesting<00:05:45.940> chords<00:05:46.510> you<00:05:46.570> get<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.810> ability

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
interesting chords you get the ability

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.690 
interesting chords you get the ability
to<00:05:47.260> play<00:05:47.500> melody<00:05:47.980> there's<00:05:48.160> all<00:05:48.280> sorts<00:05:48.640> of
