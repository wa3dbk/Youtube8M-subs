00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.709
 in impact open play basically with children then 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.199
 like all games and very engaging 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.949
 the children do it with great enthusiasm when he pointed to children we go to do 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.099
 marmalade 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.099
 aran are very happy with this is the hand willingly 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.159
 the gardens or proposed are our cellars as 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.759
 and and I must say 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.569
 I am very tired our very colorful cellars. joyous 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.120
 and u do very willingly I must also say those children who are struggling a 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.720
 little logical mathematical activities 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.330
 and are involved by the narni play group and then face it with a bow 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
 positivity in short 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.220
 because surely you deepen all that logical mathematical discourse 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.519
 therefore for example the daily fact to preserve the characteristics 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.329
 and this item uses the woolen socks you think there is hehe 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.530
 uhm then help cook what memory 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.039
 not just mathematical and logical photo speech e 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.760
 and then one 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.780
 one thing and I see transversal games I faced 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.010
 heheh 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.260
 in the relationship between children that is 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.680
 the relationship that is created between them is not a competitive relationship like 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.470
 I can save 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.930
 in normal play 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.509
 but there is a role-playing work of respect 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.839
 sure because every child towards the other in the same room 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.000
 of palm 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.160
 so this thing I found cross and then surely it is too 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.530
 in the other games I read the manual 15 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.010
 there is always this sun 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.140
 this thing very subtle than the other 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.330
 I found it very challenging. in the sense that it provides training for the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.549
 teacher 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.109
 a Milan job with children 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.169
 and within which there are meetings with 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:20.159
 all okay you're there 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.700
 so when i had to decide i thought well i know it's a 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.039
 beautiful laboratory 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.689
 substantial 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.400
 but I found it a lot 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.759
 careful 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:34.359
 even the needs of the teacher are the reality of 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.619
 school 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:39.609
 so I really liked the training course in the sense that we have 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.989
 teachers tried these games before they could do them with children 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:49.519
 and I also find the monitoring activity a foundation 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.839
 in the sense that 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:54.299
 I have read the evil we come 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.619
 understood how the game works for you did well 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:02.789
 It is a misery that comes with it called me creativity with children 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:04.339
 age begins to look 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.199
 all right or 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:11.129
 it improves this aspect rather than that fundamental night 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.029
 the result then 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.029
 so I found it very very effective 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.879
 the method I don't find very well structured in the sense that 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:30.110
 and consists of various lessons and each lesson is very balanced that 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.489
 that is, it has a moment of 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.539
 you 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.839
 which takes place at the table with a certain tranquility 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.840
 and also alternate moment of movement children of this age have 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.349
 need to alternate 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.689
 these creatives then then something that I really like the omen at the end 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.099
 of the lesson 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.489
 everyone returns in a circle sitting at the table 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.039
 and you do so a little ddd on behalf of what happened to you 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.240
 liked what your difficulties were 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.660
 what you did not like and it is very nice a little this not to go over again 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.489
 also the activity 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.729
 my email to baby I also see 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.689
 the moment I propose a game and the children 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.680
 I am very keenly aware of the objectives I want to achieve 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.340
 and this 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.090
 absolutely positive for kayaks you've got 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.050
 the knowledge of where you want to get here of the brands route you have to do 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.110
 and this is fundamental because I want to say also 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.840
 normally in which the school of 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.270
 childhood that wants to is very similar to the place of the bad guys ie 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.420
 the goal is to help the child to do the logical activity memory 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.330
 math ok 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.749
 but neither do I 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:50.729
 I lose a little bit of sight the goals in which I propose the minimally 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.729
 socks monster I have very clear 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.580
 not in the game there is a very clear explanation very transparent of those who 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.930
 the objectives are the path 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.319
 so in my opinion it is 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.629
 important this evening true and the precise goals set 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.010
 and this I found in both the games that I proposed and children 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.370
 this 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.070
 and have knowledge of their abilities in short 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.620
 not a bit hesitant here - in the sense that 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.800
 eaere i started reading my manual nn i got it right 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.139
 let's see what happens 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.139
 and I saw that text 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.719
 it was a complete refurbished work 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.659
 and so now I trust more in the sense that when they read sales there will be 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.180
 a new game to play with children 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.949
 and I know that 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.840
 the objectives are well defined the activity is well structured with 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:51.849
 hey what 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.029
 for me it is the one that this laboratory works with citizens at a time 2 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:58.550
 Share 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.719
 davide the last year of school 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.539
 and so for me working the frames the binetti is a wonderful thing is the 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:06.379
 itself that 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.349
 you made the chance beyond the game of 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.309
 listen to them again 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:15.960
 to deepen the relationship from the linguistic point of view 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.480
 re this you can not always do it in the Venetian childhood school 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:27.629
 I help children express themselves 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:31.319
 queen elizabeth the damage of the difficulty also to write for example 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.760
 over the socks these socks that had baby colors for 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.630
 circulate them 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.259
 choosing the same socks told me these are the same 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.949
 they struggled to register 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.050
 while then exercising five lands they understood that there was a language 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.899
 specific to use 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:55.349
 and so now when they play that game they have acquired the language 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:59.169
 correct and therefore without great difficulty they also play - 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.899
 mtv 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.189
 another thing that I noticed that I like 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.369
 weapons 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:16.739
 they have launched the parma relazionarsi - rom 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.599
 not competitively but collaboratively 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:24.889
 and I like that. ie initially when I shampoo petit bateau on 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.159
 table the first thing they did was to 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.789
 details for dear ones to take them 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:31.680
 emilio 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.300
 I play 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.300
 eine 3m we played and understood that the pieces were available I say 

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:44.479
 that there were rules you could not touch initially so as to take the 

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:47.089
 his present describe it 

00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:49.260
 and eaten to download 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.439
 tv rights every child 

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:55.169
 therefore also very lively children who are never still 

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:58.899
 florists sitting at the table playing with these pawns 

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:03.579
 checks they had not finished were taken from this game this is one thing 

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:05.199
 I get up very surprised
