to<00:00:33.390> pull<00:00:33.600> out<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.020> because<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.500> stretchy

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.049

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
so I put a stainless-steel split ring on

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.670 
so I put a stainless-steel split ring on
the<00:00:42.149> end<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.480> transmitter<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the end of the transmitter and then I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.369 
the end of the transmitter and then I
put<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.070> hair<00:00:44.460> tie<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.629> bought<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.079> just

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
put this hair tie that I bought it just

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.250 
put this hair tie that I bought it just
a<00:00:46.950> drugstore<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.090> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:49.050> nice

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
a drugstore it's a kind of a really nice

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.229 
a drugstore it's a kind of a really nice
size<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:50.010> go<00:00:50.100> around<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> cut<00:00:50.610> strong<00:00:50.850> neck<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
size to go around a cut strong neck and

size to go around a cut strong neck and
give<00:00:51.420> enough<00:00:51.690> room<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.530> even<00:00:52.949> cast<00:00:53.280> through<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
give enough room to even cast through it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.420 
give enough room to even cast through it
it<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.270> preens<00:00:54.660> into<00:00:55.020> their<00:00:55.170> feathers<00:00:55.590> but

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it just preens into their feathers but

there's a small size and a large size
the<00:01:26.790> small<00:01:27.330> size<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.049> put<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> batteries

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the small size you put the batteries

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.969 
the small size you put the batteries
into<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.299> put<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> battery<00:01:31.140> into<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.650> one

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
into so I put the battery into this one

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.490 
into so I put the battery into this one
like<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> same<00:01:34.140> direction

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
like that and go in the same direction

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
like that and go in the same direction
I'm<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> put<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> next<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.939> top<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
I'm going to put the next one on top of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.679 
I'm going to put the next one on top of
it<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.250> basically<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it like that so now basically the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.960 
it like that so now basically the
battery<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.070> between<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.700> rubber

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
battery is are in between this rubber

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.210 
battery is are in between this rubber
band<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.899> then<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> batteries<00:01:44.189> in

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
band and then to put the batteries in

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.660 
band and then to put the batteries in
you<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.990> hold<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> transmitter<00:01:46.649> put<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
you just hold the transmitter put the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.260 
you just hold the transmitter put the
batteries<00:01:48.060> in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
batteries in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.030 
batteries in
there's<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.750> spot<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.380> goes<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.619> into

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
there's a spot that it goes right into

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.639 
there's a spot that it goes right into
it<00:01:50.340> slides<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.240> there<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:52.380> kind<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it slides right in there and you kind of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.940 
it slides right in there and you kind of
push<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.640> halfway<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
push it in so it's like halfway and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.370 
push it in so it's like halfway and
that's<00:01:55.950> transmitting<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.380> you

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that's transmitting like that and you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.469 
that's transmitting like that and you
could<00:01:58.530> actually<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> looks<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
could actually you can see it looks a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.090 
could actually you can see it looks a
little<00:02:00.570> off<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.649> band

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
little off but that's just the band

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.850 
little off but that's just the band
being<00:02:02.579> pressed<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.320> centered

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
being pressed out but it's that centered

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.590 
being pressed out but it's that centered
and<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.549> tight<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.000> there<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and that's really tight in there the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.160 
and that's really tight in there the
larger<00:02:07.020> band<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.500> made<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.580> goes<00:02:08.700> over

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
larger band is made so that it goes over

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.680 
larger band is made so that it goes over
the<00:02:10.170> whole<00:02:10.410> thing<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.039> don't<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.239> use<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the whole thing I don't really use the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.030 
the whole thing I don't really use the
large

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
large

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.039 
large
man<00:02:13.189> because<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> small<00:02:14.060> band<00:02:14.239> stays<00:02:14.780> in

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
man because the small band stays in

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.410 
man because the small band stays in
enough<00:02:15.379> for<00:02:15.650> me<00:02:15.769> with<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.549> Kestrel<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.180> not

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
enough for me with the Kestrel it's not

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.660 
enough for me with the Kestrel it's not
going<00:02:17.719> to<00:02:17.780> get<00:02:17.900> knocked<00:02:18.290> out<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:19.219> that<00:02:19.549> would

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
going to get knocked out that that would

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.569 
going to get knocked out that that would
take<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.849> lot<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.209> force<00:02:20.629> to<00:02:20.900> knock<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.349> out

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
take a lot of force to knock that out

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.580 
take a lot of force to knock that out
but<00:02:22.579> you<00:02:22.730> can<00:02:23.030> if<00:02:23.329> you<00:02:23.450> if<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.900> don't<00:02:24.079> trust<00:02:24.319> it

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
in the place and you can see she's

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.490 
in the place and you can see she's
pretty<00:03:26.280> used<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.850> she's<00:03:27.480> not<00:03:27.750> jumping

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
pretty used to it she's not jumping

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.180 
pretty used to it she's not jumping
around<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:33.230> here's<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.290> different<00:03:34.440> angle<00:03:34.800> in

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
around and here's a different angle in

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.960 
around and here's a different angle in
slow<00:03:35.940> motion

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.690 

to<00:03:40.330> take<00:03:40.540> off<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.110> transmitter<00:03:41.710> now<00:03:42.370> I'm

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
to take off the transmitter now I'm

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.460 
to take off the transmitter now I'm
going<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.030> use<00:03:43.060> these<00:03:43.510> cuticle<00:03:44.260> scissors

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
going to use these cuticle scissors

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.530 
going to use these cuticle scissors
they're<00:03:45.280> not<00:03:45.460> sharp<00:03:45.760> on<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> end<00:03:46.210> but<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
they're not sharp on the end but the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.470 
they're not sharp on the end but the
blade<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:47.050> really<00:03:47.320> sharp<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:47.950> if<00:03:48.880> she<00:03:49.090> jumps

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
blade is really sharp so if she jumps

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.430 
blade is really sharp so if she jumps
around<00:03:49.620> she's<00:03:50.620> not<00:03:50.830> going<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.070> get<00:03:51.190> poked<00:03:52.440> so

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
around she's not going to get poked so

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.420 
around she's not going to get poked so
basically<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.310> take<00:03:54.520> this<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:56.280> cut<00:03:57.280> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
basically you just take this and cut the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.920 
basically you just take this and cut the
scissors<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.620> there<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.740> go
