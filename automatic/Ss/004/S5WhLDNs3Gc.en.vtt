day I'm actually behind the house the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.110 
day I'm actually behind the house the
Sun<00:00:35.170> is<00:00:35.320> actually<00:00:35.680> out<00:00:35.770> to<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.010> west<00:00:36.250> this

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
Sun is actually out to the west this

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.650 
Sun is actually out to the west this
direction<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:39.219> coming<00:00:39.460> through<00:00:40.030> clouds<00:00:40.359> so

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
direction it's coming through clouds so

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.029 
direction it's coming through clouds so
it's<00:00:40.780> actually<00:00:40.899> kind<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.289> crappy<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:41.770> kind<00:00:41.949> of

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
it's actually kind of crappy and kind of

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.490 
it's actually kind of crappy and kind of
dark<00:00:42.250> out<00:00:42.460> but<00:00:42.730> for<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.480> 3000<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.230> should<00:00:44.379> be

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
dark out but for the 3000 it should be

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.439 
dark out but for the 3000 it should be
fine<00:00:44.770> in<00:00:45.219> fact<00:00:45.460> with<00:00:45.699> this<00:00:45.879> first<00:00:46.120> test

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
fine in fact with this first test

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.240 
fine in fact with this first test
hopefully<00:00:47.379> it's<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.530> last<00:00:47.590> chance<00:00:47.890> for<00:00:48.100> the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
hopefully it's the last chance for the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.799 
hopefully it's the last chance for the
only<00:00:48.460> time<00:00:48.670> I'm<00:00:49.000> going<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.210> give<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.420> about<00:00:49.660> a

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
only time I'm going to give it about a

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.919 
only time I'm going to give it about a
five<00:00:50.379> second<00:00:51.100> exposure<00:00:51.519> so<00:00:52.510> it's<00:00:52.660> give<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.870> a

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
five second exposure so it's give it a

00:00:52.929 --> 00:01:01.080 
five second exposure so it's give it a
try

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:13.610 

it<00:01:01.600> probably<00:01:01.930> looks<00:01:02.050> sick<00:01:02.260> as<00:01:02.410> hell

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.160 

right<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.520> chilly<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.170> I'm

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
right because it's so chilly out I'm

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
right because it's so chilly out I'm
going<00:01:16.410> to<00:01:16.470> give<00:01:16.620> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
going to give this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.500 
going to give this
what<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.659> two-minute<00:01:20.229> development

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.330 

alright<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:25.290> back<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.710> sure<00:01:25.890> that's<00:01:26.070> been<00:01:26.250> at

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
alright I'm back I'm sure that's been at

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.620 
alright I'm back I'm sure that's been at
least<00:01:26.520> two<00:01:26.730> minutes<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.120> let's<00:01:27.240> crack<00:01:27.600> this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
least two minutes so let's crack this

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.260 
least two minutes so let's crack this
part<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.410> happens

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.930 

ok

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.000 

sure<00:01:39.510> it<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.690> from<00:01:39.930> click<00:01:40.140> OK<00:01:40.440> again<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.800> was

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
sure it is from click OK again this was

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.840 
sure it is from click OK again this was
five<00:01:41.220> seconds<00:01:41.760> let's<00:01:41.940> have<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.120> look<00:01:42.300> terrific

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.010 

to<00:01:46.479> proof<00:01:46.780> looks<00:01:46.990> pretty<00:01:47.229> good

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.389 

for<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:51.250> negative<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:51.939> might<00:01:52.149> have<00:01:52.270> gone<00:01:53.399> might

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
for the negative I might have gone might

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.859 
for the negative I might have gone might
have<00:01:54.490> got<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> little<00:01:54.759> longer<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.329> may<00:01:55.570> have<00:01:55.659> gone

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
have got a little longer I may have gone

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.319 
have got a little longer I may have gone
as<00:01:56.140> much<00:01:56.380> as<00:01:56.560> 10<00:01:56.770> seconds<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:57.640> this<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.179> the

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
as much as 10 seconds so this is the

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.959 
as much as 10 seconds so this is the
proof<00:01:59.100> I'm<00:02:00.100> going<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.340> take<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> look<00:02:00.700> at<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
proof I'm going to take a look at the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:07.679 
proof I'm going to take a look at the
neg<00:02:03.240> ok<00:02:04.649> now<00:02:05.649> for<00:02:05.679> your<00:02:06.219> needs<00:02:06.579> since<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.569> like

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
neg ok now for your needs since you like

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.170 
neg ok now for your needs since you like
to<00:02:07.750> scan<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:09.750> meg<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.849> may<00:02:12.940> have<00:02:12.970> gone

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
to scan the meg I think I may have gone

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.490 
to scan the meg I think I may have gone
a<00:02:13.239> little<00:02:13.360> longer<00:02:13.569> though<00:02:13.959> there<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> lot<00:02:14.470> of

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
a little longer though there is a lot of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.259 
a little longer though there is a lot of
detail<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.129> can<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.549> camp<00:02:15.819> in<00:02:16.090> this

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
detail you can see the camp in this

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.589 
detail you can see the camp in this
camera<00:02:16.780> that's<00:02:17.080> filming<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.010> background

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
camera that's filming in the background

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:26.520 
camera that's filming in the background
losing<00:02:19.599> some<00:02:19.780> detail<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:25.530> Myra

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
losing some detail in here I think Myra

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.710 
losing some detail in here I think Myra
got<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:26.829> little<00:02:27.040> longer<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.910> exposure<00:02:28.360> may

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
got a little longer in the exposure may

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.920 
got a little longer in the exposure may
be<00:02:28.780> up<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.019> oh<00:02:32.700> right<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.910> 10<00:02:34.120> seconds<00:02:34.599> but<00:02:34.750> now

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
be up to oh right to 10 seconds but now

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.600 
be up to oh right to 10 seconds but now
that<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.319> Sun<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.530> starting<00:02:35.799> is<00:02:36.010> said<00:02:36.220> I'm

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
that the Sun is starting is said I'm

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.089 
that the Sun is starting is said I'm
losing<00:02:37.180> light<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.599> hurry<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.410> know

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
losing light in a hurry so you know

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.910 
losing light in a hurry so you know
again<00:02:39.670> half<00:02:39.970> hour<00:02:40.209> before<00:02:40.480> or<00:02:41.110> 25<00:02:41.650> minutes
