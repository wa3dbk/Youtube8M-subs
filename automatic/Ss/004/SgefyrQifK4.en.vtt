your system very important to you well

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.229 
your system very important to you well
it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.610> think<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it is because when you think about it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
it is because when you think about it
heating<00:00:39.540> air<00:00:39.719> conditioning<00:00:39.750> systems<00:00:40.620> they

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
heating air conditioning systems they

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.350 
heating air conditioning systems they
have<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.489> breaking<00:00:41.640> down<00:00:42.000> when<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
have the way of breaking down when you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.610 
have the way of breaking down when you
need<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> most<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.110> that's<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.559> really

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
need it most and that's when it's really

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.340 
need it most and that's when it's really
hot<00:00:43.860> outside<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:45.329> cold<00:00:45.600> outside<00:00:45.809> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
hot outside or really cold outside so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.869 
hot outside or really cold outside so
maintaining<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.190> system<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.730> that's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
maintaining your system what that's

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
maintaining your system what that's
going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> help<00:00:48.750> avoid<00:00:49.320> those

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
going to do is going to help avoid those

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.200 
going to do is going to help avoid those
costly<00:00:50.010> breakdowns<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.090> it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
costly breakdowns it's going to get it

costly breakdowns it's going to get it
clean<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.379> ready<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.770> okay<00:00:53.699> not

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
clean get it all ready to go okay not

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
clean get it all ready to go okay not
only<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.260> take<00:00:55.530> care<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.829> those

only is it going to take care of those

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
only is it going to take care of those
breakdowns<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> inconvenience<00:00:57.750> if

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
breakdowns but just the inconvenience if

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
breakdowns but just the inconvenience if
your<00:00:58.079> system<00:00:58.410> goes<00:00:58.590> down<00:00:58.620> when<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.730> know

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
your system goes down when it's you know

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
your system goes down when it's you know
you<00:00:59.879> got<00:01:00.030> everybody<00:01:00.270> over<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.780> fourth<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.140> July

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you got everybody over at fourth of July

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.810 
you got everybody over at fourth of July
or<00:01:01.559> things<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.280> system<00:01:02.609> goes<00:01:02.760> down

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
or things like that the system goes down

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
or things like that the system goes down
very<00:01:03.530> inconvenient<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.949> maintaining<00:01:05.339> your

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
very inconvenient so maintaining your

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
very inconvenient so maintaining your
system<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.000> prevent<00:01:06.270> those<00:01:06.479> things<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.439> also

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
system can prevent those things it also

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.980 
system can prevent those things it also
protect<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> prolong<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.420> system<00:01:09.780> life

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
protect and prolong the system life

couple years of life out of your system

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.480 
couple years of life out of your system
reduces<00:01:21.509> energy<00:01:21.720> costs<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.770> very<00:01:23.040> important

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
reduces energy costs very very important

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.719 
reduces energy costs very very important
a<00:01:23.580> clean<00:01:23.850> system<00:01:24.150> runs<00:01:24.659> more<00:01:25.080> efficiently

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
a clean system runs more efficiently

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.280 
a clean system runs more efficiently
energy<00:01:26.729> star<00:01:26.790> says<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.509> about<00:01:27.840> fifty

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
energy star says that about fifty

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
energy star says that about fifty
percent<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.740> our<00:01:28.829> total<00:01:29.070> utility<00:01:30.030> bill<00:01:30.210> is

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
percent of our total utility bill is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
percent of our total utility bill is
tied<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.930> heating<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.350> cooling<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
tied to heating and cooling so it
