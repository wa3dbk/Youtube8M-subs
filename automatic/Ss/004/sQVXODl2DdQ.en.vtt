00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.910
 in the last lesson we suggested the path to 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.730
 speedy video card 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.710
 able to roast this time we even 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.690
 don't break up anything but you learn about 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.789
 several unexpected features 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.980
 programs of the burner using this 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.109
 programs if you still can not 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.480
 take screenshots of settings for this item 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 the minimum menu you can configure quick 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.390
 key to create a screen print 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.000
 select format 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.380
 quality level and place to save 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 removed the whole screen 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.579
 so itâ€™s probably somewhere 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.250
 use also this program has 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.050
 much cooler function which we 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.300
 even used to create these 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 lessons namely the ability to shoot 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.640
 the video is also recorded full screen 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.590
 but the settings are really a lot and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.719
 can achieve almost perfect 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.809
 the result is likely this can be replaced 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.510
 almost any paid program has few cms and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.430
 the rest of the settings are also quite helpful. 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 and here is a list of them on the first tab 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.619
 besides the already mentioned parameters also 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.820
 there is an opportunity to force the program 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.900
 automatically start every time 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.240
 with windows 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 here but below is quite important 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.799
 automatic update item 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.869
 programs on the 4 and 7 tab can be 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.490
 set combinations to activate 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.439
 fast functions among them 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 turn on off overlay new 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.090
 display and quick change of profile and of 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.430
 last menu tab custom 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.409
 here you can choose a convenient interface 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.689
 for themselves and the program interface language 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.090
 also increase the size of the window itself with 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.460
 using the cover system by the way others 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.070
 covers for the app can be downloaded from 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.470
 official site that's all next 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.640
 just tell you how to do overclocking 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.640
 more comfortable 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.159
 but
