00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
water hole over there I think in a

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
water hole over there I think in a
little<00:02:29.040> bit<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.220> mountains<00:02:29.520> everywhere<00:02:29.760> um<00:02:32.660> so

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
little bit of mountains everywhere um so

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600 
little bit of mountains everywhere um so
yeah<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.050> goes<00:02:34.230> into<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> pool<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.490> I'm

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
yeah and goes into like a pool so I'm

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.740 
yeah and goes into like a pool so I'm
sure<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:35.970> do<00:02:36.060> some<00:02:36.209> stuff<00:02:36.330> with<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.450> and

find<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.299> world<00:03:54.540> interesting<00:03:54.989> or<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> seat

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
find this world interesting or the seat

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.170 
find this world interesting or the seat
interesting<00:03:56.160> then<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.400> go<00:03:56.519> ahead<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.880> go<00:03:56.970> for

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
interesting then you go ahead and go for

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.310 
interesting then you go ahead and go for
it<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.620> um<00:03:58.860> be<00:03:59.760> 0<00:04:00.180> or<00:04:00.540> not<00:04:00.750> be<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.170> why

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
it so that is um be 0 or not be and why

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.830 
it so that is um be 0 or not be and why
and<00:04:01.650> then<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.760> final<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:03.239> I'm<00:04:03.510> going<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.690> show

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
and then the final one I'm going to show

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.380 
and then the final one I'm going to show
you<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.769> type<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.640> some

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
you I have to type it in it some

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.130 
you I have to type it in it some
pressure<00:04:06.570> this<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.019> some<00:04:07.700> be<00:04:08.700> 0<00:04:09.230> 0<00:04:10.760> Z<00:04:12.140> pretty

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
pressure this is it some be 0 0 Z pretty

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.890 
pressure this is it some be 0 0 Z pretty
sure<00:04:13.230> that's<00:04:13.380> what<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:14.750> was<00:04:15.750> going

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
sure that's what it is I was going

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.420 
sure that's what it is I was going
through<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.109> earlier<00:04:16.350> going<00:04:16.859> through<00:04:16.979> looking

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
through it earlier going through looking

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.219 
through it earlier going through looking
at<00:04:17.640> some<00:04:17.669> random<00:04:17.910> seized<00:04:18.180> earlier<00:04:18.329> type<00:04:19.020> it<00:04:19.140> in

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
at some random seized earlier type it in

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.900 
at some random seized earlier type it in
writing<00:04:19.349> stuff<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.739> this<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.580> what<00:04:20.669> I<00:04:20.700> found

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
writing stuff and this is what I found

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.560 
writing stuff and this is what I found
so<00:04:21.209> I'm<00:04:21.270> pretty<00:04:21.450> sure<00:04:21.599> this<00:04:21.690> old<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.989> is

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
so I'm pretty sure this old it is

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.170 
so I'm pretty sure this old it is
um<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:25.229> i'll<00:04:25.530> try<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> think<00:04:25.949> i<00:04:26.220> think<00:04:27.060> this

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
um and i'll try to think i think this

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.490 
um and i'll try to think i think this
has<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.570> bunch<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:27.840> tetris<00:04:28.169> blocks<00:04:28.380> over

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
has like a bunch of tetris blocks over

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.629 
has like a bunch of tetris blocks over
the<00:04:28.650> place<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:28.979> could<00:04:29.130> start<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.430> great

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
the place so you could start a great

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.500 
the place so you could start a great
survival<00:04:30.060> island<00:04:30.330> series<00:04:31.229> on<00:04:31.320> this<00:04:31.440> map<00:04:31.620> um<00:04:32.510> so

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
survival island series on this map um so

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.780 
survival island series on this map um so
yeah<00:04:33.660> that's<00:04:33.810> why<00:04:33.990> i<00:04:34.380> decided<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.580> include

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
yeah that's why i decided to include

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.300 
yeah that's why i decided to include
this<00:04:35.940> map<00:04:36.150> it's<00:04:36.389> not<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:36.750> i<00:04:37.070> don't<00:04:38.070> know<00:04:38.130> yeah

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
this map it's not like i don't know yeah

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.770 
this map it's not like i don't know yeah
i'm<00:04:38.669> pretty<00:04:38.729> sure<00:04:38.970> that's<00:04:39.120> what<00:04:39.210> all<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.479> is<00:04:39.600> I

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
i'm pretty sure that's what all it is I

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.210 
i'm pretty sure that's what all it is I
didn't<00:04:40.290> really<00:04:40.410> look<00:04:40.800> around<00:04:41.070> for<00:04:41.160> the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
didn't really look around for the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.010 
didn't really look around for the
resources<00:04:41.669> but<00:04:41.880> I'm<00:04:41.940> pretty<00:04:42.060> sure<00:04:42.210> there<00:04:42.900> is

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
resources but I'm pretty sure there is

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.390 
resources but I'm pretty sure there is
resources<00:04:43.500> sticking<00:04:43.770> out<00:04:43.830> of<00:04:43.919> places<00:04:44.100> like

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
resources sticking out of places like

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.570 
resources sticking out of places like
iron<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.630> coal<00:04:45.840> everywhere<00:04:46.380> ensure<00:04:47.130> can<00:04:47.340> akar

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
iron and coal everywhere ensure can akar

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.520 
iron and coal everywhere ensure can akar
Kessell<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:48.150> know<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.570> usual<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:49.290> that

little strip and i'm pretty sure that

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.750 
little strip and i'm pretty sure that
there's<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.960> text<00:05:28.440> box<00:05:28.590> ever<00:05:28.830> were<00:05:28.919> i'm<00:05:29.610> not
