actually see the slight degree so they

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.420 
actually see the slight degree so they
only<00:04:34.780> go<00:04:34.990> on<00:04:35.020> one<00:04:35.440> way<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.830> microphone<00:04:35.949> will

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
written to you're here for the most part

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.670 
written to you're here for the most part
so<00:04:50.350> people<00:04:50.590> have<00:04:50.710> had<00:04:50.860> mixed<00:04:51.100> reviews<00:04:51.340> on<00:04:51.760> them

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
so people have had mixed reviews on them

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.740 
so people have had mixed reviews on them
this<00:04:53.280> does<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.520> same<00:04:53.880> thing<00:04:54.180> obviously<00:04:54.660> it

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
this does the same thing obviously it

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.689 
this does the same thing obviously it
cuts<00:04:54.960> out<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.139> little<00:04:55.320> bit<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:56.160> quality

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
cuts out a little bit of the quality

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.360 
cuts out a little bit of the quality
because<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.449> is<00:04:57.570> over<00:04:57.840> bluetooth<00:04:58.350> over<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.710> 3.5

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
because it is over bluetooth over a 3.5

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.840 
because it is over bluetooth over a 3.5
millimeter<00:04:59.900> sounds<00:05:00.900> fantastic

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
millimeter sounds fantastic

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.430 
millimeter sounds fantastic
so<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:02.880> mean<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.330> does<00:05:03.509> carry<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.900> true<00:05:04.110> sound

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
so I mean it does carry the true sound

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.430 
so I mean it does carry the true sound
that<00:05:04.740> comes<00:05:05.070> through<00:05:05.310> all<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.639> your<00:05:05.789> equipment

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
that comes through all of your equipment

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.290 
that comes through all of your equipment
it's<00:05:07.440> got<00:05:07.590> your<00:05:07.680> volume<00:05:08.070> up<00:05:08.190> your<00:05:08.460> volume<00:05:08.580> down

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
it's got your volume up your volume down

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.050 
it's got your volume up your volume down
fast-forward<00:05:10.110> you're<00:05:10.320> aligned<00:05:10.850> your<00:05:11.850> power
