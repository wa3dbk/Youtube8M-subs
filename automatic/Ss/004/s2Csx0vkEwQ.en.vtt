00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.240
 to create household 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.270

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.010
 their houses in a competition 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
 compete in the decision 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.289
 Which would be better families and so let's 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.329
