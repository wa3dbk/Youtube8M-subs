00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.789
 hello I hope you are super well today 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.029
 I bring 5 ideas of snacks for parties 

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:09.730
 children so let's see 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.280
 [Music] 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.850
 the first age are delicious and 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.440
 more orio pallets 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.630
 The first thing we are going to do is separate 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:33.010
 to all the areas that we are going to use 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:35.050
 [Music] 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.199
 then we are going to use a little bit of 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.989
 chocolate to melt I got myself 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:44.050
 this chocolate bar so I'm 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:48.359
 cutting into small pieces to put it into 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.359
 microwave and can use it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.680
 [Music] 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.080
 here as you see I have it melted and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.170
 with a few sticks what we are going to do is 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.970
 put together a little chocolate and what 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.940
 we put it like this so that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.060
 stick the chocolate stick to the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.440
 cookie and we closed it as it was 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:27.019
 a sandwich 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:27.019
 [Music] 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.030
 that we do with the rest of all 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:36.380
 cookies and send them to refrigerate 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.380
 about 5 minutes 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.640
 [Music] 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.479
 well here I have them all ready one 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 Once you refrigerate them if they are left 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.780
 fully glued 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.700
 for the next step we are going to melt 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.710
 a little more chocolate 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.960
 preference in a glass because 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.450
 we need you to hold a certain height 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.880
 we are also going to need boats or 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.000
 sweet pearls to what we're going to do 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.979
 is to gather all the chocolate and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.920
 once we squeezed it super super 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.220
 well let's go for the sweets and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.220
 everyone 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.410
 and nothing else is left to cool the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.410
 about five minutes and it's ready 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.090
 [Music] 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.860
 the second idea are strawberries with chocolate 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.540
 but you can also change it by 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.689
 any other fruit that will keep you 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.299
 super rich good here I have my strawberries 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.440
 super clean super clean and also 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.720
 I cut the stick 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.680
 i 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.349
 [Music] 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.500
 and we are also going to need some sticks 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.879
 of skewer what we are going to do is 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.330
 assemble the skewers of 3 or 4 fruits as 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:03.560
 you like it more like you made arrangements 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.330
 and I did not decide to do it alone of 3 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.710
 [Music] 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.310
 ah 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.310
 two 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:24.350
 [Music] 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:26.510
 and then put chocolate in two bags in 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.670
 one of them I will place a few drops of 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.600
 natural coloring because I want to achieve 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.600
 a pink tone 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.070
 [Music] 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.770
 we cut one of the corners of the form 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.260
 and we pour the chocolate on the fruit 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.840
 can make figurines cover them all 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.090
 all of chocolate or just place 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.960
 the chocolate in the form of a zig zag like me 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.500
 I did it you let them cool and ready 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.770
 the third ideal are with palette myths and 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.110
 me for this idea you only need gummies 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.110
 and these are going to put a few sticks 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.780
 you also need the melted chocolate 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.739
 and any decoration can be mani 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.720
 coconut et cetera 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.209
 I'm going to use these candy pearls 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.820
 We spread the chocolate until more or less 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.550
 half of the gumdrop we drained super 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.310
 well we adhere the spaces and 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:42.150
 refrigerated a few minutes 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:44.790
 [Music] 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.010
 the fourth idea are some sausages in 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.920
 heart shape for this only 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.870
 we need sausages and chopsticks 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.780
 we start cutting the ends of the 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.820
 sausages and then cut them by the 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.070
 half 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.070
 [Music] 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.500
 ok every bit is going to be such a heart 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.700
 that we take a bit and make a 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.300
 diagonal cut 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.300
 [Music] 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.070
 then as you can see we cut a 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.010
 small piece of the sausage to look like 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.610
 more or less a heart and we join with a 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.370
 Stick can serve them well or if 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.530
 you prefer you can serve them or fry them 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.530
 more you like me the cold 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.000
 and the fifth idea is jello to do this 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.580
 It is the easiest and fastest in the world 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.370
 because we are going to follow the recipe that brings 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.919
 the package of gelatin we put it 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.230
 in individual containers and if 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.490
 Refrigerate moss in the freezer in two 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.940
 hours will be ready 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.310
 to serve we can give cream as I 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.340
 I made in this case it's vanilla and 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.770
 you can put on decoration I put 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.780
 candy pearls and chopped peanuts 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.540
 You can also put the chocolate 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.800
 grated et cetera 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.500
 and ready 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.390
 [Music] 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.940
 well these are all the snacks 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.950
 but in the end also finished them 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.310
 I leave some pics that I found over 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.290
 ideas that could also serve them 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.750
 thank you very much for watching and see you 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:38.250

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:38.250

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:41.880
 [Music]

 two 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.800
