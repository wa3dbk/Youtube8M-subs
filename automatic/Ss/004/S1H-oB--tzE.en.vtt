00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.680
 Meatballs or how to get in 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.599
 south germany says meat plant like 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.220
 you can call them the fried ones 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.290
 minced meat dumplings are great 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.529
 snack and at every party the absolute 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.529
 winner 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.120
 you can use different sorts 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.399
 and of course mix too 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.230
 I have beef and lamb here today 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.850
 God then I always like to take 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.540
 because it gives the meatballs an intense 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.640
 gives a note 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.170
 make sure that you suggest 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.910
 maybe processed as cool as possible 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.100
 to exclude the risk of salmonella 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.620
 Now we have fit our chopped 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:58.809
 a soothing massage in the once 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.809
 wind and of course our lamb chopped 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.879
 and now knead it really well with it 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.539
 dissolves the protein what later for the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.160
 Bonding at the meatballs now provides 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:18.759
 let's take our finely cut 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.759
 onions and peter them 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.990
 also standing beside the well next 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.369
 parsley you can also at 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.079
 the lampre gardain too well 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.509
 Coriander eg fall back 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.869
 For seasoning only salt is used 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.869
 and pepper 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.539
 You can enter the final digit 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:52.009
 set a bit bigger then that 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.000
 Knead well all year and there you can 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.450
 we already like this meatball 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.450
 informed 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:09.729
 first a ball shape and roll but 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.060
 easy plate nice press on all 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.060
 pages 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.990
 so far so good we can see the colleagues 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.640
 It is important to throw in the pan 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.390
 our meatballs are a very hot one 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.120
 pan 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.160
 That's why I also take something like peanut oil 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.420
 you can heat very much alternatively 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.420
 you can combine butter lard 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:52.349
 sear and sear from both sides 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:55.409
 then the temperature goes under so 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:01.079
 they are finished cleaning and africa 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:05.090
 dellen and I personally remain completely 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.090
 classic with bread and mustard as a side dish
