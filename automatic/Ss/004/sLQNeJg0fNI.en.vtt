00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.880
 Hello, Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.720
 today we will reach the beautiful city of Usak Usak 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.400
 and "Pepper Vaccine" 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.840
 but as always, let's learn the materials before 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.280
 30 pieces of dry pepper 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.800
 1 large onion 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.120
 1 teacup of oil 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 1 tablespoon tomato paste, half a tablespoon of pepper paste 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.160
 For the above; 2 cups of yogurt 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.480
 2 cloves of garlic 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.120
 1 tsp dry mint 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.960
 and 1 tablespoon of butter 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 no longer know the ingredients needed for pepper vaccination 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.680
 chili pepper 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.440
 peppers will be cooked late, we first put the pepper in boiling water 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.360
 half cover and boil until soft 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.160
 pepper softened now can get water 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.480
 we will also remove strands 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.000
 wait a little to cool down 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 pepper 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.040
 in the meantime we can continue the process by chopping onions 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.960
 We have 1 coarse onion 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 if it is small we can use 2 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.960
 finely 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.040
 we can roast now 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040
 we put the pot on fire 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.200
 1 tea cup of sunflower oil 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.720
 now we add the onions we chopped 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.720
 we'll roast until the onions are transparent 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 while the onions are roasted, we also boiled the pepper ... 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.560
 cut into several pieces 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560
 we have used dried stuffed pepper 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.560
 All kinds of pepper are available 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.120
 but if you can use dried peppers for Uşak, 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 chopped peppers, now wait for the order to cook 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.960
 a little salt on our onion ... 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.520
 and 1 tablespoon of tomato, half a tablespoon of hot pepper paste 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.640
 2-3 minutes of mixing for the integration of onion and paste 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.800
 Now we add the peppers and peppers 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.400
 The peppers are already cooked, let's say a bottom-top 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.840
 Let's close the lid, cut the fire 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.440
 cook for 10 minutes this way 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.120
 pepper 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.320
 Let's continue by preparing our garlic yogurt 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.280
 very little water 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.240
 some salt and garnish 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.240
 so much 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.680
 Now let's take our garlics with a little salt and add 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.640
 ready, now add to our yogurt 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.960
 I mingle 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.520
 shortly after service 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.240
 pepper wrapped, now let's take it back 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.880
 let's melt the butter in the front 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.880
 Let's wait a bit 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.480
 we are adding dry mint 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.480
 and closing the fire 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.960
 there is little time left to offer pepper vaccine service 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.000
 we waited a bit to cool down 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.200
 pepper 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.880
 a little garlic yogurt 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.360
 and pouring from our melted mint oil 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.800
 and take it to the table 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.240
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.040
 We reached out to Uşak and shared a very easy, delicious recipe 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.760
 We learned about the construction of "Pepper Vaccine" 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.960
 I wish you to remember Uşak and us as soon as possible 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.000
 Goodbye sir ...
