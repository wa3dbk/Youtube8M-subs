Oh car camping in the snow just hold the
camera<00:01:06.270> up<00:01:06.539> so<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.899> see<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.289> top

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
camera up so you can see what the top

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.960 
camera up so you can see what the top
setup<00:01:07.950> looks<00:01:08.190> like<00:01:09.289> so<00:01:10.289> this<00:01:10.649> type<00:01:10.950> setup<00:01:11.310> kind

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
setup looks like so this type setup kind

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.480 
setup looks like so this type setup kind
of<00:01:12.119> goes<00:01:12.330> against<00:01:12.750> everything<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.490> winter

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
of goes against everything that winter

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
of goes against everything that winter
snow<00:01:14.789> kami<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.390> taught<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.289> put

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
snow kami has taught me we have to put

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.730 
snow kami has taught me we have to put
this<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.800> in<00:01:17.009> quite<00:01:17.940> a<00:01:17.970> hurry

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
this up in quite a hurry

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
this up in quite a hurry
there's<00:01:19.740> dinner<00:01:20.100> cooking<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:21.140> come

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
there's dinner cooking just there come

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.160 
there's dinner cooking just there come
back<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.409> way<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> problem<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
back this way so the problem with this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.010 
back this way so the problem with this
tup<00:01:25.500> setup<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.119> it's<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.149> little<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.479> too<00:01:27.630> flat

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
tup setup is it's a little bit too flat

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200 
tup setup is it's a little bit too flat
so<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.950> hit<00:01:29.130> by<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> big<00:01:29.610> dump<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
so if we do get hit by a big dump of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.270 
so if we do get hit by a big dump of
snow<00:01:30.240> overnight<00:01:31.759> we<00:01:32.759> may<00:01:33.090> collapse<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:35.009> top

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
snow overnight we may collapse the top

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.090 
snow overnight we may collapse the top
setup<00:01:35.700> may<00:01:36.000> collapse

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
setup may collapse

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.529 
setup may collapse
we<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.399> tent<00:01:38.759> inside<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.390> they

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
we do have a tent inside there they

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.710 
we do have a tent inside there they
backup<00:01:39.990> tent<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.560> case<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> happens<00:01:41.720> go

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
backup tent just in case that happens go

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.219 
backup tent just in case that happens go
on<00:01:42.959> is<00:01:43.170> tied<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.709> that<00:01:44.509> thorn<00:01:45.509> tree

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
on is tied to that thorn tree

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.660 
on is tied to that thorn tree
there's<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.459> rope<00:01:49.009> swing<00:01:50.009> around<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.459> way

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
there's the rope swing around this way

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.080 
there's the rope swing around this way
and<00:01:50.910> that's<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.629> road<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.700> fair<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:54.060> say

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and that's the road so it's fair to say

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.609 
and that's the road so it's fair to say
that<00:01:54.420> no<00:01:54.599> one<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.929> going<00:01:55.050> to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.259> using<00:01:55.410> this

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
that no one is going to be using this

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.800 
that no one is going to be using this
road<00:01:56.629> until<00:01:57.629> winter<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.349> over<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.450> we've<00:02:00.629> got

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
road until winter is over so we've got

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.119 
road until winter is over so we've got
this<00:02:00.989> area<00:02:01.229> all<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.830> ourselves<00:02:03.979> see<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.069> it

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:05.129 
this area all to ourselves see what it

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
this area all to ourselves see what it
looks<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:07.259> old<00:02:07.410> green<00:02:07.709> tarp<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.899> now

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
looks like the old green tarp and now

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.140 
looks like the old green tarp and now
turned<00:02:10.440> white<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:14.580> we're<00:02:14.819> cooking<00:02:14.970> here

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
turned white so what we're cooking here

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.119 
turned white so what we're cooking here
a<00:02:15.629> bit<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.620> pork<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.849> boiling<00:02:18.830> turn<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> heat

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
a bit of pork just boiling turn the heat

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.790 
a bit of pork just boiling turn the heat
down<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.430> bit<00:02:20.700> actually<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:21.709> bit<00:02:22.709> of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
down a little bit actually a bit of

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.970 
down a little bit actually a bit of
pasture<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.580> pot<00:02:23.849> there<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.769> here

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
pasture in that pot there and just here

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.040 
pasture in that pot there and just here
is<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> hydrated<00:02:26.670> food<00:02:26.879> pack<00:02:27.150> imported<00:02:27.930> from

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
is a hydrated food pack imported from

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.440 
is a hydrated food pack imported from
New<00:02:28.110> Zealand<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:29.610> hold<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.879> in<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> light<00:02:30.269> so

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
New Zealand just hold it in the light so

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.320 
New Zealand just hold it in the light so
you<00:02:30.569> can<00:02:30.599> see<00:02:31.640> there's<00:02:32.640> half<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:33.000> litre<00:02:33.209> of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
you can see there's half a litre of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.540 
you can see there's half a litre of
boiling<00:02:33.599> water<00:02:33.780> inside<00:02:34.379> that<00:02:34.590> bag<00:02:34.830> right<00:02:35.069> now

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
boiling water inside that bag right now

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.759 
boiling water inside that bag right now
so<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.330> hydrated<00:02:36.810> food<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.260> turning<00:02:37.650> into

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
so the hydrated food is turning into

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.280 
so the hydrated food is turning into
normal<00:02:38.190> food<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.610> we<00:02:38.790> speak<00:02:40.069> another<00:02:42.290> new

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
normal food as we speak another new

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.589 
normal food as we speak another new
piece<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.769> gear<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.250> we've<00:02:45.090> got<00:02:45.300> for<00:02:45.480> this

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
piece of gear that we've got for this

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.210 
piece of gear that we've got for this
trip

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
trip

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.450 
trip
winter<00:02:48.220> fuel<00:02:48.670> formula<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.710> diesel<00:02:51.160> fuel

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
winter fuel formula so the diesel fuel

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.160 
winter fuel formula so the diesel fuel
from<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.390> full<00:02:52.600> drive<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:53.230> actually<00:02:53.590> freeze<00:02:53.860> in

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
from a full drive can actually freeze in

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.870 
from a full drive can actually freeze in
low<00:02:56.170> temperatures<00:02:56.740> like<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.460> tonight<00:02:57.760> it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
low temperatures like this so tonight it

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.360 
low temperatures like this so tonight it
might<00:02:58.000> drop<00:02:58.210> down<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.510> minus<00:02:58.780> 8<00:02:58.960> but<00:02:59.920> if<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.130> put

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
might drop down to minus 8 but if we put

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.090 
might drop down to minus 8 but if we put
one<00:03:00.610> milliliter<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.420> winter<00:03:02.350> fuel<00:03:02.560> formula

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
one milliliter of winter fuel formula

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.780 
one milliliter of winter fuel formula
per<00:03:03.490> liter<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:03.910> diesel<00:03:04.060> fuel<00:03:04.600> inside<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.260> tank

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
per liter of diesel fuel inside the tank

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.930 
per liter of diesel fuel inside the tank
when<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:06.970> fill<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.360> car<00:03:08.280> our<00:03:09.280> regular<00:03:09.730> diesel

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
when we fill the car our regular diesel

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.350 
when we fill the car our regular diesel
becomes<00:03:10.450> Alpine<00:03:10.930> diesel<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.710> as<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:13.000> won't

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
becomes Alpine diesel and as it won't

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.200 
becomes Alpine diesel and as it won't
freeze<00:03:14.070> well<00:03:15.070> not<00:03:15.400> unless<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.820> temperature

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
freeze well not unless the temperature

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.480 
freeze well not unless the temperature
drops<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.930> minus<00:03:17.260> 40<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:17.860> according<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
drops to minus 40 so according to the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.050 
drops to minus 40 so according to the
bottle<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:19.840> will<00:03:20.050> be<00:03:20.350> okay<00:03:20.800> down<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.040> minus<00:03:21.490> 40

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
bottle we will be okay down to minus 40

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.990 
bottle we will be okay down to minus 40
but<00:03:22.660> if<00:03:22.780> diesel<00:03:23.170> does<00:03:23.500> freeze<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.670> will<00:03:24.820> turn
