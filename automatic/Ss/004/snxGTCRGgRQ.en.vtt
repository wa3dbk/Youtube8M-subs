the entire culture of the building

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.400 
the entire culture of the building
because<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.420> started<00:01:18.870> with<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.290> was

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
opening and then we're allowed to

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.670 
opening and then we're allowed to
actually<00:01:38.180> struggle<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.450> work<00:01:39.680> closings

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
actually struggle with the work closings

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
actually struggle with the work closings
then<00:01:41.070> allow<00:01:41.700> our<00:01:41.880> students<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.300> put<00:01:42.690> in<00:01:42.810> their

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
own words and to use the academic

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.250 
own words and to use the academic
language<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.480> that<00:01:45.510> they<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.930> actually

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
language so that they can actually

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.410

describe how or what they've learned and
it<00:01:48.690> really<00:01:48.960> helps<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> solidify<00:01:49.710> what

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
