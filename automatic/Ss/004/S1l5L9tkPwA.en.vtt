00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 I'm sorry everyone pg 暁 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:12.690
 Gunpla said what I'm sorry 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:19.680
 I can not come up with a story I really take a video of Blue Distinction 1 and use it as a story 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.020
 It was a plan to do, so I actually tried to ride on the Blue Distinth Unit 1 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.500
 But 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.160
 I could not get the camera 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:35.560
 Really moving if husband How can I friends are taken of the tank point of view was shocked 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:40.010
 We bothered this time to the great business 801 invitation and let me have a full hourly report 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:43.339
 Reading is what was for or have calcined about 8 to say that different 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.530
 I'm glad I have a full time report in 8 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:52.070
 This time a conjunction with the go you Pawajimu and Hebimaru to the anti-mop 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.660
 I want to get around well as a food scene 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:00.440
 I am worried about signal bullets and if there is a jan, there is a diffuse bullet 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.030
 Enemy's strategy or mop charge mop charge 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.480
 What good Ya hit or you hit any 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.430
 It's a gog 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:16.070
 I'll clean it with a mop Itaiiteai recumbency hurts sorely 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:20.270
 The more the feeling of dione students who had a piece of the opponent until now was found only a little 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.540
 Quite the firepower high No I cormorant Hehehe my mop Kuranaga 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.750
 Struck from a soldier 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.200
 What hurts it hurts what it really hurts 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:36.730
 I wonder why I'm dying now I 've been shooting continuously 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:38.080
 Bazooka hit 9 different machine guns if it's different This is a bit a bit in a hurry ap 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.080
 Evaporates 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.530
 Because we broke the base for the time being, gog collection 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.420
 So close distance 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.380
 It is popular but I am young and fine 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:02:00.530
 Because I return to the video I do not know only it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:02.550
 I'm going to leave Paris in an enemy tank at some cost lead here after exchange of bases . 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:09.660
 Look at the enemy tank ap 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:10.470
 Also left bad, so that while dropping waving mop wrong the other is already close to dying 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.350
 I will 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.350
 I only cut myself and I make a squirrel 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 Oh, another chance was given, ha ha ha ha 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.970
 It cleaning 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.970
 What could not clean 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:36.030
 Well, I'll drop the enemy tank that I've left for the first time what to do now 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.319
 It was a bother 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.910
 I'm sorry 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.090
 Let's go to the center for the time being 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.230
 The tank was dropped 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.830
 Well what to do from now 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:56.500
 I saw the tank so I want to play for a while 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:01.780
 It's a bad pattern, so it won't be cut off here 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.980
 You and machine gun Well painful if you run away 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.980
 Let's go to the cup 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.430
 This is terrible 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.739
 Oh, I already have six 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.739
 Reverse N 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.040
 Well something there Na what to do deja vu 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.460
 If I exchange bases, I can win but maybe I can not make it in time 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.590
 Both escort and defense 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.900
 I was surprised that something was flying 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.130
 I have raised the line considerably 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.400
 The base is 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.400
 It seems to be dropped Let's recover the cost 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.140
 Let's make a post lead 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.220
 If there is only this lead 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.220
 Is it near? 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:56.570
 I have nothing to write 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:59.830
 No, I used to write it by force, but I can not write tactical things for myself and it is attractive 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.830
 Because I can not play 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.530
 I'm flying around 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.230
 It is a great nice cut 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.950
 The battle is over 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.400
 Thank you very much thanks to everyone who is sorry 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.970
 I will go to the second game 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.020
 It looks like a pretty luxurious member 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:29.100
 There is a certain extent to the difference in my list there 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.289
 I want to go to the anti with the mop in the second game 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.469
 cut 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:42.680
 The area around the Pyramids Square in the mining city may be a bit harder terrain for fighters 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:43.430
 However, I think that I can not give pressure if I do not write, so take a quick mop 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.949
 I will 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.280
 Also well not, but I just do not goodwill other category write to say that because it is good 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:56.670
 Not ha 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.670
 It is horse leather, so the number seems to fit, so we go to anti 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.669
 It is shark Nyan in front of the eye 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.090
 This is delicious 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.690
 Healing 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:10.960
 Parent Is this should have been tackled in Nimubasu 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:15.590
 There was sand , so let's leave the enemy sand to that sniper 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:19.490
 Let's play with Nyan &amp; escort 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:26.030
 I wanted to know why I sent the lock 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:29.720
 It has become drowning, but it is good because it has delayed the capture of the base of Ryo Nyan quite 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:34.600
 Hey since the mass is really dropped not and useless 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.600
 Gyafun Yaro shook why and now mop 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:44.580
 I made a mistake in specifying the base lifter 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:51.809
 Want to cry and the lever is not input so do the selection was his squirrel in the lever 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:54.929
 I'm sorry I'm not fast enough, so I've been fighting allies, and I'm delaying the base pledge considerably 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:55.120
 I think this is a good flow 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.570
 Good 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.720
 I'm a too go cares boys were shark Nyan 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:07.090
 I was fascinated by your overwhelming performance 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:12.100
 This feeling is truly love Oh I flirt with gufukas in haste 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.200
 If it doesn't reach you can't reach you can't reach it 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:19.289
 Successful 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:23.069
 Ja board will go to play at what the shark in this degree 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:27.689
 I will receive my nephew 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:30.670
 Yes I'm sorry late-night editing so tension is funny 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:36.220
 I will do my own sincerely and earnestly 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:37.300
 Your opponent's first attack and your 2nd attack are the same 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:43.780
 Is about 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:50.660
 This pattern is after it is almost near or in the feelings of the degree to Tsu Na or can not be victory 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:52.160
 The mobile suit will be recovered , oh oh , the target sand in front of you shields the enemy sand and missiles off 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.670
 Egi 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.480
 Cut once 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:03.410
 I'm sorry to disturb you 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.410
 It is good food of each to come to a building alone 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.540
 It's easy to get caught if you don't get calm 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.810
 It does not say in what is always is a reverse 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:17.150
 Avoid Bazookas to Avoid Missiles to Curry 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.210
 Whether a missile hit or not 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.270
 wall 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:24.340
 Shoborn 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.340
 I once went to stop what shark 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.259
 Less than 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.960
 My friend dropped me 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.980
 Insufficient speed 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.490
 Self weight from behind 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.409
 The gauge will fly if there is an enemy base after that 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:45.789
 Stole 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:51.389
 Allies are strong Thanks to the above thanks to everyone 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:51.389
 Thank you very much for your helpful and helpful viewing
