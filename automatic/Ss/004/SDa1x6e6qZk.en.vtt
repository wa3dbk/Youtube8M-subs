 to talk about events 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.970
 most relevant sports and obviously 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 if an issue that nobody imagined 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:59.110
 around twelve thirty of the day 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.159
 comes a statement from the middle of the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.780
 chivas media people 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.310
 informing of a conference in the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.080
 capital of the republic 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.140
 10 57 is the time when it comes to me 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.939
 to be more precise and talked about that 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.000
 there was going to be a conference with Jorge 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.880
 vergara in the federal district at 1 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.920
 average of the appointment as is a custom 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.290
 they did not talk about any details in 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.420
 around this press conference and 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.680
 fly the speculations were talked about 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.220
 some inclusive details of the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.620
 presentation of a new manager 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.860
 but to the surprise of all Jorge 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.320
 vergara established that the motive was 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.110
 another new and different from the one we had 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.300
 thought to whom we could imagine 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.730
 a couple of days before he had talked about the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.380
 stay of technician Ricardo Antonio 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.830
 lavolpe for a couple of years we know 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.430
 that were the typical words of vergara 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.080
 but well this gave you to understand that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.850
 its 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.020
 management of this season and I would plan 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.340
 for the next they were already 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.560
 working in that sense and so simple 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.150
 and simply in a talk with the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.780
 media in the capital of 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.110
 the republic establishes that he leaves ricardo 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.170
 antonio lavolpe de chivas and then the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.130
 The problem is obviously very delicate 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.860
 situation whereby it is established that 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.050
 ends the relationship between bergara and the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.050
 chivas is an inappropriate behavior with 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.740
 a part of the female staff of the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.590
 club because of this has flooded the 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.420
 social networks of speculations 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.120
 corresponding and we will see 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.459
 what is the reality because there is talk of 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.239
 a demand both from the affected person 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.520
 as of the club in ricardo antonio lavolpe 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.310
 so we'll see how far it can go 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.130
 how delicate is this matter until the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.960
 moment we have not seen found and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.420
 read some response from the Argentine 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.550
 we will also have to wait if it will be and in 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.410
 what conditions he is in all his 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.590
 Right to speak or not to speak though 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.750
 only subject I insist that according to the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.120
 Guadalajara people will transcend 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.190
 courts and this already leads to others 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.600
 parameters this situation the truth is 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.060
 that from the sporting point of view 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.860
 the chivas team was left without 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.290
 technician again will have to 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.530
 work to find a coach 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:31.340
 will have to find a man who in 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.310
 the theory and in the profile that had been 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.280
 raised with the volpe to play with 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.830
 chivas not all have it obviously not 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.860
 everyone has the experience of the blow 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.800
 but he who arrives will have the same 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.320
 possibility to start from scratch 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.820
 with the misfortunes for example we are 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.280
 strictly speaking of sport 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.200
 what has happened in the environment of the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.380
 institution that can be very respectable 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.420
 and at the same time listening this way in the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.940
 which they make their decision on 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.260
 internal and obviously makes it public 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.560
 because that is the team coach 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.870
 in any other position maybe if 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.360
 this would have happened because it stops if 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.030
 absolutely nothing happens here there is a 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.459
 Concussion because finally you work 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.330
 thinking that the volpe was going to be at 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.180
 front and will make decisions 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.360
 sports and well in this we are 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.890
 talking about this topic omar to see we are going 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.600
 to make an attempt there is a problem with 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.600
 the president network link is not heard 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.410
 I listen very well let's go to 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.330
 try to speak louder out there 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.710
 will help the operator but will 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.360
 We appreciate that the whole call is 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.030
 talking to the sports president of 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.100
 chivas the mister village of blacksmith the 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.960
 president this from social networks already 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.240
 you know in particular have you flooded with 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.090
 rumors of versions if you can help us 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.950
 simply with the theme of the posture 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.000
 official to guide so many 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.480
 fans 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.320
 they are listening to us the official position 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.370
 is that chivas is a team that has a 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:08.370
 privileges values ​​and depending on 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.699
 that we all have to keep 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.389
 certain behavior up there my 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:20.250
 Comment what is important for the fans 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:22.410
 is that we are working on putting together the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.849
 team for the next tournament and from 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.209
 then 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:31.020
 as of today so much paco 

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:33.360
 palencia like I are doing the 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.569
 analysis and interviews and 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.749
 calls to see who has the 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.550
 merits and the and the profile to be able 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:43.979
 directing a team as important as 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.070
 chivas the mister blacksmith a greeting which 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.430
 is that profile 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.990
 the profile has to be someone 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.050
 evidently that has very values 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.860
 solids has to be someone who knows 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.720
 working with a team that although it 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.980
 let's strengthen you also have to take 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.630
 in consideration of young people 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.220
 It is obviously someone who has to 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.080
 know how to work with a team where 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.510
 all the players are Mexican and that 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.850
 It is essential that you have a lot of respect 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.610
 by the fans and by the means that the 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.430
 see how our partners we 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.810
 we perfectly understand our tripod 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.820
 between media hobby and the club and from 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.250
 then you have the winning mentality 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.040
 let him know that what we want for the 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.110
 next tournament is the champion understanding 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.420
 that each technician will have to comment on 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.280
 strength in forming a campus I imagine 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.530
 that with Ricardo before all these 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.410
 facts because he had said it himself 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.570
 I had already presented an analysis 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.940
 list of possible possible reinforcements 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.370
 positions more or less beyond the 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.960
 technician they are going to choose already has a 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.860
 idea in this sense are already negotiating 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.599
 by some players 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.229
 I had already presented it to him 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:02.039
 president in concept of administration 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:05.840
 of scribes this list is a list 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:09.569
 that although there was the point of view of 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.479
 surcharge is also the point of view 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:15.539
 of paco palencia from your server 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:18.780
 and in the meeting with Jorge himself 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:20.849
 have a lot to say about it if 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.490
 we have a list if we start already 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:26.279
 make our calls and our appointments 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.529
 and of course at the moment when 

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:30.289
 let's have technician we will give account of 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:34.199
 is ready to make us your 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:36.629
 appreciations and since we are again in 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:39.659
 time to incorporate what the technician 

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:41.129
 say no in this sense it will not happen what 

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:43.560
 what happened before you arrived 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:45.060
 sometimes the technician first listens to 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.979
 players and then the manager that is 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.930
 besides they will be working on 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:50.939
 advancing these lists would not take a step 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:55.039
 firm until they have insurance that 

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:55.039
 technical is and if the operator
