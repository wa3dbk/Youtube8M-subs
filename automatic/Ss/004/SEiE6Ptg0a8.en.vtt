00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
good morning from the 26th floor of the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.619 
good morning from the 26th floor of the
Intercontinental<00:00:03.480> Hotel<00:00:03.659> in<00:00:04.230> Seoul<00:00:04.710> Korea

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.259 
Intercontinental Hotel in Seoul Korea
I'm<00:00:06.629> in<00:00:06.870> Asia<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.350> tour<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.309> while<00:00:08.519> I'm<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:08.700> I

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
I'm in Asia on tour and while I'm here I

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.230 
I'm in Asia on tour and while I'm here I
thought<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.019> might<00:00:10.260> be<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.769> good<00:00:11.219> idea<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.790> do<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
thought it might be a good idea to do a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.390 
thought it might be a good idea to do a
few<00:00:12.870> cello<00:00:13.230> talks<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.940> bow<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:16.400> various

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
few cello talks on the bow and various

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.060 
few cello talks on the bow and various
uses<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> boat<00:00:18.539> especially<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.560> relation

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
uses for the boat especially in relation

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.929 
uses for the boat especially in relation
to<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.789> three<00:00:21.090> areas<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> bow<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.580> Frog

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
to the three areas of the bow the Frog

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.620 
to the three areas of the bow the Frog
the<00:00:24.600> tip<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.500> middle<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.330> in<00:00:27.330> order<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the tip and the middle and in order to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.240 
the tip and the middle and in order to
begin<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.380> thought<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.949> would<00:00:29.160> do

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
begin this I thought I would do

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.240 
begin this I thought I would do
something<00:00:29.550> very<00:00:29.789> simple<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.449> may<00:00:30.630> seem<00:00:30.929> very

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
something very simple this may seem very

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.470 
something very simple this may seem very
elementary<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.430> probably<00:00:32.820> most<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> but

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
elementary to probably most of you but

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
elementary to probably most of you but
it's<00:00:33.899> worth<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.739> over<00:00:34.829> talk<00:00:35.670> about

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it's worth just going over talk about

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
it's worth just going over talk about
this<00:00:36.480> stick<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.309> know

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
this stick and what it is and you know

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.150 
this stick and what it is and you know
how<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> works

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
how it works

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
how it works
obviously<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.430> lighter<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.540> end<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
obviously it's lighter at this end and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.229 
obviously it's lighter at this end and
it's<00:00:43.320> heavier<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> end<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:45.000> I

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it's heavier at this end and that I

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.020 
it's heavier at this end and that I
think<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.320> done<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.520> only<00:00:47.670> hold

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
think is done because you can only hold

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.090 
think is done because you can only hold
it<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.539> end<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.200> end<00:00:49.410> needs<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it on one end and this end needs to be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
it on one end and this end needs to be
like<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.550> order<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.940> able<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> control<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
like in order to be able to control it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.139 
like in order to be able to control it
like<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> sword<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.340> tip<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.760> always<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
like a sword the tip is always the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.490 
like a sword the tip is always the
lightest<00:00:54.510> place<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.579> Frog<00:00:57.500> talking

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
lightest place and the Frog talking

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.779 
lightest place and the Frog talking
about<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> fraud<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> course<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> Frog<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
about the fraud of course the Frog is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.070 
about the fraud of course the Frog is
the<00:00:59.910> heavy<00:01:00.149> end<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.980> fact<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.080> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the heavy end the fact that it is the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.990 
the heavy end the fact that it is the
hair<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:04.799> underneath<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.369> hand<00:01:05.580> Plus

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
hair is right underneath your hand Plus

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.510 
hair is right underneath your hand Plus
that<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.360> attached<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.380> makes<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.220> Frog

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that it's attached here makes the Frog

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820 
that it's attached here makes the Frog
the<00:01:08.820> strongest<00:01:09.390> place<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> boat<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the strongest place in the boat this is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.380 
the strongest place in the boat this is
the<00:01:10.950> place<00:01:11.130> where<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.939> hardest

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the place where you can do your hardest

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.460 
the place where you can do your hardest
playing<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.380> loudest<00:01:14.100> sound<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:15.119> most

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
playing get your loudest sound your most

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.840 
playing get your loudest sound your most
clean<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.920> powerful<00:01:17.820> attack<00:01:19.009> but<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.520> course

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
clean and powerful attack but of course

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
clean and powerful attack but of course
the<00:01:21.090> Frog<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.810> thing<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.200> can't<00:01:22.530> do

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the Frog is one thing that you can't do

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.060 
the Frog is one thing that you can't do
which<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.670> bounce<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:25.110> bow<00:01:25.259> doesn't<00:01:25.500> bounce

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
which is bounce the bow doesn't bounce

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.380 
which is bounce the bow doesn't bounce
it<00:01:26.369> lands<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> dead<00:01:27.270> weight<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:28.790> but<00:01:29.790> as

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it lands like a dead weight there but as

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.390 
it lands like a dead weight there but as
far<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.750> picking<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> bow<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.979> putting<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
far as picking up the bow and putting it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.670 
far as picking up the bow and putting it
down<00:01:32.479> smoothly<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> best<00:01:34.200> control

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
down smoothly and with the best control

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.789 
down smoothly and with the best control
the<00:01:35.220> Frog<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> place<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.960> me<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the Frog is the place to be for me the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.950 
the Frog is the place to be for me the
second<00:01:38.189> strongest<00:01:38.729> place<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> bow<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.750> at

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
second strongest place in the bow is at

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.130 
second strongest place in the bow is at
the<00:01:40.079> tip<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.869> hair<00:01:43.110> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the tip and that is because the hair is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.139 
the tip and that is because the hair is
also<00:01:43.560> attached<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> hair<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
also attached here when the hair is

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.569 
also attached here when the hair is
attached<00:01:45.860> close<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> hair<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
attached close to where the hair is

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.520 
attached close to where the hair is
attached<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:48.420> strong<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:49.320> there's

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
attached is very strong because there's

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.719 
attached is very strong because there's
this<00:01:49.680> resistance<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.659> also<00:01:52.549> slap<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
this resistance so you can also slap the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.539 
this resistance so you can also slap the
bow<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> tip<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
bow down at the tip and

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.920 
bow down at the tip and
and<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.759> will<00:01:55.850> stay<00:01:56.060> there<00:01:56.270> if<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.509> hold<00:01:56.750> it

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
and it will stay there if you hold it

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.370 
and it will stay there if you hold it
because<00:01:57.619> it's<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:58.549> stable<00:01:58.969> right<00:01:59.450> here<00:01:59.780> the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
because it's so stable right here the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.039 
because it's so stable right here the
tip<00:02:00.619> though<00:02:00.829> has<00:02:01.039> a<00:02:01.070> special<00:02:01.549> challenges<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
tip though has a special challenges the

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.550 
tip though has a special challenges the
arm<00:02:03.259> in<00:02:03.950> order<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.909> control<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.929> bow<00:02:06.079> to<00:02:06.140> tip

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
arm in order to control the bow to tip

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.929 
arm in order to control the bow to tip
the<00:02:06.710> arm<00:02:06.920> needs<00:02:07.189> to<00:02:07.310> be<00:02:07.399> very<00:02:07.759> very

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
the arm needs to be very very

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.719 
the arm needs to be very very
beautifully<00:02:08.660> aligned<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.250> like<00:02:10.429> if<00:02:10.580> I

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
beautifully aligned it's just like if I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.210 
beautifully aligned it's just like if I
were<00:02:10.879> to<00:02:10.910> use<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.660> end<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.110> boat<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.500> pick

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
were to use the end of the boat to pick

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.100 
were to use the end of the boat to pick
up<00:02:13.400> something<00:02:13.790> very<00:02:13.819> delicate<00:02:14.239> on<00:02:14.629> a<00:02:14.660> table

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
up something very delicate on a table

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.380 
up something very delicate on a table
I'd<00:02:15.200> have<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.530> be<00:02:15.650> very<00:02:16.090> careful<00:02:17.090> what<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.269> do

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
I'd have to be very careful what I do

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.670 
I'd have to be very careful what I do
here<00:02:17.959> because<00:02:18.379> this<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.519> very<00:02:19.760> far<00:02:20.269> away<00:02:20.680> but

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
here because this is very far away but

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.400 
here because this is very far away but
the<00:02:22.519> tip<00:02:22.730> has<00:02:22.940> very<00:02:23.239> very<00:02:23.450> special<00:02:23.840> uses<00:02:24.230> and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
the tip has very very special uses and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.410 
the tip has very very special uses and
we'll<00:02:24.530> get<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.519> next<00:02:25.640> videos<00:02:26.209> and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
we'll get to that in the next videos and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.440 
we'll get to that in the next videos and
then<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.110> middle<00:02:27.379> of<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.620> bow<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.880> course<00:02:29.180> is

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
then the middle of the bow of course is

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.860 
then the middle of the bow of course is
the<00:02:29.690> weakest<00:02:30.079> part<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:32.239> good<00:02:32.540> for

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
the weakest part and it's good for

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.229 
the weakest part and it's good for
bouncing<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.650> boat<00:02:33.829> because<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.280> low<00:02:34.459> bounce

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
bouncing the boat because the low bounce

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.030 
bouncing the boat because the low bounce
illumos<00:02:35.750> here<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:36.230> like<00:02:36.380> jumping<00:02:36.799> on<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
illumos here it's like jumping on the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.220 
illumos here it's like jumping on the
middle<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.549> trampoline<00:02:38.120> as<00:02:38.420> opposed<00:02:39.110> to

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
middle of a trampoline as opposed to

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.479 
middle of a trampoline as opposed to
jumping<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.860> edge<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.250> trampoline

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
jumping on the edge of the trampoline

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.670 
jumping on the edge of the trampoline
where<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.000> will<00:02:41.209> bounce<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.170> here's<00:02:42.530> where

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
where you will bounce so here's where

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.130 
where you will bounce so here's where
you<00:02:42.799> get<00:02:42.920> your<00:02:43.130> most<00:02:43.610> bounce<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.329> some<00:02:44.989> ways

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
you get your most bounce in some ways

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.720 
you get your most bounce in some ways
this<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.380> where<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.739> have<00:02:45.980> your<00:02:46.220> least

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
this is where you have your least

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.120 
this is where you have your least
control<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.540> we're<00:02:48.200> going<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.440> talk<00:02:48.650> about<00:02:48.680> in

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
control so we're going to talk about in

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.550 
control so we're going to talk about in
the<00:02:49.190> next<00:02:49.250> video<00:02:49.579> specific<00:02:50.390> passages<00:02:50.930> from

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
the next video specific passages from

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.789 
the next video specific passages from
standard<00:02:52.040> repertoire<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.819> I<00:02:53.360> will<00:02:53.799> explain

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
standard repertoire that I will explain

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.729 
standard repertoire that I will explain
why<00:02:55.250> at<00:02:55.760> least<00:02:56.030> for<00:02:56.239> me<00:02:56.390> some<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.470> them<00:02:57.590> work

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
why at least for me some of them work

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.949 
why at least for me some of them work
better<00:02:57.980> at<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.280> tip<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.790> middle<00:02:59.510> at<00:02:59.870> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
better at the tip in the middle at the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.330 
better at the tip in the middle at the
fore<00:03:00.290> log<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> look<00:03:00.829> forward<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.190> getting

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
fore log and I look forward to getting

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.799 
fore log and I look forward to getting
into<00:03:01.639> this<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.209> next<00:03:02.420> city<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.200> travel<00:03:03.650> too
