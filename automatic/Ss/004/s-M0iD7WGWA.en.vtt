a hallucination your brain got zapped by

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.509 
a hallucination your brain got zapped by
this<00:03:00.000> disease<00:03:00.769> all<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.950> wires<00:03:02.160> got<00:03:02.459> crossed

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
this disease all the wires got crossed

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.120 
this disease all the wires got crossed
and<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.720> saw<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> girl<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.350> butterfly<00:03:04.860> wing

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and you were spinning up at a melody I

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.460 
and you were spinning up at a melody I
know<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:08.250> was<00:03:08.400> not<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.819> hallucination<00:03:09.440> not<00:03:10.440> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
know this was not a hallucination not a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.670 
know this was not a hallucination not a
dream<00:03:11.069> not<00:03:11.670> what<00:03:12.060> we<00:03:12.209> call<00:03:12.359> a<00:03:12.500> confabulation<00:03:13.500> I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
dream not what we call a confabulation I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.610 
dream not what we call a confabulation I
know<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.150> really<00:03:15.600> occurred<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.560> know

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
know that it really occurred and I know

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.349 
know that it really occurred and I know
it<00:03:16.859> occurred<00:03:17.130> outside<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.730> my<00:03:17.820> brain

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
it occurred outside of my brain

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.800 
it occurred outside of my brain
so<00:03:18.690> basically<00:03:19.370> but<00:03:20.370> how<00:03:20.790> how<00:03:21.420> can<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.690> even

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
so basically but how how can I even

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.050 
so basically but how how can I even
suggest<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.620> much<00:03:23.040> less<00:03:23.310> claim<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.910> his

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
suggest that much less claim that his

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.180 
suggest that much less claim that his
experience<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.870> proof<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.500> heaven<00:03:25.890> as<00:03:26.040> he's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
experience is proof of heaven as he's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.580 
experience is proof of heaven as he's
called<00:03:26.459> his<00:03:26.609> new<00:03:26.850> book<00:03:27.090> he<00:03:27.930> showed<00:03:28.200> us<00:03:28.380> his

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
called his new book he showed us his

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.069 
called his new book he showed us his
brain<00:03:28.920> scan<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.760> think<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.150> wasn't<00:03:30.510> leaving

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079

any part of my cortex unaffected so your

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.840 
any part of my cortex unaffected so your
