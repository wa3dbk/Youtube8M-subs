00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
of it still gets through so you've got

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.140

ladies and gentlemen pro pure for two

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.940 
ladies and gentlemen pro pure for two
years<00:01:14.369> has<00:01:15.270> been<00:01:15.570> quietly<00:01:16.049> developing<00:01:16.770> this

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
years has been quietly developing this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310 
years has been quietly developing this
with<00:01:17.189> scientists<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.240> engineers<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:19.170> was

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
with scientists and engineers it was

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.830 
with scientists and engineers it was
designed<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:19.979> u.s.<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:21.240> only<00:01:21.509> have

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
designed in the u.s. they only have

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.080 
designed in the u.s. they only have
factories<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.680> make<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.400> England

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
factories that can make this in England

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.929 
factories that can make this in England
so<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.689> made<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.080> England<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
so it's made in England and this is the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.469 
so it's made in England and this is the
only<00:01:27.119> filter<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.860> only<00:01:29.280> cuts<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
only filter that not only cuts out the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.990 
only filter that not only cuts out the
other<00:01:30.869> bad<00:01:31.500> contaminants<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.549> also<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
other bad contaminants and also the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600 
other bad contaminants and also the
fluoride<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.720> step<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.380> cuts<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
fluoride in one step it cuts out the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.630 
fluoride in one step it cuts out the
acid<00:01:36.360> derivative<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.350> fluoride<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
acid derivative of fluoride it is the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.120

only<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.600> does<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.040> the
