from main unit to the rear unit so your
SD<00:02:22.130> card<00:02:22.340> gets<00:02:22.550> stored<00:02:22.820> right<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:23.360> here

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
SD card gets stored right in here

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.270 
SD card gets stored right in here
so<00:02:25.220> both<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.180> wires<00:02:26.390> going<00:02:27.380> along<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
so both of the wires going along the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.950 
so both of the wires going along the
headliner<00:02:29.740> tuck<00:02:30.740> it<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.690> then<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.810> will

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
headliner tuck it in and then you will

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.080 
headliner tuck it in and then you will
see<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:34.900> gap<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.110> between<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.680> B<00:02:37.130> pillar<00:02:37.370> simply

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
see a gap in between a B pillar simply

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.060

thing you can sort of push out pull this
thing<00:02:52.430> out<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:53.090> make<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.270> gap<00:02:53.540> where<00:02:54.380> are<00:02:54.470> some

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
thing out to make a gap where are some

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.130 
thing out to make a gap where are some
other<00:02:54.860> cars<00:02:55.160> with<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:55.970> side<00:02:56.180> simply<00:02:56.930> take

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
other cars with this side simply take

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.770 
other cars with this side simply take
this<00:02:57.260> off<00:02:57.440> with<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.740> plaque<00:02:57.980> face<00:02:58.220> and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
this off with the plaque face and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.480 
this off with the plaque face and
there's<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.870> screw<00:03:00.110> behind<00:03:00.710> this<00:03:00.920> airbag<00:03:01.280> side

there's a screw behind this airbag side

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.310 
there's a screw behind this airbag side
then<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.790> can<00:03:01.970> somewhat<00:03:02.300> unscrew<00:03:02.960> it<00:03:02.990> a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
then you can somewhat unscrew it a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.870 
then you can somewhat unscrew it a
little<00:03:03.620> bit<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.040> then<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.430> can<00:03:04.580> make<00:03:04.730> more

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
little bit and then you can make more

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.460 
little bit and then you can make more
gap<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.540> put<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:06.320> put<00:03:06.370> wires<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.180> then<00:03:09.110> what<00:03:09.440> I

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
gap to put to put wires and then what I

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.670 
gap to put to put wires and then what I
don't<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.280> do<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.730> don't<00:03:10.790> like<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.680> take

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
don't like to do is I don't like to take

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.160 
don't like to do is I don't like to take
anything<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.370> any<00:03:13.580> any<00:03:13.940> pieces<00:03:14.270> off<00:03:14.570> so<00:03:15.080> you

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
anything to any any pieces off so you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.680 
anything to any any pieces off so you
can<00:03:15.260> simply<00:03:15.550> make<00:03:16.550> room<00:03:16.850> in<00:03:16.880> between<00:03:17.510> this

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
can simply make room in between this

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.290 
can simply make room in between this
rubber<00:03:17.990> part<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.530> your<00:03:19.100> vehicle<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.700> simply

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
rubber part of your vehicle and simply

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.300 
rubber part of your vehicle and simply
run<00:03:20.450> your<00:03:20.630> wire<00:03:20.840> like<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:22.720> okay<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.020> then<00:03:24.890> in

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
run your wire like this okay and then in

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.830 
run your wire like this okay and then in
between<00:03:25.520> this<00:03:26.170> spot<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:28.880> again<00:03:29.209> -

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
between this spot and then again -

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.449 
between this spot and then again -
between<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.350> rubber<00:03:30.620> part<00:03:30.890> as<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.130> can<00:03:31.280> see

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
between the rubber part as you can see

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.880 
between the rubber part as you can see
see<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.820> wire<00:03:32.000> there<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.930> simply<00:03:33.170> run<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.680> all

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
see the wire there and simply run it all

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:43.280 
see the wire there and simply run it all
the<00:03:33.920> way<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.520> back<00:03:34.720> let's<00:03:35.720> go<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.230> dog

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.589 

so<00:03:44.689> from<00:03:45.689> the<00:03:45.810> back<00:03:46.879> this<00:03:47.879> is<00:03:47.939> where<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.420> have

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
so from the back this is where you have

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.420 
so from the back this is where you have
to<00:03:48.780> start<00:03:49.079> watch<00:03:49.560> yourself

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
to start watch yourself

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.229 
to start watch yourself
because<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.510> wire<00:03:51.689> is<00:03:51.720> quite<00:03:52.409> long<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.239> in

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
because the wire is quite long and in

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.990 
because the wire is quite long and in
the<00:03:54.360> wire<00:03:54.569> um<00:03:55.140> if<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.950> run<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.459> all<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.819> way<00:03:56.939> to

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
the wire um if you run it all the way to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.300 
the wire um if you run it all the way to
the<00:03:57.239> back<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:58.319> might<00:03:58.560> have

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
the back you might have

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.940 
the back you might have
I<00:03:59.340> mean<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.819> will<00:04:00.120> see<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.569> lot<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.840> wire<00:04:01.650> that's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
I mean you will see a lot of wire that's

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.420 
I mean you will see a lot of wire that's
left<00:04:02.760> for<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.480> use<00:04:03.659> and<00:04:04.040> what<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.159> have<00:04:05.310> to

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
left for you to use and what you have to

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.660 
left for you to use and what you have to
do<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.730> find<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.150> gap<00:04:06.329> in<00:04:06.510> between<00:04:06.659> any<00:04:07.670> ipart's

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
do is find a gap in between any ipart's

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:20.599 
do is find a gap in between any ipart's
let's<00:04:09.659> see<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.170> can<00:04:10.379> get<00:04:10.500> some<00:04:10.650> legs<00:04:11.000> yes<00:04:19.579> yep

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
let's see if I can get some legs yes yep

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.430 
let's see if I can get some legs yes yep
so<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:23.000> usually<00:04:24.000> put<00:04:24.330> all<00:04:24.449> that<00:04:24.630> wire<00:04:24.870> extra

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
so I usually put all that wire extra

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.570 
so I usually put all that wire extra
wire<00:04:25.710> with<00:04:26.520> in<00:04:26.810> this<00:04:27.810> piece<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.830> lot<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.280> wire

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
wire with in this piece so a lot of wire

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.020 
wire with in this piece so a lot of wire
just<00:04:30.020> wrap<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.380> then<00:04:31.440> put<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.770> in<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:32.850> way

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
just wrap it and then put it in that way

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.750 
just wrap it and then put it in that way
you<00:04:33.090> can<00:04:33.300> hide<00:04:33.449> it<00:04:33.600> all<00:04:33.720> nicely<00:04:34.020> within<00:04:34.760> know

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
you can hide it all nicely within know

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.810 
you can hide it all nicely within know
within<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:36.780> vehicle<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.680> then<00:04:38.070> simply<00:04:38.580> run

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
within the vehicle and then simply run

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.420 
within the vehicle and then simply run
your<00:04:39.000> wire<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.539> way<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.139> then<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:41.010> your<00:04:41.190> rear

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
your wire this way and then to your rear

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.800 
your wire this way and then to your rear
unit<00:04:42.949> for<00:04:43.949> SUVs<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.760> wagon<00:04:45.120> they're<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> little

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
unit for SUVs and wagon they're a little

somewhere<00:05:19.050> really<00:05:19.320> really<00:05:19.470> difficult<00:05:20.660> but<00:05:21.660> I

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
somewhere really really difficult but I

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.420 
somewhere really really difficult but I
really<00:05:22.050> think<00:05:22.199> you<00:05:22.380> can<00:05:22.560> do<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:22.860> on<00:05:23.190> your<00:05:23.370> own

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
really think you can do this on your own

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.050 
really think you can do this on your own
and<00:05:23.820> even<00:05:24.479> for<00:05:24.810> SUVs<00:05:25.260> trucks

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
and even for SUVs trucks

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.279 
and even for SUVs trucks
this<00:05:27.539> is<00:05:27.690> totally<00:05:29.840> definitely<00:05:30.840> can<00:05:31.020> be<00:05:31.110> done

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
this is totally definitely can be done

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:41.930 
this is totally definitely can be done
on<00:05:31.500> your<00:05:31.650> own<00:05:31.830> ok<00:05:32.639> so<00:05:33.199> pick<00:05:34.520> that<00:05:35.520> was<00:05:35.729> it

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.029 

just<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.360> quick<00:05:43.600> walk<00:05:43.870> around<00:05:43.900> here

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.209 

the<00:05:50.029> unit<00:05:50.389> is<00:05:50.509> right<00:05:50.749> there<00:05:51.289> and<00:05:51.529> I<00:05:52.009> think

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
the unit is right there and I think

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.709 
the unit is right there and I think
that's<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.550> best<00:05:52.729> position<00:05:52.879> to<00:05:53.180> Mountaineer

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
that's the best position to Mountaineer

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.629 
that's the best position to Mountaineer
blackvue<00:05:54.229> there<00:05:54.860> are<00:05:54.919> 550

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
blackvue there are 550

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.549 
blackvue there are 550
I've<00:05:55.789> seen<00:05:56.180> people<00:05:56.360> mounting<00:05:56.990> age<00:05:59.559> mounting

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:00.559 
I've seen people mounting age mounting

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:03.429 
I've seen people mounting age mounting
it<00:06:00.710> here<00:06:01.009> mounting<00:06:01.879> it<00:06:02.029> there<00:06:02.300> right<00:06:03.050> up<00:06:03.229> there

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 
it here mounting it there right up there

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.679 
it here mounting it there right up there
but<00:06:04.069> I<00:06:04.129> think<00:06:04.219> the<00:06:04.580> center<00:06:04.849> position<00:06:05.029> is<00:06:05.509> the

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:05.689 
but I think the center position is the

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:08.649 
but I think the center position is the
best<00:06:05.930> position<00:06:06.740> for<00:06:07.309> black<00:06:07.430> view<00:06:07.759> and<00:06:08.240> this<00:06:08.599> is

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
best position for black view and this is

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.649 
best position for black view and this is
my<00:06:09.399> driving<00:06:10.399> eye<00:06:11.300> level<00:06:11.899> and<00:06:12.379> as<00:06:13.069> you<00:06:13.219> can<00:06:13.369> see

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
my driving eye level and as you can see

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.379 
my driving eye level and as you can see
nothing<00:06:14.659> disrupts<00:06:15.409> my<00:06:15.619> vision<00:06:16.520> so<00:06:17.089> which<00:06:17.240> is

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
nothing disrupts my vision so which is

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.409 
nothing disrupts my vision so which is
nice<00:06:17.740> about<00:06:18.740> block<00:06:19.159> view<00:06:19.399> it's<00:06:19.969> not<00:06:20.149> in<00:06:20.300> the

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
nice about block view it's not in the

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.049 
nice about block view it's not in the
vision<00:06:20.749> and<00:06:20.930> then<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.199> side<00:06:21.409> of<00:06:21.559> your<00:06:21.680> vision

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:22.059
