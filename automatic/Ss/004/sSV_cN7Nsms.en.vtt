00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 with the media game 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.250

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.480
 this week through an imitation game we 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.110
 one then she picked up a leaf from the tray and 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.670
 then he or she irritates dancing 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.740
 that is on the leaf 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.060

 dancer standing on the plate 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.449
 if this is correct then the dancer gets a point 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.199
 and whoever has the most points wins
