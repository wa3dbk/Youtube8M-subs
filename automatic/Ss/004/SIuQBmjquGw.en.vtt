00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.890
 can start the tutorial so already I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.330
 wanted to clarify that the chain was not 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 bad at all 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.289

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 customize the startup theme of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.100
 because I did it badly actually 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 told me I did it wrong 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.199
 I had a little messed up everything that was 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.270
 audio level audio quality is actually 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.470
 under cache not that I had made the video 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.290
 1 2 2 and that I had just published it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.320
 before the start of the school year 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.229
 it was the next day and in fact I 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.729
 went back to the internate so I did 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.710
 this video quickly once to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.280
 inside told me but the game is 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 loïc delete this video tattoo merdé 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.090
 so I have so I deleted the video the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.810
 quickly as possible and then bin it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.820
 you do not see the video anymore 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.470
 customize your screen better life 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 on the start screen 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.430
 it's the same thing so why I 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.840
 redo this tutoring because it was a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.640
 tutorial that I really wanted to do so 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.409
 he was important to me we will say I 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.180
 found the idea really not bad so 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.579
 I decided to make them ste foy 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.060
 better and I hope that this time I will have 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.070
 not mess up the audio 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.530
 So here we go directly 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.850

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.590
