00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
it's probably the better choice just

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.439 
it's probably the better choice just
because<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:41.470> can<00:00:41.620> for<00:00:42.340> one<00:00:42.519> colorless<00:00:42.910> have

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
because you can for one colorless have

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.660 
because you can for one colorless have
the<00:00:43.629> chance<00:00:43.900> to<00:00:44.019> burn<00:00:44.320> your<00:00:44.530> opponent<00:00:45.040> but

the chance to burn your opponent but
these<00:00:45.879> work<00:00:46.090> just<00:00:46.330> fine<00:00:46.570> if<00:00:46.750> you<00:00:46.840> can<00:00:47.019> get<00:00:47.199> your

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
these work just fine if you can get your

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.060 
these work just fine if you can get your
hands<00:00:47.440> on<00:00:47.590> those<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:49.090> 12<00:00:49.570> because<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.920> only

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
hands on those to 12 because you only

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
they call it the bat and bore but it's

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.920 
they call it the bat and bore but it's
the<00:01:03.820> one<00:01:03.970> that<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.180> get<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.449> starter<00:01:04.780> deck

the one that you get in the starter deck

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.430 
the one that you get in the starter deck
it<00:01:05.170> does<00:01:05.460> 154<00:01:06.460> for<00:01:06.670> energy<00:01:07.119> just<00:01:07.600> as<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.810> text<00:01:08.320> so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
it does 154 for energy just as a text so

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.740 
it does 154 for energy just as a text so
you<00:01:08.530> can<00:01:08.680> have<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:08.979> better<00:01:09.369> damage<00:01:09.850> output<00:01:10.030> if

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
you can have a better damage output if

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.390 
you can have a better damage output if
you<00:01:10.900> don't<00:01:11.049> feel<00:01:11.229> reliable<00:01:11.890> writing<00:01:12.190> too

retrieval<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.610> such<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.540> pretty<00:02:34.840> easy<00:02:34.990> to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
retrieval and such it's pretty easy to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.520 
retrieval and such it's pretty easy to
do<00:02:35.320> system<00:02:35.800> 120<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:37.600> only<00:02:37.720> really<00:02:37.900> need<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.470> I

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.780 
guess it since you're going to be
running<00:02:40.210> require<00:02:40.750> deoxys<00:02:41.500> possibly<00:02:42.400> alarm

evolutions like em born nine tails so if

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.460 
evolutions like em born nine tails so if
you<00:03:39.730> need<00:03:39.880> another<00:03:39.970> supporter<00:03:40.570> think<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.350> like

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470

to<00:04:20.200> burn<00:04:20.440> out<00:04:20.590> your<00:04:20.620> hand<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.070> then<00:04:21.160> use<00:04:21.370> this

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
to burn out your hand and then use this

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.820 
to burn out your hand and then use this
to<00:04:21.730> get<00:04:21.790> six<00:04:22.060> new<00:04:22.210> cards<00:04:22.600> it's<00:04:23.200> just<00:04:23.410> too<00:04:23.590> good

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
to get six new cards it's just too good

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.430 
to get six new cards it's just too good
and<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:25.210> great<00:04:25.420> thing<00:04:25.450> is<00:04:25.660> you<00:04:25.810> shuffle<00:04:26.320> in

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and the great thing is you shuffle in

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440 
and the great thing is you shuffle in
your<00:04:26.620> shuffle<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.670> into<00:04:27.910> your<00:04:28.030> deck<00:04:28.180> rather

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
your shuffle it into your deck rather

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.630 
your shuffle it into your deck rather
than<00:04:28.570> having<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.900> discard<00:04:29.320> it<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:29.740> it's<00:04:30.580> a

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
than having to discard it so it's a

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.390 
than having to discard it so it's a
pretty<00:04:30.820> solid<00:04:31.060> card<00:04:31.390> I<00:04:31.630> like<00:04:31.900> it

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.370 

moving<00:04:35.910> on<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.270> actual<00:04:36.360> trainers<00:04:36.990> we<00:04:37.169> have

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
moving on to the actual trainers we have

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.800 
moving on to the actual trainers we have
for<00:04:37.889> communication<00:04:38.639> lets<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.360> swap<00:04:39.540> out<00:04:39.780> a

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
for communication lets you swap out a

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.960 
for communication lets you swap out a
Pokemon<00:04:40.259> for<00:04:40.500> any<00:04:40.620> other<00:04:40.979> Pokemon<00:04:41.580> your<00:04:41.729> deck

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
Pokemon for any other Pokemon your deck

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.760 
Pokemon for any other Pokemon your deck
so<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.300> can<00:04:42.509> swap<00:04:42.750> out<00:04:42.870> your<00:04:42.990> basics<00:04:43.470> for<00:04:43.650> like

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
so you can swap out your basics for like

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.460 
so you can swap out your basics for like
evolutions<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.490> such<00:04:44.780> this<00:04:45.780> has<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.169> be<00:04:46.440> a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
evolutions and such this has to be a

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.920 
evolutions and such this has to be a
four<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.160> every<00:04:47.580> deck<00:04:47.729> in<00:04:47.880> my<00:04:48.060> opinion<00:04:48.360> it

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
four of and every deck in my opinion it

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.810 
four of and every deck in my opinion it
just<00:04:49.080> helps<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.500> set<00:04:49.740> up<00:04:49.919> your<00:04:49.949> Pokemon<00:04:50.639> and

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
just helps you set up your Pokemon and

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.779 
just helps you set up your Pokemon and
such<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.440> really<00:04:52.440> really<00:04:52.650> good<00:04:52.800> card<00:04:53.039> really

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
such and really really good card really

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.659 
such and really really good card really
good<00:04:56.479> moving<00:04:57.479> on<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.630> junk<00:04:57.990> arm<00:04:58.310> this<00:04:59.310> card<00:04:59.610> is

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
good moving on to junk arm this card is

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.909 
good moving on to junk arm this card is
really<00:04:59.940> sick<00:05:00.210> this<00:05:00.389> format<00:05:00.870> because<00:05:01.050> it

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
really sick this format because it

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.860 
really sick this format because it
combos<00:05:02.430> off<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.610> lot<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.910> stuff<00:05:03.240> like

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
combos off a lot of stuff like

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.279 
combos off a lot of stuff like
communication<00:05:04.470> energy<00:05:05.460> retrieval<00:05:05.970> as<00:05:06.289> most

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
communication energy retrieval as most

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.870 
communication energy retrieval as most
decks<00:05:07.590> probably<00:05:08.010> run<00:05:08.130> three<00:05:08.430> but<00:05:08.610> i<00:05:08.639> think

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
decks probably run three but i think

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.909 
decks probably run three but i think
this<00:05:09.030> techniques<00:05:09.479> for<00:05:09.840> just<00:05:10.590> because<00:05:10.770> you

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
this techniques for just because you

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.620 
this techniques for just because you
definitely<00:05:11.430> want<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:11.880> get<00:05:12.030> your<00:05:12.120> retrievals

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
definitely want to get your retrievals

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.830 
definitely want to get your retrievals
back<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.169> your<00:05:13.650> comms<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.490> plus<00:05:15.240> powers<00:05:15.660> and

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
back and your comms and plus powers and

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.920 
back and your comms and plus powers and
what<00:05:15.960> have<00:05:16.139> you<00:05:16.169> so<00:05:16.620> yeah<00:05:17.550> for<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.539> could<00:05:18.750> run

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
what have you so yeah for you could run

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.300 
what have you so yeah for you could run
three<00:05:19.199> if<00:05:19.320> you<00:05:19.500> really<00:05:19.560> don't<00:05:20.100> feel

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
three if you really don't feel

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.610 
three if you really don't feel
comfortable<00:05:20.370> running<00:05:20.850> for<00:05:21.150> though<00:05:24.500> next<00:05:25.500> up

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
comfortable running for though next up

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.400 
comfortable running for though next up
is<00:05:25.740> energy<00:05:26.070> retrieval<00:05:27.169> basically<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.289> get

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
is energy retrieval basically to get

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.290 
is energy retrieval basically to get
your<00:05:28.530> energy<00:05:28.620> vaccine<00:05:29.250> keep<00:05:29.430> attacking<00:05:29.729> or

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
your energy vaccine keep attacking or

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.180 
your energy vaccine keep attacking or
using<00:05:30.900> them<00:05:31.080> for<00:05:31.110> nine<00:05:31.349> tails<00:05:31.680> or<00:05:31.889> what<00:05:32.010> have

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
using them for nine tails or what have

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.320 
using them for nine tails or what have
you<00:05:33.440> most<00:05:34.440> XE<00:05:34.860> me<00:05:34.919> to<00:05:35.009> run<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.430> but<00:05:35.789> this<00:05:36.060> deck

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
you most XE me to run to but this deck

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.150 
you most XE me to run to but this deck
in<00:05:36.449> particular<00:05:36.930> needs<00:05:37.229> three<00:05:37.680> because<00:05:38.039> you

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
in particular needs three because you

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.219 
in particular needs three because you
got<00:05:38.280> to<00:05:38.370> be<00:05:38.430> discarding<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.180> lot<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.780> energy<00:05:39.930> due

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
got to be discarding a lot of energy due

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.650 
got to be discarding a lot of energy due
to<00:05:40.380> nine<00:05:40.560> tails<00:05:40.910> rather<00:05:41.910> than<00:05:42.090> other<00:05:42.270> decks<00:05:42.510> I

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
to nine tails rather than other decks I

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.270 
to nine tails rather than other decks I
don't<00:05:42.810> really<00:05:42.900> have<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.229> deal<00:05:43.410> with<00:05:43.530> that<00:05:43.590> so

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
don't really have to deal with that so

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.890 
don't really have to deal with that so
three<00:05:45.060> retrieval<00:05:46.940> next<00:05:47.940> is<00:05:48.060> too<00:05:48.240> rare<00:05:48.389> candy

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
three retrieval next is too rare candy

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.480 
three retrieval next is too rare candy
you<00:05:49.139> only<00:05:49.289> really<00:05:49.470> need<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.860> because<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.370> only

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
you only really need to because you only

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.629 
you only really need to because you only
run<00:05:50.699> to<00:05:51.539> 12<00:05:51.960> m<00:05:52.139> bar<00:05:52.409> that's<00:05:53.099> your<00:05:53.250> only<00:05:53.370> stage

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
run to 12 m bar that's your only stage

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.149 
run to 12 m bar that's your only stage
two<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.060> deck<00:05:54.270> however<00:05:54.990> if<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.260> up<00:05:55.770> the

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
two in the deck however if you up the

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.610 
two in the deck however if you up the
emboar<00:05:56.550> count<00:05:56.849> run<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.270> other<00:05:57.419> n<00:05:57.690> board<00:05:57.960> you

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
emboar count run the other n board you

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.110 
emboar count run the other n board you
might<00:05:58.830> consider<00:05:59.010> wanting<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.669> run<00:05:59.760> a<00:05:59.820> third

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
might consider wanting to run a third

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.260 
might consider wanting to run a third
rare<00:06:00.300> candy<00:06:01.099> so<00:06:02.099> yeah<00:06:02.400> that's<00:06:03.389> that<00:06:05.150> moving<00:06:06.150> on

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
rare candy so yeah that's that moving on

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.750 
rare candy so yeah that's that moving on
to<00:06:06.449> plus<00:06:06.720> power<00:06:07.070> lets<00:06:08.070> you<00:06:08.159> do<00:06:08.280> 10<00:06:08.550> extra

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
to plus power lets you do 10 extra

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.219 
to plus power lets you do 10 extra
damage<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:09.449> this<00:06:09.570> is<00:06:09.690> really<00:06:09.900> key<00:06:10.199> for

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
damage and this is really key for

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.000 
damage and this is really key for
certain<00:06:11.300> matchups<00:06:12.300> because<00:06:13.020> restroom<00:06:13.800> elite

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
certain matchups because restroom elite

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.100 
certain matchups because restroom elite
is<00:06:14.130> 120<00:06:14.760> but<00:06:14.970> a<00:06:15.000> lot<00:06:15.180> of<00:06:15.210> pokemon<00:06:15.720> seem<00:06:15.930> to<00:06:16.020> be

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
is 120 but a lot of pokemon seem to be

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.290 
is 120 but a lot of pokemon seem to be

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 
your mbar like if they try and reversal

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.180 
your mbar like if they try and reversal
it<00:06:41.010> out<00:06:41.190> and<00:06:41.460> this<00:06:42.240> card<00:06:42.479> really<00:06:43.260> really<00:06:43.529> gets

it out and this card really really gets

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.140 
it out and this card really really gets
yet<00:06:44.370> a<00:06:44.400> tough<00:06:44.729> that<00:06:44.880> you

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
yet a tough that you

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.270 
yet a tough that you
so<00:06:45.600> I<00:06:45.810> think<00:06:45.990> it's<00:06:46.260> a<00:06:46.350> one<00:06:46.530> of<00:06:46.650> some<00:06:46.890> people<00:06:47.160> run

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
so I think it's a one of some people run

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.550 
so I think it's a one of some people run
too<00:06:47.550> but<00:06:48.210> since<00:06:48.390> you<00:06:48.480> run<00:06:48.630> for<00:06:48.870> junk<00:06:49.140> arms<00:06:49.470> I

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
too but since you run for junk arms I

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:56.060 
too but since you run for junk arms I
think<00:06:49.770> one<00:06:50.160> is<00:06:50.190> good<00:06:51.180> enough<00:06:54.110> next<00:06:55.110> up<00:06:55.290> is<00:06:55.470> 11

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
think one is good enough next up is 11

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.480 
think one is good enough next up is 11
far<00:06:56.370> energy<00:06:56.790> I<00:06:57.780> like<00:06:58.350> the<00:06:58.500> extra<00:06:58.800> fire<00:06:59.070> because

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
far energy I like the extra fire because

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.620 
far energy I like the extra fire because
you're<00:06:59.580> going<00:06:59.670> to<00:06:59.730> be<00:06:59.790> discarding<00:07:00.300> a<00:07:00.360> lot<00:07:00.510> with

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
you're going to be discarding a lot with

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.780 
you're going to be discarding a lot with
nine<00:07:00.840> tails<00:07:01.140> so<00:07:01.590> it's<00:07:02.130> almost<00:07:02.280> probably

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
nine tails so it's almost probably

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.680 
nine tails so it's almost probably
around<00:07:02.880> ten<00:07:03.210> fire<00:07:03.510> but<00:07:03.780> i<00:07:03.900> recommend<00:07:04.260> 11<00:07:05.690> last

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
around ten fire but i recommend 11 last

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.600 
around ten fire but i recommend 11 last
but<00:07:06.960> not<00:07:07.050> least<00:07:07.110> is<00:07:07.560> three<00:07:08.010> electric<00:07:08.430> energy

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
but not least is three electric energy

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.340 
but not least is three electric energy
you<00:07:09.300> basically<00:07:09.510> need<00:07:09.810> these<00:07:10.020> so<00:07:10.170> you<00:07:10.230> can

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
you basically need these so you can

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.350 
you basically need these so you can
attack<00:07:10.620> the<00:07:10.830> requires<00:07:11.160> a<00:07:11.280> deoxys<00:07:11.820> i<00:07:12.030> think

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
attack the requires a deoxys i think

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.780 
attack the requires a deoxys i think
threes<00:07:12.630> i<00:07:12.660> saw<00:07:12.930> a<00:07:12.960> number<00:07:13.230> it's<00:07:14.130> not<00:07:14.310> too

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.790 
threes i saw a number it's not too

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.610 
threes i saw a number it's not too
little<00:07:15.090> but<00:07:15.750> it's<00:07:15.900> just<00:07:16.140> enough<00:07:16.410> that<00:07:16.440> you

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
little but it's just enough that you

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.260 
little but it's just enough that you
could<00:07:16.710> probably<00:07:17.010> drawn<00:07:17.460> to<00:07:17.700> it<00:07:17.820> by<00:07:17.940> the<00:07:18.000> time

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
could probably drawn to it by the time

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.650 
could probably drawn to it by the time
you<00:07:18.420> get<00:07:18.510> to<00:07:18.570> go<00:07:18.750> for<00:07:18.960> a<00:07:18.990> quasi<00:07:19.290> deoxys<00:07:20.660> so

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 
you get to go for a quasi deoxys so

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.930 
you get to go for a quasi deoxys so
that's<00:07:21.930> the<00:07:22.110> list<00:07:22.460> let<00:07:23.460> me<00:07:23.550> know<00:07:23.670> what<00:07:23.820> you

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
that's the list let me know what you

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.480 
that's the list let me know what you
