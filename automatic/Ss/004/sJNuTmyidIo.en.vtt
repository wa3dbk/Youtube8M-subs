eco-mat<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:25.220> question<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.759> actually<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
eco-mat the question is actually the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.260 
eco-mat the question is actually the
subject<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.440> lab<00:01:27.649> report<00:01:28.069> and<00:01:28.280> our<00:01:28.759> course

subject of the lab report and our course
to<00:01:29.899> find<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.319> answer<00:01:30.800> try<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.759> make<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.149> clear

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
to find the answer try to make a clear

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.649 
to find the answer try to make a clear
question<00:01:32.929> that<00:01:33.770> is<00:01:34.009> not<00:01:34.250> too<00:01:34.580> hard<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.479> to

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
question that is not too hard for you to

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.740 
question that is not too hard for you to
find<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.049> answer<00:01:36.440> after<00:01:37.340> we<00:01:38.090> came<00:01:38.330> up<00:01:38.539> with<00:01:38.720> a

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
find the answer after we came up with a

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.080 
find the answer after we came up with a
question<00:01:39.049> we<00:01:39.860> need<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.100> assume<00:01:40.580> what<00:01:40.970> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
question we need to assume what the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.270 
question we need to assume what the
answer<00:01:41.509> is<00:01:41.539> so<00:01:41.929> we<00:01:42.380> can<00:01:42.530> compare<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.009> the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
answer is so we can compare to the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.649 
answer is so we can compare to the
results<00:01:43.759> later<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.990> called<00:01:45.490> hypothesis<00:01:46.659> it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
results later that called hypothesis it

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.050 
results later that called hypothesis it
may<00:01:47.990> be<00:01:48.049> hard<00:01:48.500> for<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.399> find<00:01:49.729> an

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
may be hard for you to find an

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.660 
may be hard for you to find an
explanation<00:01:50.479> for<00:01:51.350> your<00:01:51.590> way<00:01:51.799> of<00:01:52.039> thinking

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
explanation for your way of thinking

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.539 
explanation for your way of thinking
but<00:01:53.569> try<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:53.899> think<00:01:54.080> about<00:01:54.500> our<00:01:54.860> risks<00:01:55.310> and

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
but try to think about our risks and

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.690 
but try to think about our risks and
about<00:01:56.020> hypothesis<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:57.979> can<00:01:58.340> really

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
about hypothesis that you can really

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.660 
about hypothesis that you can really
explain<00:01:59.509> what<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.990> choose<00:02:00.259> according<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.369> the

real reason for this lab report our

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.460 
real reason for this lab report our
hypothesis<00:02:07.219> is<00:02:07.720> marshmallows<00:02:08.720> because<00:02:09.140> it's

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
hypothesis is marshmallows because it's

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.470 
hypothesis is marshmallows because it's
loaded<00:02:09.859> with<00:02:09.890> sugar<00:02:10.070> which<00:02:10.850> has<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> lot<00:02:11.450> of

loaded with sugar which has a lot of
energy<00:02:11.780> energy<00:02:12.609> is<00:02:13.609> actually<00:02:14.180> what<00:02:14.359> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
energy energy is actually what the

experiment<00:07:17.960> in<00:07:18.530> this<00:07:18.800> experiment<00:07:19.520> we<00:07:19.880> learned

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
experiment in this experiment we learned

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.580 
experiment in this experiment we learned
about<00:07:21.110> ecology<00:07:21.650> and<00:07:22.060> in<00:07:23.060> this<00:07:23.270> experiment<00:07:24.140> we

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 
about ecology and in this experiment we

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.890 
about ecology and in this experiment we
learn<00:07:24.860> what<00:07:25.250> is<00:07:25.400> carrots<00:07:25.940> and<00:07:26.180> what<00:07:26.420> kind<00:07:26.750> of

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
learn what is carrots and what kind of

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.230 
learn what is carrots and what kind of
stuff<00:07:27.290> has<00:07:27.590> more<00:07:27.860> terrorists<00:07:28.370> this<00:07:29.060> is

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
stuff has more terrorists this is

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.390 
stuff has more terrorists this is
important<00:07:29.810> thing<00:07:30.020> what<00:07:30.320> that<00:07:30.710> we<00:07:30.920> needed<00:07:31.370> like

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
important thing what that we needed like

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.840 
important thing what that we needed like
then<00:07:32.180> using<00:07:32.690> that<00:07:33.200> urine<00:07:33.710> in<00:07:34.010> experiment

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.850 
then using that urine in experiment

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.720 
then using that urine in experiment
experiment<00:07:35.630> we<00:07:36.140> also<00:07:36.380> have<00:07:36.860> our<00:07:37.100> new<00:07:37.400> things

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730 
experiment we also have our new things

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.310 
experiment we also have our new things
to<00:07:38.390> learn<00:07:38.690> is<00:07:39.520> this<00:07:40.520> experiment<00:07:41.510> we<00:07:41.810> landed

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.320 
to learn is this experiment we landed

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.080 
to learn is this experiment we landed
the<00:07:42.530> cheese<00:07:42.830> bar<00:07:43.130> has<00:07:43.490> more

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.090 
the cheese bar has more

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.620 
the cheese bar has more
Colonel<00:07:44.750> Reed's<00:07:44.960> a<00:07:45.200> marshmallow<00:07:46.300> nursery<00:07:47.300> how

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:47.630 
Colonel Reed's a marshmallow nursery how

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.360 
Colonel Reed's a marshmallow nursery how
does<00:07:47.870> this<00:07:48.020> experiment<00:07:48.530> expand<00:07:49.280> your

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.370 
does this experiment expand your

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.460 
does this experiment expand your
knowledge<00:07:49.550> this<00:07:50.240> is<00:07:50.450> almost<00:07:50.810> same<00:07:51.050> thing<00:07:51.320> as

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.470 
knowledge this is almost same thing as

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.190 
knowledge this is almost same thing as
practice<00:07:51.950> but<00:07:52.370> this<00:07:52.640> part<00:07:52.880> we<00:07:53.060> like<00:07:53.270> we<00:07:53.600> you

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:54.200 
practice but this part we like we you

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.870 
practice but this part we like we you
know<00:07:54.380> what<00:07:54.590> we<00:07:54.710> learn<00:07:54.950> including<00:07:55.190> connection

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:55.880 
know what we learn including connection

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.780 
know what we learn including connection
so<00:07:56.360> in<00:07:56.810> your<00:07:57.050> experiment<00:07:57.650> we<00:07:57.890> don't<00:07:58.100> Aries<00:07:58.580> and

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:58.790 
so in your experiment we don't Aries and

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.420 
so in your experiment we don't Aries and
digesting<00:07:59.330> care<00:07:59.900> is<00:08:00.140> always<00:08:00.380> digest<00:08:01.100> in<00:08:01.310> the

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.430 
digesting care is always digest in the

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:09.490 
digesting care is always digest in the
body

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:09.500 

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.560 

you
