00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.830 
together and try to win games and he's
possible<00:03:30.189> so<00:03:30.370> we're<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.299> right<00:03:31.420> track<00:03:31.689> right

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
possible so we're the right track right

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.899 
possible so we're the right track right
now<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.310> he's<00:03:33.310> got<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.579> know<00:03:33.730> some<00:03:33.879> things

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.640 
now and he's got it to know some things
differently<00:03:34.540> seemed<00:03:35.019> like<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.170> smooth<00:03:35.500> line

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
differently seemed like a smooth line

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.110 
differently seemed like a smooth line
between<00:03:35.829> you<00:03:36.069> and<00:03:36.250> Linda<00:03:36.549> Mike<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.849> where<00:03:36.970> you

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
between you and Linda Mike to where you

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.490 
between you and Linda Mike to where you
could<00:03:37.239> kind<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.480> attack<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.989> he<00:03:38.049> can<00:03:38.200> pick<00:03:38.379> his

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
could kind of attack and he can pick his

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.170 
could kind of attack and he can pick his
spots<00:03:38.769> off<00:03:38.950> yeah<00:03:39.129> yeah<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.609> think<00:03:39.670> we're

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
spots off yeah yeah I think we're

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.910
