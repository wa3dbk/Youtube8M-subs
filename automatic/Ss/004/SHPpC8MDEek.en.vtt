00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
whether this will will not happen I'd

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.920 
whether this will will not happen I'd
probably<00:01:32.790> still<00:01:33.090> say<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.479> won't<00:01:33.659> happen

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
probably still say this won't happen

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.830 
probably still say this won't happen
it's<00:01:34.560> still<00:01:34.770> unlikely<00:01:35.130> still<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> long<00:01:36.000> shot<00:01:36.030> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it's still unlikely still a long shot in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.510 
it's still unlikely still a long shot in
my<00:01:37.049> opinion<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.619> still<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.070> know<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> long

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
my opinion this is still you know a long

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.090 
my opinion this is still you know a long
shot<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.090> John<00:01:39.750> Cena<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.200> turn<00:01:40.500> heel<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> think

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
shot for John Cena to turn heel I think

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.429 
shot for John Cena to turn heel I think
a<00:01:41.159> much<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.549> likely<00:01:41.790> situation<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.840> John

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
a much more likely situation is John

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.289 
a much more likely situation is John
Cena's<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.070> defeat<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> rock<00:01:44.790> clean<00:01:45.090> at

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
Cena's to just defeat the rock clean at

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.130 
Cena's to just defeat the rock clean at
WrestleMania<00:01:45.990> 29<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> rock<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
WrestleMania 29 and I know the rock is

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.840 
WrestleMania 29 and I know the rock is

room estate another scenario that has
been<00:01:52.680> discussed<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.329> John<00:01:54.329> seen<00:01:54.570> defeat<00:01:54.960> in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
Extreme Rules to team up together to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
Extreme Rules to team up together to

face the shield and defeat the shield

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.200 
face the shield and defeat the shield
now<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> more<00:02:05.369> likely<00:02:05.759> scenario<00:02:05.790> in

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
now that's the more likely scenario in

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.990 
now that's the more likely scenario in
my<00:02:06.329> opinion<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.840> could<00:02:07.829> imagine<00:02:08.009> ww<00:02:08.729> doing

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
my opinion I could imagine ww doing

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.990 
my opinion I could imagine ww doing
something<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.690> maybe<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
something like that maybe that them to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.710 
something like that maybe that them to
dishing<00:02:12.390> out<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.629> shield's<00:02:12.989> first<00:02:13.230> two<00:02:13.410> feet

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
dishing out the shield's first two feet

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.600 
dishing out the shield's first two feet
you<00:02:13.840> know<00:02:13.960> if<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.740> rocks<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> team<00:02:15.460> that

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
you know if the rocks on the team that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.010 
you know if the rocks on the team that
dishes<00:02:15.970> out<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.210> shield's<00:02:16.510> first<00:02:16.720> defeat

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
dishes out the shield's first defeat

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.650 
dishes out the shield's first defeat
that<00:02:17.230> would<00:02:17.440> look<00:02:17.650> legitimate<00:02:18.460> if<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.450> see

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that would look legitimate if you see

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.050 
that would look legitimate if you see
what<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:19.930> saying<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.650> would<00:02:20.860> look<00:02:21.040> real<00:02:21.550> now

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
what I'm saying it would look real now

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.310 
what I'm saying it would look real now
the<00:02:22.120> only<00:02:22.390> other<00:02:22.570> thing<00:02:22.660> about<00:02:22.870> Johnson

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
the only other thing about Johnson

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.840 
the only other thing about Johnson
obtained<00:02:23.860> here<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.190> being<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.490> leader<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.760> the

obtained here on being the leader of the
shield<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.690> she<00:02:25.900> would<00:02:26.050> have<00:02:26.260> interfered

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
shield is that she would have interfered

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.700 
shield is that she would have interfered

the leader of the shoe I know don't get
me<00:02:56.410> wrong<00:02:56.440> w<00:02:56.920> w<00:02:57.160> doesn't<00:02:57.400> think<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.730> deeply<00:02:58.180> I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
me wrong w w doesn't think that deeply I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.020 
me wrong w w doesn't think that deeply I
get<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.750> but<00:02:59.350> he<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.490> wouldn't<00:03:00.700> make<00:03:01.000> a

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
get that but he just wouldn't make a

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.550 
get that but he just wouldn't make a
whole<00:03:01.300> lot<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.510> sense<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.110> lot<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.320> ways

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
whole lot of sense in a lot of ways

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.530 
whole lot of sense in a lot of ways
although<00:03:02.860> i<00:03:02.950> still<00:03:03.070> think<00:03:03.400> would<00:03:03.580> be<00:03:03.700> also<00:03:03.880> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
although i still think would be also the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.470 
although i still think would be also the
more<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.470> snow<00:03:05.740> I'd<00:03:06.100> prefer<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.610> see<00:03:06.820> instead

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
more the snow I'd prefer to see instead

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.560 
more the snow I'd prefer to see instead
of<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.990> rock<00:03:08.200> winning<00:03:09.040> clean<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.700> then<00:03:10.300> John

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
of the rock winning clean and then John
