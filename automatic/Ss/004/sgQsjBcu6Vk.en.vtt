00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.819 
bladder they can rupture you can have
quite<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> large<00:03:47.909> volume<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.509> blood<00:03:48.870> within<00:03:49.560> the

abdominal cavity before one recognizes

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.319 
abdominal cavity before one recognizes
that<00:03:52.949> this<00:03:53.220> patient<00:03:53.669> has<00:03:53.819> internal<00:03:54.299> bleeding

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
that this patient has internal bleeding

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.449 
that this patient has internal bleeding
and<00:03:54.870> some<00:03:55.349> of<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> classic<00:03:56.040> signs<00:03:56.310> of

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
and some of the classic signs of

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.699 
and some of the classic signs of
internal<00:03:56.819> bleeding<00:03:57.049> patients<00:03:58.049> go<00:03:58.169> into<00:03:58.409> shock

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
internal bleeding patients go into shock

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.649 
internal bleeding patients go into shock
and<00:03:58.949> sharp<00:03:59.729> means<00:04:00.000> they're<00:04:00.209> going<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.479> drop

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
and sharp means they're going to drop

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.569 
and sharp means they're going to drop
your<00:04:00.870> blood<00:04:01.079> pressure<00:04:01.409> become<00:04:02.340> very

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
your blood pressure become very

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.089 
your blood pressure become very
tachycardic<00:04:03.449> and<00:04:03.629> just<00:04:03.989> really<00:04:04.229> short<00:04:05.009> of

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
tachycardic and just really short of

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.770 
tachycardic and just really short of
breath<00:04:05.159> and<00:04:05.639> decreased<00:04:06.359> level<00:04:06.720> of

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
breath and decreased level of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.020 
breath and decreased level of
consciousness<00:04:07.079> so<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.099> really<00:04:08.370> need<00:04:08.699> to<00:04:08.729> pay

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
consciousness so you really need to pay

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.939 
consciousness so you really need to pay
close<00:04:09.329> attention<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.169> you<00:04:10.199> are<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.680> Miss

need to discuss once we've gotten past

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.379 
need to discuss once we've gotten past
abdominal<00:04:23.070> trauma<00:04:23.370> what<00:04:23.700> happens<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.270> the

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
abdominal trauma what happens to the

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.170 
abdominal trauma what happens to the
patient<00:04:24.870> with<00:04:25.440> spinal<00:04:26.039> trauma

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
patient with spinal trauma

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.659 
patient with spinal trauma
well<00:04:27.419> we<00:04:27.539> know<00:04:27.690> that<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.110> spine<00:04:28.560> is<00:04:28.949> one<00:04:29.550> of

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
well we know that the spine is one of

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.810 
well we know that the spine is one of
those<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.539> spine<00:04:30.870> runs<00:04:31.169> we<00:04:32.100> have<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.370> spinal

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
those the spine runs we have the spinal

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.640 
those the spine runs we have the spinal
column<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.419> of<00:04:33.539> course<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.930> have<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.199> spinal

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
column and of course you have the spinal

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.070 
column and of course you have the spinal
cord<00:04:34.889> we<00:04:35.550> have<00:04:35.759> what<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.000> called<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.509> very<00:04:36.780> high

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
cord we have what is called a very high

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.230 
cord we have what is called a very high
network<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.800> nerves<00:04:38.039> in<00:04:38.340> that<00:04:38.370> area<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
network of nerves in that area and

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.240 
network of nerves in that area and
depending<00:04:39.990> where<00:04:40.169> your<00:04:40.320> injury<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.889> that's

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
depending where your injury is that's

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.650 
depending where your injury is that's
where<00:04:41.430> you're<00:04:41.610> going<00:04:41.759> to<00:04:41.850> get<00:04:41.970> your<00:04:42.120> symptoms

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
where you're going to get your symptoms

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.290 
where you're going to get your symptoms
in<00:04:43.199> patients<00:04:43.530> typically<00:04:44.310> who<00:04:44.610> had<00:04:44.850> injuries

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
in patients typically who had injuries

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.600 
in patients typically who had injuries
of<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.449> spine<00:04:45.930> from<00:04:46.500> above<00:04:46.860> c3<00:04:47.580> like<00:04:47.820> c1<00:04:48.330> c2<00:04:48.660> c3

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
of the spine from above c3 like c1 c2 c3

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.860 
of the spine from above c3 like c1 c2 c3
usually<00:04:50.610> they<00:04:50.759> have<00:04:50.789> difficulty<00:04:51.630> breathing

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
usually they have difficulty breathing

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.409 
usually they have difficulty breathing
and<00:04:52.350> could<00:04:52.860> easily<00:04:53.130> wind<00:04:53.639> up<00:04:53.820> on<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.030> ventilator

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
and could easily wind up on a ventilator

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.200 
and could easily wind up on a ventilator
like<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.990> case<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:55.560> patient<00:04:56.070> but<00:04:56.759> I<00:04:57.000> have

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
like the case of this patient but I have

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.260 
like the case of this patient but I have

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
who was involved in a car accident spine

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.060 
who was involved in a car accident spine
was<00:05:03.300> very<00:05:03.539> badly<00:05:03.870> fractured<00:05:04.289> in<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.650> cervical

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
was very badly fractured in the cervical

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.129

and the thighs and then you can do

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.540 
and the thighs and then you can do
something<00:05:33.479> called<00:05:33.960> dermatomes<00:05:34.560> where<00:05:34.919> you<00:05:35.370> do

something called dermatomes where you do
those<00:05:35.760> pinpricks<00:05:36.449> to<00:05:36.599> establish<00:05:37.229> how<00:05:37.680> sharp

those pinpricks to establish how sharp
or<00:05:38.400> dull<00:05:38.610> sensation<00:05:39.449> is<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:40.229> important<00:05:40.710> thing

period<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.300> time<00:05:46.729> I've<00:05:47.729> worked<00:05:48.120> with<00:05:48.240> a<00:05:48.360> nurse

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
period of time I've worked with a nurse

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.540 
period of time I've worked with a nurse
who<00:05:48.780> said<00:05:49.020> she<00:05:49.289> had<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.500> spinal<00:05:49.889> injury<00:05:50.130> and

who said she had a spinal injury and

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.700 
who said she had a spinal injury and
they<00:05:50.639> said<00:05:50.849> she'd<00:05:51.030> never<00:05:51.060> walk<00:05:51.300> again<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:52.110> she

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
they said she'd never walk again and she

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.320 
they said she'd never walk again and she
was<00:05:52.860> telling<00:05:53.190> me<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.430> story<00:05:53.490> as<00:05:53.970> a<00:05:54.000> nurse<00:05:54.300> she

was walking she'd very normal life so
you<00:05:57.870> cannot<00:05:58.199> just<00:05:58.440> write<00:05:58.740> it<00:05:58.889> off<00:05:59.039> and<00:05:59.280> say

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
you cannot just write it off and say

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.310 
you cannot just write it off and say
just<00:05:59.669> because<00:05:59.849> someone's<00:06:00.750> had<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:00.960> spinal

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320

life<00:06:03.800> anymore<00:06:04.800> it<00:06:05.039> doesn't<00:06:05.070> work<00:06:05.490> that<00:06:05.520> way

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
life anymore it doesn't work that way

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.969 
life anymore it doesn't work that way
you<00:06:06.509> just<00:06:06.720> do<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:06.990> best<00:06:07.169> you<00:06:07.320> can<00:06:07.409> but<00:06:07.800> these

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
you just do the best you can but these

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.010 
you just do the best you can but these
spaces<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:08.460> typically<00:06:08.820> when<00:06:09.479> there<00:06:09.659> is<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:09.810> lot

of swelling immediately following trauma
it's<00:06:12.659> very<00:06:12.960> hard<00:06:13.320> to<00:06:13.380> tell<00:06:13.710> what's<00:06:13.949> going<00:06:14.039> to

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
it's very hard to tell what's going to

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.140 
it's very hard to tell what's going to
happen<00:06:14.580> for<00:06:14.729> the<00:06:14.820> future<00:06:15.349> so<00:06:16.970> usually<00:06:17.970> what

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
happen for the future so usually what

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.050 
happen for the future so usually what

like<00:06:46.000> to<00:06:46.030> discuss<00:06:46.300> um<00:06:46.860> spinal<00:06:47.860> injuries

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
like to discuss um spinal injuries

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.909 
like to discuss um spinal injuries
typically<00:06:48.669> we<00:06:48.880> always<00:06:49.180> think<00:06:49.419> of<00:06:49.660> having<00:06:50.650> that

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
typically we always think of having that

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.610 
typically we always think of having that
trauma<00:06:51.430> patient<00:06:52.000> who<00:06:52.570> is<00:06:52.600> paralyzed<00:06:53.350> from<00:06:53.530> the

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
waist down well there is something which

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.510 
waist down well there is something which
is<00:06:55.870> rather<00:06:56.050> special<00:06:56.680> called<00:06:56.860> central<00:06:57.280> cord

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
is rather special called central cord

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.790 
is rather special called central cord
syndrome<00:06:57.580> I've<00:06:58.330> not<00:06:58.540> really<00:06:59.110> seen<00:06:59.230> it<00:06:59.530> that

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
syndrome I've not really seen it that

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.770 
syndrome I've not really seen it that
often<00:07:00.040> over<00:07:00.490> all<00:07:00.669> these<00:07:00.850> years<00:07:01.180> probably<00:07:01.419> two

opposite way and in these patients what
you<00:07:06.130> have<00:07:06.370> is<00:07:06.639> full<00:07:07.330> use<00:07:07.630> of<00:07:07.660> the<00:07:07.960> lower

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:08.139 
you have is full use of the lower

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:10.950 
you have is full use of the lower
extremities<00:07:08.860> and<00:07:09.100> they<00:07:09.610> have<00:07:09.820> loss<00:07:10.060> of<00:07:10.330> motion

or very little use of their upper
extremities<00:07:13.690> I<00:07:13.930> saw<00:07:14.380> the<00:07:14.440> case<00:07:14.740> of<00:07:14.979> a<00:07:15.040> young
