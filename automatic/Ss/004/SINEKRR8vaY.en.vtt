which<00:02:03.880> i<00:02:04.000> have<00:02:04.149> yet<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.539> review<00:02:04.899> so<00:02:05.829> those<00:02:06.100> will

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
which i have yet to review so those will

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.300 
which i have yet to review so those will
be<00:02:06.310> coming<00:02:06.520> up<00:02:06.640> in<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.850> coming<00:02:07.090> weeks<00:02:07.299> I
