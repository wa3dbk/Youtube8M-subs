00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.540
 share with you the greatest of 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.520
 telepizza the family day are the 14th 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.000
 and 15 and their family pizzas to five 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.340
 euros 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.320
 take advantage telepizza the secret is in 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.510
 the mass or divi good night 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.850
 first thing you said in the previous one 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.400
 party that had illusion for the cup 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.870
 but what was important was the league but 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.580
 I suppose it will be a disappointment not to follow 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.580
 in the cup 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.580
 Y 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.510
 If it's a big disappointment we wanted 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.010
 move to the next round of the cup 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.879
 we played against a good team is 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.100
 a good team has played very well and has 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.100
 been a very good cup eliminator 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.059
 but I think if you have the option of 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.210
 choose I prefer to do well in the league 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.650
 and anyway the players is 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.800
 soft everything for in this tie 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.860
 have played very well force peak time is 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.020
 possibly we lost the game in the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.190
 first match cost us but the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.700
 performance of the players today has been 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.700
 first class 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.410
 you tell me that the team played well 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.850
 that the players have given everything 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.400
 maybe it has lacked a bit of aggressiveness 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.960
 in attack in those arrivals by bands 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960
 put several balls to the area 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.870
 without scoring more goals 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.800
 but we have passed the ball well today because 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.800
 we have had good possession 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.660
 We have had bad centers of 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.390
 principle in the good the party has been 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.310
 a disappointment not to have done more 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.310
 optimists but the players have 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.180
 worked hard to make it better and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.310
 what they have to do now is follow 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.000
 working to improve and do it 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.660
 best 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.740
 throughout the league we have not marked 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.080
 enough goals and we have not created 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.940
 enough opportunities is something in 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.270
 that we have to improve 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.500
 yes davis 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.020
 logically I have to ask 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.790
 what happened to the referee you have 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.140
 been expelled if the good expelled 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.360
 many times during his career he has 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.740
 seen practically from the fourth 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.600
 he was very nervous he was not liking 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.120
 the referee's treatment towards the real 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.120
 society maybe the way to go 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.890
 words is not the right word 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.360
 I was nervous 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.720
 I think I believe that the right to take 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.090
 decisions in wrong box 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.000
 Owens has stopped me from two decisions 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.650
 wrong and I think these two 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.800
 decisions was an error on the part of the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.200
 referee 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:12.500
 they also take many many yellow 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.270
 here in Spain is the country where 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.440
 yellow are removed are the meters 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.410
 Spanish or the arbitrators who 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.840
 yellow they take out of all europe 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.300
 and today after three or four minutes 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.240
 it's a cup game a great match of 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.730
 team spirit but the referee 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.459
 I wanted to take football tico the spirit of 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.130
 of the game before the people wanted to see 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.750
 speed I wanted to see action or where 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.580
 incorrect and the two decisions by the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.030
 that they have taken me yellow they were 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.030
 incorrect 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.090
 good night you think the lack of 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.830
 your equipment to be superior to 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.260
 villarreal in the elminate as he says 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.260
 have more scoring chances or something more 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.130
 james and three times 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.540
 van steen and I think now it's a good 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.760
 team play football well I'm a 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.170
 taste is power have a good style 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.019
 for your game 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.200
 There are varied center objects varied in 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.459
 the moment I think they are sober us 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.950
 definitely 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.980
 we have to work a lot 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.260
 to get closer to his level there was no 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.780
 protective news but today it has not been 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.100
 the day to vila-real now deserved a 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.000
 victory but I'll tell you that I think 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.000
 that the Villarreal is a great team 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.510
 and going back to the origin of my question the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.850
 first cup unfortunately is already 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.500
 now the league comes and they come 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.380
 two home games as is the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.040
 situation of points in the table 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.040
 very important two meetings 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.070
 and if all league matches have been 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.830
 important since I've arrived not only 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.780
 to the next 2 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.460
 you have to win your matches and to 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.350
 get your points we have not won the 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.160
 weekend matches this season that's 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.070
 obvious 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.530
 dv and we have to try to do everything 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.810
 that we can concentrate on the 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.400
 next party declared we have 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.590
 had the opportunity to win at 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.740
 grenade or to win to the lift a great 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.180
 victory against Barcelona we have to 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.300
 try to win games matches 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.580
 that we can then will wheaton wilton 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.250
 but it has been going to put optimal something of 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.610
 all season has not been a thing of a 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.610
 match
