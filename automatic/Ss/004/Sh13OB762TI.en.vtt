doughnuts and park card like really
really<00:01:30.960> use<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.590> card<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:33.140> what<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.320> Rigby

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
really use the card but what I Rigby

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.130 
really use the card but what I Rigby
they<00:01:35.430> basically<00:01:35.820> learn<00:01:36.300> how<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.960> nuts

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
they basically learn how to do go nuts

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.560 
they basically learn how to do go nuts
so<00:01:37.800> they<00:01:38.100> go<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.550> donuts<00:01:38.880> penneth<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
so they go to the donuts penneth on and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.110

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
come up to a duo that's pretty much a

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.020 
come up to a duo that's pretty much a
complete<00:01:46.020> replica<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:47.160> Carter<00:01:47.730> and<00:01:47.850> Briggs

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
complete replica of Carter and Briggs

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.180 
complete replica of Carter and Briggs
all<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:48.900> down<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.110> their<00:01:49.440> vehicle<00:01:49.920> which

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
all the way down to their vehicle which

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.860 
all the way down to their vehicle which
is<00:01:50.430> perfect<00:01:50.940> for<00:01:51.090> donuts<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:53.420> what<00:01:54.420> correctly

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
is perfect for donuts so what correctly

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.100 
is perfect for donuts so what correctly
they're<00:01:55.050> not<00:01:55.229> backing<00:01:55.440> down<00:01:55.620> so<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.900> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
they're not backing down so like so the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200 
they're not backing down so like so the
two<00:01:58.290> teams<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.890> against<00:01:59.220> each<00:01:59.280> other<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.820> they

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
two teams go against each other and they

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.180 
two teams go against each other and they
end<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.570> creating<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.140> vortex<00:02:02.420> which<00:02:04.040> puts<00:02:05.040> them

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
end up creating a vortex which puts them

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.490 
end up creating a vortex which puts them
in<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.400> really<00:02:05.729> crazy<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.630> situation<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in a really crazy to my situation and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.199 
in a really crazy to my situation and
you<00:02:08.040> know<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.250> fighting<00:02:08.580> within<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:09.030> vortex

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
you know the fighting within the vortex

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.860 
you know the fighting within the vortex
and<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:11.070> correctly<00:02:11.520> they<00:02:11.850> choose<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.600> go

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and I more correctly they choose to go

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.060 
and I more correctly they choose to go
to<00:02:13.340> basically<00:02:14.340> spin<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.790> vortex<00:02:15.330> and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
to basically spin with the vortex and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.890 
to basically spin with the vortex and
they<00:02:17.070> find<00:02:17.580> their<00:02:17.700> way<00:02:17.850> out<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.450> end<00:02:18.810> up

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
they find their way out and end up

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.860 
they find their way out and end up
