00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.960 

over<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> decade<00:00:28.590> ago<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.040> was<00:00:29.310> introduced<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
over a decade ago I was introduced to a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.729 
over a decade ago I was introduced to a
game<00:00:30.239> that<00:00:30.419> my<00:00:30.570> friends<00:00:30.960> claimed<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.470> just

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
game that my friends claimed was just

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.130 
game that my friends claimed was just
too<00:00:31.919> hard<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> play<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> understand

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
too hard to play from what I understand

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.360 
too hard to play from what I understand
they<00:00:34.290> couldn't<00:00:34.590> make<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.829> past<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> third

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
they couldn't make it past the third

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.790 
they couldn't make it past the third
level<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.270> boldly<00:00:37.230> took<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
level or so I boldly took up the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
level or so I boldly took up the
challenge<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.310> found<00:00:39.060> myself<00:00:39.270> hooked<00:00:39.630> on<00:00:39.810> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
challenge and found myself hooked on a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.470 
challenge and found myself hooked on a
game<00:00:40.079> called<00:00:40.320> Darius<00:00:40.829> twin<00:00:41.190> at<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.239> time<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
game called Darius twin at the time I

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420 
game called Darius twin at the time I
wasn't<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.170> aware<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> Darius<00:00:44.040> series

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
wasn't really aware of the Darius series

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
wasn't really aware of the Darius series
but<00:00:45.000> everything<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.360> makes<00:00:45.570> Darius<00:00:45.990> games

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
but everything that makes Darius games

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.040 
but everything that makes Darius games
while<00:00:46.680> Darius<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.910> game<00:00:48.150> along<00:00:49.020> with

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
while Darius is in this game along with

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.530 
while Darius is in this game along with
some<00:00:49.200> interesting<00:00:49.680> twists<00:00:50.510> thankfully<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
some interesting twists thankfully I

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.270 
some interesting twists thankfully I
found<00:00:51.900> that<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.170> more<00:00:52.620> than<00:00:52.800> playable

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
found that it was more than playable

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.090 
found that it was more than playable
despite<00:00:53.490> their<00:00:53.940> start<00:00:54.270> claims<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.100> Darius

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
despite their start claims and Darius

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.500 
despite their start claims and Darius
twin<00:00:56.340> would<00:00:56.520> become<00:00:56.760> one<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.970> my<00:00:57.090> earliest

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
twin would become one of my earliest

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:18.330

good news Darius twin does have multiple
endings<00:02:47.040> which<00:02:47.700> change<00:02:48.060> depending<00:02:48.450> how<00:02:48.599> many

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
endings which change depending how many

are well defined and colorful and the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.800 
are well defined and colorful and the
sound<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.190> decent<00:03:22.700> even<00:03:23.180> if<00:03:23.300> it's<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.540> little

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
sound is decent even if it's a little

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.200 
sound is decent even if it's a little
poorly<00:03:24.320> sampled<00:03:24.920> there<00:03:25.760> are<00:03:25.910> going<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.150> be

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
poorly sampled there are going to be

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.360 
poorly sampled there are going to be
times<00:03:26.510> where<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.930> sounds<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.410> little<00:03:27.800> off-key

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
times where it sounds a little off-key

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.210 
times where it sounds a little off-key
almost<00:03:29.030> like<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.210> detuned<00:03:29.690> piano<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:31.070> while

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
almost like a detuned piano so while

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.040 
almost like a detuned piano so while
among<00:03:31.460> the<00:03:31.640> tunes<00:03:31.850> are<00:03:32.000> very<00:03:32.150> catchy<00:03:32.450> the

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
among the tunes are very catchy the

among the tunes are very catchy the
sampling<00:03:33.620> really<00:03:34.100> doesn't<00:03:34.520> make<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.790> sound

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
sampling really doesn't make it sound

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.540 
sampling really doesn't make it sound
all<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.180> great<00:03:35.330> but<00:03:36.100> then<00:03:37.100> there's<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
all that great but then there's the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.690 
all that great but then there's the
mechanical<00:03:38.120> design<00:03:38.390> which<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.780> fantastic

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700

mouth that when it really comes down to
it<00:04:04.310> there<00:04:04.460> isn't<00:04:04.760> too<00:04:04.940> much<00:04:04.970> more<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.480> say

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
it there isn't too much more to say

about<00:04:05.750> Darius<00:04:06.200> twin<00:04:06.530> it's<00:04:07.490> solid<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.180> it

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
about Darius twin it's solid and it

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.840 
about Darius twin it's solid and it
offers<00:04:08.630> co-op<00:04:09.020> play<00:04:09.230> which<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:09.590> nice<00:04:09.800> but<00:04:10.670> it's

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
offers co-op play which is nice but it's

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.360 
offers co-op play which is nice but it's
predictable<00:04:11.390> in<00:04:11.570> almost<00:04:11.810> penalty-free<00:04:12.370> so

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
predictable in almost penalty-free so

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.700 
predictable in almost penalty-free so
just<00:04:13.670> how<00:04:13.820> does<00:04:13.880> it<00:04:14.240> stack<00:04:14.480> up<00:04:14.540> let's<00:04:15.500> take<00:04:15.680> a

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
just how does it stack up let's take a

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:25.749 
just how does it stack up let's take a
look

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.980

through the rose tinted glasses of
nostalgia<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:28.740> game<00:04:28.919> was<00:04:29.069> pretty<00:04:29.280> good<00:04:29.580> but

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
nostalgia this game was pretty good but

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.020 
nostalgia this game was pretty good but
visiting<00:04:31.319> it<00:04:31.470> again<00:04:31.770> has<00:04:32.400> left<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.759> little<00:04:32.910> to
