do that for you if you're not too
confident<00:02:07.960> with<00:02:08.140> code<00:02:08.380> that<00:02:09.039> once<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.610> stage

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
confident with code that once that stage

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.490 
confident with code that once that stage
is<00:02:10.090> out<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.360> way<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.750> creation<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.379> ads

is out the way the creation of the ads

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.600 
is out the way the creation of the ads
and<00:02:11.739> everything<00:02:12.040> else<00:02:12.159> is<00:02:12.430> quite

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and everything else is quite

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.229 
and everything else is quite
straightforward

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
straightforward

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.820 
straightforward

so it's definitely something I'd

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.930 
so it's definitely something I'd
