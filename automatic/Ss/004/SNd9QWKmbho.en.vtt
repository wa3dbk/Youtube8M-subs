00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
fencing to keep up I thought I almost

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.490 
fencing to keep up I thought I almost
quit<00:00:50.100> impressive<00:00:50.489> how<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.610> did<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:50.969> without

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
quit impressive how I did this without

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.110 
quit impressive how I did this without
realizing<00:00:52.500> how<00:00:52.620> thick<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.579> an<00:00:53.730> easy<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
realizing how thick it's an easy way to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
realizing how thick it's an easy way to
make<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:54.930> put<00:00:55.170> blocks<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.250> dirt

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
make this you just put blocks of dirt

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.010 
make this you just put blocks of dirt
there<00:00:56.699> watch<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> dirt<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:57.899> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
there watch the dirt there and then you

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.979 
there watch the dirt there and then you
put<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.070> top<00:00:59.430> then<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> put<00:01:00.329> wood

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
put one of them on top then you put wood

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229 
put one of them on top then you put wood
post<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.370> there<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.609> there<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.180> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
post there and there and there so you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000

creates the fence on that delete that
row<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> dirt<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:05.760> put<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> fence<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.510> top<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
row of dirt then put a fence on top of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.219 
row of dirt then put a fence on top of
them

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
them

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020

the moment it leads to the area with the
Union<00:04:44.900> Jack<00:04:44.930> then<00:04:45.410> I<00:04:45.500> made<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:48.220> plan<00:04:49.220> this<00:04:49.310> is<00:04:49.460> a

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
Union Jack then I made a plan this is a

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.400 
Union Jack then I made a plan this is a
block<00:04:49.790> missing<00:04:50.090> at<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.240> top<00:04:50.419> of<00:04:50.540> ever<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.990> think

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
block missing at the top of ever I think

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.880 
block missing at the top of ever I think
there's<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.620> lot<00:04:51.800> missing<00:04:51.890> to<00:04:52.220> talk<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:53.890> it's

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
there's a lot missing to talk that it's

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.320 
there's a lot missing to talk that it's
a<00:04:54.919> block<00:04:55.130> forcing<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.460> up<00:04:55.640> there

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
a block forcing it up there

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.850 
a block forcing it up there

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
why wait so they made this a new stitch

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.260 
why wait so they made this a new stitch

my<00:05:13.750> Canadian<00:05:14.229> friend<00:05:14.530> you<00:05:15.250> made<00:05:15.460> this<00:05:15.900> by

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
my Canadian friend you made this by

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.960 
my Canadian friend you made this by
because<00:05:17.530> he's<00:05:17.680> from<00:05:17.830> Canada<00:05:18.370> it's<00:05:18.550> six<00:05:18.850> hours

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
because he's from Canada it's six hours

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.969 
because he's from Canada it's six hours
behind<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:19.750> was<00:05:19.900> like<00:05:19.990> midnight<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.500> sit

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
behind so it was like midnight and sit

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.830

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
see midnight here and sit sit up there

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.680 
see midnight here and sit sit up there
so<00:05:23.020> I'd<00:05:23.110> say<00:05:23.350> we'd<00:05:23.740> like<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.949> get<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.370> do<00:05:24.490> this

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
so I'd say we'd like to get to do this

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.779 
so I'd say we'd like to get to do this
and<00:05:25.690> then<00:05:25.870> he<00:05:25.960> boots<00:05:26.169> his<00:05:26.620> Canadian<00:05:27.400> word<00:05:27.639> in

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
and then he boots his Canadian word in

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.480 
and then he boots his Canadian word in
this<00:05:27.940> Shack<00:05:28.210> just<00:05:28.590> pretty<00:05:29.590> much<00:05:29.770> but<00:05:29.979> bit<00:05:30.190> dark
