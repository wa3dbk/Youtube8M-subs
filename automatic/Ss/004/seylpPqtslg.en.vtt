course I decided to put my device up
against<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.599> had<00:00:30.689> read<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
against it because I had read that the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520 
if you get figure if you get five
accessories<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.180> make<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> discount

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.160 
accessories I think they make a discount
even<00:01:37.829> bigger<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.090> thought<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
even bigger but I thought that it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.740 
even bigger but I thought that it
wouldn't<00:01:40.470> charge<00:01:40.680> very<00:01:41.220> fast<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.420> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
wouldn't charge very fast for one and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
wouldn't charge very fast for one and
then<00:01:43.140> two<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> couldn't<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> case<00:01:44.610> on

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
then two that I couldn't have a case on

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.090 
then two that I couldn't have a case on
it<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.869> was<00:01:46.320> wrong<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.710> both<00:01:46.740> accounts

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it well I was wrong on both accounts

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.310 
it well I was wrong on both accounts
because<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.549> did<00:01:47.850> write<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.149> down<00:01:48.299> rouleau<00:01:48.990> last

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
because I did write it down rouleau last

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.910 
because I did write it down rouleau last
night<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.659> did<00:01:51.930> charge<00:01:52.259> pretty

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
night and it really did charge pretty

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.889 
night and it really did charge pretty
fast<00:01:53.869> also<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.700> had<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> device<00:01:57.060> hover<00:01:57.390> over<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
fast also I had the device hover over it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.889 
fast also I had the device hover over it
I<00:01:58.140> realized<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.189> still<00:01:59.579> charging<00:02:00.149> so

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I realized it was still charging so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.389 
I realized it was still charging so
that's<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.549> actually<00:02:02.850> got<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> case<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
that's when I actually got the case and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.340 
that's when I actually got the case and
decided<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.579> for<00:02:05.759> fun<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.299> I'd<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:07.079> ahead

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
decided just for fun that I'd go ahead

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.339 
decided just for fun that I'd go ahead
and<00:02:07.710> try<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> stick<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.300> there<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
and try to stick it on there with the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.860 
and try to stick it on there with the
