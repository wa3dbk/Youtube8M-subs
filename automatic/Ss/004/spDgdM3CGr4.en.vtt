we're<00:00:00.210> right<00:00:00.390> in<00:00:00.420> the<00:00:00.659> middle<00:00:00.960> of<00:00:01.230> almond

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
we're right in the middle of almond

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.940 
we're right in the middle of almond
bloom<00:00:02.780> that's<00:00:03.780> not<00:00:04.049> snow<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.560> ground<00:00:04.770> you

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
bloom that's not snow on the ground you

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.610 
bloom that's not snow on the ground you
see<00:00:04.980> those<00:00:05.790> are<00:00:06.000> petals<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.990> are<00:00:07.290> falling

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
see those are petals that are falling

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.759 
see those are petals that are falling
off<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.099> trees<00:00:12.049> today<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.110> supposed<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.590> be

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
off the trees today is supposed to be

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.670 
off the trees today is supposed to be
about<00:00:14.040> 85<00:00:14.759> degrees

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
about 85 degrees

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.439 
about 85 degrees
that's<00:00:17.130> quite<00:00:17.369> warm<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.060> middle<00:00:18.359> of

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
that's quite warm for the middle of

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.840 
that's quite warm for the middle of
March

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
March

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.330 
March
typically<00:00:20.850> middle<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> March<00:00:21.480> were<00:00:21.859> about<00:00:22.859> 70

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
typically middle of March were about 70

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.800 
typically middle of March were about 70
degrees<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.910> we're<00:00:24.090> quite<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> bit<00:00:24.600> above

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
degrees so we're quite a bit above

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.960 
degrees so we're quite a bit above
normal<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.439> that's<00:00:26.070> accelerating<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
normal and that's accelerating the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.750 
normal and that's accelerating the
almond<00:00:27.240> bloom<00:00:27.920> that's<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:29.189> necessarily<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
almond bloom that's not necessarily a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.730 
almond bloom that's not necessarily a
bad<00:00:30.000> thing

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
bad thing

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
bad thing
the<00:00:31.759> bees<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.790> been<00:00:33.030> very<00:00:33.239> active<00:00:33.450> in

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the bees have been very active in

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.270 
the bees have been very active in
pollinating<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.969> weather<00:00:39.210> has<00:00:39.450> cooperated

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
pollinating the weather has cooperated

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.360 
pollinating the weather has cooperated
this<00:00:41.280> year<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.940> abloom<00:00:43.100> almonds<00:00:44.100> need

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this year with the abloom almonds need

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.630 
this year with the abloom almonds need
warm<00:00:45.149> dry<00:00:45.629> sunny<00:00:46.079> weather<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> bees<00:00:47.399> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
warm dry sunny weather for the bees to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.170 
warm dry sunny weather for the bees to
work<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.510> pollinate<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> trees<00:00:50.180> almond

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
work and the pollinate the trees almond

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
work and the pollinate the trees almond
trees<00:00:51.360> aren't<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.780> fertile<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.800> need

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
trees aren't so fertile they need

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.229 
trees aren't so fertile they need
pollenization<00:00:53.969> from<00:00:54.719> other<00:00:55.050> almond<00:00:55.410> trees

other almond varieties the same variety
can't<00:01:00.420> pollinate<00:01:00.840> itself<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.789> see

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
can't pollinate itself so as you can see

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.929 
can't pollinate itself so as you can see
there's<00:01:04.379> different<00:01:04.799> size<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.010> shapes<00:01:05.760> of

we use is helicopters helicopters will
fly<00:02:34.489> over<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:36.200> fields<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.750> push<00:02:38.750> down<00:02:39.080> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
fly over the fields and push down the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.630 
fly over the fields and push down the
air<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.880> air<00:02:41.570> higher<00:02:41.930> up<00:02:42.230> 3040<00:02:43.010> feet<00:02:43.220> up<00:02:43.430> is

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
air the air higher up 3040 feet up is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.449 
air the air higher up 3040 feet up is
warmer<00:02:44.570> than<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.780> air<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.140> ground<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
warmer than the air on the ground so the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.449 
warmer than the air on the ground so the
helicopter<00:02:47.269> blades<00:02:47.480> will<00:02:47.660> push<00:02:47.870> air<00:02:48.140> down<00:02:48.459> mix

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
helicopter blades will push air down mix

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.820 
helicopter blades will push air down mix
that<00:02:49.670> air<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.590> warm<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.769> field<00:02:52.010> up<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.459> way

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
that air and warm the field up that way
