my mother I have a resolution of 1440 x

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.630 
my mother I have a resolution of 1440 x
900<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:06.170> sometimes<00:02:06.619> when<00:02:07.009> i<00:02:07.039> record<00:02:07.399> a<00:02:07.490> video

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
900 so sometimes when i record a video

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.039 
900 so sometimes when i record a video
to<00:02:07.759> get<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.920> desperate<00:02:09.920> ratio<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.399> 16<00:02:11.269> by<00:02:11.480> 9<00:02:11.750> I

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
to get a desperate ratio of 16 by 9 I

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:19.150 
to get a desperate ratio of 16 by 9 I
tend<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.500> record<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.720> 1440<00:02:14.720> x<00:02:16.030> 8<00:02:17.030> 10<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.680> i<00:02:18.920> hope

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
tend to record it 1440 x 8 10 so i hope

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.009 
tend to record it 1440 x 8 10 so i hope
