00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
about athletes today that are don't even

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.370 
about athletes today that are don't even
approach<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.789> true<00:00:30.090> they<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:31.109> don't

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
approach what is true they really don't

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.120 
approach what is true they really don't
get<00:00:31.859> behind<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> scenes<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> maybe<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:34.710> my

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
get behind the scenes and maybe what my

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.220 
get behind the scenes and maybe what my
athletes<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.390> bit<00:00:36.600> different<00:00:37.050> or

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
athletes are a little bit different or

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
athletes are a little bit different or
why<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.610> seemingly<00:00:39.300> easy<00:00:39.980> but<00:00:40.980> I've

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
why they are so seemingly easy but I've

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170 
why they are so seemingly easy but I've
led<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> very<00:00:42.270> complex<00:00:42.840> life<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.610> I<00:00:44.610> just

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
led a very complex life and I just

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.200 
led a very complex life and I just
thought<00:00:45.360> after<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:47.100> years<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.670> trying

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
thought after all these years of trying

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.260 
thought after all these years of trying
to<00:00:48.420> mask<00:00:48.870> some<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.620> my<00:00:49.739> problems<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:51.090> would

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to mask some of my problems that would

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.029 
to mask some of my problems that would
be<00:00:51.390> important<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> people<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
be important to people out there and

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.920 
be important to people out there and
I've<00:00:53.190> gotten<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> lot<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.910> cards<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> lot<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
I've gotten a lot of cards a lot of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
I've gotten a lot of cards a lot of
letters<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> lot<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> telephone<00:00:56.640> calls<00:00:56.670> from

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
some pretty prominent people thanking me

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.319 
some pretty prominent people thanking me
for<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.780> writing<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.379> book<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.329> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
for right just writing this book and to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
for right just writing this book and to
me<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.660> had<00:01:04.260> hoped<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.949> kind<00:01:05.189> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
me I had hoped it would be kind of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.700 
me I had hoped it would be kind of
cleansing<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.880> me<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:07.080> go<00:01:07.890> back<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.280> time<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
cleansing for me to go back in time and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.140 
cleansing for me to go back in time and
think<00:01:10.710> about<00:01:10.799> some<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> things<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:12.000> I've

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
think about some of the things that I've

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.399 
think about some of the things that I've
seen<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.630> life<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.110> were<00:01:13.200> less<00:01:13.380> than

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
seen in my life that were less than

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.820 
seen in my life that were less than
desirable<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.880> probably<00:01:15.360> propelled<00:01:16.200> me<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
desirable but probably propelled me to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
desirable but probably propelled me to
have<00:01:17.360> some<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.720> life<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:18.960> didn't

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
have some kind of a life that didn't

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.700 
have some kind of a life that didn't
dream<00:01:19.560> possible<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.630> think<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
dream possible I think when you go up in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.660 
dream possible I think when you go up in
in<00:01:23.040> tough<00:01:23.430> environments<00:01:25.040> you<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.189> learn<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.430> lot

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
in tough environments you do learn a lot

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.969 
in tough environments you do learn a lot
and<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.600> does<00:01:27.750> make<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.990> pretty<00:01:28.259> tough<00:01:28.500> minded

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and it does make you pretty tough minded

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.890 
and it does make you pretty tough minded
and<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.729> think<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.030> there's<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.600> way<00:01:30.869> for

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and I just think that there's a way for

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.359 
and I just think that there's a way for
young<00:01:31.470> people<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.280> who<00:01:32.570> go<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.369> as

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
young people out there who go up and as

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.210 
young people out there who go up and as
I<00:01:35.400> say<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.240> perfect<00:01:36.750> environment<00:01:37.259> there's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
I say not in perfect environment there's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.530 
I say not in perfect environment there's
a<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.150> they<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.420> get

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
a way out there that they can get

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270 
a way out there that they can get
through<00:01:39.810> life<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.259> make<00:01:40.560> their<00:01:40.740> lives<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
through life and make their lives a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.819 
through life and make their lives a
success<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.930> can't<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> unless<00:01:43.710> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
success and you can't do it unless you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.920 
success and you can't do it unless you
have<00:01:44.070> imagined<00:01:44.549> I'd<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.030> can't<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
have imagined I'd you just can't you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
have imagined I'd you just can't you
have<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.409> big<00:01:46.649> imagination<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.579> have

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
have to have a big imagination you have

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.170 
have to have a big imagination you have
to<00:01:47.909> dream<00:01:48.210> big<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.250> I'm<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.520> hopeful<00:01:50.970> that
