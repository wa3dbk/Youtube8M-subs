00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.820 

and<00:00:04.960> another<00:00:05.560> aspect<00:00:05.849> I'd<00:00:06.849> keep<00:00:07.120> in<00:00:07.269> mind<00:00:07.830> with

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830 
and another aspect I'd keep in mind with

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.960 
and another aspect I'd keep in mind with
the<00:00:08.980> chimneys<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.860> the<00:00:12.310> different<00:00:12.730> heights

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.970 
the chimneys is the different heights

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.790 
the chimneys is the different heights
and<00:00:13.500> diameters<00:00:14.500> some<00:00:14.920> of<00:00:14.980> the<00:00:15.040> chimneys<00:00:16.800> right

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
and diameters some of the chimneys right

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.419 
and diameters some of the chimneys right
here<00:00:18.130> I<00:00:18.490> mentioned<00:00:18.999> earlier<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.859> Queen

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:21.429 
here I mentioned earlier like the Queen

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.579 
here I mentioned earlier like the Queen
and<00:00:21.699> number<00:00:22.539> two<00:00:22.749> you<00:00:22.989> know<00:00:23.109> the<00:00:23.380> size

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
and number two you know the size

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.269 
and number two you know the size
diameter<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:26.199> happens<00:00:26.499> to<00:00:26.619> be<00:00:26.650> an<00:00:26.829> eagle

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
diameter this happens to be an eagle

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.540 
diameter this happens to be an eagle
that's<00:00:27.939> still<00:00:28.949> diameter<00:00:29.949> of<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.189> size<00:00:30.429> one

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that's still diameter of the size one

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.119 
that's still diameter of the size one
this<00:00:33.550> lamp<00:00:33.850> has<00:00:34.540> a<00:00:35.129> number<00:00:36.129> two<00:00:36.370> I<00:00:37.949> don't<00:00:38.949> have

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
this lamp has a number two I don't have

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.990 
this lamp has a number two I don't have
another<00:00:40.800> burner<00:00:41.800> number<00:00:42.280> one<00:00:42.460> size<00:00:42.670> burner

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
another burner number one size burner

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.090 
another burner number one size burner
but<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.269> do<00:00:43.329> have<00:00:43.570> another<00:00:43.600> chimney<00:00:44.590> for<00:00:44.890> one

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
but I do have another chimney for one

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.240 
but I do have another chimney for one
the<00:00:46.030> difference<00:00:46.840> is<00:00:47.109> how<00:00:47.739> well<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.039> can<00:00:48.190> see

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
the difference is how well you can see

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.259 
the difference is how well you can see
this<00:00:48.609> but<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:50.699> quite<00:00:51.699> different<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.149> number

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
this but it's quite different the number

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.329 
this but it's quite different the number
one<00:00:52.600> looks<00:00:52.809> like<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.469> know<00:00:53.559> right<00:00:53.769> inside<00:00:54.190> the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
one looks like you know right inside the

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:01.590 
one looks like you know right inside the
number<00:00:54.640> two<00:00:58.649> number<00:00:59.649> two<00:00:59.829> fits<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:01.089> chimney

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
number two number two fits the chimney

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.360 
number two number two fits the chimney
it<00:01:01.659> fits<00:01:01.870> on<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.289> number<00:01:02.559> two<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:03.129> know<00:01:03.249> the

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
it fits on the number two you know the

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.340 
it fits on the number two you know the
way<00:01:03.489> it's<00:01:03.640> made<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:05.340> we<00:01:06.340> take<00:01:06.930> let<00:01:07.930> some<00:01:08.140> need

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
way it's made to we take let some need

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.100 
way it's made to we take let some need
for<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.100> number<00:01:09.610> one<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.300> put<00:01:10.570> it<00:01:10.600> down<00:01:10.780> there

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
for the number one and put it down there

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.710 
for the number one and put it down there
but<00:01:11.650> sets<00:01:11.950> on<00:01:12.160> there<00:01:12.430> but<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.820> does<00:01:13.030> not<00:01:13.300> fit

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
but sets on there but it does not fit

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.360 
but sets on there but it does not fit
correctly<00:01:13.750> at<00:01:14.470> all<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.770> could<00:01:18.010> result

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
correctly at all and that could result

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.870 
correctly at all and that could result
in<00:01:18.900> hazardous<00:01:19.900> fire<00:01:20.170> not<00:01:21.070> burning<00:01:21.370> properly

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
in hazardous fire not burning properly

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.030 
in hazardous fire not burning properly
at<00:01:22.120> all<00:01:22.270> but<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.830> can't<00:01:24.070> do<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:25.800> so<00:01:26.800> we<00:01:26.890> need

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
at all but you can't do that so we need

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.080 
at all but you can't do that so we need
to<00:01:27.130> keep<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.490> in<00:01:27.550> mind

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
to keep that in mind

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.440 
to keep that in mind

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.070 
keep in mind what size chimney you're
after<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:39.030> size<00:01:39.240> burner<00:01:39.659> your

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
after you know what size burner your

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.270 
after you know what size burner your
landlord<00:01:40.530> he<00:01:40.619> has<00:01:42.830> personally<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.070> the

taller chimneys I think they kind of
look<00:01:46.799> cool<00:01:47.030> but<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.570> our<00:01:48.780> lamps<00:01:49.200> burn

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
