00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.490 

on<00:00:15.619> Saturn<00:00:17.119> air-conditioning<00:00:18.500> protocol

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
on Saturn air-conditioning protocol

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.359 
on Saturn air-conditioning protocol
functionality<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.939> whole<00:00:21.090> system<00:00:21.740> well<00:00:22.740> this

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
functionality the whole system well this

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.150 
functionality the whole system well this
is<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:23.700> compressor<00:00:24.090> right<00:00:24.450> here<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:25.160> know

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
is the compressor right here I know

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.120 
is the compressor right here I know
there's<00:00:26.520> not<00:00:26.730> any<00:00:27.000> freon<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.140> because<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
there's not any freon in here because I

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.590 
there's not any freon in here because I
changed<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.790> the<00:00:30.630> unit<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:32.210> another<00:00:33.210> unit

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
changed the the unit with a another unit

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.780 
changed the the unit with a another unit
the<00:00:33.780> original<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> car<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.309> kind

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the original one what the car just kind

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.260 
the original one what the car just kind
of<00:00:35.850> died<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.829> assuming<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.730> bought<00:00:39.000> another

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
of died I'm assuming so I bought another

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.340 
of died I'm assuming so I bought another
one<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.930> was<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> used<00:00:40.470> one<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:42.350> hooked

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
one it was a used one and hooked

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.280 
one it was a used one and hooked
everything<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:45.390> haven't<00:00:46.020> put<00:00:46.140> any

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
everything up and I haven't put any

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.209 
everything up and I haven't put any
freon<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> yet<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.289> tried<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:49.890> turn<00:00:50.070> on

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
freon in it yet but I tried to turn on

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.900 
freon in it yet but I tried to turn on
the<00:00:50.429> air-conditioning<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:52.760> didn't<00:00:53.760> hear

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the air-conditioning and I didn't hear

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.950 
the air-conditioning and I didn't hear
the<00:00:54.030> clutch<00:00:54.269> or<00:00:54.449> anything<00:00:54.629> engage<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.059> don't

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the clutch or anything engage so I don't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.899 
the clutch or anything engage so I don't
know<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.410> an<00:00:58.620> electrical<00:00:59.129> issue<00:00:59.219> with

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
know if it's an electrical issue with

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.829 
know if it's an electrical issue with
like<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.230> connector<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:01.890> any<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> wires

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
like the connector or any of the wires

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.000 
like the connector or any of the wires
or<00:01:03.920> basically<00:01:04.920> how<00:01:05.070> air<00:01:05.489> conditioning<00:01:06.060> work

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
or basically how air conditioning work

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.880 
or basically how air conditioning work
air<00:01:08.010> conditioning<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.500> electrical<00:01:10.500> are

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
air conditioning and electrical are

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.920 
air conditioning and electrical are
definitely<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.210> weak<00:01:12.710> weak<00:01:13.710> point<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.100> me<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
definitely a weak weak point with me I

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.100 
definitely a weak weak point with me I
don't<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:15.990> need<00:01:16.729> AC<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.670> have<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:21.110> this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
don't really need AC but I have a this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.000 
don't really need AC but I have a this
is<00:01:22.610> technically<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.700> family<00:01:24.090> car<00:01:24.300> so<00:01:25.260> when<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
is technically a family car so when the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.120 
is technically a family car so when the
kids<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.370> in<00:01:26.400> there<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:26.880> wife's<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.270> there

this<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.770> cold<00:01:45.159> start<00:01:45.219> so<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:46.000> RPMs<00:01:46.570> are

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
this is a cold start so the RPMs are

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.440 
this is a cold start so the RPMs are
gonna<00:01:46.750> be<00:01:46.899> a<00:01:46.930> little<00:01:47.049> bit<00:01:47.229> higher<00:01:47.409> than<00:01:47.619> normal

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
gonna be a little bit higher than normal

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.080 
gonna be a little bit higher than normal
but

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.389 

let<00:01:53.630> me<00:01:53.720> see<00:01:55.030> make<00:01:56.030> sure<00:01:56.210> that's<00:01:56.330> pushed<00:01:56.690> in

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
let me see make sure that's pushed in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.260 
let me see make sure that's pushed in
that's<00:01:59.030> fine<00:01:59.359> it's<00:01:59.869> cold<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:02.030> I'm<00:02:02.090> going<00:02:02.240> to

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
that's fine it's cold so I'm going to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.899 
that's fine it's cold so I'm going to
turn<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.600> on<00:02:02.659> full<00:02:02.990> blast<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.700> you'll<00:02:04.700> see

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
turn it on full blast and you'll see

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.219 
turn it on full blast and you'll see
that<00:02:05.119> there's<00:02:06.049> no<00:02:06.200> change<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:07.840> rpm<00:02:08.840> speed<00:02:09.110> or

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
that there's no change in rpm speed or

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.830 
that there's no change in rpm speed or
anything

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.990 

on

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.839 

off

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
off so I don't know if that's an

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.839 
off so I don't know if that's an
electrical<00:02:30.769> issue<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:33.400> don't<00:02:34.400> know<00:02:34.609> if<00:02:34.670> that's

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
electrical issue I don't know if that's

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.490 
electrical issue I don't know if that's
an<00:02:34.969> electrical<00:02:35.420> issue<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:36.049> where<00:02:36.200> there's

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
an electrical issue to where there's

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
just no electricity going to the unit to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.849 
just no electricity going to the unit to
tell<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.329> to<00:02:41.359> go<00:02:41.599> on<00:02:41.810> or<00:02:42.049> if<00:02:42.590> that's<00:02:42.799> a

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.610 
tell it to go on or if that's a
mechanical<00:02:43.400> issue<00:02:43.519> where<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:45.049> clutch<00:02:45.319> and

mechanical issue where the clutch and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.380 
mechanical issue where the clutch and
the<00:02:47.019> compressors<00:02:48.019> messed<00:02:48.319> up<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:49.090> know<00:02:50.090> there's

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
the compressors messed up I know there's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.879 
the compressors messed up I know there's
a<00:02:50.450> bearing<00:02:50.900> in<00:02:51.019> there<00:02:51.170> somewhere<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.709> don't

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
a bearing in there somewhere I don't

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.030 
a bearing in there somewhere I don't
know<00:02:52.010> if<00:02:52.159> it's<00:02:52.280> an<00:02:52.400> issue<00:02:52.549> with<00:02:52.819> that<00:02:53.889> there<00:02:54.889> is

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
know if it's an issue with that there is

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.629 
know if it's an issue with that there is
no<00:02:55.280> noise<00:02:55.609> or<00:02:56.120> any<00:02:57.400> yeah<00:02:58.400> there's<00:02:58.609> a
