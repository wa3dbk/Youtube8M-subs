that<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.049> ran<00:00:07.290> out<00:00:07.970> first<00:00:08.970> you've<00:00:09.780> mostly

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
that I ran out first you've mostly

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.900 
that I ran out first you've mostly
worked<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:10.679> side<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.219> body<00:00:11.429> from<00:00:11.700> the

skinning it would be a good idea to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.340

that you've done was done on the proxy

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.660 
that you've done was done on the proxy
character<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:14.010> one<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.430> made

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
character the one you have made

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.490

symmetrical<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.690> make<00:02:15.840> your<00:02:16.050> work<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.350> bit

symmetrical to make your work a bit

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.850 
symmetrical to make your work a bit
easier<00:02:17.540> now<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.600> need<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.959> transfer<00:02:19.410> all<00:02:19.620> that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
easier now you need to transfer all that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.400 
easier now you need to transfer all that
