take about 10 inches and loop this
braided<00:00:39.059> line<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> create<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> loop<00:00:41.840> we're

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
braided line and create a loop we're

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.029

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the loop this is a polymer not that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.330 
the loop this is a polymer not that
we're<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> use<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> mainline<00:00:54.050> and

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
we're going to use on the mainline and

just<00:00:56.340> tie<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.940> an<00:00:57.090> overhand<00:00:57.539> knot<00:00:59.270> one<00:01:00.270> time

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
just tie like an overhand knot one time

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.119 
just tie like an overhand knot one time
leaving<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.399> loop<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.570> by<00:01:03.719> itself<00:01:04.129> what

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
leaving the loop out here by itself what

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.760 
leaving the loop out here by itself what
we<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.900> reach<00:01:07.260> through<00:01:07.590> our

reverse snail because it's tie don't I

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.710 
reverse snail because it's tie don't I
don't<00:03:04.930> do<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.170> like<00:03:05.230> other<00:03:05.530> other<00:03:05.920> folks<00:03:06.190> do

don't do it like other other folks do

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.550 
don't do it like other other folks do
but<00:03:07.720> send<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.470> through<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.739> line<00:03:09.090> your<00:03:10.090> eye<00:03:10.660> of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
but send it through the line your eye of

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.060 
but send it through the line your eye of
the<00:03:11.739> hook<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.239> make<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.300> loop<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.980> hold<00:03:14.980> it

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
the hook and make a loop and hold it

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.150 
the hook and make a loop and hold it
with<00:03:15.160> your<00:03:15.190> thumb<00:03:16.290> now<00:03:17.290> what<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.560> do<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.770> take

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
with your thumb now what I do is take

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.090 
with your thumb now what I do is take
and<00:03:18.520> run<00:03:18.790> my<00:03:18.940> tag<00:03:19.180> in<00:03:19.450> around<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.560> hook<00:03:20.770> and

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
and run my tag in around the hook and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.449 
and run my tag in around the hook and
through<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.580> loop<00:03:22.200> four<00:03:23.200> or<00:03:23.320> five<00:03:23.500> times

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.800 

this<00:03:27.459> may<00:03:27.670> be<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.970> correct<00:03:28.209> way<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.510> do<00:03:28.780> a

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
this may be the correct way to do a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.510 
this may be the correct way to do a
smell<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.200> don't<00:03:29.530> know<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:30.070> this<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.280> how

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
smell I don't know I just this is how

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.090 
smell I don't know I just this is how
I've<00:03:30.640> done<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.910> for<00:03:31.090> years<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.510> years<00:03:31.690> and

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
I've done it for years and years and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.490 
I've done it for years and years and
then<00:03:33.100> we<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:33.580> pull<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.300> tag<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.230> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
then we just pull the tag in and the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.500 
then we just pull the tag in and the
main<00:03:35.680> line<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.790> cinch<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.480> up

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.460 

and<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.780> really<00:03:43.110> should<00:03:43.319> really<00:03:45.260> use<00:03:46.260> some

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
and you really should really use some

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.080 
and you really should really use some
cutters<00:03:46.860> but<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.370> use<00:03:48.269> my<00:03:48.420> teeth<00:03:48.480> most<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.110> time

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
cutters but I use my teeth most the time
