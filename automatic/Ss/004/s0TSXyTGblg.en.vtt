00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.720
 so I and TJ had to spend the night in the tent that smelled of ax. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.900
 every time I breathed I could taste the smell. And I became increasingly angry and angry. 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.580
 The night finally ended and I woke up early in the morning before everyone else woke up. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 so that I could start my masterful revenge plan. 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.700
 Was I tired? Perhaps. But that is a sacrifice that you must accept for revenge. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.700
 each camp had a drinking water fountain that came out of the ground, attached to a pvc pipe. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.800
 I found the largest freezer bag I could find and started filling it with water. 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.460
 It was clearly a slow process. So I had more than enough time to change my mind. 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.160
 To think about what TJ said what could happen after I took revenge. 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.820
 But nothing stopped me. I was a squeaky, hormone-fed monster. 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.580
 When the bag was full I went back to my tent and woke up TJ. 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.100
 He woke up and I said "see this". 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.780
 TJ wasn't actually part of my revenge plan. I just wanted to take him to trouble with me. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.560
 I don't think TJ really wanted to take revenge. 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.040
 I ran to the giant tree tent and hid behind a real tent that stood next to the tree tent. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.200
 Everyone was quiet in the tent. TJ still had no idea what I was going to do. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.940
 Until I threw the bag over the tent. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.900
 If everything went according to plan, the bag would open, on the roof and the water would slide between the openings. 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.180
 And then they would be super wet LOL :) 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.580
 That was the plan. 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.620
 [dramatic music] 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.800
 I never saw what my creation had done. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.860
 I was afraid that I had missed the wooden tent altogether. 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.400
 I never played a sport like a child, so coming over alone would have been a success. 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.300
 But the fact that everyone suddenly started screaming and that one boy, "I'm going to kill you Micah!" shouted. 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.100
 I knew this had to be the perfect shot 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.360
 Did I stop laughing at their stupid guilty faces? 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.860
 No. 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.640
 Me and TJ ran away as fast as we could without looking back. 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.360
 We ran into the forest before one of the 15 years old saw us. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.780
 We kept running and running, making sure we were as far away from the camp as possible. 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.080
 And while running I had vomited a bit (dirty) 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.520
 TJ who was the good friend who was, thought I wasn't ready to run so he decided that we should hide in the bushes. 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.840
 After 5 minutes still nobody came 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.840
 (whispering) shall we go back to the camp? 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.260
 (whispering) No. 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.000
 (whispering) yes you are right 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.800
 So we just kept running. Until we found a river where the scouts could canoe. 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.820
 I and TJ both didn't think this was a good idea to quit. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.000
 So we sat by the river and chatted for a few hours. 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.920
 Because TJ was moving to china in a week 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.040
 And I knew I wasn't going to see him for a long time. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.740
 So I wanted to share it with him every moment. 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.500
 we were just 2 little bros talking to each other. 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.240
 Boulders throw and talk about our feelings. 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.320
 And that night the 15-year-old tent was exhumed. 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.060
 So I guess it wasn't said. 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.200
 Oh and do you remember that I gave up after all that running? (still dirty) 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:05.860
 so there was apparently a virus in the camp that all staff members had and about half of all scouts too. 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.760
 one of the 15-year-olds did not feel well when he went to bed that night. 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.640
 and suddenly he woke up and let the churned water give him up. 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.160
 jeeeeej 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
