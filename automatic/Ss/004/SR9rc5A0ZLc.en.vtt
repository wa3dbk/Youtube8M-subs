 Of course we can publish it here 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.090
 they do not look 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.710
 then we come to play markus 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.250
 At the beginning of the summer one says as a driver 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.170
 always table still not important there can 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 you do not play until after about ten days 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 look at it now are ten days of play 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.890
 played 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.020
 now the third one is playing against the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 second is the table state is the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.290
 table situation for you already important 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.409
 plays it already up to date is the role 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.540
 monday together i believe that or how 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.740
 make sure you have the table in it 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.500
 moment is still much more important than 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.229
 Of course we all look for us too 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.530
 also on the table but we try 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.630
 again and again the focus on the next one 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.180
 day to the next game and the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.409
 judge and that is fortuna düsseldorf 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.680
 there is waiting for us 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.110
 the strongest team abroad 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.360
 there is an exciting game with us 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.210
 our home strength we in the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.920
 last weeks and months again 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.460
 want to have developed and built 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.570
 we also kept that possible though 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.550
 First of all, it is the content of the tasks 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.590
 to perceive each one of them 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.650
 Every single player starts in the squad 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.970
 and then safety team again 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.190
 to present as we all do 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.770
 imagine 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.600
 thank you markus costa in reinheim there was 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.270
 away home a point on the other hand 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.290
 still undefeated and without 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.670
 Point loss now comes with Dusseldorf 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.050
 not only the strongest 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.670
 away team but also one 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.200
 team with him from the last 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.410
 Season still a small bill open 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:53.360
 have or yes indeed was the result 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:57.270
 from the season before the 0 1 here at home 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.520
 very annoying result calculated 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.400
 eggenhofer makes the decisive goal 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.070
 against us in a game phase where we 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.280
 have played absolutely superior and that 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.410
 faithfulness, so to speak, fell from nothing 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.459
 we lost the game and 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.799
 In that sense one can say that we 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.780
 have a bill open but we have 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.260
 this year another team 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.120
 our previous home record is top 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.910
 becomes a real top game second 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.000
 against third or the third against the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.180
 second and yes we really want that 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.890
 win a game said costa alex us 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.769
 have heard strongest away team 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.940
 you are the strongest home team that 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.170
 You can expect a game there 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.630
 how do you go into the game as 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.220
 Team struck we prepare so 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.730
 as before every game 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.290
 focus on us prepare ourselves 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.610
 of course on a bit on the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.900
 opponent over 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.630
 I think you can see that in ours 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.900
 that way we also do that more 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.920
 deal with us and I expect one 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.990
 top game in the second league with 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.270
 a better exit for us 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.070
 hope we all thank you alex so there is 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.900
 time for your questions around yes that can 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.910
 no team issel village the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.950
 away as I said so no game 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.410
 lost him at home 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.220
 play full pulsel offensive or have 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.690
 a different strategy 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.680
 we have to be very careful 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.280
 or rather careful 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.040
 but we have to be very vigilant and 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.310
 concentrated in our ball possession phase 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.990
 because düsseldorf from my point of view very much 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.830
 well defended also lurked on mistakes 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.480
 top switching behavior shows and 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.570
 dangerous to play forward 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.830
 you have a very good squad very much 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.730
 wide squad with really clenched 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.660
 offensive force 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:56.620
 so far we have to play in our game 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.260
 our play area still tick more 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.150
 be more focused on the ball because 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:09.030
 taking with you anticipation and that 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.030
 will certainly be a lot of power and energy 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.400
 costs 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.690
 In that sense, we will certainly be today and 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.830
 a few more things tomorrow 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:24.480
 responsive and accordingly 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.480
 to prepare for the opponent
