 that is the whole club remains the car of a scene or should you too 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.800
 our knowledge that despite the empty very long that he actually short we 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.200
 start today with the guest appearance of a balcony from the country of 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.660
 rising sun this really eye-catching car is the new investor 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.970
 to the ROG who has accompanied and for two weeks so much is in advance 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.540
 betrayed he has introduced himself exemplary Anderson because he is too 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.540
 something 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.650
 even the name sounds politically between cheers and hubbub under it 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.709
 Nissan has hit the core of the joke 

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:02.589
 the optics seems to do the culprit 1 ca shows that sprung from the rear end 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.950
 reminds of the great morality and the rest is as if he came from the sketches 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.850
 those who cleverly rejected his as exaggerated 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.289
 wherever you look 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.280
 quietly, arts are huge detours in the drawings themselves are the flanks 

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:20.799
 still inflated everything makes animal figures voice you just can not say 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.880
 Prof Bork Beijing 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.670
 also the formulations of the trade press describe the car a bit overdriven 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.370
 as texted car image editor Hirschberger 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.990
 the place in the Conservative class between polo and golf 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.210
 I Dorner with open pants 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 the wdr team 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.580
 we do not have to put on any more thanks to the crazy Lux there 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.200
 close the four meters 14 ranks only when parking here is the check 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.390
 Proven rear view camera emails 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.270
 just as well camouflaged is the height of one meter 57 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.260
 he is at the traffic lights stop because you realize that the big SUVs are at eye level 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.050
 February sets Baggersee has been an important reason to buy for years 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.060
 soon Asaf AK Knopp with a fuel-eater first w 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.260
 Cat a cool alternative even if the job makes a heavy impression 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.400
 betrayed he can be easily if association management flowed almost playful 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.010
 itself but so fully equipped model has in the operation immediately 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.690
 then opened the gene meter exaggerated it shows the g-forces at 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.020
 drive to a healthy person without feeling physically 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:35.249
 we drive the 1 4 5 the CDU with under ten HP leads is actually for that 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.209
 Piece of hotel 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.830
 with specified 5 comma 1 liter consumption 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.040
 with front wheel drive the kids outside 3 50 kg and develops 42 minutes 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.570
 meter 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.330
 as much again a comma 6-liter gasoline engine with four-wheel drive around 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.929
 a hundred 90 hp 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:54.379
 this illustrates what amazing implementation lags behind 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.329
 The testimony of the transmission sits on a center console which is a motorcycle tank 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.489
 should be modeled 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.139
 under the infotainment screen sits a second display which is also something 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.009
 at Kitas is one 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.359
 Here you can adjust the purchase 3v modes 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.989
 Although the vehicle is almost like a fountain of youth we strongly recommend 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.999
 the extra center armrest because of the slightly higher circuit 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:23.329
 amazing, however, because the factor of the key Dr is not enforceable 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.039
 what the lifetime of the trouser pockets Herten 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.039
 shortened 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.439
 Baltes motor journalists Munich we are a boring routine and golf 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.359
 That's why they provide us with so much material for enthusiasm 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.529
 there always the sales front important 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.659
 We drive to an established local dealer in Berlin-Pankow 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.650
 May Nissan KÃ¼ttner knows the customers from decades of experience 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.929
 they are a reaction to the train 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:08.589
 Of course we are not surprised that the train hits like a bomb 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.879
 there they come 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.830
 and so Garg zwackt were passing us because the model is so trendy 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.979
 even the design is individualized 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.829
 you probably know bumper sticker 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.829
 Life is too short because he has cars 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.719
 Nowhere is the difference between the KAC and the pithy saying of the 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:29.340
 Manufacturer 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.650
 and to do the reality clearly as in the sales hall now noticeable what 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.550
 the customers really think 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.830
 he was an enemy on something quieter course to drive a sensational scandal 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.430
 how is the long one? 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.670
 as they had known then it was well known that the company 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.080
 can the tenants 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.939
 Customers do not just come by a car, but they want it too 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.949
 are cared for 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.349
 You can be satisfied with us 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.169
 Percent in the number he 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.650
 11 read from the customer 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.729
 if someone builds the most cars Christian but not the most successful 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.509
 Market in return on sales and reliability 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.469
 with Nissan at the very front 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.559
 the suitcase is more interested in business strategies 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:14.200
 little 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.540
 increasingly the will be the core issue for the club is far ahead and 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.439
 of course the love money 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.909
 There are a lot of lifestyle osteoarthritis and many of them are very 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.789
 Most of them are very expensive 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.080
 hardly a customer needs 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.840
 Alex can fit together and should be put together individually 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.619
 The starting price is always based on the train. An action came over time 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:41.859
 and the number inheritable, of course I liked him 13 episodes 100 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.210
 in the double Rittner has probably make clear what it means if a manufacturer 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.309
 give recommended retail price 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:51.529
 the torture struck exactly ten euros below 17 thousand lies 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:09.829
 It seems surprisingly well suited to the nightlife in the cities 

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:14.129
 for that Nissan has something went so well invented sitting upright is that 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:17.659
 The parking light mounted on the hood, as it were, makes the focus of attention 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.210
 It is important to shimmer the transparent cover 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.270
 just to calm down like lighthouses in sight 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.330
 you can not lose orientation at all 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.129
 Wambach is just the two poets in front and we made in between 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.279
 Middle through 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.590
 our conclusion 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.250
 you can decode it yourself we have 610 kilometers and 36 again 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.780
 second hand 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.590
 that is five command in the predominantly the urban enterprises picture 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.790
 Nissan Juke is one of the vehicles we will really do again 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.930
 have returned
