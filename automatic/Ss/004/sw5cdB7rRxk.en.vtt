00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

I'm<00:00:00.690> going<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.900> start<00:00:01.170> off<00:00:01.319> biting<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.040> maple

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
I'm going to start off biting this maple

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.240 
I'm going to start off biting this maple
that's<00:00:02.909> 3/4<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.810> an<00:00:03.959> inch<00:00:04.080> thick<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.799> rip<00:00:05.069> it

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
that's 3/4 of an inch thick and rip it

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.000 
that's 3/4 of an inch thick and rip it
down<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.759> two<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.270> three<00:00:06.600> eighths<00:00:06.810> inch<00:00:07.230> thick

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
down to two and three eighths inch thick

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:32.080 
down to two and three eighths inch thick
on<00:00:08.189> my<00:00:08.309> table<00:00:08.490> saw

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.729 

and<00:00:33.090> I'm<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.629> round<00:00:33.840> over<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.410> piece

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and I'm going to round over this piece

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.950 
and I'm going to round over this piece
why<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.129> have<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> chance<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.329> gonna<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
why I have the chance I'm gonna do the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.350 
why I have the chance I'm gonna do the
top<00:00:37.290> only<00:00:37.590> because<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.820> that's<00:00:39.090> how<00:00:39.329> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
top only because I think that's how I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:01:01.100 
top only because I think that's how I
want<00:00:39.690> it

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.810 

and<00:01:02.110> basically<00:01:02.530> what<00:01:02.860> that<00:01:03.010> did<00:01:03.220> was<00:01:03.400> it<00:01:03.430> just

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
and basically what that did was it just

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.650 
and basically what that did was it just
gave<00:01:03.970> this<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.420> softer<00:01:05.080> look<00:01:05.320> on<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.680> top<00:01:06.660> so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
gave this a softer look on the top so

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.600 
gave this a softer look on the top so
now<00:01:07.690> I<00:01:07.900> tilted<00:01:08.410> my<00:01:08.470> blade<00:01:08.800> down<00:01:09.010> about<00:01:09.190> 10

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
now I tilted my blade down about 10

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.690 
now I tilted my blade down about 10
degrees<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.930> put<00:01:11.530> my<00:01:11.680> stock<00:01:12.040> against<00:01:12.550> it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
degrees and I put my stock against it

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.420 
degrees and I put my stock against it
and<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.360> blade<00:01:13.570> is<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:14.050> little<00:01:14.500> bit<00:01:14.650> lower<00:01:14.979> so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
and the blade is a little bit lower so

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.430 
and the blade is a little bit lower so
there's<00:01:15.970> enough<00:01:16.210> room<00:01:16.360> so<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.840> won't<00:01:17.020> cut<00:01:17.320> out

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
there's enough room so it won't cut out

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:42.130 
there's enough room so it won't cut out
the<00:01:17.620> bottom

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.170 

and<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.860> got<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> perfect<00:01:44.520> fit<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and now I got the perfect fit for the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.039 
and now I got the perfect fit for the
iPhone<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.770> case<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.840> see

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
iPhone with the case on and you can see

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.529 
iPhone with the case on and you can see
my<00:01:49.259> attempts<00:01:49.829> earlier<00:01:50.159> we're<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.240> too

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
my attempts earlier we're just a bit too

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.990 
my attempts earlier we're just a bit too
wide<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.369> now<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> round<00:01:53.820> over

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
wide and now I'm going to round over

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.440 
wide and now I'm going to round over
this<00:01:54.360> backside

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.350 

so<00:02:02.450> now<00:02:02.690> I<00:02:02.720> turned<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.530> size<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.280> what<00:02:05.210> I'm

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
so now I turned it to size and what I'm

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320 
so now I turned it to size and what I'm
going<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.780> do<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.410> just<00:02:07.370> run<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.760> through<00:02:07.790> here

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
going to do is just run it through here

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:19.580 
going to do is just run it through here
using<00:02:09.080> some<00:02:09.110> push<00:02:09.649> sticks

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.680 

and<00:02:20.590> now<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:20.950> have<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.400> nice<00:02:21.670> profile<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.569> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
and now I have this nice profile on the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.650 
and now I have this nice profile on the
top<00:02:22.800> but<00:02:23.800> as<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.310> see<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.610> here<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.030> select

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
top but as you can see in here I select

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.480 
top but as you can see in here I select
some<00:02:25.840> grooves<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.440> I'm<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.010> going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.190> sand
