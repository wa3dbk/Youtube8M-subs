I think it's so great that it takes a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.360 
I think it's so great that it takes a
lot<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:45.239> an<00:00:46.230> aesthetic<00:00:46.739> dermatologist

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
lot to be an aesthetic dermatologist

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.400 
lot to be an aesthetic dermatologist
it's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> lot<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> training<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.050> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's a lot of training but it's so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's a lot of training but it's so
wonderful<00:00:50.070> once<00:00:50.280> you're<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.800> have

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
wonderful once you're there and you have

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.740 

I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.650> YouTube<00:01:00.010> channel<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:01.180> could<00:01:01.630> be

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
I think the YouTube channel it could be

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.960 
I think the YouTube channel it could be
great<00:01:02.020> because<00:01:02.440> it's<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.830> way<00:01:03.010> for<00:01:03.040> patients

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
great because it's a way for patients

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.060 
great because it's a way for patients
who<00:01:04.059> don't<00:01:04.270> live<00:01:04.449> in<00:01:04.480> New<00:01:04.660> York<00:01:04.720> City<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.950> get

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
who don't live in New York City to get

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.480 
who don't live in New York City to get
some<00:01:06.310> of<00:01:06.460> my<00:01:06.580> ideas<00:01:06.790> about<00:01:07.300> what<00:01:07.900> a<00:01:08.490> patient

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
some of my ideas about what a patient

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.070 
some of my ideas about what a patient
can<00:01:09.670> do<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.300> thought<00:01:10.510> it<00:01:10.660> would<00:01:10.720> be<00:01:10.870> really

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
can do and I thought it would be really

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.700
