condition

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.410 
condition
we're<00:00:07.649> powered<00:00:08.010> up<00:00:08.160> see<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.970> does<00:00:09.210> operate

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
we're powered up see this does operate

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.310 
we're powered up see this does operate
pull<00:00:10.349> out<00:00:10.500> them<00:00:10.830> mini<00:00:11.639> stop<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.480> turn<00:00:13.170> down

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
pull out them mini stop here turn down

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
pull out them mini stop here turn down
the<00:00:13.469> speed<00:00:13.620> here<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.940> your<00:00:15.179> forward

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
the speed here is your forward

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:34.910 
the speed here is your forward
this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> variable<00:00:17.910> speed

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700 

now<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> lift<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.059> card<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:37.170> shuts<00:00:37.500> off

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
now if you lift this card it shuts off

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.030 
now if you lift this card it shuts off
so<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.130> has<00:00:38.250> an<00:00:38.399> automatic<00:00:38.730> shut<00:00:38.880> off

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
so it has an automatic shut off

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
so it has an automatic shut off
dizzle<00:00:41.040> put<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.370> back<00:00:42.090> down<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:42.960> the
