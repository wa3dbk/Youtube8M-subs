natural hardwood fire these little holes
right<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.739> those<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.579> pumping<00:00:44.879> air<00:00:45.120> into

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
right here those are pumping air into

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.540 
right here those are pumping air into
that<00:00:46.079> hot<00:00:46.320> pot<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:46.890> there's<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that hot pot right there there's a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
that hot pot right there there's a
convection<00:00:47.940> oven<00:00:48.180> fan<00:00:48.690> built<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.590> what

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
convection oven fan built in so what

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
convection oven fan built in so what
that<00:00:49.860> does<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> stops<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> fire<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.809> then

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that does is it stops the fire but then

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.959 
that does is it stops the fire but then
it<00:00:52.050> also<00:00:52.170> does<00:00:52.620> create<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> convection<00:00:53.699> oven

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it also does create that convection oven

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.729 
it also does create that convection oven
so<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.629> bake<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:54.930> fired<00:00:55.110> pizza<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.620> you
