run camber especially on the rear tires
all<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:37.310> does<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.489> make<00:03:37.639> your<00:03:37.940> tires<00:03:38.150> wear

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
all it does is make your tires wear

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.229 
all it does is make your tires wear
funny<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:40.180> there's<00:03:41.180> no<00:03:41.299> real<00:03:41.870> gain<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.350> its

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
funny so there's no real gain to its

that's what you get with the MSO 1d s
model<00:04:20.020> like<00:04:21.020> I<00:04:21.140> said<00:04:21.380> I've<00:04:21.500> already<00:04:21.650> got<00:04:21.920> one

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
model like I said I've already got one

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.520 
model like I said I've already got one
it's<00:04:22.730> a<00:04:22.850> clone<00:04:25.750> those<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.260> haven't

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
it's a clone those of you that haven't

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.600 
it's a clone those of you that haven't
seen<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:28.190> it's<00:04:28.970> right<00:04:29.210> here<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:31.250> is<00:04:31.310> what

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
seen it it's right here this is what

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.920 
seen it it's right here this is what
that<00:04:31.790> car<00:04:32.030> would<00:04:32.210> look<00:04:32.420> like<00:04:32.570> pretty<00:04:32.840> much

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
that car would look like pretty much

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.420 
that car would look like pretty much
fully<00:04:33.260> upgraded<00:04:33.770> with<00:04:33.890> all<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.190> aluminum

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
fully upgraded with all the aluminum

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.620 
fully upgraded with all the aluminum
bulkheads<00:04:35.200> carbon<00:04:36.200> fiber<00:04:36.410> upper<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.010> lower

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
bulkheads carbon fiber upper and lower

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.600 
bulkheads carbon fiber upper and lower
it<00:04:38.630> wouldn't<00:04:39.440> look<00:04:39.500> exactly<00:04:40.040> like<00:04:40.070> this<00:04:40.370> but

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
it wouldn't look exactly like this but

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.370 
it wouldn't look exactly like this but
it'd<00:04:40.790> be<00:04:40.820> really<00:04:41.090> close<00:04:42.670> so<00:04:43.670> I<00:04:44.140> got<00:04:45.140> another

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
it'd be really close so I got another

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.840 
it'd be really close so I got another
one<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.650> mess<00:04:45.800> around<00:04:45.950> with<00:04:46.250> because<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.670> like

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
one to mess around with because I like

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.290 
one to mess around with because I like
this<00:04:47.060> chassis<00:04:47.450> so<00:04:47.630> much<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.910> hopefully<00:04:49.910> this

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
this chassis so much so hopefully this

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.060 
this chassis so much so hopefully this
one<00:04:50.540> turns<00:04:50.930> out<00:04:51.110> as<00:04:51.260> good<00:04:51.320> as<00:04:51.560> this<00:04:51.650> one's<00:04:51.890> been

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
one turns out as good as this one's been

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.700 
one turns out as good as this one's been
treating<00:04:52.370> me<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.870> get<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.900> lot<00:04:54.080> of<00:04:54.140> drifting<00:04:54.560> in

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
treating me and get a lot of drifting in

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.980 
treating me and get a lot of drifting in
with<00:04:54.860> it
