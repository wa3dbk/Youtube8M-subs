00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
like baby powder

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.749 
like baby powder
so<00:01:37.110> again<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.560> sprinkle<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.100> over<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
so again just sprinkle it all over the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.310 
so again just sprinkle it all over the
areas<00:01:39.390> where<00:01:39.540> they're<00:01:39.689> kind<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.960> coming<00:01:40.229> in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
areas where they're kind of coming in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.770 
areas where they're kind of coming in
and<00:01:40.500> out<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.850> we<00:01:41.850> had<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.150> coming<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.600> our

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and out of we had them coming up our

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.870 
and out of we had them coming up our
pipes<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.130> didn't<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.549> rain

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
pipes because we didn't have much rain

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
pipes because we didn't have much rain
and<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:46.049> bit<00:01:46.140> messy<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and so it's a little bit messy like I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.539 
and so it's a little bit messy like I
said<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.729> easily<00:01:48.119> clean<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.049> bowl<00:01:49.200> so

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
said but it's easily clean up a bowl so

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.030 
said but it's easily clean up a bowl so
hope<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.670> guys<00:01:50.790> enjoy
