00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.459
 the day of making jello let's cook 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.570
 a gelatin 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.360
 from grape 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.860
 Grape jelly let's make a liter 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.520
 of gelatin so we're going to need 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.009
 four cups of water let's heat them 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.560
 and then the jelly goes on we go for the 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.440
 water come four is a glass of 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.750
 these 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.750
 use a liter is an expense of this set 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.330
 light turns on 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.860
 and we put it to warm up we wait 15 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.670
 minutes 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.670
 15,000 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.760
 when it gets cold 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.290
 We are going to need the perforated spoon 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.290
 to be able to think 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.619
 and it's starting to boil once 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.130
 start boiling the water we pay 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.130
 we open the jelly 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.250
 you have to put a premium 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.080
 of crap 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.080
 he began to read grape 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.330
 l 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.650
 we can see and this is how we have 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.290
 gelatin we let it dry it 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.700
 dry it to cool for a while you can not 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.700
 dry because it is wet yes this 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.270
 you want to try it you can not be 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.850
 boiling this thing we let it go 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.830
 stay here for 5 minutes and then we had 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.570
 in the vessel 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.190
 if he were running, then, like, 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.659
 you have to tell him you have to close the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.670
 doors and windows 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.750
 but so unknown whether gelatin 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.630
 after 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.420
 tomorrow we can taste it at night 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.930
 10 today to us or to the day the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.930
 we can taste 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.129
 and this was cooking jello 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.420
 and so they want it with milk because with the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.420
 lecce 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.800
 chocolates there are people who put fruit 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.680
 but his day when he is here 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.150
 you said cat are catches we can 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.370
 put in fact is like gelatin the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.930
 you can put as flan you have to the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.530
 plan takes honey up when this one 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.750
 You can put your party or jam 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.730
 or cards with snow 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.730
 because you can put mayonnaise 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.910
 so what was it that you can put on 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.910
 with the points 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.840
 since it looked a bit 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.840
 this is the important step 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.609
 two 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.609
 if it is giving you the temptation 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.579
 it is hot 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.540
 what are you taking where I am grabbing 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.150

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.810
 is that it is new camera does not know you leave 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.810

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.819
 very well 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.430
 and is that you burn yourself with these 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.370
 things 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.980
 green towels good one next 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.599
 Stumbling styles you have to be careful 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.599
 because of his back 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.630

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.169

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.680

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.680
 Y 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.389
 and here we gelatin by 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.249
 time to stop leaving one like 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.040
 the steam 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:49.890
 and that steam 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.740
 and the gelatin is going to be ready and this 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.240
