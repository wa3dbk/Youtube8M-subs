another<00:00:01.500> thing<00:00:01.829> that<00:00:01.860> modern<00:00:02.429> societies

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
another thing that modern societies

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.260 
another thing that modern societies
brought<00:00:03.330> us<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.810> microwave<00:00:04.350> oven<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.270> so

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
brought us is the microwave oven and so

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.620 
brought us is the microwave oven and so

short period of time and they cook the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.170 
short period of time and they cook the
food<00:00:31.920> from<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> inside<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> way

food from the inside out and the way
they<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:33.780> they<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.380> vibrate

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
they do it what they do is they vibrate

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
they do it what they do is they vibrate
they<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.300> more<00:00:36.600> than<00:00:36.750> vibrate

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
they actually it's more than vibrate

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
they actually it's more than vibrate
they<00:00:37.770> explode<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.120> molecules<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> food

they explode the molecules in the food
against<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.590> another<00:00:40.890> which<00:00:41.430> such

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I personally don't own a microwave but

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.569 
I personally don't own a microwave but
if<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> buy<00:00:50.910> oven<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.920> instruction<00:00:53.430> book

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
if you buy oven in the instruction book

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.549 
if you buy oven in the instruction book
as<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.820> say<00:00:54.000> after<00:00:54.149> cooking<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.750> food<00:00:54.899> let

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
as they say after cooking the food let

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.189 
as they say after cooking the food let
it<00:00:55.710> sit<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.910> minute<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.480> two<00:00:57.539> before<00:00:57.809> eating

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it sit for a minute or two before eating

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.389 
it sit for a minute or two before eating
it<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.910> they<00:00:59.910> don't<00:01:00.030> say<00:01:00.239> why<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.399> common

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it and they don't say why and common

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.860 
it and they don't say why and common
sense<00:01:02.550> would<00:01:02.760> say<00:01:02.910> oh<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.210> too<00:01:03.420> hot<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
sense would say oh it's too hot and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.890 
sense would say oh it's too hot and
that's<00:01:04.530> part<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> Inc<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:06.299> other<00:01:06.450> factor

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that's part of it Inc the other factor

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
that's part of it Inc the other factor
is<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.229> those<00:01:07.380> molecules<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.520> food<00:01:08.729> are

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is when those molecules of food are

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.719 
is when those molecules of food are
exploding<00:01:09.720> into<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.530> another<00:01:10.740> chip<00:01:11.040> damages

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
exploding into one another chip damages

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.630 
exploding into one another chip damages
the<00:01:12.600> molecules<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.740> free<00:01:14.070> radicals

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the molecules and you get free radicals

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.210 
the molecules and you get free radicals
and<00:01:15.030> after<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> couple<00:01:15.930> minutes<00:01:16.200> many<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.100> those

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and after a couple minutes many of those

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
and after a couple minutes many of those
free<00:01:17.549> radicals<00:01:17.729> find<00:01:18.330> their<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:18.659> back<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
free radicals find their way back and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.469 
free radicals find their way back and
become<00:01:19.500> paired<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.060> don't<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.360> as

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
become paired and so they don't do as

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
become paired and so they don't do as

preferably wood you know not that's not
very<00:01:42.060> practical<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.290> gas<00:01:43.619> fire<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.340> useful

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
very practical so gas fire is useful

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
very practical so gas fire is useful
microwave<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:49.140> least<00:01:49.380> useful<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:50.549> of
