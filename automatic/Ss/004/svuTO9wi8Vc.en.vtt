nothing like that I mean we were out
running<00:01:06.490> around<00:01:06.720> 170<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:07.930> was<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.080> little

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
running around 170 and it was a little

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.650 
running around 170 and it was a little
bumpy<00:01:08.710> but<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.100> boat<00:01:09.310> handling<00:01:09.640> well<00:01:09.970> the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
bumpy but the boat handling well the

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.560 
bumpy but the boat handling well the
short<00:01:10.900> we<00:01:11.110> put<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.410> short<00:01:11.650> wing<00:01:11.860> on<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.340> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
short we put the short wing on it and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.830 
short we put the short wing on it and
just<00:01:13.570> for<00:01:13.930> just<00:01:14.530> for<00:01:14.650> making<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.100> speed<00:01:15.340> runs

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
just for just for making the speed runs

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.630 
just for just for making the speed runs
it<00:01:16.840> handles<00:01:17.229> handled<00:01:18.190> better<00:01:18.280> with<00:01:18.550> the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
it handles handled better with the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.340 
it handles handled better with the
longer<00:01:18.970> wing<00:01:19.119> on<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.780> rear<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.290> row

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
longer wing on it in the rear in the row

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.410 
longer wing on it in the rear in the row
of<00:01:20.440> water<00:01:20.770> just<00:01:21.369> because<00:01:21.700> it's<00:01:21.850> up<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.360> the

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
of water just because it's up on the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.820 
of water just because it's up on the
cushion<00:01:22.840> more<00:01:23.050> but<00:01:24.869> overall<00:01:25.869> it's<00:01:26.200> I<00:01:26.440> mean<00:01:26.740> the

guys in the hydroplane circuit four five
six<00:02:05.410> years<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.300> they<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.660> mean<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.320> never

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
six years and they I mean I never

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.730 
six years and they I mean I never
underestimate<00:02:09.399> what<00:02:09.880> they<00:02:10.060> can<00:02:10.270> do<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:11.290> then
