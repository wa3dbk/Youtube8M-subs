00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.109
 is very difficult for us to say that the 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:25.900
 moment the photograph is f 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.359
 It was important that you entered the photograph. 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.339
 entered the mind of the moment I entered with 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.470
 everybody buy my wife there 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.559
 bought a bed and I discovered 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.530
 photography through this camera o the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.050
 my relationship with photography began to 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.750
 grow and I joined in a moment 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.710
 I left everything in my career and I will come 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.989
 photographer but in reality I think 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.329
 I started to push the camera button to 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.339
 from a moment but the photographs 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.609
 began to be made 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.829
 condemn you from where I come to the lights 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.670
 that I brought with me the way I 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.809
 I learned to see, it's not my mother, my father. 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.600
 my story 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.119
 in fact the body of work of a 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.369
 photographer at the end of his life is a 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.049
 coherence of life that all he 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.799
 He saw everything he learned everything he 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.380
 felt it is not photography in reality is 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.780
 a language a very language 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.600
 very strong with the language with 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.600
 a song that needs no translation the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.479
 6pack photography in brazil you can be 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.320
 read anywhere on the planet 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.149
 It's a privilege, then, to have had the 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.729
 opportunity to turn towards the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.740
 photo but it was not 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.619
 from that moment I started to 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.659
 to photograph that photography started me 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.299
 I photographed my life with my 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.310
 story with everything I could bring 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.470
 within the limit of the materialize 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.490
 photography 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.490
 everything was missing 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:10.650
 photographers have been working for a long time 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.690
 I have friends that I've seen working with 90 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.240
 95 years old 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.970
 I remember that I arrived in Mexico once 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.740
 the anniversary of the brave Ã¡lvarez 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.230
 the Mexican photographer of the history of 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.120
 mexico finally I celebrated the 100 years 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.290
 I arrived at his house for a drink and I 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.370
 I have to demonstrate my photographs. 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.590
 I was not surprised she knows 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.700
 I really did not have any photos. 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.520
 so it's a profession that we do not 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.740
 There is a limit to the genius that I 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.180
 I'm very sorry, I had to travel a lot and 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.770
 I had to walk a lot 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.590
 a report I made in the north of 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.550
 haiti office 850 kilometers walk from 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.550
 mountains 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.360
 I passed three times as high as 4,200 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.430
 meters 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.160
 I did it because I had no road and I 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.050
 wanted in that region then physically 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.310
 for me it was 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.890
 was a challenge but in reality the greatest 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.810
 trip I did on my twins, nor was it 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.540
 Cold trips made walking 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.260
 nor the countries that I have been the regions that 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.330
 I was 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.610
 I think the trip inside of me 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.530
 even what I saw I learned that I 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.590
 I discovered my relationship with my planet. 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.930
 so it was fantastic for me 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.090
 Look when I started the genes project is 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.940
 I thought it was my last project 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.080
 because a project I knew if the long 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.930
 term 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.500
 I was going to spend eight years because what I 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.020
 I made a kind of you. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.320
 of course I wrote a real project 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.390
 knows that I spend eight years and like me 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.770
 was going to work on finishing around 70 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.330
 years ago it was my last project but 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.280
 today 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.900
 then I ended up hearing about a 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.400
 bit of energy I can do 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.410
 a little more 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.490
 I'm designing to climb to the top of 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.920
 foggy peak the shaman group - and the 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.980
 name I 'm starting a job 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.590
 about the amazon about the movement 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.360
 Brazilian indigenous possibly not 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.590
 will be a work of intensity to 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.500
 intensity of genres but I do not think 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.030
 I'll stop shooting, I'll continue 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.590
 no kick or bike 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.400
 if we for hosting us here 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.400
 then you must not
