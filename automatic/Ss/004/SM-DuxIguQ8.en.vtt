00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.510
 hello to all and militate there 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.550
 I hope you wear well and 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.230
 today we meet again for the video 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.050
 that you all expected 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.770
 the pvp video tomorrow rogue 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.170
 attention be careful so I warn 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.340
 right now really and that's it 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.070
 really something important 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.040
 do not worry and I say it to 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.960
 all the brave and to all the riders where 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.360
 the people who take me ray for what 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.800
 would take me for us because they 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.989
 play a lot better rogue etc 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.850
 yes I am a noob with a rogue 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.800
 no seriously this is where it was 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.780
 first time of my life that I played 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.930
 rogue I know I did some 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.360
 mistakes there is no problem on that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.369
 but give me time to master 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.140
 my class perfectly and I you 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.360
 will show and you will necessarily 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.729
 see the evolution of my level 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.259
 so here it is the first first 1st 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.649
 first big fight I'm doing with 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:27.820
 this rogue to get up and pvp 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.189
 so it's against 1 that screams with 3500 of 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.110
 so life in cargo breakage panels is at 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.150
 the cascarra arch is therefore worth 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.189
 complete what so you have to know that the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.640
 rogue was not singing 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.049
 everywhere and level neither level goes out nor 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.770
 stats level I was trying to make a 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.930
 maximum 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.939
 I have already spent 40 million teeth 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.619
 for the stats there right now so I 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.860
 will try to be really 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.950
 really perfect but then the stuff is 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.850
 not optimized trode 1 to 1 of 2 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.369
 zot kids 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.380
 there really is no optimization 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.390
 resistance etc etc 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.549
 these words our elements so it's some 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:13.000
 something that is absolutely not viable in 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:16.060
 pvp 1 v1 to get up here there is 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.239
 so that's really the first fight and 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.420
 it's normal that I play badly so not 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.430
 of confession of panic for this fight is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.959
 for others besides that I 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.450
 will post because I really want that 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.519
 you see the evolution of my game and 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.310
 the game technique and I do not mind 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.940
 show everyone that we are all 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.330
 noob a day more or less and me 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.980
 listen I was pretty noble there and that's 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.900
 normal when it's my first fight on 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.560
 come not forged not to master my fact 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.750
 four in one day 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.490
 well, here it will take me a little 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.610
 time to master the rogue class 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.040
 but in any case I hope it's okay 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.170
 please seven new characters and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.520
 this new series so I believe that 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.320
 it's really that it's okay 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.240
 please because I like it 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.940
 I love their rogues 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.600
 game system etc 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.040
 williams - there is way to do some 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.380
 very very nice thing 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:15.370
 here we go, otherwise I saw for my video 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.400
 yesterday that you did not really like 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.690
 in any case appreciated the principle of 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.860
 make comments there with 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.020
 subscribers so the contest winners 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.930
 of course and me too I find that 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.360
 really great i still want to 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.310
 thank you causse morel it was great 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.730
 cool and I'm really waiting with 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.050
 impatience the others commented rich 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.480
 who will arrive from elsewhere shortly 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.130
 do not worry you just have to 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.070
 we talk a little more about what we're going 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.520
 to clarify and that's with the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.220
 second and third winner but that 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.090
 going to come 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.180
 it's really something that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.180
 so I appreciate to share precisely my 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.060
 passion with subscribers finally I find 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.800
 it's really super cool and 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.780
 apparently you too so that's 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:11.230
 doubly super if not the rogue hand 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.900
 right now and more optimized than ex that 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.359
 what you see right now l1 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.060
 really better stuff at the level of 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.799
 especially resistors and multi 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.140
 elements like that it will do 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.720
 something more viable at 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.010
 level 2 of the pvp but every thing in his 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.800
 time for now we see my 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.310
 Rogue's first attempts 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.490
 big nag on two girls zot no 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.070
 pity 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.770
 something else there is another duet task which 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.860
 will happen very quickly normally that I 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.950
 do with these beds so you'll see this 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.620
 that it will be quickly but I think that 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.729
 it's a solo tech that will please you 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.290
 it's a rescue that's still 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.150
 quite difficult so I think it's okay 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.930
 not be easy easy easy for us 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.990
 to succeed 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.669
 in any case we will see that quickly 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.800
 but in any case do not worry 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.510
 is going to be full of other things that 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.830
 are going to happen on the chain you've seen 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.150
 that right now it's a bit difficult 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.010
 for me to release a video every 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.520
 days because I do not have the job but 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.699
 it's normal 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.580
 like everyone here but it's coming 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.949
 quickly do not worry alas 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.699
 little bong combo that is almost 900 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.620
 damage rather rather nice and 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.970
 the sacred that is they 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.949
 find at mid life who has power to 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.789
 stuffing with punishment no doubt 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.229
 finally I think he'll do that a 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.330
 small bag the icam is not bad to be 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.360
 get up the go it screams cascading at 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.760
 it remains that friendly who played and 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.210
 you notice that he has 5 level more 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.610
 than me 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.139
 we see there yes that's it 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:52.470
 since I am 130 232 to the group for 1 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.180
 voice there and I'm one in two but without 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.610
 mastery there it was not the best 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.669
 choice 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:03.900
 in any case the sacred which is not bad 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:05.960
 seen it was a potting game that made 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.419
 really finally sit pretty well 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.240
 with danflous to pardon who are rather 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:16.139
 I do not even know if his case who were 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:20.130
 fmi where we will see that if I redo a 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.750
 blow finally in any case it's true to 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.820
 it's really nice the kid is me 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.199
 I like in two it's a good 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.849
 hammer but absolutely not viable in 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.949
 pvp 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:32.669
 for sure when I see others 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.960
 players who does not start like me who 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.479
 are crazy lorenzi etc 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.310
 I tell myself that it will be necessary that 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.080
 I put myself if I climbed degraded 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.750
 Well, it's not that I'm not going to 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.190
 guard like that but it's just that 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.690
 as much as doing things well 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.910
 that's all about doing things well but 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.789
 it'll do I really have this little 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.380
 fight it was so cool 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.030
 finally at this moment I like to play 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.039
 with occasionally not all the time 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.140
 because the main character before 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.940
 what is the fairy cat and it is true that 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.420
 I like having both 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.160
 but it's really cool too 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.590
 change class to have a character 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.030
 a little smaller with the rocks that 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.740
 are less important but others 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.630
 aspects of the game that are more important 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.570
 finally it's me I like it makes me 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:24.120
 it's nice it's really cool and 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.950
 in any case do not worry and he 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.270
 there will be others 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.100
 other little videos on my rogue 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.100
 and I really invite you but really 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:38.010
 to tell me what you think 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:38.790
 and precisely really in commentary 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.890
 say what you think 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.840
 if I have to continue or not if you 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.900
 not like of course I 'll stop seeing 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:49.470
 that it is above all an exchange for 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.590
 both so the community and me 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.180
 my subscribers and me and if you like it 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.540
 not but I do not see the interest of 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.660
 continue because that's it for 

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.830
 you first and foremost that I do it and sees 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.510
 the end of the fight in fast rising mode 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.340
 play 

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.260
 really offers to put in 

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.150
 comment if you enjoyed I 

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.410
 tell you very soon everyone at 

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.100
 join me months on the networks 

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.700
 social 

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.700
 Hi
