00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.549
 is the beginning then 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.850
 stability 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.910
 you do not lose the pedÃ¡nea how many 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.630
 you leave a lot of time elevated a single exercise a raised tire does not happen 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.989
 absolutely nothing 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.989
 However, thanks to all the years I would say that 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.550
 that they have developed in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.839
 michelle allows us to do all this kind of 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.249
 of roads singtel vehicles a year in fact that island 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.919
 the purpose that we want to demonstrate does not take with this type of evidence by 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.850
 example we pretexts to the inclination of 42 degrees api the maximum 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.870
 of 45 something that the actors therefore as far as aduriz in the cove this the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.590
 suspension geometry that good for for example this type of 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.680
 change is going to compensate the other very important the destruction of weights 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.420
 all the mechanical components are placed in such a way that it weighs as very 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.220
 good one side and the other not 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.120
 that makes us feel security 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.239
 in a 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 pending release in an intervention of this kind 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.820
 now for example 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.200
 us this 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.590
 prays all 4 4 systems that counts Chile 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.890
 in his life psc-psoe is not very pronounced Basque 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.940
 with descents 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.590
 we also see that the one that always has very good traction 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.590
 this thanks to the relationship that the transfer box has 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.560
 or in the four by four low range not like most what 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.390
 they know him 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.770
 and in turn is induced for example in this descent 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.700
 I can release the brake pedal and automatically the one that works 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.100
 when the complaint 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.299
 or that satiety is not completely gone 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.130
 exactly 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.580
 then bother you 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.620
 very useful not annex the 4 by 4 especially when they are down to 100 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.729
 ormes that hide earth and everything 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.630
 which is very difficult how to stop 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.439
 position 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.390
 in a car that does not have this system acts strikes 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.830
 but enough and told me that the car always bury the return then 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.190
 they flipped clear then the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.840
 a very important for all this kind of 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840
 of roads now here in mind with a system 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.809
 kessel 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:14.869
 stabilitrak able to do an extraction control and instability helps us 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:19.219
 a lot was in difficult situations especially when a wheel that was 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.459
 this one for example in the air or is skating by sensors of speed 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 from each of the wheels the controller knows what 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:31.269
 which one is skating then is doing the weight distribution 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.540
 I beg pardon of three traction monkeys needed 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.039
 for what is clear is that the ball 2 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.729
 will not try to mess up after arranging the walls but the car because many 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.020
 many times cars 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.850
 years ago 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.500
 go as you are not sanctioned that 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.409
 your car wants to go is exactly 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.429
 that is the purpose and common other four by four 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.999
 this title to this four-wheel drive back an eye area 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.230
 and is that I am the best who is 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.879
 to relate 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.339
 and the whole fraction c thanks to the other three wheels 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.999
 that were static and that's where really there you need as the 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.350
 power for you 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.499
 gets you ahead in a difficult situation 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:15.449
 The stability that helps us distribute all this type of 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.979
 of traction either forward back left or right or crossed that 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.999
 system is electronic now has other systems that do the same 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.070
 but mechanically we call it blocked the difference imdeec 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.590
 although it does not have any button located in the form of a board, although it takes 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.279
 tic environment 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.790
 it acts very well 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.269
 in our team 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.139
 by the no 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.309
 It is very very useful 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.729
 also another point to note that in my comment 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:52.369
 d if we left it for a long time because it did not damage cicpc 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:53.359
 notice that no 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.409
 is built under a chassis that friends formed 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.359
 which is so rigid that for example the stosic body 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.149
 many people may be that this one crooked 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:07.839
 timoshenko judged account that we can open and close full 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.409
 the gas 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.109
 and this and we see that do not wait 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.109
 those that do not absolutely nothing happens 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:18.890
 he who does not suffer 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.890
 a kind of acting or anything like that 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.889
 that also helps us because it benefits us the real life that is a car 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.360
 That this 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.090
 that it was time to give an impulse to the use of this type of road 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.909
 because it's going to be more more durable, it's not going to come out that much noise 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.770
 if they realize it is perfectly assembled there are no movements of the 

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:45.819
 grondona board side the suspension screams 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.050
 the students many of those who do not give us chiriano 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.779
 crytek hundreds of the best truck four by four of lorca 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.050
 so is 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.900
 to better peak
