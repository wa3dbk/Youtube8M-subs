grams so what you're ending up with is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.200 
grams so what you're ending up with is
is<00:00:57.539> by<00:00:57.780> removing<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.319> you're<00:00:58.800> taking<00:00:59.219> 5%<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
is by removing that you're taking 5% of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
is by removing that you're taking 5% of
the<00:01:00.510> weight<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> drone<00:01:01.409> off<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.039> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the weight of the drone off of it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.739 
the weight of the drone off of it
what<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> could<00:01:02.999> allow<00:01:03.179> you<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.569> with

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
what that could allow you to do with

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.210 
what that could allow you to do with
that<00:01:03.899> weigh<00:01:04.050> savings<00:01:04.530> may<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.800> go<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> high

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
that weigh savings may be go with a high

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740 
that weigh savings may be go with a high
of<00:01:05.250> milliamp<00:01:05.670> hour<00:01:05.820> battery<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> can

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
of milliamp hour battery so that you can

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
of milliamp hour battery so that you can
have<00:01:06.870> a<00:01:06.900> little<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.350> more<00:01:07.530> runtime<00:01:08.180> possibly

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
have a little bit more runtime possibly

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.030 
have a little bit more runtime possibly
add<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.659> accessories<00:01:10.409> maybe<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.890> some

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
add some accessories maybe like some

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.500 
add some accessories maybe like some
LEDs<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.700> something<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.480> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
LEDs or something like that to the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570 
LEDs or something like that to the
outside<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> drone<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:14.160> really<00:01:14.400> have

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
outside of the drone and not really have

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940 
outside of the drone and not really have
as<00:01:14.700> much<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.060> weight<00:01:15.240> penalty<00:01:15.690> on<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.990> what<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
as much of a weight penalty on it what I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.860 
as much of a weight penalty on it what I
have<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.370> is<00:01:17.730> another<00:01:18.210> body<00:01:18.510> that<00:01:18.660> I

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870

have right now is another body that I
have<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.320> I've<00:01:19.650> started<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.100> take<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
have and I've started to take the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.430 
have and I've started to take the
stickers<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> how-to<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.290> can

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
stickers off for the how-to what you can

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.780 
stickers off for the how-to what you can
see<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.920> basically<00:01:23.070> end<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.640> with

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
see is that you basically end up with

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.420 
see is that you basically end up with
just<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.120> all<00:01:24.240> black<00:01:24.720> foam<00:01:25.230> which<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.250> lot<00:01:26.400> of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
people might like it's a little bit

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.940 
people might like it's a little bit
stealthy<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.050> looking<00:01:28.290> maybe<00:01:28.620> it<00:01:28.770> doesn't

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
stealthy or looking maybe it doesn't

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
bit you can usually start to try and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.680

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
pull it away at one of the edges again

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.180 
pull it away at one of the edges again
you<00:02:59.050> want<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> be<00:02:59.320> real<00:02:59.560> careful<00:02:59.800> when<00:03:00.040> you're

you want to be real careful when you're
doing<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.610> because<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.270> don't<00:03:01.390> want<00:03:01.510> to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
doing this because you don't want to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.530 
doing this because you don't want to
pull<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.620> foam<00:03:02.860> itself<00:03:03.310> out<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.550> there<00:03:03.790> I

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.820 

found<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.690> at<00:03:07.840> these<00:03:07.990> front<00:03:08.320> two<00:03:08.380> edges

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
found that at these front two edges

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.949 
found that at these front two edges
seemed<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> best<00:03:09.550> places<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:10.030> start<00:03:10.209> and

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
seemed like the best places to start and

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.720 
seemed like the best places to start and
then<00:03:11.590> what<00:03:11.740> you're<00:03:11.860> going<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.010> want<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.459> and

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
then what you're going to want to do and

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.490 
then what you're going to want to do and
this<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.420> reason<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.810> have<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.200> glove

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
this is the reason that I have the glove

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.650 
this is the reason that I have the glove
is<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:15.459> basically<00:03:15.880> are<00:03:16.030> going<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.450> want<00:03:16.600> to

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
start slowly peeling it away and then

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.250 
start slowly peeling it away and then
