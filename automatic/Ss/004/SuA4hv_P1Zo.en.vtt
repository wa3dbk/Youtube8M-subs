00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.019
 appearance is deceptive today in my 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.269
 hands the camera seems to be serious 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.179
 SLR but actually it 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.110
 mirrorless and it's pretty light 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.539

 rulers al 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.449
 The concept of this camera is unusual about the stuffing 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.329
 the price for 2500 is similar to this here 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.010
 five thousand but it’s clear that 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.789
 the camera is larger and 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.809
 This is more convenient than a larger camera. 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.719
 easier to hold 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.969

 same screen due to this 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.609
 convenient to shoot in the sun in the viewfinder 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.359
 Better see the picture but harder to do 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.879
 selfie

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.750
 such a studio synchronizer in order 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.060
 to work with external flashes and 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.659
 it was especially interesting to check this 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.119
 script to shoot closer to sunset but still 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.500
 use external flash 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.500
 diffuser and radio synchronizer 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:43.810

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.930
 fit small from the nex series they 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.540
 easier cheaper compact well and in general 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.730
 It turns out to study in the menu in three thousand 500 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.520

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.230
 and even from an external battery putting 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.020
 break between shooting the camera in the bag 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.489
