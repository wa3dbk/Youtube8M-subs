backside but it's actually is
polycarbonate<00:02:18.849> so<00:02:19.849> where<00:02:20.150> we'll<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.720> how

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
polycarbonate so where we'll see how

that<00:02:21.049> phone<00:02:21.230> will<00:02:21.470> be<00:02:21.530> hopefully<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.459> will

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
that phone will be hopefully it will

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.330 
that phone will be hopefully it will
come<00:02:22.879> quick<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.959> comes<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.829> 16<00:02:25.129> gigabyte

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
come quick and it comes on a 16 gigabyte

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.160 
come quick and it comes on a 16 gigabyte
variant<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.060> from<00:02:26.239> what<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.420> did<00:02:26.659> see<00:02:26.870> was

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
variant and from what I did see was

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.009 
variant and from what I did see was
pretty<00:02:27.439> expensive<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:29.120> think<00:02:29.329> that

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
pretty expensive so I really think that

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.199 
pretty expensive so I really think that
the<00:02:30.230> LG<00:02:30.560> might<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:31.340> some<00:02:31.519> problems<00:02:32.000> because

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
the LG might have some problems because

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.930 
the LG might have some problems because
last<00:02:32.569> year<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> LG<00:02:33.170> g2<00:02:33.349> at<00:02:34.129> least<00:02:34.310> broadly<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
last year the LG g2 at least broadly it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.440 
last year the LG g2 at least broadly it
was<00:02:35.329> very<00:02:35.629> affordable<00:02:36.349> and<00:02:36.849> we'll<00:02:37.849> see<00:02:38.120> this

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
was very affordable and we'll see this

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.160 
was very affordable and we'll see this
time<00:02:38.690> around

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
time around

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.599 
time around
if<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.730> LG<00:02:40.730> g3<00:02:41.180> will<00:02:42.049> be<00:02:42.290> at<00:02:42.769> affordable<00:02:43.280> so

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
if the LG g3 will be at affordable so

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.750 
if the LG g3 will be at affordable so
yeah<00:02:43.970> quick<00:02:44.480> video
