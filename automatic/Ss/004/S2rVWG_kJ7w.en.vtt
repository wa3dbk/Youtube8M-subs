00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hey people welcome to another 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.859
 Coach carroll like today we dedicate ourselves 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.180
 us the defender I have 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.730
 again some players picked out 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.410
 which in my opinion the best or that 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 Best price to offer performance ratio 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.940
 and to have comparatively cheap 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.949
 especially in this case but the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 rest already and then catch a message 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.060
 We'll take a look at the first player 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.710
 I want to show you briefly is Cosima 9 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.670
 It costs millions to have a good one 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 so many 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 So that means if you do not have the money 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.609
 I did not need that then 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.779
 did not need him at all 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.420
 pull because he is expensive 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.760
 It costs 9 million at the beginning of 18 years 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.579
 is he young has a potential of 85 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.440
 a current value of 74 and 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.719
 actually the perfect value for the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.039
 defender relatively quickly 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.510
 physically strong to 1 90 large after all 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.160
 three stars weak foot and two 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.270
 Star skills can also be wrongful 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.989
 play medium medium 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.770
 These are very very good values 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 huge potential in any case 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.280
 but he is just enormously expensive 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.020
 I then took him with me 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.579
 even if it is not as cheap as it is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.379
 actually the goal is because he stops 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.659
 I already had a tremendously good last year 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.100
 he had this really really good this 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.520
 probably also because he holds the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.659
 whole values ​​as must be 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.710
 so if you have a lot of money if 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.090
 her career started with one 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.630
 team that has a lot of money has no idea 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.939
 chelsea mancity anything in the direction 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.799
 Monaco what I have to then you or then 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.650
 you do not have to, you can not buy yourself 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.930
 I would recommend if not then 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.640
 surely you can not afford it 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.990
 you want all your money for it 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.670
 but we'll spend that again 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.280
 I do not know if that's the thing to serve 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 would be a matter of opinion 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 let's get to the next aic nathan aki 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.890
 I do not know dutch so 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.299
 at least you could say it 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.829
 little brother of david luiz if you can 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.540
 look at him he looks the same 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.520
 has the same fluffy hair that has 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.869
 the same face in the reason almost 18 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.740
 years young at least also at 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.670
 chelsea play inside linebacker 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.990
 Physically relatively weak for the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.479
 defender this is a big one 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.520
 weak spot but he is very fast 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.219
 has a price of 76 approximately so far 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.200
 I know not the largest but 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.360
 he sees so it really is david 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.989
 luiz in the reason he is fast he can 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.610
 also offensively what he is all so that 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.030
 Basically it just stops a few 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.890
 years younger 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.930
 It costs 21 million, anyway 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.060
 a total rating of 67 in the beginning 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.650
 a potential of 84 that means so too 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.220
 especially a very high potential here 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.409
 for this money very good all-rounder 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.000
 can once again into the 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.040
 offensive turn on with his good 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.450
 ball control with his mid 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.560
 also very good dribbling actually that 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.599
 It will certainly get better 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.010
 his other good offensive 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.329
 and so on are in the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.019
 help open the game is on 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.900
 every event be his thing 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.010
 defensive not so good unfortunately because 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.000
 he is relatively weak but me 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.129
 think that will change with time too 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.019
 if you develop it frequently 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.879
 because he is still as I said 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.709
 at 67 so has still in the reason 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.890
 at least 17 to get up if you have him 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.780
 at least one is used correctly 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.370
 Recommendation worth 2 1 million cheap 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.140
 you can not go wrong 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.549
 especially because it does not stop there 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.489
 It's all about the money because it stops 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.099
 not so much then we can 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.569
 karim rekik 15 million just rather 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.579
 a tremendous game for this money 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.799
 problem with him is like so 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.480
 often heard namely buy because he 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.609
 He is on loan at PSV Eindhoven 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.829
 borrowed from mancity will be there so 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.930
 you can return there 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.459
 So their only or can it to the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.019
 submit an offer next year 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.329
 in the second season of her career 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.150
 but he brings everything will power and 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.459
 I need strong physically fast 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.730
 Believe also relatively tall 185 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.419
 fine with me 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.859
 defensive very well 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.389
 So everything you need in the reason 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.950
 just like that, just keep it clear 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.480
 cheaper because he also has one 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.900
 little younger is overall rating 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.519
 Anyway, he has 73 points potential 84 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.840
 as well as here very much development well 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.180
 yes, why is the difference between 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.669
 him and between rick and so on 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.889
 it is huge though it is relative 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.530
 I do not like to say good question 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.000
 but I do not know 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.230
 yes so you have to on the case 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.419
 or should that be an eye in any case 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.699
 throw and wait as he is 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.959
 developed in eindhoven and whether he should 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.790
 he returns to mancity 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.680
 I'm still affordable for you 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.780
 I hope so, and I do not think so 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.220
 now within a year the 2 5 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.530
 million or so will I think 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.729
 about three million came around 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.329
 then maybe settle down a bit 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.820
 more who knows 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.099
 but he should definitely still 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.660
 endurable be then but have lloris 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.160
 or year 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.080
 yes, I 'm sure I pronounce 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
 and he is just an absolute crusher 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.509
 I I meant at times 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.539
 he is not tall 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:39.240
 so big but he is relatively fast over 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.419
 70 and has a strength between 91 and 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.009
 95 and so it's tremendous 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.199
 incredibly physically strong he is 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.630
 he did not grow up fast 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.060
 but jumping can be enormously high 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.669
 very good defensive sets is just 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.990
 20 years young but 1.8 million worth 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.909
 Again, the problem comes back to 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.840
 Therefore, we have only recently begun to work for us 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.030
 so club is active 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.590
 blablabla it is only next here 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.970
 but also possible in any case 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.370
 recommendable player fast 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.449
 physically enormously enormously strong so not 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.159
 just a little bit but really 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.650
 really blatantly strong one of the strongest 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.659
 player and that in the old age that is 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.509
 So in a few years of development 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:18.960
 this is definitely one for the post 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.630
 99 strength overall rating has the 73 to 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.949
 current time potential 83 than he 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.169
 can definitely still at least 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:28.800
 10 points are more worrying 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.659
 99 come up to speed in the upper seventies 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.849
 already almost to the 80s 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.080
 that's really very good and then 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.940
 Even the last player Jonathan did 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.070
 The young junior player from Hamburg 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.650
 worth just 140000 so in the reason 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.479
 almost nothing not fast 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.340
 but you have to remember 17 years young 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.880
 The guy is younger than me two months 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.389
 has a body like what it eats 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.190
 192 big weighs 90 kilo is the one is 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.960
 He is 17 years young and is one 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.630
 Burglar a wall a colossus 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.400
 berserk in there 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.159
 85 the creation of him so young age 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.069
 overall rating around 60 potential of 83 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.740
 but if you are 17 years old 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.050
 just 60 so overall valuation 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.490
 then has 85 strength then it says well 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.990
 that he will at least I think at least 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.000
 or what it at least that he on duration 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.190
 the 99 days will get because that is 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.630
 really almost indispensable with such a 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.610
 development he probably lie down 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.900
 I think I would not 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.250
 necessarily be slow so 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.199
 acceleration is not just good though 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.789
 in sprint speed it ever in the good 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.919
 everything will go up 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.449
 Defensive values ​​are also very acceptable 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.819
 so that definitely one 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.960
 an idea for the longer view here 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.400
 Of course, again the problem man 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.319
 Can not Fly It Immediately You Can 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.099
 So theoretically, maybe you can 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:42.809
 you then a loan with purchase option 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.400
 negotiate I do not know I got it 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:47.279
 I do not try it, I just know it 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.719
 At least refuse a purchase transfer 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:50.129
 but what does the leyen stand for me 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:50.509
 think that in lion you can count on everyone 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:52.770
 case 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.539
 that you could also try times as 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.770
 I just do not think that works 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.839
 that he is such a giant with you 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.569
 Chance has a small club but says 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:02.069
 at a big club with 60 total is 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.139
 which are not used so often but 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.729
 These are open to the players if you are 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.830
 very much money off then is 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:08.339
 definitely a short summerer so if 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.339
 you really like that 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:12.569
 no idea a transfer budget of 50 

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:13.770
 million or so you can there 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:15.360
 strike without hesitation 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.520
 it will not disappoint you if you 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.069
 has less money and fast a player 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.779
 then he needs hierarchy or 11 and 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:23.449
 if you have little or not so much money 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:26.039
 and wait a bit then ok 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:27.629
 because he has everything you need 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:29.909
 similar to right and if you still 

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.979
 have much more time then jonathan 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:33.839
 but that will take a long time he has 60 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.979
 Total until he becomes highly developed 

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:36.389
 take a long time 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:37.949
 I guess three years or so 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:41.219
 at least so far in the 80s area 

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:42.810
 arrives therefore you need patience because 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:44.099
 with him but I think that will become 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.509
 also what worth at least with 

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:51.889
 this video next time come then 

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:51.889
 the cds and the zms are up and bye
