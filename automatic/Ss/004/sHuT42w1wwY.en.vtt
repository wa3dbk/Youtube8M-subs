I'll document now if you see this red

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.009 
I'll document now if you see this red
dot<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.650> that<00:00:30.430> is<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.789> play<00:00:31.090> icon<00:00:31.300> when<00:00:31.779> I<00:00:31.810> go

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
to press play the this icon will

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.119 
to press play the this icon will
actually<00:00:36.460> launch<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:40.030> annoying<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:42.010> a

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
actually launch very annoying and it's a

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.060 
actually launch very annoying and it's a
feature<00:00:42.340> I<00:00:42.489> know<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.960> might<00:00:44.110> guess<00:00:44.440> is<00:00:44.800> used

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
feature I know you might guess is used

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.720 
feature I know you might guess is used
quite<00:00:45.309> often<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:47.469> is<00:00:47.620> actually<00:00:47.860> going<00:00:48.039> on<00:00:48.460> I

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
quite often what is actually going on I

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.970 
quite often what is actually going on I
figure<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.180> out<00:00:49.329> is<00:00:49.629> is<00:00:50.500> that<00:00:50.800> it's

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
figure it out is is that it's

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.479 
figure it out is is that it's
miscalibrated<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.890> I<00:00:53.920> actually<00:00:54.219> have

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
miscalibrated and what I actually have

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.040 
miscalibrated and what I actually have
to<00:00:54.579> press<00:00:54.879> left<00:00:55.329> of<00:00:55.690> center<00:00:56.879> which<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:57.910> ok<00:00:58.840> if

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
to press left of center which is ok if

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.200 
to press left of center which is ok if
it's<00:00:59.289> just<00:00:59.559> myself<00:00:59.860> but<00:01:00.219> once<00:01:00.609> I<00:01:00.730> hand<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:01.090> off

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
it's just myself but once I hand it off

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
it's just myself but once I hand it off
to<00:01:01.239> somebody<00:01:01.570> else<00:01:02.100> guess<00:01:03.100> what<00:01:03.280> happens<00:01:03.869> I

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to somebody else guess what happens I

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.460 
to somebody else guess what happens I
believe<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.270> as<00:01:07.570> part<00:01:07.960> of<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.170> screen

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
believe that it is as part of the screen

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.370 
believe that it is as part of the screen
that's<00:01:08.710> being<00:01:08.890> affected<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.990> when<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.200> actually

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
that's being affected so when I actually

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.789 
that's being affected so when I actually
do<00:01:11.799> get<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.130> play<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:13.570> you<00:01:13.750> might<00:01:13.930> guess<00:01:14.260> that

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
do get to play is you might guess that

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.859 
do get to play is you might guess that
part<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.369> screen<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:18.689> still<00:01:19.689> has<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
part of the screen is it still has the

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.390 
part of the screen is it still has the
same<00:01:20.110> problem<00:01:20.170> when<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:20.799> actually<00:01:21.009> want<00:01:21.340> to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
same problem when I actually want to

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.179 
same problem when I actually want to
afford<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.840> video<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.439> actually<00:01:23.770> thinks<00:01:24.070> I

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
afford the video it actually thinks I

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:32.640 
afford the video it actually thinks I
want<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.810> increase<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.140> volume<00:01:30.150> ok<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:32.380> i

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
want to increase the volume ok if i

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.480 
want to increase the volume ok if i
press<00:01:33.490> perhaps<00:01:34.259> below<00:01:35.259> it<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.100> starts<00:01:39.430> to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
press perhaps below it then it starts to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.170 
press perhaps below it then it starts to
advance<00:01:41.939> very<00:01:42.939> very<00:01:43.509> annoying<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.970> might

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
advance very very annoying you might

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.060 
advance very very annoying you might
wonder<00:01:46.570> what<00:01:46.899> happened<00:01:47.380> when<00:01:47.530> i<00:01:47.560> tried<00:01:47.649> to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
actually you know you might guess that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.970 
actually you know you might guess that
didn't<00:02:42.640> fix<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.850> problem<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:44.110> got<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.800> back
