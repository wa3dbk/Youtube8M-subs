00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 same is let's say cooking the fire 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.000
 for cooking what is going to be 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 later a gin good morning 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.309
 jose antonio a 100% handmade gin 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.280
 you 're not seeing by olive wood from the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.960
 land natural products and in some 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.879
 facilities with a lot of antiquity and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.339
 much tradition there are many who 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.170
 they consume the gin but we do not know why 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.369
 example how it's done let's go by 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.440
 example I have the great curiosity of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.729
 know what your Raw materials 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.950
 how it is done here we are seeing this 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.380
 mister who is poking the candle like 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.090
 the good has said but where is the pot 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.710
 where it cooks what is thrown 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.030
 well I when explained this the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.250
 more natural vehicles so that what 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.140
 let's understand everything because the hole is 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 find in that place that they are two 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.170
 copper stills that would be the pot not 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.120
 what we are seeing right now in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.160
 screen very well 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.940
 and right now what we are is 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.940
 heating the product inside the water 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.800
 a stew 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.180
 we have put water in it so it does not 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 burn the chickpeas and do not miss us 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.690
 I would burn but today we are doing 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.690
 white money and we have thrown in black 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.270
 the juniper this seed that we have here 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.700
 is the lame voucher we are going to teach it to the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 camera look fernando the juniper that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.650
 from here I get the smell how good it is 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.360
 smell we look for it to be the most 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.980
 fresh possible that gives a lot of aroma the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.320
 product no more products we have put to 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.649
 the pot looks at the pot we put it 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.050
 as of said great winter water and 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.240
 alcohol and alcohol alcohol the alcohol that 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.650
 we use an alcohol that we do not want 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.360
 that they put it we're going to return the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.880
 product is alcohol comes from the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.440
 beet a food tree and comes 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.770
 almost 100 degrees of alcohol and with a 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.300
 almost pure alcohol that does say 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.970
 pure alcohol we have already put the juniper 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.520
 here is in the pot all the products 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.800
 with the firewood of the olive tree and this would be the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.150
 not fine result but for later 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.640
 subsequently make a mixture 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.920
 concentrated in which we take a 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.060
 concentrated to all the products that I 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.730
 I warmed up the variety 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.099
 as I explain here what we take advantage of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.500
 inside that still is the steam that 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.590
 produces 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.570
 and if that falcon that occurs is 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.540
 drive with those pipes that come out 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.970
 of the still go back to a pool 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.880
 what is 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.860
 refrigerated is the environment that we have 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.360
 of water that water that comes from a 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.460
 Roman spring of fitsa here in the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.380
 farm because what it does is cool the 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.810
 pipe the steam that has been produced 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.670
 inside our still goes through the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.100
 circuit cools and is not coming 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.510
 around here the concoction that if you want what 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.190
 I'm going to take it, not because now we're going to 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.990
 go fernando I 'm going to approach 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.090
 this concoction that for this I have to 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.980
 take the pot that is empty have 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.000
 subject meters subject mind jose antonio 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.000
 I take the pot that is empty 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.470
 the pot filled with the concoction and now we 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.540
 we go antonio to the part where then 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.160
 this product that comes very concentrated 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.960
 very tasty with lots of alcohol 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.020
 let's say we get to do a 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.580
 80 degree graduation is the colic 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.680
 we come and introduce it in this 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.140
 blender let's get closer fernando 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.910
 This would be the mixer, let's say that 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.400
 I would make the final product of this gin 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.690
 made entirely handmade here 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.180
 see me and I'm with the pitcher I'm with 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.820
 the concoction of gin Fernando 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.610
 they will fix the transparencies that the 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.740
 product is such a natural product that 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.740
 It will appear to the fact 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.470
 You see it 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.120
 and you will also see that impression of alcohol 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.860
 that is giving you the nose 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.630
 it smells from here and now once 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.550
 we have made this mix here 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.550
 it would be a mixer to understand it 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.889
 we wanted to put it to beat anything 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.780
 more to give the button 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.419
 what level of production do you have? 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.639
 look every time we are targeting 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.379
 we get a final product from 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.379
 about 8000 liters 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.110
 eight thousand books and sell for only 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.630
 for the area of Seville for men 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.790
 let's see if you understand me this was our 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.470
 first idea said molle with that 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.630
 sell between villa province 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.550
 capital would be an achievement for us not 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.720
 we have a person right now who is 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.720
 closing conversations in the postman 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.820
 then comes this gin made of 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.900
 artisan way fernando a product 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.900
 100% Andalusian
