hey everyone at survivals prepper dotnet
we're<00:00:10.889> doing<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.580> few<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.969> us<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.240> doing<00:00:12.360> a

survivalist challenge and what we do is

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.369 
survivalist challenge and what we do is
we<00:00:15.150> send<00:00:15.389> stuff<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.630> other<00:00:15.839> people<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.199> have

straps so one of the challenges was is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479 
straps so one of the challenges was is
to<00:00:33.090> make<00:00:33.270> my<00:00:33.540> own<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.440> decided<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.460> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to make my own so I decided to do that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.670 
to make my own so I decided to do that
and<00:00:35.700> then<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.600> other<00:00:36.750> challenge<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.500> set

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and then the other challenge was to set

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.619 
and then the other challenge was to set
it<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:37.920> test<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:38.760> test<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> overnight

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it up test it and then test it overnight

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.990 
it up test it and then test it overnight
so<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.980> haven't<00:00:41.430> gotten<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.670> chance<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so this one I haven't gotten a chance to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940 
so this one I haven't gotten a chance to
go<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> woods<00:00:43.110> yet<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.680> we're<00:00:43.920> just

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
go up up to the woods yet so we're just

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.470 
go up up to the woods yet so we're just
gonna<00:00:44.190> set<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.700> out<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.120> my<00:00:45.270> back<00:00:45.450> yard

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
gonna set it up out here in my back yard

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.250 
gonna set it up out here in my back yard
see<00:00:46.320> how<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> works<00:00:46.770> now<00:00:47.210> my<00:00:48.210> main<00:00:48.450> plan<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.960> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
see how it works now my main plan was to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590 
see how it works now my main plan was to
see<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.370> worked<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.480> I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
see how it worked with just that if I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.240 
see how it worked with just that if I
could<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.140> done<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> stuff<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.129> my

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
could get this done with the stuff in my

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.220 
could get this done with the stuff in my
bug-out<00:00:53.579> bag<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.539> showed<00:00:54.780> me<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> few

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
bug-out bag and it showed me a few

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
bug-out bag and it showed me a few
weaknesses<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> those<00:00:56.670> were<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.210> didn't

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
weaknesses one of those were I didn't

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.380 
weaknesses one of those were I didn't
have<00:00:57.600> enough<00:00:57.840> paracord<00:00:58.760> continuous<00:00:59.760> life<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
have enough paracord continuous life to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.959 
have enough paracord continuous life to
do<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> did<00:01:02.430> basically<00:01:02.640> was

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
do this and what I did basically was

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
do this and what I did basically was
take<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> hundred<00:01:03.629> feet<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> paracord<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
take a hundred feet of paracord and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.210 
take a hundred feet of paracord and
double<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.820> over<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.830> quadruplet<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.070> it's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
double it over so a quadruplet so it's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.490 
double it over so a quadruplet so it's
four<00:01:08.430> strands<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.780> tie<00:01:09.930> overhand

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
four strands and then just tie overhand

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.330 
four strands and then just tie overhand
knots<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
knots in it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.359 
knots in it
about<00:01:11.939> every<00:01:12.270> six<00:01:12.299> inches<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.310> but<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
about every six inches or so but I

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.460 
about every six inches or so but I
didn't<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.909> enough<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.259> my

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
didn't have that enough of that in my

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
didn't have that enough of that in my
bug-out<00:01:16.920> bag<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.580> continuous<00:01:18.090> strand<00:01:18.299> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
bug-out bag one continuous strand so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
bug-out bag one continuous strand so
that<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> weakness<00:01:19.530> another<00:01:20.430> weakness<00:01:20.759> is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
that was a weakness another weakness is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.440 
that was a weakness another weakness is
that<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.560> carabiners<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.210> knew

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that the carabiners and I kind of knew

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.140 
that the carabiners and I kind of knew
that<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> weakness<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.700> just

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that this was a weakness but the I just

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.819 
that this was a weakness but the I just
never<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.509> around<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
never got around to it but the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.460 
never got around to it but the
carabiners<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.790> not<00:01:30.450> weight<00:01:31.079> bearing

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
carabiners are not weight bearing

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.039 
carabiners are not weight bearing
they're<00:01:32.040> enough<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.700> hang<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.060> bag<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.960> know

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
they're enough to hang my bag you know

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.450 
they're enough to hang my bag you know
from<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.320> tree<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.560> something<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.280> that's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
from a tree or something but that's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.109 
from a tree or something but that's
about<00:01:35.700> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
about it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.210 
about it
so<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> thought<00:01:37.079> maybe<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.439> could<00:01:37.530> use<00:01:37.890> two<00:01:38.189> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
so I thought maybe I could use two of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.149 
so I thought maybe I could use two of
them<00:01:38.460> together<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.530> figured<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
them together and then I figured I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.319 
them together and then I figured I
didn't<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> guinea<00:01:42.030> pig<00:01:42.299> for

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
didn't want to be the guinea pig for

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.569 
didn't want to be the guinea pig for
that<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that so I'm not gonna do that what I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.300 
that so I'm not gonna do that what I
ended<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.000> doing<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.390> getting<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.899> couple<00:01:46.310> rock

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
ended up doing was getting a couple rock

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
ended up doing was getting a couple rock
climbing<00:01:47.759> carabiners<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.689> actually

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
climbing carabiners that are actually

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.280 
climbing carabiners that are actually
made<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.630> with<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.810> I'll<00:01:52.020> show<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
made for that so with that I'll show you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.319 
made for that so with that I'll show you
how<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.829> plan<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.220> setting<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.210> then

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
how I plan on setting this up and then

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.399 
how I plan on setting this up and then
we're<00:01:54.450> gonna<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.020> works

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
we're gonna see if it works

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.859 
we're gonna see if it works
Ian<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.390> end<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.600> falling

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
Ian just so you know if I end up falling

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.679 
Ian just so you know if I end up falling
on<00:01:58.079> my<00:01:58.259> butt<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.710> dreaming<00:01:59.460> I'm<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.540> gonna

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
on my butt I'm dreaming I'm not gonna

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.380 
on my butt I'm dreaming I'm not gonna
put<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.020> videos<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.790> let's<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.240> this

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
put in videos there so let's get this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.200 
put in videos there so let's get this
hooked<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.960> we'll<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.200> how<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.439> works

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
hooked up and we'll see how it works

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.550 
hooked up and we'll see how it works
alright<00:02:06.210> before<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.810> into<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> actual

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
alright before we get into the actual

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
alright before we get into the actual
hang<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.039> hammock<00:02:08.160> part<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.759> wanted<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> show

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
hang the hammock part I wanted to show

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.999 
hang the hammock part I wanted to show
you<00:02:09.390> how<00:02:09.629> how<00:02:10.170> these<00:02:10.410> straps<00:02:10.770> are

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
you how how these straps are

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250 
you how how these straps are
theoretically<00:02:11.790> supposed<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.450> work

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
theoretically supposed to work

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.130 
theoretically supposed to work
what<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.799> do<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.250> take<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.510> end<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:15.959> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
what you do is take the the end with the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.440 
what you do is take the the end with the
loop<00:02:16.319> around<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.799> right<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.640> throw<00:02:18.269> that

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
loop around it right here and throw that

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.490 
loop around it right here and throw that
around<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> tree<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.510> then<00:02:21.720> take<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.170> other

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
around the tree and then take this other

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.850 
around the tree and then take this other
end<00:02:23.329> with<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.840> knots<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.319> end<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.739> it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
end with and the knots the end of it

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.140 
end with and the knots the end of it
right<00:02:26.040> here<00:02:26.689> and<00:02:28.370> kind<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.430> put<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
right here and kind of put it in the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.030 
right here and kind of put it in the
direction<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.780> want<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.349> facing<00:02:31.650> where

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
direction you want it to be facing where

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.979 
direction you want it to be facing where
the<00:02:32.129> hammock<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.610> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.299> then

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
the hammock is going to be and then

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.180 
the hammock is going to be and then
tighten<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.360> theoretically<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.780> should

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
tighten that and theoretically it should

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.920 
tighten that and theoretically it should
have<00:02:38.190> enough<00:02:38.489> force<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.870> know

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
have enough force on that and I know

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.360 
have enough force on that and I know
I've<00:02:40.170> heard<00:02:40.379> that<00:02:40.560> you're<00:02:40.829> not<00:02:40.950> supposed<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
I've heard that you're not supposed to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.979 
I've heard that you're not supposed to
you're<00:02:41.700> supposed<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.000> use<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.299> actual<00:02:42.689> straps

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
you're supposed to use the actual straps

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.410 
you're supposed to use the actual straps
because<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.439> damages<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.069> tree<00:02:44.340> these<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.299> in

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
because it damages the tree these are in

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.149 
because it damages the tree these are in
my<00:02:45.569> yard<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:45.989> not<00:02:46.590> too<00:02:46.739> worried<00:02:46.920> about<00:02:46.980> that

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
my yard so not too worried about that

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.610 
my yard so not too worried about that
and<00:02:47.519> then<00:02:48.180> once<00:02:48.599> you<00:02:48.750> find<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> distance

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
and then once you find the distance

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.470 
and then once you find the distance
that's<00:02:49.980> why<00:02:50.220> these<00:02:50.280> knots<00:02:50.730> are<00:02:50.940> here<00:02:51.150> once<00:02:51.329> you

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that's why these knots are here once you

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.420 
that's why these knots are here once you
find<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> distance<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.409> you<00:02:52.470> need<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:53.310> get

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
find the distance that you need to get

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.309 
find the distance that you need to get
the<00:02:53.579> right<00:02:53.730> level<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.359> you<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.989> throw<00:02:55.170> that

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
the right level and you just throw that

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.680 
the right level and you just throw that
carabiner<00:02:55.829> on<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:57.060> hooks<00:02:57.239> up<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
carabiner on and it hooks up to the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.229 
carabiner on and it hooks up to the
hammock<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.620> we'll<00:02:59.099> see<00:02:59.310> how<00:02:59.760> well<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.030> works

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
hammock so we'll see how well that works

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.550 
hammock so we'll see how well that works
or<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.989> end<00:03:01.170> up<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.409> my<00:03:01.560> butternut<00:03:03.500> okay<00:03:04.500> so

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
or if I end up on my butternut okay so

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.039 
or if I end up on my butternut okay so
instead<00:03:05.129> of<00:03:05.190> making<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:05.940> sit<00:03:06.209> through<00:03:06.450> six

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
instead of making you sit through six

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.599 
instead of making you sit through six
minutes<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.560> silence<00:03:08.010> here<00:03:08.159> I'll<00:03:08.280> explain<00:03:08.310> you

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
minutes of silence here I'll explain you

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.420 
minutes of silence here I'll explain you
what<00:03:08.879> I'm<00:03:08.970> doing<00:03:09.329> I've<00:03:09.989> got<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.560> first<00:03:11.040> drop

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
what I'm doing I've got that first drop

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.039 
what I'm doing I've got that first drop
on<00:03:11.639> from<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.090> part<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.359> just<00:03:12.389> showed<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.810> in

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
on from the part I just showed you in

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.750 
on from the part I just showed you in
the<00:03:13.139> video<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.370> putting<00:03:14.549> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
the video and then I'm putting the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.050 
the video and then I'm putting the
second<00:03:15.150> strap<00:03:15.389> on<00:03:15.629> and<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:17.129> this<00:03:17.879> is

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
second strap on and this is this is

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.099 
second strap on and this is this is
about<00:03:18.560> 16<00:03:19.560> 17<00:03:19.859> feet<00:03:20.579> apart<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.359> it's<00:03:21.510> actually

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
about 16 17 feet apart and it's actually

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.860 
about 16 17 feet apart and it's actually
a<00:03:23.040> little<00:03:23.609> bit<00:03:23.699> too<00:03:23.910> close<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.389> thought<00:03:24.599> it<00:03:24.750> was

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
a little bit too close I thought it was

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.839 
a little bit too close I thought it was
gonna<00:03:25.560> be<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> little<00:03:26.040> bit<00:03:26.220> too<00:03:26.370> far<00:03:26.639> but

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
gonna be a little bit too far but

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.460 
gonna be a little bit too far but
actually<00:03:27.299> once<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.599> see<00:03:27.870> everything<00:03:28.260> put

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
actually once you see everything put

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.900 
actually once you see everything put
together<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.549> little<00:03:29.669> bit<00:03:29.879> too<00:03:30.090> close<00:03:34.910> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
together it's a little bit too close the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.839 
together it's a little bit too close the
cool<00:03:36.329> thing<00:03:36.599> about<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.280> hammock

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
cool thing about this the the hammock

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.729 
cool thing about this the the hammock
itself<00:03:39.359> is<00:03:39.569> it's<00:03:39.720> all<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.109> self-contained

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
itself is it's all in a self-contained

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.220 
itself is it's all in a self-contained
pouch<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:42.120> only<00:03:42.359> thing<00:03:42.540> that's<00:03:42.720> separate

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
pouch the only thing that's separate

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.110 
pouch the only thing that's separate
from<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.650> actual<00:03:43.919> hammock<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.760> string

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
from the actual hammock is the string

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.629 
from the actual hammock is the string
for<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:46.410> mosquito<00:03:46.799> net<00:03:47.099> that<00:03:47.280> you'll<00:03:47.430> see

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
for the the mosquito net that you'll see

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.819 
for the the mosquito net that you'll see
here<00:03:47.849> in<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.000> minute<00:03:48.269> but<00:03:48.449> it's<00:03:49.079> pretty<00:03:49.560> cool

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
here in a minute but it's pretty cool

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.349 
here in a minute but it's pretty cool
because<00:03:50.010> everything's<00:03:50.519> right<00:03:50.819> there<00:03:50.849> it's

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
because everything's right there it's

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.530 
because everything's right there it's
small<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:52.470> know<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.849> would<00:03:53.940> take<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.299> quite

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
small you know it it would take up quite

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.149 
small you know it it would take up quite
a<00:03:54.569> bit<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.870> room<00:03:55.019> in<00:03:55.199> your<00:03:55.230> bug<00:03:55.440> out<00:03:55.590> bag<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.069> it

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
a bit of room in your bug out bag but it

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.119 
a bit of room in your bug out bag but it
is<00:03:56.280> pretty<00:03:56.549> light<00:03:56.909> so<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.500> might<00:03:58.709> even<00:03:58.859> be<00:03:59.099> a

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
is pretty light so it might even be a

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.520 
is pretty light so it might even be a
good<00:03:59.220> thing<00:03:59.669> to<00:03:59.909> have<00:04:00.090> in<00:04:00.930> your<00:04:00.989> bug<00:04:01.290> out<00:04:01.470> bag

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
good thing to have in your bug out bag

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.319 
good thing to have in your bug out bag
because<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.099> takes<00:04:02.280> up<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.489> space<00:04:02.730> without<00:04:02.970> that

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
because it takes up a space without that

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.539 
because it takes up a space without that
weight<00:04:03.569> so<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.989> makes<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.889> where<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.190> can't

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
weight so it makes it to where you can't

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.909 
weight so it makes it to where you can't
use<00:04:06.540> up<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.989> space<00:04:07.199> with<00:04:07.440> something<00:04:07.769> that's

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
use up that space with something that's

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.849 
use up that space with something that's
weighs<00:04:08.159> a<00:04:08.190> lot<00:04:09.019> what<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.049> did<00:04:10.260> was<00:04:10.440> just<00:04:10.620> hooked

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
weighs a lot what I did was just hooked

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.219 
weighs a lot what I did was just hooked
up<00:04:11.040> there's<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.340> u-bolt<00:04:12.299> at<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.659> end<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:13.019> each

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
up there's a u-bolt at the end of each

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:14.750 
up there's a u-bolt at the end of each
end<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.680> hammock<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.549> hook<00:04:14.729> that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
end of the hammock and I just hook that

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:23.560 
end of the hammock and I just hook that
onto<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:15.870> hiking<00:04:16.590> carabiners<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.579> got

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.720 

and<00:04:24.570> then<00:04:25.110> just<00:04:25.470> adjusted<00:04:26.010> everything<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.520> cut

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
and then just adjusted everything I cut

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.890 
and then just adjusted everything I cut
a<00:04:26.760> little<00:04:26.910> bit<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.300> out<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:27.690> didn't

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
a little bit of that out so you didn't

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.840 
a little bit of that out so you didn't
have<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.020> sit<00:04:28.320> through<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:28.770> just<00:04:29.280> adjusted

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
have to sit through it but just adjusted

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.220 
have to sit through it but just adjusted
everything<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.360> want<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.600> make<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.140> where

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
everything you want to make it to where

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.530 
everything you want to make it to where
the<00:04:31.350> hammock<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.890> basically<00:04:32.340> straight<00:04:32.850> this

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
the hammock is basically straight this

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.420 
the hammock is basically straight this
is<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.810> first<00:04:34.110> time<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.350> had<00:04:34.590> done<00:04:34.740> this<00:04:34.920> so<00:04:35.400> the

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
is the first time I had done this so the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.780 
is the first time I had done this so the
the<00:04:36.300> first<00:04:36.570> time<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.170> did<00:04:37.470> my<00:04:37.500> adjustments<00:04:38.250> it

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
the first time I did my adjustments it

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.700 
the first time I did my adjustments it
was<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:38.970> little<00:04:39.210> low<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.720> ended<00:04:39.960> up<00:04:40.110> on<00:04:40.410> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
was a little low and I ended up on the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.490 
was a little low and I ended up on the
ground<00:04:40.950> so<00:04:41.460> if<00:04:42.240> you've<00:04:42.510> never<00:04:42.930> done<00:04:43.260> anything

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
ground so if you've never done anything

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.290 
ground so if you've never done anything
like<00:04:43.620> this<00:04:43.800> before<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:44.460> might<00:04:44.670> end<00:04:44.970> up<00:04:45.120> with

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
like this before you might end up with

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.060 
like this before you might end up with
the<00:04:45.480> same<00:04:45.990> problems<00:04:46.410> might<00:04:46.710> take<00:04:46.890> a<00:04:46.920> little

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
the same problems might take a little

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.330 
the same problems might take a little
bit<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:49.670> then<00:04:50.670> this<00:04:50.880> string<00:04:51.390> is<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.650> it's

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
bit and then this string is the it's

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.210 
bit and then this string is the it's
like<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.580> bungee<00:04:54.120> cord<00:04:54.150> type<00:04:54.780> string<00:04:55.230> that<00:04:55.440> goes

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
like a bungee cord type string that goes

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.880 
like a bungee cord type string that goes
around<00:04:56.400> there's<00:04:56.820> six<00:04:57.150> little<00:04:58.050> holes<00:04:58.260> on<00:04:58.620> each

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
around there's six little holes on each

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.520 
around there's six little holes on each
three<00:04:59.610> on<00:04:59.760> each<00:04:59.940> side<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.750> hammock<00:05:01.110> itself

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
three on each side of the hammock itself

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.880 
three on each side of the hammock itself
that<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.460> thread<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.000> through<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:04.380> did

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
that you thread that through and I did

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.160 
that you thread that through and I did
this<00:05:05.070> I<00:05:05.340> when<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:05.640> put<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.390> tree<00:05:06.660> this<00:05:07.110> is

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
this I when I put it on the tree this is

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.110 
this I when I put it on the tree this is
really<00:05:07.920> just<00:05:08.250> kind<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.490> for<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.790> video<00:05:09.060> I

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
really just kind of for the video I

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.140 
really just kind of for the video I
didn't<00:05:09.450> do<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.050> really<00:05:10.470> well<00:05:10.710> so<00:05:11.490> if<00:05:11.910> you're

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
didn't do it really well so if you're

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.120 
didn't do it really well so if you're
you<00:05:13.050> know<00:05:13.080> if<00:05:13.290> you're<00:05:13.440> in<00:05:13.590> any<00:05:13.740> kind<00:05:13.860> of

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
you know if you're in any kind of

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.560 
you know if you're in any kind of
wilderness<00:05:14.370> situation<00:05:14.850> where<00:05:15.419> you're

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
wilderness situation where you're

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.940 
wilderness situation where you're
actually<00:05:15.720> using<00:05:16.230> this<00:05:16.350> where<00:05:16.590> there<00:05:16.710> might<00:05:16.890> be

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
actually using this where there might be

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.070 
actually using this where there might be
some<00:05:17.130> wind<00:05:17.580> or<00:05:18.270> anything<00:05:18.480> like<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.750> you're

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
some wind or anything like that you're

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.720 
some wind or anything like that you're
gonna<00:05:19.230> have<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.620> fasten<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.160> little<00:05:20.580> bit

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
gonna have to fasten it a little bit

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.450 
gonna have to fasten it a little bit
better<00:05:20.880> than<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.210> did<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.570> but<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.620> just<00:05:23.010> did<00:05:23.340> it

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
better than I did it but I just did it

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.630 
better than I did it but I just did it
for<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.700> video<00:05:23.850> here<00:05:24.980> so<00:05:25.980> I'd<00:05:26.130> put<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.430> first

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
for the video here so I'd put the first

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.210 
for the video here so I'd put the first
three<00:05:26.910> on<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.630> inside<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:28.560> then<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.830> put<00:05:29.040> the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
three on the inside and then I put the

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.670 
three on the inside and then I put the
I'm<00:05:29.669> putting<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.120> second<00:05:30.540> three<00:05:30.780> on<00:05:31.410> the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
I'm putting the second three on the

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.700 
I'm putting the second three on the
outside<00:05:31.710> just<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.460> kind<00:05:32.700> of<00:05:32.760> raise<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:33.710> you

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
outside just to kind of raise that you

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.159 
outside just to kind of raise that you
know<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:34.860> didn't<00:05:35.160> really<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.900> would<00:05:36.900> do<00:05:37.020> it

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
know it didn't really I would do it

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.200 
know it didn't really I would do it
differently<00:05:37.530> next<00:05:37.770> time<00:05:37.919> basically<00:05:38.340> maybe

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
differently next time basically maybe

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.150 
differently next time basically maybe
have<00:05:39.690> it<00:05:39.720> be<00:05:39.990> a<00:05:40.020> little<00:05:40.110> more<00:05:40.290> spread<00:05:40.710> out<00:05:40.740> I

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
have it be a little more spread out I

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.700 
have it be a little more spread out I
ended<00:05:41.970> up<00:05:42.060> having<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.630> raise<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.260> hammock<00:05:43.620> a

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
ended up having to raise the hammock a

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.520 
ended up having to raise the hammock a
little<00:05:43.919> bit<00:05:44.040> too<00:05:44.340> so<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.690> little<00:05:46.140> bit<00:05:46.320> loose<00:05:46.500> but

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
little bit too so a little bit loose but

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.760 
little bit too so a little bit loose but
all<00:05:47.340> in<00:05:47.580> all<00:05:47.700> it<00:05:47.850> works

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.030 

and<00:05:54.520> then<00:05:54.670> like<00:05:54.880> I<00:05:55.000> said<00:05:55.030> I<00:05:55.240> had<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.770> raise<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:56.980> a

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
and then like I said I had to raise it a

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.710 
and then like I said I had to raise it a
little<00:05:57.220> bit<00:05:57.400> because<00:05:57.520> when<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:57.850> first<00:05:58.180> sat<00:05:58.450> down

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
little bit because when I first sat down

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.240 
little bit because when I first sat down
in<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.140> and<00:05:59.170> went<00:05:59.440> all<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.560> way<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.800> the<00:06:00.040> ground

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
in it and went all the way to the ground

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.490 
in it and went all the way to the ground
and<00:06:01.240> that<00:06:01.390> kind<00:06:01.600> of<00:06:01.690> defeats<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:02.470> whole

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
and that kind of defeats the whole

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.120 
and that kind of defeats the whole
purpose<00:06:03.280> basically<00:06:04.200> so<00:06:05.200> I<00:06:05.230> raised<00:06:05.560> both<00:06:05.860> sides

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
purpose basically so I raised both sides

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.290 
purpose basically so I raised both sides
as<00:06:07.090> much<00:06:07.420> as<00:06:07.570> I<00:06:07.690> could<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:08.490> then<00:06:09.490> it<00:06:10.060> actually

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
as much as I could and then it actually

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.490 
as much as I could and then it actually
worked<00:06:10.720> out<00:06:10.900> pretty<00:06:11.110> well<00:06:13.110> you<00:06:14.110> know<00:06:14.200> all<00:06:14.380> in

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
worked out pretty well you know all in

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.380 
worked out pretty well you know all in
all<00:06:14.620> this<00:06:14.800> I've<00:06:15.100> never<00:06:15.400> been<00:06:15.700> a<00:06:15.940> hammock

kit anything like that this is something
that's<00:06:34.780> really<00:06:35.170> easy<00:06:35.200> took<00:06:35.710> about<00:06:35.920> five

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
that's really easy took about five

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.800 
that's really easy took about five
minutes<00:06:36.580> and<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.300> first<00:06:37.510> time<00:06:37.660> I've<00:06:37.780> ever

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
it up so really easy wait a lot easier

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.380 
it up so really easy wait a lot easier
than<00:06:44.440> you<00:06:45.130> know<00:06:45.250> say<00:06:45.430> a<00:06:45.460> tent<00:06:45.850> or<00:06:46.060> something

like that this is only one person but in

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.330 
like that this is only one person but in
a<00:06:49.090> get<00:06:49.450> home<00:06:49.630> situation<00:06:50.350> bug<00:06:50.560> out<00:06:50.740> situation

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
a get home situation bug out situation

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.310 
a get home situation bug out situation
that<00:06:51.520> might<00:06:51.730> be<00:06:51.910> you<00:06:52.510> know<00:06:52.630> you<00:06:52.690> are<00:06:52.990> gonna<00:06:53.140> be

that might be you know you are gonna be
on<00:06:53.440> your<00:06:53.590> own<00:06:53.620> so<00:06:54.040> all<00:06:54.850> in<00:06:55.000> all<00:06:55.060> I<00:06:55.120> think<00:06:55.240> this

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480 
on your own so all in all I think this

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.390 
on your own so all in all I think this
is<00:06:55.660> pretty<00:06:55.840> cool<00:06:56.110> and<00:06:56.620> it<00:06:56.770> keeps<00:06:57.040> you<00:06:57.190> away

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
is pretty cool and it keeps you away

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.070 
is pretty cool and it keeps you away
from<00:06:57.610> the<00:06:57.760> bugs<00:06:57.970> with<00:06:58.240> the<00:06:58.360> mosquito<00:06:58.810> net<00:06:59.050> and

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
from the bugs with the mosquito net and

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.830 
from the bugs with the mosquito net and
off<00:06:59.380> the<00:06:59.620> ground<00:06:59.980> and<00:07:00.280> you<00:07:00.820> know<00:07:00.940> the<00:07:01.180> kids<00:07:01.630> the

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
off the ground and you know the kids the

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.020 
off the ground and you know the kids the
the<00:07:01.870> creepy<00:07:02.530> crawlies<00:07:02.980> away<00:07:03.250> from<00:07:03.490> you<00:07:03.640> but<00:07:03.820> I

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
the creepy crawlies away from you but I

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.470 
the creepy crawlies away from you but I
think<00:07:04.420> this<00:07:04.720> is<00:07:04.900> you<00:07:05.320> know<00:07:05.440> for<00:07:06.120> for<00:07:07.120> what<00:07:07.300> it

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:07.480 
think this is you know for for what it

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480 
think this is you know for for what it
is<00:07:07.510> I<00:07:07.690> think<00:07:08.080> this<00:07:08.200> is<00:07:08.350> pretty<00:07:08.590> cool<00:07:08.860> as<00:07:09.130> far<00:07:09.340> as
