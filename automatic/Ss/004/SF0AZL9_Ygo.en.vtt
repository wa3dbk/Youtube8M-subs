00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
space not only want the receptor that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.139 
space not only want the receptor that
looks<00:00:54.480> varying<00:00:54.930> size<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> actually<00:00:56.699> if

the community pretty much asked for a

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.070 
the community pretty much asked for a
flat<00:01:05.410> space<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.980> this<00:01:06.280> is<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.720> series<00:01:07.720> of<00:01:07.780> flat

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
flat space and this is a series of flat
