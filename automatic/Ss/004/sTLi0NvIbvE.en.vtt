prone to starting fights and that was

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.259

sails<00:03:30.780> okay<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.930> guess<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.349> directors<00:03:32.739> saying

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.129 
sails okay I guess the directors saying
their<00:03:33.459> sailors<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.359> that<00:03:34.540> has<00:03:34.810> something<00:03:34.989> to

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
their sailors so that has something to

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.800 
their sailors so that has something to
