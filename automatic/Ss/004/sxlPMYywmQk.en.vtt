give<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.420> more<00:02:08.630> room<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.930> flex<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.410> when

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
give you more room to flex and when

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
give you more room to flex and when
you're<00:02:10.340> sliding<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:11.330> kind<00:02:11.570> of<00:02:11.690> your<00:02:12.200> your

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
you're sliding it kind of your your

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.500 
you're sliding it kind of your your
weight<00:02:12.740> balances<00:02:13.250> out<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.550> Center<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.360> when

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
weight balances out of Center so when

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.750 
weight balances out of Center so when
you<00:02:14.570> slide<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.800> want<00:02:16.010> kind<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.370> stiff<00:02:16.610> board

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
you slide you want kind of stiff board

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.030 
you slide you want kind of stiff board
for<00:02:17.030> sliding<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.470> creates<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
for sliding and that that creates the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.710 
for sliding and that that creates the
feel<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.460> stiff<00:02:19.670> board<00:02:19.850> well<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.360> think<00:02:20.480> so

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
feel of a stiff board well so I think so

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.990 
feel of a stiff board well so I think so
it's<00:02:20.870> really<00:02:20.990> nice<00:02:21.170> um<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:22.430> has<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.580> mild

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
it's really nice um it has a mild

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.900 
it's really nice um it has a mild
concave<00:02:23.660> very<00:02:24.170> mild<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.550> feel<00:02:25.790> it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
concave very mild so you feel it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
concave very mild so you feel it
definitely<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.360> feel<00:02:26.510> really<00:02:26.720> comfortable

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
definitely you feel really comfortable

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.190 
definitely you feel really comfortable
nights<00:02:27.710> for<00:02:27.890> dancing<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.370> stuff<00:02:28.520> but<00:02:29.210> one

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
nights for dancing and stuff but one

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.050 
nights for dancing and stuff but one
thing<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.710> if<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.220> had<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> little<00:02:31.550> more<00:02:31.700> concave

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
thing I if it had a little more concave

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.870 
thing I if it had a little more concave
it'd<00:02:32.180> be<00:02:32.300> better<00:02:32.450> for<00:02:32.540> sliding<00:02:33.050> um<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.760> you

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
it'd be better for sliding um but you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.190 
it'd be better for sliding um but you
know<00:02:34.940> it's<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.420> still<00:02:35.660> nice<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.050> still

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
know it's it's still nice and it still

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.470 
know it's it's still nice and it still
works<00:02:36.350> for<00:02:36.500> stand<00:02:36.710> ups<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.450> layout<00:02:38.450> of

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
works for stand ups and layout of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.350 
works for stand ups and layout of
pendulums<00:02:38.990> whatever<00:02:39.290> you're<00:02:39.470> doing<00:02:40.360> let's

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
pendulums whatever you're doing let's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.440 
pendulums whatever you're doing let's
see<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.410> graphic<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.730> kind<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.180> nice

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
see and the graphic is kind of this nice

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.430 
see and the graphic is kind of this nice
like<00:02:45.640> motion<00:02:46.640> sort<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.540> feel<00:02:47.720> there<00:02:48.260> was<00:02:48.350> an

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
like motion sort of feel there was an

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.340 
like motion sort of feel there was an
old<00:02:48.560> graphic<00:02:48.950> this<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> new<00:02:49.490> one<00:02:49.640> about

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
old graphic this is the new one about

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.370 
old graphic this is the new one about
maybe<00:02:51.350> two<00:02:51.620> years<00:02:51.650> old<00:02:51.980> by<00:02:52.280> now<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.960> yeah<00:02:53.960> you

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
maybe two years old by now and yeah you

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.050 
maybe two years old by now and yeah you
can<00:02:54.410> see<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.740> I've<00:02:54.830> gone<00:02:54.980> through<00:02:55.460> a<00:02:55.970> few

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
can see that I've gone through a few

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.280 
can see that I've gone through a few
accidents<00:02:56.570> with<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> board<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.200> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
accidents with the board and the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.590 
accidents with the board and the
fiberglass<00:02:57.710> is<00:02:57.860> kind<00:02:58.070> of<00:02:58.160> held<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.400> up<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.730> so

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
fiberglass is kind of held it up and so

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.360 
fiberglass is kind of held it up and so
there's<00:02:59.780> no<00:02:59.870> impact<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.500> actual<00:03:00.770> bamboo

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
there's no impact on the actual bamboo

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.140 
there's no impact on the actual bamboo
itself<00:03:01.970> um<00:03:03.100> yes<00:03:04.100> this<00:03:04.370> deck<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.580> great<00:03:04.970> for

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
itself um yes this deck is great for

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.230 
itself um yes this deck is great for
dancing<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.720> think<00:03:06.350> just<00:03:07.190> because<00:03:07.790> there's<00:03:08.120> not

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
dancing I think just because there's not

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.840 
dancing I think just because there's not
too<00:03:08.480> much<00:03:08.630> concave<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:10.400> has<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.550> nice

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
too much concave and it has a nice

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.050 
too much concave and it has a nice
wheelbase<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.810> some<00:03:12.320> room<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.530> move<00:03:12.710> around

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
wheelbase and some room to move around

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.390 
wheelbase and some room to move around
alright<00:03:14.060> for<00:03:14.180> sliding<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.750> said<00:03:14.990> and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
alright for sliding like I said and

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.590 
alright for sliding like I said and
what's<00:03:16.400> nice<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:16.580> even<00:03:17.150> though<00:03:17.210> it's<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.360> drop

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
what's nice is even though it's a drop

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.240 
what's nice is even though it's a drop
through<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.930> still<00:03:18.170> has<00:03:18.320> some<00:03:18.440> nice<00:03:18.590> tails<00:03:18.950> and

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
through it still has some nice tails and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.620 
through it still has some nice tails and
some<00:03:19.970> knows<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.920> do<00:03:21.920> your<00:03:22.130> your<00:03:22.520> shove<00:03:23.150> its<00:03:23.330> and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
some knows to do your your shove its and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.810 
some knows to do your your shove its and
Tiger<00:03:24.470> claws<00:03:24.680> whatever<00:03:25.010> you're<00:03:25.130> doing<00:03:25.340> and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
Tiger claws whatever you're doing and

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.890 
Tiger claws whatever you're doing and
that's<00:03:25.940> also<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.480> deals<00:03:26.660> with<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
that's also that deals with the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.360 
that's also that deals with the
durability<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.530> board<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:27.980> durable<00:03:28.250> when

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
durability of the board is durable when

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.470 
durability of the board is durable when
I'm<00:03:28.460> never<00:03:28.640> really<00:03:28.730> scared<00:03:29.120> when<00:03:29.270> I'm<00:03:29.390> doing

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
I'm never really scared when I'm doing

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.390 
I'm never really scared when I'm doing
those<00:03:29.720> tricks<00:03:29.930> with<00:03:30.050> this<00:03:30.170> board<00:03:30.410> whereas<00:03:31.250> on

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
those tricks with this board whereas on

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.980 
those tricks with this board whereas on
other<00:03:31.550> boards<00:03:31.850> I'm<00:03:32.030> kind<00:03:32.240> of<00:03:32.330> nervous<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.960> how

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
other boards I'm kind of nervous of how

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.020 
other boards I'm kind of nervous of how
I<00:03:33.110> land<00:03:33.410> on<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:33.890> everything<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.880> can

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
I land on it and everything this you can

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.250 
I land on it and everything this you can
just<00:03:35.420> go<00:03:35.570> for<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.070> have<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.340> set<00:03:37.550> up<00:03:37.640> with

just go for it so I have to set up with

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.370 
just go for it so I have to set up with

a nice little paint and I mean looks

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.570 
a nice little paint and I mean looks
better<00:03:49.940> than<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.180> was<00:03:50.270> before<00:03:50.390> but<00:03:51.320> I<00:03:51.590> was<00:03:52.400> nice
