00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800 
thing the only thing going to lose is a
spark<00:01:59.100> plug<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.549> barrel<00:01:59.820> swell<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.540> there's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
spark plug in a barrel swell so there's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.959 
spark plug in a barrel swell so there's
nothing<00:02:01.110> attached<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.399> uses<00:02:02.790> its

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
nothing attached to it it just uses its

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.260 
nothing attached to it it just uses its
weight<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.530> make<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.280> three<00:02:05.670> or<00:02:05.729> four<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.060> them

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
weight so make it three or four of them

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.270 
weight so make it three or four of them
Karam<00:02:06.630> carry<00:02:06.990> them<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> then<00:02:08.129> you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
Karam carry them with you and then you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
swill with a snap on it and a spark plug

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.910 
swill with a snap on it and a spark plug
hope<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.360> helps<00:02:19.690> somebody<00:02:20.020> maybe<00:02:20.680> it'll
