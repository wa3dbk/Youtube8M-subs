smoothly

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.800 
smoothly
I<00:01:50.310> mean<00:01:51.310> sides<00:01:51.580> just<00:01:51.790> three<00:01:52.000> bit<00:01:52.180> dirtier<00:01:52.570> than

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
I mean sides just three bit dirtier than

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:06.270 
I mean sides just three bit dirtier than
the<00:01:52.870> others<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:59.020> lift<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.320> up<00:02:04.920> I'll<00:02:05.920> show

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
the others so just lift it up I'll show

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.070 
the others so just lift it up I'll show
you<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.580> alignment<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.270> second<00:02:07.869> valve

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.920 

so<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:21.879> hardly<00:02:22.879> impressive<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:25.340> fact<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.970> good

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
so it's hardly impressive in fact a good

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.990 
so it's hardly impressive in fact a good
day<00:02:27.080> better<00:02:27.319> than<00:02:27.709> my<00:02:28.129> Sandler<00:02:30.760> which<00:02:31.760> is

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.720 

let's<00:02:42.190> get<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.520> into<00:02:42.820> words

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.759

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
on this blessing nothing

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.570
