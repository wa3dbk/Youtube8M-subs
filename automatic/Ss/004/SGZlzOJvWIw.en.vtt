00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I'll do talk about two-hand gate turning

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
I'll do talk about two-hand gate turning
quickly<00:00:58.500> okay

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
quickly okay

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
we don't have enough turning speed as

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.410 
we don't have enough turning speed as
you<00:02:04.229> turn<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> ski<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.490> before<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.090> fully

you turn this ski in before we get fully

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.960 
you turn this ski in before we get fully
turned<00:02:06.810> you'll<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:07.740> stuck<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> call

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
turned you'll get stuck what I call

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.160 
turned you'll get stuck what I call
no-man's<00:02:09.539> land

straight<00:05:29.330> our<00:05:29.539> left<00:05:30.530> foot<00:05:30.650> I'll<00:05:30.860> do<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.010> left

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
straight our left foot I'll do a left

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.510 
straight our left foot I'll do a left
foot<00:05:31.370> for<00:05:31.580> skier<00:05:32.620> here<00:05:34.120> they<00:05:35.120> come<00:05:35.330> up

they come up and then across fall with
fairly<00:05:42.250> straight<00:05:42.490> arms<00:05:42.849> so<00:05:43.330> it's<00:05:43.449> more<00:05:43.539> of<00:05:43.660> a

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
fairly straight arms so it's more of a

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.129 
fairly straight arms so it's more of a
sweeping<00:05:44.319> move<00:05:44.590> across<00:05:45.400> and<00:05:45.970> as<00:05:46.360> as<00:05:46.599> handles

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
sweeping move across and as as handles

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.320 
sweeping move across and as as handles
being<00:05:47.319> swept<00:05:47.620> across<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.979> skier<00:05:48.819> is<00:05:48.879> flowing

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
being swept across the skier is flowing

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.770 
being swept across the skier is flowing
away<00:05:49.479> and<00:05:50.080> toward<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.740> wig<00:05:51.419> grasping<00:05:52.419> it<00:05:52.509> over

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
away and toward the wig grasping it over

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.980 
away and toward the wig grasping it over
the<00:05:52.870> power<00:05:53.080> triangle<00:05:53.470> and<00:05:54.310> locking<00:05:54.789> in<00:05:55.030> okay

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
the power triangle and locking in okay

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.050 
the power triangle and locking in okay
so<00:05:56.650> those<00:05:57.310> are<00:05:57.460> two<00:05:57.729> really<00:05:58.139> big<00:05:59.139> points

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
so those are two really big points

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.059 
so those are two really big points
whether<00:06:01.060> you're<00:06:01.300> two-hand<00:06:01.690> gate<00:06:01.930> or<00:06:02.349> one-hand
