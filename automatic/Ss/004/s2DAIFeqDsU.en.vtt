with this leather circle thingy here

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.360 
with this leather circle thingy here
if<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.069> take<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.360> fold<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.370> this

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
if you take this and you fold it this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.160 
if you take this and you fold it this
way<00:02:15.609> and<00:02:15.909> you<00:02:16.209> take<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.569> leather<00:02:16.810> cord

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
way and you take this leather cord

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.110 
way and you take this leather cord
that's<00:02:17.319> attached<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.519> actually<00:02:18.670> wrap

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
that's attached you can actually wrap

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.360 
that's attached you can actually wrap
the<00:02:19.390> leather<00:02:19.569> cord<00:02:19.900> around<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.980> leather

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the leather cord around the leather

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.190 
the leather cord around the leather
circle<00:02:21.879> thingy<00:02:22.150> that's<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.750> technical<00:02:23.049> term

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
circle thingy that's the technical term

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.339 
circle thingy that's the technical term
and<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:24.400> creates<00:02:24.700> an<00:02:24.849> angle<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:25.989> use<00:02:26.170> it

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
and it creates an angle you can use it

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.300 
and it creates an angle you can use it
for<00:02:26.500> viewing<00:02:27.480> content<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.599> your<00:02:28.689> iPad<00:02:29.019> so<00:02:29.920> it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
for viewing content on your iPad so it

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.460 
for viewing content on your iPad so it
doesn't<00:02:30.730> have<00:02:30.909> a<00:02:30.939> stand<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:31.989> does<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.439> a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
doesn't have a stand but it does have a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.220 
doesn't have a stand but it does have a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
spin function built into it but that's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.809 
spin function built into it but that's
about<00:02:35.500> all<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.769> this<00:02:35.859> case<00:02:36.099> does<00:02:36.310> it

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
about all that this case does it

I've<00:02:46.269> never<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:48.430> used<00:02:48.459> this<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:48.939> lot<00:02:49.359> just

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
I've never really used this a lot just

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.000 
I've never really used this a lot just
because<00:02:50.169> it<00:02:50.290> didn't<00:02:50.560> handle<00:02:50.829> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
because it didn't handle the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.740 
because it didn't handle the
functionality<00:02:51.609> that<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.909> know<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.359> I<00:02:52.540> need

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
functionality that I know that I need

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.839 
functionality that I know that I need
but<00:02:53.349> my<00:02:53.500> father-in-law<00:02:53.980> swears<00:02:54.370> by<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.609> he

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
but my father-in-law swears by it he

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.909 
but my father-in-law swears by it he
loves<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.239> also<00:02:55.959> worth<00:02:56.290> noting<00:02:56.470> they<00:02:56.769> have

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
loves it also worth noting they have

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.640 
loves it also worth noting they have
this<00:02:57.099> for<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.549> MacBook<00:02:57.970> Air<00:02:58.000> 11<00:02:58.599> and<00:02:58.930> 13<00:02:59.379> and

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
this for the MacBook Air 11 and 13 and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.800 
this for the MacBook Air 11 and 13 and
for<00:02:59.919> the<00:02:59.980> MacBook<00:03:00.159> Pro<00:03:00.579> so<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.329> is<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.510> whole

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
for the MacBook Pro so this is a whole

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.270 
for the MacBook Pro so this is a whole
line<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.079> products<00:03:02.530> there's<00:03:02.739> also<00:03:02.859> one<00:03:03.129> for

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
book book from 12 cell so is this but

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.929 
book book from 12 cell so is this but
this<00:03:11.079> is<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.950> new<00:03:12.069> version<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.579> book<00:03:12.730> book

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
and it's a whole different world first

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.979 
and it's a whole different world first
difference<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:18.040> about<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.280> third<00:03:18.609> thinner<00:03:18.989> if

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
difference it's about a third thinner if

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.770 
difference it's about a third thinner if
not<00:03:20.349> more<00:03:20.650> it's<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.430> lot<00:03:21.729> thinner<00:03:22.180> than<00:03:22.599> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
not more it's a lot thinner than the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.869 
not more it's a lot thinner than the
original<00:03:22.989> book<00:03:23.590> book<00:03:23.799> for<00:03:23.949> the<00:03:24.040> iPad<00:03:24.340> in

original book book for the iPad in
addition<00:03:25.419> I'm<00:03:25.989> putting<00:03:26.260> my<00:03:26.349> fingers<00:03:26.680> here<00:03:26.919> and

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
addition I'm putting my fingers here and

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.699 
addition I'm putting my fingers here and
there's<00:03:27.370> actually<00:03:27.819> room<00:03:28.120> all<00:03:28.540> around<00:03:28.930> for<00:03:29.590> my

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
there's actually room all around for my

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.789 
there's actually room all around for my
fingers<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.310> go<00:03:30.449> it's<00:03:31.449> smaller<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.260> proportion

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
fingers to go it's smaller in proportion

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.740 
fingers to go it's smaller in proportion
now<00:03:32.979> it<00:03:33.280> may<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:33.609> be<00:03:33.699> my<00:03:33.909> finger<00:03:34.389> depth

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
now it may just be my finger depth

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.170 
now it may just be my finger depth
that's<00:03:35.079> smaller<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:36.099> that<00:03:36.280> makes<00:03:36.639> a<00:03:36.790> huge

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
that's smaller but that makes a huge

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.610 
that's smaller but that makes a huge
difference<00:03:37.239> when<00:03:37.900> you're<00:03:38.139> actually<00:03:38.290> holding

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
difference when you're actually holding

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.619 
difference when you're actually holding
it<00:03:38.889> it<00:03:39.010> just<00:03:39.159> feels<00:03:39.459> more<00:03:39.669> compact<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.359> feels

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
it it just feels more compact it feels

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.050 
it it just feels more compact it feels
tighter<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.709> feels<00:03:42.040> even<00:03:42.280> better<00:03:42.669> in<00:03:43.030> your

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
tighter it feels even better in your

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.259 
tighter it feels even better in your
hand<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:44.500> thinner<00:03:44.829> as<00:03:45.069> we<00:03:45.220> said<00:03:45.489> it's

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
hand it's thinner as we said it's

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.719 
hand it's thinner as we said it's
smaller<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:47.769> substantially<00:03:48.489> lighter

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:48.729 
smaller and it's substantially lighter

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.550 
smaller and it's substantially lighter
makes<00:03:49.629> a<00:03:49.780> big<00:03:49.989> difference<00:03:50.349> if<00:03:50.470> you're

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
makes a big difference if you're

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.800 
makes a big difference if you're
carrying<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:50.949> around<00:03:51.010> but<00:03:51.909> that's<00:03:52.150> only<00:03:52.479> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
carrying this around but that's only the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.080 
carrying this around but that's only the
beginning<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.409> the<00:03:53.620> changes<00:03:54.069> whereas<00:03:54.909> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
beginning of the changes whereas the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.939 
beginning of the changes whereas the
original<00:03:55.180> book<00:03:55.689> book<00:03:55.900> simply<00:03:56.109> held<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.620> iPad

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
held this way but here's a trick let me

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.840 
held this way but here's a trick let me
be<00:04:47.840> quiet<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.320> hopefully<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:48.860> can<00:04:48.950> hear<00:04:49.100> this

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.390 

there<00:04:52.850> are<00:04:52.970> snaps<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.230> backside<00:04:54.680> so<00:04:54.980> it

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
there are snaps on the backside so it

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.400 
there are snaps on the backside so it
actually<00:04:55.580> folds<00:04:55.940> out<00:04:56.150> this<00:04:56.330> entire<00:04:56.480> way<00:04:56.870> now

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
actually folds out this entire way now

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.750 
actually folds out this entire way now
why<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.710> that<00:04:57.860> important<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.460> couple<00:04:58.700> of

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
why is that important a couple of

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.970 
why is that important a couple of
reasons<00:04:58.880> number<00:04:59.180> one<00:04:59.380> the<00:05:00.380> camera<00:05:00.770> on<00:05:00.890> the

iPad 2 and the new iPad is usable it's

iPad 2 and the new iPad is usable it's
not<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:04.970> most<00:05:05.120> convenient<00:05:05.570> thing<00:05:05.900> in<00:05:05.990> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
not the most convenient thing in the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.380 
not the most convenient thing in the
world<00:05:06.200> I<00:05:06.350> guess<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.650> could<00:05:06.800> zip<00:05:07.250> this<00:05:07.730> up<00:05:07.940> and

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
world I guess you could zip this up and

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.020 
world I guess you could zip this up and
have<00:05:08.540> just<00:05:08.750> two<00:05:09.080> pieces<00:05:09.370> it's<00:05:10.370> not<00:05:10.580> convenient

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
have just two pieces it's not convenient

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.150 
have just two pieces it's not convenient
but<00:05:11.450> it<00:05:11.570> does<00:05:11.750> work<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.320> that's<00:05:12.740> important

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
but it does work and that's important

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.370 
but it does work and that's important
enough<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.430> take<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.850> iPad<00:05:14.180> out<00:05:14.480> to<00:05:14.990> use<00:05:15.200> the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
enough to take the iPad out to use the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.370 
enough to take the iPad out to use the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
there's a piece of leather if you take

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.760 
there's a piece of leather if you take
it<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:22.220> you<00:05:22.340> extend<00:05:22.700> it<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:23.360> lock<00:05:24.350> it<00:05:24.560> in

right behind the snaps it actually makes

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.120 
right behind the snaps it actually makes

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
a really nice typing platform and you

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.800 
a really nice typing platform and you
can<00:05:31.280> leave<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:31.550> like<00:05:31.700> this<00:05:31.729> or<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.270> can<00:05:32.540> fold

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
can leave it like this or you can fold

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.290 
can leave it like this or you can fold
this<00:05:32.990> underneath<00:05:33.410> it<00:05:33.770> holds<00:05:34.640> really<00:05:35.150> well

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
this underneath it holds really well

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.510 
this underneath it holds really well
I've<00:05:35.960> tried<00:05:36.260> it<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:36.560> did<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.770> lot<00:05:36.979> of<00:05:37.010> typing<00:05:37.430> over

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
I've tried it I did a lot of typing over

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.710 
I've tried it I did a lot of typing over
the<00:05:37.610> last<00:05:37.700> couple<00:05:37.970> of<00:05:38.000> days<00:05:38.150> on<00:05:38.360> it<00:05:38.450> and<00:05:38.600> it

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
the last couple of days on it and it

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.290 
the last couple of days on it and it
does<00:05:38.900> not<00:05:38.930> slip<00:05:39.919> out<00:05:40.160> it<00:05:40.370> holds<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:40.880> angle

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
does not slip out it holds the angle

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.120 
does not slip out it holds the angle
even<00:05:41.780> without<00:05:42.169> it<00:05:42.229> being<00:05:42.440> physically

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
connected in that way it's just meaning

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.330
