00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
sim card and as you can see on the box

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.299 
sim card and as you can see on the box
it<00:00:37.559> has<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.800> free<00:00:38.280> internet<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.360> year<00:00:40.309> it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
battery of the my phone reactant is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.199 
battery of the my phone reactant is
actually<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> built-in<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> device<00:02:07.710> itself

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
actually a built-in on the device itself

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
actually a built-in on the device itself
as<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> portion<00:02:10.560> where

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the battery is and there is nothing we

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.160 
the battery is and there is nothing we
can<00:02:15.270> do<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.989> actually<00:02:16.760> remove<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:21.170> also

can do to actually remove it I also
prepared<00:02:22.650> here<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> two<00:02:23.700> SIM<00:02:24.030> card<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:26.780> let's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
prepared here a two SIM card so let's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.809 
prepared here a two SIM card so let's
insert<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.380> up<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.100> from<00:02:32.100> force<00:02:32.610> in

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
insert it up so this is from force in

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.430 
insert it up so this is from force in
one<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.950> one<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:36.060> seeming<00:02:36.510> true<00:02:36.750> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
one and this one is for seeming true and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.390 
one and this one is for seeming true and
also<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.340> here<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.319> velocity<00:02:40.319> slap<00:02:40.920> any

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
also we have here the velocity slap any

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400 
also we have here the velocity slap any
