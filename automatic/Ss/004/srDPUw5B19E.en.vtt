00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.540
 new youtube love knife front here 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.670
 again a little update to my 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.230
 finished nominal garden fair project i 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.680
 have the knife so very short 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.500
 presented in the original condition as is 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 has come 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.250
 I got it a bit yesterday 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 unfortunately screwed it is not quite 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.590
 become as I imagined 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.920
 have 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.009
 That's because of the many tools 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 I've upgraded a bit 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.960
 In front of a hardware store , that has one or two 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.840
 brought others and I thought that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.070
 I can thus achieve the result 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.340
 that I imagined 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.920
 unfortunately, that's what she put into practice 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.370
 so it has to be wrong yesterday 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.960
 improvise a bit in the afternoon 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.960
 and that is the result 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.940
 I do not say nice but rarely 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.030
 Coloring again typical of the others 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.850
 Originally made myself again 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:22.950
 with a slight walnut charm and 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:28.590
 some of the 250 degrees in this case and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:32.400
 rapeseed oil which I actually intended 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.420
 had was this I wanted here in 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.540
 course of the knife so from this 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.110
 slightly thicker belly I say now times 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:48.229
 until the back there is a line after 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.229
 pull with very small building gate 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:57.630
 I actually wanted that over one 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.579
 dremel make the hit in the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.050
 Baumarkt my choice is not in the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.970
 I like to rest 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.960
 That's why I had myself for 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.970
 a engraving turning world decided 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.490
 thought he was just the top with the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.340
 you would have so small recesses 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.160
 can do 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.910
 I also had the soldering iron in front of me 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:24.240
 then this well to hurt so 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.610
 I then just here so why on the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.300
 golf because I would have thought no 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.320
 Structure is yes in practice 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:40.800
 showed that such a knife handle 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.900
 beech is definitely harder than that so the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.630
 company triumph considers it possible 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.290
 I was impossible with this engraving 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.240
 drive here a reasonable structure 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.720
 so it was only light 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.900
 scratch and even at the highest level 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.770
 I did not get any further 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.080
 I then in despair 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.530
 back to my drill 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.900
 used and just with the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.050
 smallest available drill 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:16.050
 job that was 4 mm I just have 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:18.450
 small holes drilled in the handle if 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:25.020
 If somebody wants to imitate it fits 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.220
 because here goes the speech in 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.800
 the blade disappears and 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.720
 relatively deep when you are on the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.340
 opposite side begins holes 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.600
 Drilling can quickly lead to that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.640
 that you pierce this once 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.740
 I happen then I have one 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.350
 bit of wood fit mended again 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.450
 yes and I do not have these holes 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.270
 still with and with him 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.350
 a little bit reworked soldering iron 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.980
 therefore, whether the darkness here in the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.650
 to recognize holes very well 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.090
 and I still have the garden knife 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.090
 given a little face 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:24.550
 Skull- like expression was called 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.490
 grinning masks that should be that 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.870
 should the knife a bit 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.140
 individualize but even more exists 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.030
 have done the deletion 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.740
 that's actually the best i think 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:42.840
 better at this now all this brings 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.840
 his little head here 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:52.379
 quite astonishing is the oven leads 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:54.719
 to that the knife is very easy money 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:57.869
 I have already been at the 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.029
 Other routiniers I found 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:03.719
 So easy baked have that sound 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.119
 can now open well with too 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.769
 one hand 

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:10.619
 if you want you can even enter them 

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:13.499
 a bit on fling I still have that 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:23.929
 filmed separately and play the same 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:26.729
 with what I have done 

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:28.289
 now i made sure that the 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.319
 now sound my ring game has 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.239
 as I here above the inner ring a 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:37.249
 a little bit sophisticated 

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:39.989
 because at the original knife came the 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:43.519
 sound root on the rings 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:50.009
 the son a fraction of a millimeter 

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:53.179
 survived and that led to me 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:56.179
 even with closed blog here 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:06:00.569
 click game was like here now 

00:05:56.179 --> 00:06:03.239
 I'm not completely closed now 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:08.819
 this saving now leads to that 

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:10.259
 the blade just sits just fine if 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.309
 they go down so easily 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.739
 was bent 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:20.819
 if I now the wind properly fixed 

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:22.319
 target firmly I do not have any 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.719
 sound more game the blade stands 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:30.449
 now really bombproof and leaves 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:34.109
 to work well with it, so that's how 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.469
 said that not quite so successful 

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:38.249
 result as it really liked 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:42.379
 would have 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:44.879
 but as I said not nice but rare 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:47.699
 and it's a very nice one again 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:52.379
 been customized okay what is 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.549
 now in my collection I have 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.469
 I would be glad if you too 

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:57.929
 be back next video if it is 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:07:00.299
 is called new youtube love knife 

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:03.139
 girlfriend with until then I wish you 

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:03.139
 Have a nice time
