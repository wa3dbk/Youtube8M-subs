to<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.760> on<00:00:14.850> the<00:00:14.970> inside<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.690> pot<00:00:15.930> holder

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
to be on the inside of our pot holder

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560 
to be on the inside of our pot holder
and<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.400> use<00:00:17.640> something<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.300> don't

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and you can use something that you don't

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.230 
and you can use something that you don't
like<00:00:18.869> or<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.200> can<00:00:19.350> use<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.950> matching<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.850> we

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
like or you can use a matching and we

like or you can use a matching and we
place<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.540> facedown<00:00:22.050> an<00:00:22.500> easy<00:00:22.920> way<00:00:23.130> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
place that facedown an easy way to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.670 
place that facedown an easy way to
remember<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.869> place<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.500> facedown

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
remember that is you place it facedown

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.620 
remember that is you place it facedown
because<00:00:26.220> you're<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.520> going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.360> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
because you're not going to see this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.390 
because you're not going to see this
when<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.020> pot<00:00:28.230> holder<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.680> done<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
when the pot holder is done it is in the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.300 
when the pot holder is done it is in the
inside<00:00:29.790> then<00:00:30.329> you<00:00:30.480> place<00:00:30.720> your

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
inside then you place your

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.030 
inside then you place your
heat-resistant<00:00:32.329> square<00:00:33.329> material<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.440> top<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
heat-resistant square material on top of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.630 
heat-resistant square material on top of
that<00:00:35.310> and<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.810> you<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:37.560> the<00:00:37.739> 10<00:00:38.160> inch<00:00:38.340> square

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that and then you put the 10 inch square

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
that and then you put the 10 inch square
of<00:00:38.670> fabric<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.570> want<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

back of your pot holder that everyone

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.340 
back of your pot holder that everyone
will<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:43.109> when<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.649> turn<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> over<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:45.350> then

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
will see when they turn it over and then

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.160 
will see when they turn it over and then
you<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.920> 4<00:00:47.370> remaining<00:00:47.789> 10<00:00:48.449> inch<00:00:48.629> squares<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
you have 4 remaining 10 inch squares of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.130 
you have 4 remaining 10 inch squares of
fabric<00:00:49.379> which<00:00:49.859> you<00:00:50.070> fold<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.120> half<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.809> iron

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
fabric which you fold in half and iron

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.630 
fabric which you fold in half and iron
and<00:00:53.480> you<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.929> to<00:00:55.079> layer<00:00:55.350> them<00:00:55.710> raw

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and you are going to layer them raw

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.630 
and you are going to layer them raw
edges<00:00:57.000> together<00:00:57.750> always<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.920> finished<00:00:59.339> edge

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.610 
is always to the center of the pot
holder<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.960> just<00:01:03.960> layer<00:01:04.379> them<00:01:04.410> like<00:01:05.400> that

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
holder and just layer them like that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.540 
holder and just layer them like that
making<00:01:07.620> sure<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.400> finished<00:01:08.820> edges<00:01:09.150> are<00:01:10.550> to

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
making sure the finished edges are to

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.060 
making sure the finished edges are to
the<00:01:11.700> inside<00:01:12.120> now<00:01:12.659> our<00:01:12.810> last<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.500> we're<00:01:13.830> going

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the inside now our last one we're going

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.060 
the inside now our last one we're going
to<00:01:14.250> lay<00:01:14.490> where<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.630> goes<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.590> we're<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:17.010> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to lay where it goes and we're going to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.480 
to lay where it goes and we're going to
pick<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.730> one<00:01:18.030> under<00:01:18.770> pick<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.220> put

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
pick this one under pick it up and put

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
pick this one under pick it up and put
him<00:01:20.880> under<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:24.150> guy<00:01:24.540> here

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440 

and<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.950> our<00:01:29.130> pad<00:01:29.400> holder<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.910> ready<00:01:30.120> to<00:01:30.330> be

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and then our pad holder is ready to be

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.410 
and then our pad holder is ready to be
here<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.320> put<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.580> pins<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.060> because

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
here I put a lot of pins in because

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
here I put a lot of pins in because
you're<00:01:33.600> working<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.170> seven<00:01:34.650> layers<00:01:35.150> of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you're working with seven layers of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.670 
you're working with seven layers of
fabric<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:38.100> does<00:01:38.370> tend<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> shift<00:01:39.650> under<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
fabric and it does tend to shift under a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.170 
fabric and it does tend to shift under a
sewing<00:01:40.980> machine<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.640> pin<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.850> corners

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
sewing machine so I pin the corners

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.620 
sewing machine so I pin the corners
first<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.470> pin<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.970> places

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
first and then I pin all the places

00:01:48.630 --> 00:02:05.350 
first and then I pin all the places
where<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.830> fabric<00:01:50.270> intersects<00:01:52.280> like<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.760> I

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.389 

check<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> back<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.040> what<00:02:08.190> are<00:02:08.310> you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
check the back to the what are you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.100 
check the back to the what are you
looking<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:08.910> well<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.479> sure<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.959> it's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
looking for well to be sure that it's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.780 
looking for well to be sure that it's
all<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.380> way<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.740> edges<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.520> see

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
all the way to the edges as you can see

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
all the way to the edges as you can see
you<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.540> said<00:02:12.810> you've<00:02:12.990> got<00:02:13.020> seven

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you know like I said you've got seven

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.460 
you know like I said you've got seven
layers<00:02:13.800> there<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:15.270> might<00:02:15.840> want<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.110> smooth

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
layers there you might want to smooth

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:44.140 
layers there you might want to smooth
things<00:02:16.800> out<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.580> tad

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
not like an exact science well that's

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.340

I<00:02:57.620> always<00:02:58.160> check<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.850> other<00:02:58.970> side<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.570> make

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
I always check on the other side to make

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.930 
I always check on the other side to make
sure<00:03:00.020> because<00:03:00.230> occasionally<00:03:00.740> like<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.760> can

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
sure because occasionally like you can

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.170 
sure because occasionally like you can
see<00:03:02.240> here<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.810> came<00:03:03.140> very<00:03:03.709> very<00:03:04.070> very<00:03:04.250> close<00:03:04.760> in

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
see here I came very very very close in

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.020 
see here I came very very very close in
fact<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.540> think<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.930> might<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.320> quickly<00:03:07.190> since

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
fact I think I might just quickly since

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.970 
fact I think I might just quickly since
I<00:03:08.239> was<00:03:08.390> going<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.630> sleep<00:03:08.930> anyway<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.530> might<00:03:09.709> just

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
I was going to sleep anyway I might just

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.840 
I was going to sleep anyway I might just
go<00:03:10.160> over<00:03:10.280> there<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:10.880> mean<00:03:11.870> her<00:03:12.640> right<00:03:13.640> because<00:03:13.790> I

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
go over there I mean her right because I

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.440 
go over there I mean her right because I
don't<00:03:13.880> want<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.150> coming<00:03:14.330> apart<00:03:15.040> now<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.360> I

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
don't want it coming apart now and so I

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.370 
don't want it coming apart now and so I
clip<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.900> corners<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.709> then<00:03:19.520> if<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.790> see<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.540> lot

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
clip the corners and then if I see a lot

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.070 
clip the corners and then if I see a lot
of<00:03:21.530> bulk<00:03:21.800> somewhere<00:03:22.340> else<00:03:22.580> which<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.300> it's<00:03:23.870> not

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
of bulk somewhere else which I it's not

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:36.010 
of bulk somewhere else which I it's not
too<00:03:24.350> bad

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.330 

okay<00:03:37.020> so<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.319> think<00:03:37.470> that's<00:03:37.890> pretty<00:03:38.190> good

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
okay so I think that's pretty good

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.130 
okay so I think that's pretty good
although<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.790> looks<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.090> little<00:03:39.209> bulkier<00:03:39.780> here

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
although it looks a little bulkier here

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:49.730 
although it looks a little bulkier here
