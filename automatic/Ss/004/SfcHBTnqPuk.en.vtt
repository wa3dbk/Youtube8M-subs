last<00:00:50.370> week<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.579> did<00:00:50.879> breakdown<00:00:51.239> range<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> we

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
last week we did breakdown range and we

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.090 
last week we did breakdown range and we
did<00:00:51.960> find<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> increases<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
did find out that it increases the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
did find out that it increases the
effectiveness<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.390> selected<00:00:54.809> players

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
effectiveness of the selected players

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
effectiveness of the selected players
weapon<00:00:55.379> now<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.100> 100%<00:00:56.460> sure<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.969> their

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
weapon now we are not 100% sure on their

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.670 
weapon now we are not 100% sure on their
percentage<00:00:57.510> about<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.469> know

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
percentage about this but we do know

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
percentage about this but we do know
that<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.280> does<00:00:59.550> increase<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> effectiveness

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
that it does increase the effectiveness

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.810 
that it does increase the effectiveness
at<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:00.899> medium<00:01:01.109> range<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.280> damage<00:01:02.640> we

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
at about medium range now for damage we

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.460 
at about medium range now for damage we
just<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.180> also<00:01:03.329> found<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.049> increases

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
just we also found out that it increases

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.590 
just we also found out that it increases
the<00:01:04.619> damage<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> shotgun<00:01:05.460> by<00:01:06.030> about<00:01:06.270> 40

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the damage of the shotgun by about 40

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.539 
the damage of the shotgun by about 40
percent<00:01:06.750> which<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.229> definitely<00:01:07.619> definitely

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
percent which is definitely definitely

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.789 
percent which is definitely definitely
good<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> also<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.530> clear

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
good but what I also want to do is clear

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.800 
good but what I also want to do is clear
the<00:01:10.950> speculation<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> air<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.540> what

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the speculation in the air about what

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
the speculation in the air about what
one<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.439> better<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.130> there's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
one is actually better because there's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
one is actually better because there's
actually<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:15.030> clear<00:01:15.299> winner<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.960> what

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
actually not one clear winner now what

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.630 
actually not one clear winner now what
I'll<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.290> doing<00:01:16.500> right<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.130> showing<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
I'll be doing right now is showing you a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
I'll be doing right now is showing you a
two<00:01:17.970> different<00:01:18.150> tests<00:01:18.630> from<00:01:18.990> two<00:01:19.290> different

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
two different tests from two different

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
two different tests from two different
distances<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.369> both<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> attachments

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
distances with both of the attachments

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.140 
distances with both of the attachments
or<00:01:21.689> proficiencies<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> first<00:01:23.820> test<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
or proficiencies so the first test that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
or proficiencies so the first test that
they<00:01:24.240> decided<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> put<00:01:24.869> together<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.320> he

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
they decided to put together was he

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.890 
they decided to put together was he
spas-12<00:01:25.740> from<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.520> medium<00:01:26.939> range<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.689> what

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
spas-12 from about medium range now what

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.030 
spas-12 from about medium range now what
I<00:01:27.930> did<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:28.710> off

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
I did was first off

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.429 
I did was first off
tested<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.670> no<00:01:29.820> attachments<00:01:30.450> range<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
tested it with no attachments range and

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
tested it with no attachments range and
then<00:01:31.590> damage<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:32.820> was<00:01:32.939> better

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
then damage and see which one was better

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.120 
then damage and see which one was better
from<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:33.570> different<00:01:33.900> distances<00:01:34.170> now<00:01:34.890> first

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
from two different distances now first

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
from two different distances now first
off<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.490> did<00:01:35.670> no<00:01:35.759> attachments<00:01:36.360> which<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.659> two

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
off we did no attachments which was two

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749 
off we did no attachments which was two
shots<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.770> shit<00:01:37.920> once<00:01:38.189> again<00:01:38.400> look<00:01:38.579> it's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
shots and what shit once again look it's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.640 
shots and what shit once again look it's
reasonable<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.689> too<00:01:39.900> bad<00:01:40.110> but

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
reasonable you know it's not too bad but

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.840 
reasonable you know it's not too bad but
once<00:01:40.829> again<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.130> seem<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> lot<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> hit

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
once again you seem to get a lot of hit

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.639 
once again you seem to get a lot of hit
markers<00:01:42.210> now<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> second<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.470> had

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
markers now the second one that we had

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
markers now the second one that we had
was<00:01:43.829> range<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.369> also<00:01:44.610> took<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.119> shots<00:01:45.390> which

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
was range that also took two shots which

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.270 
was range that also took two shots which
was<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> exact<00:01:46.229> same<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.500> having<00:01:46.770> nothing<00:01:47.009> on

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
was the exact same as having nothing on

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.429 
was the exact same as having nothing on
there<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.210> when<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.390> slapped<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.960> damage

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
there but then when we slapped on damage

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.310 
there but then when we slapped on damage
it<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.680> very<00:01:49.860> consistent<00:01:50.280> one<00:01:50.759> shot<00:01:51.000> kills<00:01:51.320> so

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
it was very consistent one shot kills so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.810 
it was very consistent one shot kills so
the<00:01:52.439> next<00:01:52.649> testing<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.189> kind<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.520> did<00:01:53.640> was

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the next testing that we kind of did was

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.550 
the next testing that we kind of did was
from<00:01:53.970> long<00:01:54.240> range<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> exact<00:01:55.350> same

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
from long range with the exact same

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.020 
from long range with the exact same
class<00:01:55.829> setup<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.909> actually

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
class setup and I really actually

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.340 
class setup and I really actually
enjoyed<00:01:57.360> seeing<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> data<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.200> one

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
enjoyed seeing the data on this one

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.149 
enjoyed seeing the data on this one
because<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:58.619> kind<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.860> proved<00:01:59.009> my<00:01:59.100> point

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
because they kind of proved my point

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
because they kind of proved my point
right<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.729> which<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.079> better<00:02:01.259> than

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
right as which not one is better than

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.990 
right as which not one is better than
the<00:02:01.649> other<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.579> off<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.880> no

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the other so first off with no

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.789 
the other so first off with no
attachments<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.869> took<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.229> four<00:02:04.560> shots

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
attachments it took about four shots

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.350 
attachments it took about four shots
from<00:02:04.920> long<00:02:05.130> range<00:02:05.159> which<00:02:05.610> once<00:02:05.820> again<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
from long range which once again for a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.449 
from long range which once again for a
shotgun<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.899> reasonable<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.250> threw

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
shotgun is reasonable but then we threw

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.460 
shotgun is reasonable but then we threw
on<00:02:08.640> damage<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> took<00:02:09.869> three<00:02:10.080> shots<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
on damage and that took three shots so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.080 
on damage and that took three shots so
once<00:02:10.649> again<00:02:10.860> there's<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.700> difference

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
once again there's actually a difference

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.490 
once again there's actually a difference
with<00:02:12.209> damage<00:02:12.569> from<00:02:12.750> long<00:02:12.959> range

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
with damage from long range

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
with damage from long range
but<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:13.980> when<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.130> went<00:02:14.430> over<00:02:14.550> into<00:02:14.880> range<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
but then when we went over into range it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.480 
but then when we went over into range it
took<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.020> surprising<00:02:16.230> two<00:02:16.740> shots<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.250> once

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
took a surprising two shots and once

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.660 
took a surprising two shots and once
again<00:02:17.730> guys<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.750> another<00:02:18.930> clear<00:02:19.200> winner

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
again guys we have another clear winner

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.010 
again guys we have another clear winner
so<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:20.940> go<00:02:21.120> back<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> look<00:02:21.900> at

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
so now if we go back and take a look at

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.750 
so now if we go back and take a look at
our<00:02:22.140> final<00:02:22.290> stats<00:02:22.740> guys<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.460> found<00:02:23.550> out

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
our final stats guys we just found out

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.490 
our final stats guys we just found out
that<00:02:23.790> damage<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.450> most<00:02:24.690> effective<00:02:25.080> from<00:02:25.200> short

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
that damage is most effective from short

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.650 
that damage is most effective from short
range<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.370> range<00:02:26.550> proficiency<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.450> gonna

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
range and the range proficiency is gonna

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.060 
range and the range proficiency is gonna
be<00:02:27.780> your<00:02:27.960> best<00:02:28.170> choice<00:02:28.320> from<00:02:28.590> about<00:02:28.860> long
