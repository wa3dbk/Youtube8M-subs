00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
about couple in the crease there just to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.610 
about couple in the crease there just to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
make it more vibrant then I curling my

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.780 
make it more vibrant then I curling my
lashes<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.640> I'm<00:03:32.820> going<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.060> put<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:34.790> Hypnose

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
lashes and I'm going to put the Hypnose

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.170

by<00:03:36.480> Lancome<00:03:37.080> on<00:03:37.440> again<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.400> always<00:03:38.730> do<00:03:38.940> two

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
by Lancome on again and I always do two

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.120 
by Lancome on again and I always do two
coats<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:43.590> then<00:03:43.710> i<00:03:43.800> figured<00:03:43.860> for

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
coats of this and then i figured for

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.510 
coats of this and then i figured for
this<00:03:44.490> look<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.970> i<00:03:45.420> was<00:03:45.600> going<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.810> try<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:47.010> use

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
this look that i was going to try to use

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.350 
this look that i was going to try to use
false<00:03:47.850> lashes<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.680> outer<00:03:50.160> half<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:51.060> I

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
false lashes on the outer half so I

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.020 
false lashes on the outer half so I
never<00:03:51.690> never<00:03:52.170> really<00:03:52.530> used<00:03:52.710> them<00:03:52.920> at<00:03:53.430> all<00:03:53.670> ever

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
never never really used them at all ever

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.240 
never never really used them at all ever
but<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.360> might<00:03:54.600> as<00:03:54.630> well<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.710> color<00:03:55.920> looks

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
but I might as well it's the color looks

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:05.510 
but I might as well it's the color looks
so<00:03:57.470> Sweeting<00:03:58.470> we<00:03:58.770> need<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.520> drill<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:04.520> i

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
so Sweeting we need to drill it and i

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.220 
so Sweeting we need to drill it and i
find<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.790> way<00:04:05.940> easier<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.390> use<00:04:06.510> tweezers<00:04:06.810> than

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
find it way easier to use tweezers than

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.010 
find it way easier to use tweezers than
I<00:04:07.430> find<00:04:08.430> with<00:04:08.610> just<00:04:09.420> fingers<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.670> yeah<00:04:12.020> well

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020
