00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.600
 I'm going to show you how to repair the 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.490
 glass cleaner of cars like 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.519
 this one that is detached 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.650
 This method is very effective that I 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.550
 I have used it for several years 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.130
 here I have already repaired the first one this 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.300
 since the rubber was also unfolded 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.509
 Here I put it, you have to use it hot 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.280
 the east method is very effective 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.030
 I recommend it if you want to save 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.420
 a ticket and it is something that is very 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.420
 Quick 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.990
 I'm going to start hitting 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.940
 the plastic that is detached from 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 wiper washer 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.700
 I have here ready the 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.580
 hot gloss gun 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.660
 we are going to apply a little bit now 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.660
 small piece 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.030
 and much more 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.420
 good 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.650
 It's a good idea to put it in a bucket with 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.450
 cold water 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.990
 at this moment I am going to put it to the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990
 bucket with water 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.080
 is already here well pegadito on Monday a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.670
 quick work 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.730
 it seems that here is a little 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.970
 I'm going to put a little bit here 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.970
 as well 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.140
 The glass cleaner is now repaired 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.170
 using the hot glue is something good 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.030
 simple and this process is durable 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.910
 like to try 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.610
 This is free to do it who likes to go 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.430
 and buy new ones because it's a decision of 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.640
 each person I simply expose one 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.640
 idea 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.250
 let's place the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.630
 it's already repaired here you see the club 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.630
 the hot silicone 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.800
 Y 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.879
 at this time I applied a little 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.999
 water to the glass and I'm going to put them to 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.999
 to work 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.250
 okay 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.250
 what 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.440
 all right 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.440
 Y 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.760
 Y 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.000
 they are already working 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.889
 now after having put it to 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.720
 work for a while I'm going to remove it for 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.720
 to look to see if it does not take off 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.830
 is perfectly fine in its place not 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.830
 the rubber took off 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.680
 It is well pegadito so it is that as 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.530
 I tell them they work especially from 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.060
 emergency and so you want to put 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.550
 the new ones are fine but emergency 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.610
 They can be repaired using 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.949
 hot silicone 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.219
 I hope this idea helps them 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.219
 friends
