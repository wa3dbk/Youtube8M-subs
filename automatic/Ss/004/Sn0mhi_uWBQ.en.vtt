however<00:00:01.290> back<00:00:02.389> here<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.510> furnace<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:03.929> getting

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
however back here the furnace is getting

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.860 
however back here the furnace is getting
a<00:00:04.819> toasty<00:00:06.859> however<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:07.980> blower<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.870> barely

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
a toasty however my blower is barely

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.749 
a toasty however my blower is barely
running<00:00:12.710> too<00:00:13.710> much<00:00:13.860> blower<00:00:14.130> doesn't<00:00:14.610> work

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
running too much blower doesn't work

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.730 
running too much blower doesn't work
little<00:00:15.420> blower<00:00:15.630> doesn't<00:00:16.020> work<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.529> an

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
little blower doesn't work and it's an

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.140 
little blower doesn't work and it's an
induction<00:00:17.039> motor<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:17.910> difficult

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
induction motor so it's really difficult

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.150 
induction motor so it's really difficult
to<00:00:18.390> control<00:00:18.660> speed<00:00:21.710> if<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.830> didn't<00:00:23.039> see<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to control speed if I didn't see the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:47.299 
to control speed if I didn't see the
atom<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.760> worked<00:00:23.910> pretty<00:00:24.150> well<00:00:46.309> let's

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
atom I just worked pretty well let's

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.880 
atom I just worked pretty well let's
open<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> way<00:00:50.210> which<00:00:51.590> means<00:00:52.590> I'm<00:00:52.739> not

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
open all the way which means I'm not

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.930 
open all the way which means I'm not
really<00:00:53.129> getting<00:00:53.370> adequate<00:00:53.730> flow<00:00:54.329> a<00:01:00.829> little

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
really getting adequate flow a little

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.529 
really getting adequate flow a little
smell<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
smell that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.679 
smell that
let's<00:01:04.409> check<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> compressor<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.420> she's

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
let's check the compressor and she's

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.110 
let's check the compressor and she's
getting<00:01:06.840> warm<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:08.159> blazing

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.280 

well<00:01:15.120> it's<00:01:15.300> not<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.510> iron<00:01:15.659> melting<00:01:15.990> furnace

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
well it's not an iron melting furnace

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.620 
well it's not an iron melting furnace
but<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:17.630> does<00:01:18.630> work<00:01:19.880> perhaps<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.300> blower

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
but it does work perhaps with a blower

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:46.480 
but it does work perhaps with a blower
oh<00:01:27.830> yeah<00:01:43.490> well<00:01:44.490> starting<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> glow

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
oh yeah well starting to glow

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.260 
oh yeah well starting to glow
although<00:01:47.490> most<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.789> fuel<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:48.060> being

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
although most the fuel that's being

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.490 
although most the fuel that's being
sprayed<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:48.960> burning<00:01:49.110> off<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
sprayed in is just burning off the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.900 
sprayed in is just burning off the
crucible<00:01:49.920> directly

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.139 

it's<00:01:56.910> why<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> love<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.570> aluminum<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:59.119> no<00:02:00.119> I

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it's why I love to do aluminum now no I

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.680 
it's why I love to do aluminum now no I
don't<00:02:00.390> plan<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.570> today<00:02:05.360> when<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.509> really

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
don't plan on today when it's really

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.380 
don't plan on today when it's really
erratic<00:02:06.869> makes<00:02:07.229> me<00:02:07.320> wonder<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.619> via<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.550> devices

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
erratic makes me wonder if via a devices

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.560 
erratic makes me wonder if via a devices
vlog<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:10.050> should<00:02:10.800> check<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> temp<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.370> these

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
vlog I should check the temp of these

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.800 
vlog I should check the temp of these

this<00:02:21.900> plane<00:02:22.200> she<00:02:22.380> was<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.709> here<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.730> hard

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
this plane she was out of here it's hard

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.590 
this plane she was out of here it's hard
to<00:02:23.940> see<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:25.910> well<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:26.940> think<00:02:27.120> I'm<00:02:27.330> gonna<00:02:27.420> shut

to see but well I think I'm gonna shut
her<00:02:27.660> down

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.959 

successful<00:02:32.739> tests<00:02:33.099> I<00:02:33.159> suppose<00:02:33.400> at<00:02:33.549> work<00:02:33.730> it's

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:33.969 
successful tests I suppose at work it's

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.339 
successful tests I suppose at work it's
just<00:02:35.790> well<00:02:36.790> maybe<00:02:37.719> I<00:02:37.780> let<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.019> go<00:02:38.079> for<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> little

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
just well maybe I let it go for a little

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.289 
just well maybe I let it go for a little
while<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.920> then<00:02:39.069> I'll<00:02:39.189> I'll<00:02:39.760> take<00:02:40.180> another

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
while and then I'll I'll take another

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.759 
while and then I'll I'll take another
video<00:02:40.629> when<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.810> open<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.140> furnace<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.620> see

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
video when I open the furnace and see

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.189 
video when I open the furnace and see
how<00:02:41.829> hot<00:02:41.980> this
