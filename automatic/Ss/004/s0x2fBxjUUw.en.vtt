00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the street to do this makeup I'm going

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.589 
the street to do this makeup I'm going
to<00:03:07.560> start<00:03:07.799> by<00:03:07.920> applying<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.489> load<00:03:08.879> of<00:03:09.180> face

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
to start by applying a load of face

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.869 
to start by applying a load of face
powder<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.530> white<00:03:11.400> face<00:03:11.579> powder

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
powder and it is a white face powder

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.520 
powder and it is a white face powder
it's<00:03:12.150> not<00:03:12.329> going<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.629> really<00:03:12.900> make<00:03:13.049> me<00:03:13.200> paler

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
it's not going to really make me paler

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.319 
it's not going to really make me paler
because<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.129> kind<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.609> transparent<00:03:15.180> one

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.059 
because it is kind of a transparent one
but<00:03:15.959> still<00:03:16.200> it's<00:03:16.349> better<00:03:16.500> than<00:03:16.650> my<00:03:16.769> colored

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
but still it's better than my colored

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.400 
but still it's better than my colored
powder<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.720> I'm<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.900> going<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.109> apply<00:03:19.230> that
