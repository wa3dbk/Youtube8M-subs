 I'm Luis Gg this is intermediate tv and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.150
 without further ado we begin 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.480
 one of the advantages that the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.480
 windows phone platform is that if you do not 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.570
 you have a credit card is possible 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.780
 make purchases of applications to 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.150
 through your telcel receipt the truth is 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.250
 that the configuration is very very simple 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.780
 if you want to buy an application you 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.580
 you are going to find that we have a 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.559
 payment application 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.010
 will have two options which 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.140
 says try or buy in this case if you 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.989
 you decide not to try the application anymore 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.120
 buying it directly will ask you 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.769
 If you have some form of payment in 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.590
 In this case, the forms of payment could be 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.960
 a credit card a credit card 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.320
 debit etc. but the important point 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.140
 is that you will appear there by default 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.200
 the option to pay it with telcel in this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.450
 if you press it the application goes 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.270
 to download and the cost of this 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.360
 application will be deducted from the credit 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.550

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.360
