00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
dust right here and that will give us

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.550 
dust right here and that will give us
our<00:01:36.720> clay<00:01:37.050> blocks<00:01:38.510> so<00:01:39.510> these<00:01:39.660> oak<00:01:40.050> barrels<00:01:40.440> are

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
our clay blocks so these oak barrels are

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.900 
our clay blocks so these oak barrels are
extremely<00:01:41.130> useful<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.730> multiple

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
extremely useful they have multiple

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.300 
extremely useful they have multiple
purposes<00:01:42.440> this<00:01:43.440> is<00:01:43.620> just<00:01:43.800> one<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:43.980> them<00:01:44.130> so

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
purposes this is just one of them so

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.330
