 I agree 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.100
 Because it loses in 10 minutes 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.980
 Yes a little greed will select the most order the 3-position corresponding app 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.920
 Oh, there seems to be some limit on something 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.299
 It hard but I'm not a thing discord Naa cut that time from those of other users 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:08.250

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.150
 Some kind of each other various forms Jinho 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.150
 It becomes 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.830
 I wonder if both Lancers have zones 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.830

 Yokoe's Attacking Ginger comes to 74 and I 'm sorry 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.500
 But it is likely to drainage that Japanese banks met with bobbin 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.500
 That's right if you can roll it now 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.610
 Mr. Pee's teacher has always been a member of the House Jumping Party, isn't it amazing? 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.740
 It seems that I have never let it swing and fly 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:25.680
 I wonder if you will still do a thing such as the turret is me in the average value 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.680
 Agra was cloudy Agra Please take this 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.930
 I wonder if this is an exchange so yes 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.930
 A fierce sound is coming out Yes 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.120

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.120
 this is 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.360
 I was able to bring in the enemy suddenly 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.080
 I still accustomed also in the other stabbed the other party 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.030
 Let's go ahead 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.030
 It is so because it is still early commercial of 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.290
 Don't get lost 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.130
 It seems to be quite difficult to prevent each 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.090
 Of 3 places 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.720
 But 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.060
 This probably endowment myriad of lie down Ne obtained KuchiFutoshi 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.090
 When 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.090
 Relentlessly 9 I came Ah But baton steadily 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:43.730
 For example, what do you think immediately if you look at 68 gold than gold ? 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.730
 Because you will do what happens 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.030
 It's very dangerous because it sells 78 cases just after calling 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.300
 It's not easy , so it's a car 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.430
 Please do your best 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.960
 It is was a little badly cooked When you do so this is another 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.550
 It may be defeated I felt like I was losing 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.260

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.430

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.650
 Ne 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.650
 What does the other person point here 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.730
 It is so, who would you do it the other party refer to anything to do with 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.960
 Omura- san, but if measures are taken 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.249
 Staring is w 6 want a corner 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:00.449
 I wonder if it's thin 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:06:04.069
 No, because immediately triple urging from or Mr. toward the listening look is unlikely 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.069
 Yes what 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.689
 Yes It is also the manager feeling or thinking now your free 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:34.009

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:41.320
 Yes it is 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:43.090
 I feel would be a little, for example, there is no regional banks and blur White also think if Well I also tear something 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.940
 I have to match 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:50.210
 Yes is the author Nea likely it this 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:54.710
 Or do students who are not among the also come people of Oite someday 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:57.770
 I also looks like it was the military side is hit but the other 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.509
 Hey, we'd form a 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.509
 I still think at the bottom of r 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:10.160
 I took it back a little bit 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.160
 Yeah I think I want to avoid easy only 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:27.830
 Patiently This is the case it is in magnificent have high Nee

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.160
 Oh worries ー 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.540
 After all, to pass this kind of hand and oar 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.540
 What a key or a 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.030
 A little bit 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.350

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:49.030
