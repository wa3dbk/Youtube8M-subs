00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
the 22 in general it just it's a louder

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.439 
the 22 in general it just it's a louder
capsule<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:13.900> right<00:03:14.079> here

it's<00:03:16.449> also<00:03:16.599> more<00:03:16.930> clear<00:03:17.439> just<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.919> 35

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it's also more clear just like the 35

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.640 
it's also more clear just like the 35
would<00:03:18.579> be<00:03:18.759> but<00:03:19.629> it<00:03:19.689> doesn't<00:03:19.959> seem<00:03:20.079> quite<00:03:20.290> as<00:03:20.470> as

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
would be but it doesn't seem quite as as

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.379 
would be but it doesn't seem quite as as
clear<00:03:21.310> as<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.669> 35<00:03:23.639> handheld<00:03:24.639> plug-in<00:03:25.090> style

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
clear as the 35 handheld plug-in style

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.920 
clear as the 35 handheld plug-in style
35<00:03:26.290> it's<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:27.009> little<00:03:27.370> bit<00:03:27.519> darker<00:03:28.449> which<00:03:28.720> is

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
35 it's a little bit darker which is

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.420 
35 it's a little bit darker which is
good<00:03:29.139> because<00:03:29.379> that's<00:03:29.829> where<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.250> get<00:03:30.370> most

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
good because that's where you get most

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.030 
good because that's where you get most
of<00:03:30.699> your<00:03:30.819> feedback<00:03:31.199> so<00:03:32.199> it<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.620> still<00:03:32.889> my

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
of your feedback so it is still my

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.920 
of your feedback so it is still my

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
favorite capsule for my wireless as the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.689 
favorite capsule for my wireless as the
35<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.889> 22<00:03:39.400> isn't<00:03:40.060> bad<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:41.280> think<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:42.519> also

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
35 the 22 isn't bad I think it's also

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.710 
35 the 22 isn't bad I think it's also
darker<00:03:43.239> than<00:03:43.419> the<00:03:43.659> wired<00:03:44.560> 22<00:03:45.299> which<00:03:46.299> is<00:03:46.479> good

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
darker than the wired 22 which is good

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.170 
darker than the wired 22 which is good
but<00:03:47.680> there's<00:03:47.889> not<00:03:48.040> as<00:03:48.159> much<00:03:48.310> low<00:03:48.609> end<00:03:48.639> on<00:03:49.000> it

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
but there's not as much low end on it

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.689 
but there's not as much low end on it
which<00:03:49.389> if<00:03:49.689> you<00:03:50.199> have<00:03:50.349> a<00:03:50.379> sound<00:03:50.979> system<00:03:51.250> that
