00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.490 
Cameron up but actually this logo
matches<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.130> actually<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.180> look<00:00:33.510> actually

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
matches it actually this look actually

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
matches it actually this look actually
this<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.770> matches<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.070> perfect<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> old

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
this one matches a perfect but the old

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.720 
this one matches a perfect but the old
older<00:00:37.320> counterfeit<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.309> author<00:00:38.520> what

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
older counterfeit see the author what

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.990 
older counterfeit see the author what
used<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> be<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> lot<00:00:39.149> darker<00:00:40.550> like<00:00:41.550> take<00:00:41.790> for

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
used to be a lot darker like take for

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
used to be a lot darker like take for
example<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
example this one so do you see the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.819 
example this one so do you see the
differences<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> otter<00:00:45.059> color<00:00:45.829> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
differences in the otter color the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.260 
differences in the otter color the
counterfeit<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.370> black<00:00:47.610> lender<00:00:47.879> lot<00:00:48.030> thicker

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
counterfeit one black lender lot thicker

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
counterfeit one black lender lot thicker
so<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.050> that's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.410> lot<00:00:49.980> thicker

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so if you get one that's a lot thicker

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
so if you get one that's a lot thicker
lines<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:51.539> counterfeit<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.710> said

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
lines it's counterfeit but like I said

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.220 
lines it's counterfeit but like I said
most<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.629> counterfeits<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.750> fixed<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
most are counterfeits have fixed up I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
most are counterfeits have fixed up I
know<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.160> they're<00:00:56.309> working<00:00:56.520> overtime

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
know you know they're working overtime

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.560 
know you know they're working overtime
there<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.090> China<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.160> we're<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.879> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
there in China and so we're here as you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.319 
there in China and so we're here as you
can<00:01:00.629> tell<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.410> font<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> counterfeit<00:01:03.120> one

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
can tell the font on a counterfeit one

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.969 
can tell the font on a counterfeit one
is<00:01:04.040> slightly<00:01:05.040> bigger<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> I'm<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.860> all

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
is slightly bigger so I'm just going all

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
is slightly bigger so I'm just going all
that<00:01:08.070> returns<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> compare<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:09.330> another<00:01:09.540> way

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that returns to compare now another way

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.170 
that returns to compare now another way
to<00:01:09.750> check<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> QR<00:01:10.619> code<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.119> can

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
to check is the QR code but as you can

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.870 
to check is the QR code but as you can
see<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.900> QR<00:01:13.260> code<00:01:13.290> matches<00:01:13.650> perfect<00:01:14.189> between

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
see the QR code matches perfect between

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.270 
see the QR code matches perfect between
the<00:01:14.939> real<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.090> fake<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:16.009> now<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> weights

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the real and fake one now the weights

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850 
the real and fake one now the weights
like<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.570> color<00:01:18.840> scheme<00:01:19.080> don't<00:01:19.710> know<00:01:19.799> if

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
like is the color scheme don't know if

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.350 
like is the color scheme don't know if
you<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.159> tough<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.490> camera<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.119> there's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you a little tough on camera but there's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.020 
you a little tough on camera but there's
a<00:01:21.420> color<00:01:21.689> bar<00:01:21.930> difference<00:01:22.790> unfortunately<00:01:23.790> if

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
a color bar difference unfortunately if

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.010 
a color bar difference unfortunately if
you<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.299> got<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> mail<00:01:24.780> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
you just got this in the mail you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.910 
you just got this in the mail you
probably<00:01:25.290> won't<00:01:25.500> even<00:01:25.590> notice<00:01:27.680> anything<00:01:28.680> so

the<00:01:50.820> UPC<00:01:51.360> code<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.049> tell<00:01:52.110> there's<00:01:52.409> two

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the UPC code as you can tell there's two

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.499 
the UPC code as you can tell there's two
different<00:01:52.770> they're<00:01:53.189> different<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
different they're different here so the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.660 
different they're different here so the

two<00:02:20.980> seconds<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:21.640> hard<00:02:21.879> but<00:02:22.330> i<00:02:22.510> guess

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
two seconds it's so hard but i guess
