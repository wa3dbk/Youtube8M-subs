 cyberport presents the high end in 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.920
 ear headphones se 846 from shaw das 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.599
 Company comes from the United 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.330
 States and is above all for his 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.760
 top-class headphones microphones and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.210
 Pickup systems known worldwide 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.949
 the new se 846 is about 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 an in earphone one in 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.420
 considering his price first the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.640
 language is why this product 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.880
 but worth every one of these many euros 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 we will show you at first 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.480
 few general information offers the se 846 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.180
 four high definition micro driver one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.000
 Transmission range from 15 to 20,000 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.550
 hertz an impedance of new and one 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.160
 sensitivity of 114 decibels per 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.440
 megawatt as you can see that exists 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.809
 housing made of transparent plastic so 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.460
 that one's technical interior 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.379
 is impressively revealed in the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.550
 opas pieces are just a whole lot 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.100
 set available 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.809
 on the one hand, there are three otoplastics 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.760
 Foam and three of silicone 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.470
 on the other hand have a yellow one 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.630
 universal passport piece as well 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 so-called can in the tree pass pieces ever 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.100
 after the clock you can change the accessories as you like 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.159
 and easily change as well 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.580
 interchangeable are the cables of 162 cm 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.310
 on 116 cm or vice versa 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.979
 The end of this cable forms a 3 5 mm 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.140
 jack plug by means of 6.3 mm 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.700
 but klinken adapter also sound 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.130
 systems can be connected 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.979
 the perfect workmanship completes that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.079
 complete package we are thrilled 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 before we get closer to the tone 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.220
 See, we still throw only one 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 look at the built-in technology because you 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 namely, you can see very closely 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.740
 in each of the two headphones one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.520
 big block out three even smaller ones 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.500
 blocks 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.340
 what we just something and technically 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.320
 have described 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.240
 are each two genuine drivers in 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.070
 Micro size plus subwoofer 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.259
 that means we have it here with one 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.359
 typical sound system in miniature too 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.369
 above all, it's a real thing 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.140
 to generate experience have 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.179
 Engineers of ten shoes each 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.560
 metal plates made of stainless steel with 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.489
 which a mechanical low-pass filter 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.629
 is generated by the promises sc 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.970
 846 unprecedented 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.180
 bass reproduction with the precision of a 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.640
 real subwoofers and this technique of 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.530
 actually unique for shoes has 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.750
 this engineering of art only recently 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.230
 patented but not so 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.510
 enough 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.910
 Also unique is the exchange 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.380
 small bowls around individual 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.170
 sound signatures to offer 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.629
 how that works quite simply as 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.549
 First you remove the piece afterwards 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.560
 you access the included assembly 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.239
 tool and unscrew the protection collar 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.829
 then you can do that 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.060
 numerous and with one 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.530
 replace others 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.930
 There are three different ones altogether 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.319
 Sound tubes with the sound of signatures 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.760
 was balanced and brilliant caution 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.590
 is with these small parts however 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.630
 Offered so you do not off the table 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.819
 fall and then forever untraceable 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.389
 but still a great thing 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.310
 thumb up and now equal to the sound 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.989
 after the first listen one notices 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.209
 the clear difference to standard 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.760
 headphones heights middle and low 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.620
 can be clear separate 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.480
 and in relation to the bass we have 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.700
 truly no better in ears 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.709
 heard it is really amazing how 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.810
 a lot of sound from such a small product 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.940
 what's more, our sound experience can come 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.130
 strengthened is the good isolation of 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.569
 ambient noise of the manufacturer 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.760
 promises one at this point 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.130
 Shielding of over 90 percent 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.210
 which we can not quite share 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.800
 make the clock pieces 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.870
 of course a good job though 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.440
 over 90 percent is not 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.180
 always in there 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.820
 in the end it always comes down to that 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.690
 own clock in total but a great one 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.540
 Result 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.520
 we summarize this is not a 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.740
 product for hobby listener but for 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.960
 professional musician and enthusiastic 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.180
 Music enthusiasts use the built-in technology 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.950
 deliver an unbeatable sound 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.830
 the manifold possibilities of the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.600
 Individualization is first class only 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.160
 The price lets us swallow because he 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.020
 is really far above what we are 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.440
 already call expensive headphones 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.620
 would 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.760
 we therefore give four and a half out of five 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.760
 his stars
