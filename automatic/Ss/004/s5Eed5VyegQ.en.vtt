00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:22.029
 as I see he was washing the tables at san 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.730
 marco there is a whole culture of people 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.590
 who have come out to survive 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.590
 to war then a size of 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.869
 poverty and completely finished 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.280
 different this always the window in 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.980
 bottom left now at a certain time 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.510
 charge charge office I noticed 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.700
 isolation of messages these facts 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.219
 these message stratifications mi 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.629
 I realized that I was born true not 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.429
 I was more inside I am no longer in the 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.620
 his way and then why always why 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.350
 because always because it is always like this 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.480
 this ritual because not so because 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.109
 do not deliver the gesture here because 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.449
 don't deliver it here in jesus for 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.219
 build out this message had to 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.219
 come forward in services in the territory 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.150
 it's basically a widow's job 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.420
 part with an attention to the gesture of the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.259
 baroque 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:23.500
 in the thirties he goes very young 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:27.979
 to resume the baroque architecture of 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.200
 venice and therefore a very organic gesture 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.390
 the Baroque is very sensual and very sensual 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.240
 precisely this characteristic of 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.590
 sensuality and leads to this gesture for 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.729
 therefore all his activity to one 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:46.009
 condition almost of very gesturality 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.060
 sensual but also very angry 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.890
 the emilia still remains aggressive 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 connected with the canvas not nearly so 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.159
 then pollockiana in the manner of chicken 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.700
 the canvas the splendid reflects his 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.450
 body and therefore his gesture therefore a 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.100
 a different uniqueness of Americans for 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.979
 Americans basically use it 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.049
 also the colors like white and black like 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.750
 france klein while he brings in to 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.760
 color of venice strong colors and red 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.609
 the yellow and so on so there is a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.950
 European connotation that is different from 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:25.750
 American connotation and there is one 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.750
 Italian connotation that is different 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.159
 Venice is one and a surrealist city 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:46.829
 I say very studied in the sense of evasion 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:58.019
 of a rather monotonous escape 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:03:01.299
 nostalgic melancholy are a lot 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:05.609
 Venetian traditionalists sick of 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:09.819
 their great Venetian families passed them 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:14.010
 they were inside the constructive making of the 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:20.019
 reality but today the large families 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.599
 the society sleep long sleeps 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.430
 Venetian and very boring 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.760
 throughout the winter they play cards 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.950
 lots of stupid games and not 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.930
 cultivate no cultural interest or 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.989
 artistic certainly I am the son of 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.440
 tintoretto as I am son of goya of 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.199
 domains and of the picasso of guernica 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.560
 of expressionism published by berlin for 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:53.260
 these things these multiple ones these 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.250
 moving objects are a tribute to 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.250
 ava berlin 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.750
 from the eight-man democratic berlin 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.460
 beckmann I sought this spirit i 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.330
 there are painters of the modern world 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.910
 many 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.780
 painting painting in the sense this is 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.140
 finished I don't enjoy it made it stronger 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.200
 of me and I arrive at my own expression 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.180
 because at a certain moment of those who 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.870
 you have inside and because you have to make way 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.680
 spit your current badges wanted 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.660
 summarize this moment of fear e 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.400
 of destruction 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.590
 fear today fear today this the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.000
 meaning of the message against all 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.310
 alienated technological exaltations 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.160
 for another 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.450
 it was a defense of man in his 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.140
 integrity and all his humanity of 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.140
 all his judgment
