 skull is more pronounced for makeup i will 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.319

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:00.429
 shade 104 it will be our base with you 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.830
 I decided to use the arrows first 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.899
 face paint but then I thought it was not 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.689
 each of you has one and better 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:13.209
 I 'll just use the shadows we will apply them 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:15.310
 wet so to begin to apply 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.650
 base to our with you 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.350
 the arrow didnâ€™t run away in the summer 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.180
 me it pain under mac in shade 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.780
 pinter whether many about him always 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.750
 ask so remember light 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.090
 shade I'll put a little under the curb 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:38.680
 so that our brow was more 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:40.660
 clearly expressed using 350 shades from 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.780
 catrice a little from its tenue 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:50.019
 the hanging eyelid for this will put a crease 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.180
 this shade and slightly dim it well 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.209
 now we will draw the arrow itself 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.130
 for starters, I do it 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.579
 fine effects will be quietly 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.280
 quietly thicken it to the one I need 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.549
 size light pencil 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.920
 the inside of the arrow and the little blue 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.920

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.410

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.410
 size 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.540
 also put light on the water line 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.799
 pencil and arrow slightly keep on 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.840
 lower line of growth of our cilia with you 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.450
 well now wet if your 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.720
 arrow you like can apply 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.260
 brighter shade principle can 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.659
 leave and this is not quite bright effect 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
 for this just do not apply 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.579
 over the top 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.430
 i will use blue shades and pink 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:56.450
 the shadows that will be applied to the inside 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.450
 our arrow 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.510
 so that my little eyes 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.900
 didn't seem even smaller i slightly 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.560
 under the carcass bottom of the arrow in order 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.900
 make it less clear paint 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.910
 I lightly painted my eyelashes with black 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.980
 tinged so that our 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.110
 arrow and the lower cilia painted 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.870
 blue mascara now i will use 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.490
 blush pink from catrice which to 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.310

 bourgeois shade glitter 3d effect 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.600
 Well, now get down to your hair if your 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.540
 hair dry 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.450
 wet it in my plan lucky 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.640
 my hair is curly but if you have hair 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.190
 Do not hover then use 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.950
 curling slightly twisting a few strands 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.710
 Naturally on dry hair well or 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.690
 wrap your hair in a harness 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.580
 many do 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.950
 preferably before makeup slightly on 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.020
 dried hair and walk like that 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.840
 some time fixing these 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.760
 flagella all over his head so 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.360
 so that you and I have the effect of wet 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.150
 hair 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:23.350
 we are all our hair length 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:25.210
 distribute foam or mousse now 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.740
 I'll turn my head around like this 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:32.080
 you dry your hair lightly pressing it 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.270
 bottom in the end you have what should 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.900
 get such a wet hair effect 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.570
 slightly disheveled well, all come back 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.090
 in our usual position with you slightly 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.940
 still spend on hair hands 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.250
 to a little beat ours with you 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.590
 roots and that's what we have about 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.750
 It turns out quite so straight years 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.940

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.800

 your hair is curled like mine then you are lucky you 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:09.280
 it will be much easier to do it 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.930
 much easier by the way many men 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.229

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.960
