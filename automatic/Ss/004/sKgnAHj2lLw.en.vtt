00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
was kinda light and then this one went

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.640 
was kinda light and then this one went
in<00:04:32.310> there<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.669> did<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.000> same<00:04:33.290> as<00:04:34.290> far<00:04:34.560> as

laying<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.070> down<00:04:35.270> but<00:04:36.270> it's<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.540> lot<00:04:36.750> more<00:04:37.050> I

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
laying it down but it's a lot more I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.990 
laying it down but it's a lot more I
won't<00:04:39.570> say<00:04:39.750> GUI<00:04:40.050> but<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:41.010> don't<00:04:41.580> know<00:04:41.640> it<00:04:41.820> has<00:04:41.850> a

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
won't say GUI but I don't know it has a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.340
