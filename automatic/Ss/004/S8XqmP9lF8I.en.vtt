00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
ricochets up in there for a long way I

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.210 
ricochets up in there for a long way I
can't<00:00:22.080> remember<00:00:22.199> whether<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.590> scored<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
can't remember whether we scored on it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
can't remember whether we scored on it
but<00:00:23.340> if<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.580> did<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.880> got<00:00:24.029> real<00:00:24.300> close<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:25.380> score

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
but if we did we got real close we score

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.670 
but if we did we got real close we score
I<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:26.760> two<00:00:26.939> plays<00:00:27.410> kickoff<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
I think in one or two plays kickoff to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.420

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
of a different look now I hope they I

of a different look now I hope they I
don't<00:01:15.270> know<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> confused<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.470> they're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't know that it confused and they're

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.630 
don't know that it confused and they're
not<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:16.979> they<00:01:17.130> couldn't<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.460> their

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
not because they couldn't get their

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
not because they couldn't get their
hands<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.000> him<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:19.020> rest<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.290> college

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.320 
hands on him but the rest of college
football<00:01:19.830> couldn't<00:01:20.189> either<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.880> again<00:01:21.180> we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
football couldn't either so again we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.760 
football couldn't either so again we
gave<00:01:21.509> which<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.900> would<00:01:22.049> tend<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.590> mean

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
gave which we would tend to do I mean

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.649
