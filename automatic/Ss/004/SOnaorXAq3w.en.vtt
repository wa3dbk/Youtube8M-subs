00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.069 
to show you the quick and easy way to
melt<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.460> I'm<00:00:35.940> gonna<00:00:36.390> put<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
melt this I'm gonna put this in the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.910 
melt this I'm gonna put this in the
microwave<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:38.070> 50%<00:00:38.940> power<00:00:39.350> for<00:00:40.350> two<00:00:40.590> minutes

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
microwave at 50% power for two minutes

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.730 
microwave at 50% power for two minutes
and<00:00:41.130> then<00:00:41.390> I'm<00:00:42.390> gonna<00:00:42.540> check<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.990> to<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.350> how

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
and then I'm gonna check it to see how

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.030 
and then I'm gonna check it to see how
how<00:00:44.520> melted<00:00:45.060> it<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.380> take<00:00:46.680> probably

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
how melted it is it will take probably

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.310 
how melted it is it will take probably
three<00:00:47.280> minutes<00:00:48.030> maybe<00:00:48.300> four<00:00:48.630> minutes<00:00:48.750> but

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
three minutes maybe four minutes but

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.440 
three minutes maybe four minutes but
we're<00:00:49.470> gonna<00:00:49.590> start<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.070> two<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.880> important

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
we're gonna start with two the important

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.140 
we're gonna start with two the important
thing<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.080> overheat<00:00:52.950> this<00:00:53.580> if<00:00:53.820> you

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
thing is not to overheat this if you

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.970 
thing is not to overheat this if you
overheat<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.810> you've<00:00:54.960> ruined<00:00:55.290> your<00:00:55.470> chocolate

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
overheat it you've ruined your chocolate

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.320 
overheat it you've ruined your chocolate
so<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.400> just<00:00:56.550> gonna<00:00:56.670> set<00:00:56.970> this<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
so I'm just gonna set this in the

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.380 
so I'm just gonna set this in the
microwave<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:58.970> when<00:00:59.970> you<00:01:00.060> take<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
microwave now when you take the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.009 
microwave now when you take the
chocolate<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:02.210> it'll<00:01:03.210> look<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.870> not

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
chocolate out it'll look like it's not

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.840 
chocolate out it'll look like it's not
melted<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.280> start<00:01:05.460> putting<00:01:05.759> your

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
melted but as you start putting your

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.249 
melted but as you start putting your
spoon<00:01:06.150> into<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.479> you'll<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
spoon into it you'll see that it is

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:15.170 
spoon into it you'll see that it is
starting<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.950> melt<00:01:13.580> I'm<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.730> gonna<00:01:14.850> stir

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
starting to melt I'm just gonna stir

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.060 
starting to melt I'm just gonna stir
this<00:01:15.360> around<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:16.140> probably<00:01:16.470> gonna<00:01:16.680> put<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
this around I'm probably gonna put this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.000 
this around I'm probably gonna put this
back<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.550> over<00:01:18.330> maybe<00:01:18.480> another<00:01:18.810> 30<00:01:18.930> seconds<00:01:19.800> a

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
back in over maybe another 30 seconds a

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.330 
back in over maybe another 30 seconds a
minute<00:01:20.850> at<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.120> most<00:01:21.470> if<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.740> wasn't<00:01:23.010> in<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
minute at the most if I wasn't in a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.130 
minute at the most if I wasn't in a
hurry<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.850> could<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.360> set<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> water

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
hurry I could just set it on the water

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
hurry I could just set it on the water
bath<00:01:25.409> right<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.040> little<00:01:26.250> burner<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
bath right on my little burner here and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.240 
bath right on my little burner here and
in<00:01:27.630> about<00:01:27.810> five<00:01:28.140> minutes<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:29.130> be

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
in about five minutes this would be

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.399 
in about five minutes this would be
ready<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> go<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:32.430> actually<00:01:32.580> pretty<00:01:32.970> close

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
ready to go it's actually pretty close

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.600 
ready to go it's actually pretty close
you'll<00:01:34.409> find<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.830> as<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.100> start<00:01:35.280> stirring

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you'll find that as you start stirring

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.600 
you'll find that as you start stirring
this<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.330> you<00:01:36.570> dissipate<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> heat<00:01:37.260> in<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
this and you dissipate the heat in it it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.140 
this and you dissipate the heat in it it
melts<00:01:39.000> very<00:01:39.240> very<00:01:39.510> quickly<00:01:40.820> okay<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:42.000> gonna

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
melts very very quickly okay I'm gonna

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:52.640 
melts very very quickly okay I'm gonna
put<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.540> back<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:49.940> at<00:01:50.940> half<00:01:51.570> power<00:01:51.900> again<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
put this back in at half power again and

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.800 
put this back in at half power again and
we're<00:01:53.190> gonna<00:01:53.280> watch<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.580> maybe<00:01:54.000> maybe<00:01:54.450> 30

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
we're gonna watch it maybe maybe 30

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.640 
we're gonna watch it maybe maybe 30
seconds<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.590> minute<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.409> milk
