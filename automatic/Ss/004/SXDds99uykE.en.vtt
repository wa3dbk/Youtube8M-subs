bouncing<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.849> an<00:02:52.000> audio<00:02:52.239> track<00:02:52.450> which<00:02:52.780> is

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
bouncing to an audio track which is

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.530 
bouncing to an audio track which is
pretty<00:02:53.200> straightforward<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:54.370> record<00:02:55.150> I've

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
pretty straightforward and record I've

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.750 
pretty straightforward and record I've
noted<00:02:56.110> how<00:02:56.260> handsome<00:02:56.590> himself<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.549> for

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
noted how handsome himself to this for

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.759 
noted how handsome himself to this for
this<00:02:57.849> is<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> very<00:02:58.299> easy<00:02:58.360> way<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.959> do<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.349> and

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
this is a very easy way that I do it and

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.530 
this is a very easy way that I do it and
we<00:03:00.610> choose<00:03:01.269> felids<00:03:01.780> we<00:03:01.900> want<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.200> bounce<00:03:02.410> and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
we choose felids we want to bounce and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.690 
we choose felids we want to bounce and
you<00:03:04.540> go<00:03:04.690> before<00:03:04.959> applying<00:03:05.590> effects<00:03:06.069> Spencer

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
you go before applying effects Spencer

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.229 
you go before applying effects Spencer
into<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.480> actual<00:03:07.900> song<00:03:08.500> itself<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.090> just

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
into the actual song itself and it just

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.610 
into the actual song itself and it just
runs<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:10.750> out<00:03:10.930> which<00:03:11.110> only<00:03:11.260> takes<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.590> few

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
runs is it out which only takes a few

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.009 
runs is it out which only takes a few
seconds<00:03:12.130> because<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.579> know<00:03:12.840> hardware<00:03:13.840> so

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
seconds because you know hardware so

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.690 
seconds because you know hardware so
fast<00:03:14.319> these<00:03:14.500> days<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:15.010> soft<00:03:15.250> was<00:03:15.400> pretty

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
fast these days this soft was pretty

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.360 
fast these days this soft was pretty
efficient<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.420> oh<00:03:17.260> that's<00:03:17.739> my<00:03:17.950> mistake<00:03:18.099> i

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
efficient and oh that's my mistake i

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.069 
efficient and oh that's my mistake i
should<00:03:18.549> have<00:03:18.640> said<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:18.970> do<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.209> between<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
should have said to do it between the

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.930 
should have said to do it between the
actual<00:03:20.530> dew<00:03:20.890> points<00:03:21.280> not<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.549> whole<00:03:21.700> song

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
actual dew points not the whole song

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:34.340 
actual dew points not the whole song
because<00:03:22.180> those<00:03:22.750> are<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.140> signs

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.570 

so<00:03:35.350> now<00:03:35.470> it's<00:03:35.650> wounding<00:03:35.980> out<00:03:36.130> just<00:03:36.370> those

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
so now it's wounding out just those

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.090 
so now it's wounding out just those
notes<00:03:36.880> as<00:03:37.240> audio<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.990> putting<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:38.980> new

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
notes as audio and putting it in a new

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.710 
notes as audio and putting it in a new
track<00:03:39.340> oh<00:03:39.610> here<00:03:40.330> we<00:03:40.360> go<00:03:42.240> take<00:03:43.240> off<00:03:43.390> that's<00:03:43.600> a

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
track oh here we go take off that's a

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:52.740 
track oh here we go take off that's a
bigger<00:03:43.930> than<00:03:44.200> us<00:03:44.320> your<00:03:44.500> feedback<00:03:51.570> I'm<00:03:52.570> just

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
bigger than us your feedback I'm just

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.270 
bigger than us your feedback I'm just
normalize<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.590> make<00:03:53.740> it<00:03:53.860> loud<00:03:54.100> as<00:03:54.250> possible

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
normalize it to make it loud as possible

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.900 
normalize it to make it loud as possible
without<00:03:55.210> distorting<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:56.110> clipping<00:03:56.670> ok<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:57.730> if

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
without distorting on clipping ok so if

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.760 
without distorting on clipping ok so if
I<00:03:58.000> meet<00:03:58.180> out<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.510> original<00:03:58.900> pillow<00:03:59.170> we<00:03:59.380> can

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
I meet out the original pillow we can

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.340 
I meet out the original pillow we can
just<00:03:59.950> hear<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.220> copy<00:04:00.490> I<00:04:00.610> made<00:04:00.720> I'm<00:04:01.720> also<00:04:01.930> take

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
just hear the copy I made I'm also take

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.140 
just hear the copy I made I'm also take
off<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.710> first<00:04:02.950> bar<00:04:03.370> because<00:04:03.580> as<00:04:03.730> your<00:04:03.910> son's

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
off the first bar because as your son's

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:14.250 
off the first bar because as your son's
anyway<00:04:04.890> I'm<00:04:05.890> off<00:04:06.040> finish<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.550> somewhere

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.020 

you<00:04:15.099> don't<00:04:15.280> need<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.549> hear<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.849> whole<00:04:15.970> thing

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
you don't need to hear the whole thing

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.640 
you don't need to hear the whole thing
you<00:04:16.299> can<00:04:16.449> tell<00:04:16.630> me<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.750> it's<00:04:17.079> an<00:04:17.199> exact<00:04:17.470> copy

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
you can tell me that it's an exact copy

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.530 
you can tell me that it's an exact copy
so<00:04:18.459> what<00:04:18.609> we're<00:04:18.729> going<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:18.910> do<00:04:19.030> is<00:04:19.150> are<00:04:19.269> going

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
so what we're going to do is are going

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.629 
so what we're going to do is are going
to<00:04:19.600> take<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.019> razor<00:04:20.320> tool<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.340> we're<00:04:21.519> going

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
to take the razor tool and we're going

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.879 
to take the razor tool and we're going
to<00:04:21.699> slice<00:04:22.060> around<00:04:22.570> just<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.199> apartment<00:04:23.800> we

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
to slice around just the apartment we

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.850 
to slice around just the apartment we
want<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.660> again<00:04:25.660> it's<00:04:25.840> quantizing<00:04:26.680> to

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
want like that again it's quantizing to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.300 
want like that again it's quantizing to
the<00:04:27.010> bar<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:28.030> we<00:04:28.449> don't<00:04:28.630> really<00:04:28.720> need<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.310> be

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
the bar so we don't really need to be

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.129 
the bar so we don't really need to be
too<00:04:30.490> fancy<00:04:30.820> about<00:04:31.300> making<00:04:31.750> sure<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:31.960> pay

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
too fancy about making sure we pay

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.230 
too fancy about making sure we pay
careful<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.889> right<00:04:33.010> part<00:04:33.280> everything's<00:04:33.970> so

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
careful the right part everything's so

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.490 
careful the right part everything's so
easy<00:04:34.419> these<00:04:34.690> things<00:04:34.960> with<00:04:35.169> automated

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
easy these things with automated

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.170 
easy these things with automated
technology<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.639> would<00:04:36.789> have<00:04:36.880> been<00:04:36.910> so

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
technology this would have been so

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.200 
technology this would have been so
difficult<00:04:37.419> with<00:04:37.750> audio<00:04:38.080> team<00:04:38.940> alright<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:40.120> now

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
difficult with audio team alright so now

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.060 
difficult with audio team alright so now
we've<00:04:40.360> got<00:04:40.479> this<00:04:40.600> particular<00:04:40.930> part<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:42.010> the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
we've got this particular part of the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.909 
we've got this particular part of the
waveform<00:04:42.360> an<00:04:43.360> absolution<00:04:43.870> we<00:04:44.500> just<00:04:44.680> reverse

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
waveform an absolution we just reverse

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.080 
waveform an absolution we just reverse
him<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:47.190> we<00:04:48.190> don't<00:04:48.310> actually<00:04:48.520> need<00:04:48.789> to<00:04:48.910> rest

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
him and we don't actually need to rest

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.029 
him and we don't actually need to rest
at<00:04:49.270> all<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:49.780> we<00:04:49.900> can<00:04:50.050> either<00:04:50.110> meet<00:04:50.620> them<00:04:50.860> with

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
at all so we can either meet them with

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.469 
at all so we can either meet them with
the<00:04:51.130> meat<00:04:51.310> tool<00:04:51.550> or<00:04:51.760> we<00:04:51.880> can<00:04:52.030> just<00:04:52.060> take<00:04:52.330> them

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
the meat tool or we can just take them

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.560 
the meat tool or we can just take them
out<00:04:52.600> entirely<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.760> now<00:04:54.880> we've<00:04:55.000> just<00:04:55.030> got<00:04:55.240> the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
out entirely so now we've just got the

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:02.129 
out entirely so now we've just got the
part<00:04:56.169> where<00:04:56.440> interesting<00:04:56.889> with<00:04:57.250> us

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.350 

so<00:05:03.139> if<00:05:03.199> we<00:05:03.230> add<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.949> original<00:05:04.580> packing<00:05:04.910> we<00:05:05.240> now

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
so if we add the original packing we now

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:24.300 
so if we add the original packing we now
get<00:05:05.540> this<00:05:05.660> combination

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310
