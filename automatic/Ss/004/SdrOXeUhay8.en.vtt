accident or something so we'll start
from<00:00:23.400> scratch<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.180> really<00:00:24.420> easy<00:00:24.449> install

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
from scratch it's a really easy install

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
from scratch it's a really easy install
easy<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.439> yourself<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> driveway<00:00:26.189> or

easy to do yourself in the driveway or

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.370 
easy to do yourself in the driveway or
up<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> lift<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.539> makes<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> little

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
up on a lift like this makes a little

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.710 
up on a lift like this makes a little
bit<00:00:28.529> easier<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.189> they're<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> we'll

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
bit easier but they're going so we'll

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.500 
bit easier but they're going so we'll
begin<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.550> passenger<00:00:32.550> side<00:00:32.730> side<00:00:33.239> skirt

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
begin with the passenger side side skirt

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.650 
begin with the passenger side side skirt
which<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.989> clip<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:35.660> speed

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
which is going to clip in these speed

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780 
which is going to clip in these speed
clips<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> go<00:00:37.739> install<00:00:38.520> on

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
clips here are going to go install on

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
clips here are going to go install on
two<00:00:39.000> threaded<00:00:39.480> studs<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
two threaded studs that are up on the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.959 
two threaded studs that are up on the
frame<00:00:40.980> rail<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.340> body<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.760> more

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
frame rail of the body so it's more

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.220 
frame rail of the body so it's more
complicated<00:00:48.300> about<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> you've<00:00:49.110> got

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
complicated about this is you've got

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
complicated about this is you've got
this<00:00:49.410> lower<00:00:49.590> intercooler<00:00:49.950> pipe<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> way

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
this lower intercooler pipe on the way

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.910 
this lower intercooler pipe on the way
this<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> ID<00:00:51.600> parts<00:00:51.960> upgrade<00:00:52.410> intercooler

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
this is the ID parts upgrade intercooler

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
this is the ID parts upgrade intercooler
pipe<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.430> bit<00:00:53.610> bigger<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
pipe so it's a little bit bigger but the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.779 
pipe so it's a little bit bigger but the
OEM<00:00:55.020> plastic<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> same<00:00:56.039> design<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.699> we

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
OEM plastic one is the same design so we

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.510 
OEM plastic one is the same design so we
have<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.329> tab<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.070> over

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
we get it lined up we'll just wiggle

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.100 
we get it lined up we'll just wiggle
into<00:01:07.170> place<00:01:07.470> go<00:01:08.040> clip<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.750> also<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110

done and installed we're going to pick

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.460 
done and installed we're going to pick
up<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.450> ID<00:03:56.599> parts<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.049> limit<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.290> belly

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
pan install that as well the aluminum

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.960 
pan install that as well the aluminum
pan<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.590> thinner<00:04:00.799> than<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.099> OEM<00:04:01.340> plastic<00:04:01.819> pan

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
pan is thinner than the OEM plastic pan

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.130 
pan is thinner than the OEM plastic pan
it<00:04:02.090> should<00:04:02.269> be<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.360> little<00:04:02.510> bit<00:04:02.659> more<00:04:02.840> durable

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
it should be a little bit more durable

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.960 
it should be a little bit more durable
too<00:04:03.470> it's<00:04:03.860> also<00:04:03.980> cheaper<00:04:04.459> which<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.760> nice

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
too it's also cheaper which is nice

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.559 
too it's also cheaper which is nice
especially<00:04:05.180> if<00:04:05.659> you've<00:04:05.780> lost<00:04:05.959> yours<00:04:07.209> this<00:04:08.209> pan

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
especially if you've lost yours this pan

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.930 
especially if you've lost yours this pan
has<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:08.780> curve<00:04:09.110> to<00:04:09.319> it<00:04:09.349> which<00:04:09.950> actually<00:04:10.250> goes

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
has a curve to it which actually goes

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.740 
has a curve to it which actually goes
reverse<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.660> what<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.840> would<00:04:11.959> think<00:04:13.750> easiest

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
reverse of what you would think easiest

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.689 
reverse of what you would think easiest
way<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.840> start<00:04:15.140> this<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.530> catch<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:16.519> front

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
way to start this is to catch the front

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:28.029 
way to start this is to catch the front
tabs<00:04:21.490> just<00:04:22.490> like<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:27.289> then<00:04:27.680> catch<00:04:27.860> one

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
tabs just like that and then catch one

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:49.850 
tabs just like that and then catch one
of<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.190> rear<00:04:28.370> screws

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860

now<00:04:50.460> our<00:04:50.580> tricks<00:04:50.790> of<00:04:50.910> doing<00:04:51.150> this<00:04:51.270> is<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.510> get

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
now our tricks of doing this is to get

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.150 
now our tricks of doing this is to get
all<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.110> screws<00:04:52.350> in<00:04:52.530> place<00:04:52.710> but<00:04:52.920> don't

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
all the screws in place but don't

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.830 
all the screws in place but don't
tighten<00:04:53.430> them<00:04:53.700> yet<00:04:53.730> there's<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.420> little<00:04:54.660> bit<00:04:54.810> of

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
tighten them yet there's a little bit of

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.420 
tighten them yet there's a little bit of
adjusting<00:04:55.440> you'll<00:04:55.560> have<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.860> do<00:04:55.980> midway

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
adjusting you'll have to do midway

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.530 
adjusting you'll have to do midway
through<00:04:56.700> it<00:04:56.850> if<00:04:56.940> any<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.210> screws<00:04:57.420> are

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
through it if any of the screws are

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.640 
through it if any of the screws are
tightened<00:04:57.720> you'll<00:04:57.930> have<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.170> loosen<00:04:58.380> them

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
tightened you'll have to loosen them

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.080 
tightened you'll have to loosen them
again<00:04:58.860> in<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:58.980> future<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.700> get<00:04:59.820> the<00:04:59.910> thing

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
again in the future to get the thing

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.030 
again in the future to get the thing
lined<00:05:00.240> up<00:05:00.420> right<00:05:03.500> remember<00:05:04.500> those<00:05:04.650> two<00:05:04.680> in<00:05:04.950> the

lined up right remember those two in the
back<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.430> there's<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.760> three<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.180> each<00:05:06.330> side<00:05:06.680> as

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
back and there's a three on each side as

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.400 
we said a second ago we're going to
catch<00:05:09.000> all<00:05:09.300> these<00:05:09.570> screws<00:05:09.870> we're<00:05:10.140> not<00:05:10.260> going

to tighten them down though just in case

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.050 
to tighten them down though just in case
we<00:05:13.350> need<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.530> do<00:05:13.650> some<00:05:13.860> shifting<00:05:14.820> back<00:05:15.030> and

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
we need to do some shifting back and
