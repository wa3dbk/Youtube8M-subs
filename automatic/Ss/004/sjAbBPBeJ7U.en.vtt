00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.179
 toyota here in paris bets a lot on 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.420
 the hybrid as of its tradition 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.469
 presenting the new auris hybrid in two 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.670
 versions here 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:22.400
 let's see the first model let's get started right away 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.869
 entering this auris that mounts the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.609
 classic engine 1,800 cc c 136 horses 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.740
 of power 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.199
 but let's see infotainment and the bridge 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.899
 particular very vertical plank i 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:41.930
 quite good materials is a 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:43.850
 touchscreen we can see that yes 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.879
 connects via bluetooth to the mobile phone but 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.000
 not only for audio but also for data 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.559
 because it has the online function that online 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.300
 allows us to see for example the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.890
 time to where we are now or 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.340
 destination online search for 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.840
 park fuel prices 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.089
 updated in real time or see 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.860
 your emails do a search on 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.790
 google everything on this display 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.570
 about 6 and a half inch touchscreen 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.170
 for the rest we see which input of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.530
 auxiliary and for the usb here the classic ones 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.900
 modalities of all the books of toyota and the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 socket for the lighter or the current 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.210
 power 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.500
 let's see out the car let's do a 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.360
 mostly to see the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.759
 back which is the part together 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.020
 to the front that has changed the most with 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.490
 this cut of hunger the latter 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.619
 fairly large luggage compartment 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.509
 although the plan is very high 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.800
 load because it is below are housed 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.100
 batteries but I was talking about two models 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.480
 start because we have here in paris 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.040
 unfortunately in version 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.770
 unique so we can't go up not 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.430
 we can see it inside but the auris 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.110
 hybrid touring sport called the station 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.110
 wagon call it how you want 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.770
 the line remains more or less the one for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.690
 regarding design cuts 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.660
 certainly not just increases 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.320
 the habitability of the almost rear and of the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.320
 trunk
