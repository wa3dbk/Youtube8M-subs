00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.270 

so<00:00:10.660> when<00:00:10.780> we<00:00:10.900> design<00:00:11.200> one<00:00:11.620> less<00:00:11.800> we<00:00:11.950> actually

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
so when we design one less we actually

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.590 
so when we design one less we actually
thought<00:00:12.460> well<00:00:12.670> you<00:00:12.880> should<00:00:13.120> preserve<00:00:13.450> the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
thought well you should preserve the

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.829 
thought well you should preserve the
optionality<00:00:13.960> so<00:00:14.440> what<00:00:14.620> if<00:00:14.710> people<00:00:15.070> do<00:00:15.280> want<00:00:15.640> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
optionality so what if people do want to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.679 
optionality so what if people do want to
what<00:00:16.839> people<00:00:17.019> do<00:00:17.199> want<00:00:17.439> to<00:00:17.529> switch<00:00:17.830> up<00:00:18.689> that

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
what people do want to switch up that

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:20.999 
what people do want to switch up that
their<00:00:19.869> battery<00:00:20.199> pack<00:00:20.349> what<00:00:20.529> if<00:00:20.619> they<00:00:20.740> don't<00:00:20.800> if

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
their battery pack what if they don't if

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.349 
their battery pack what if they don't if
they<00:00:21.099> only<00:00:21.339> want<00:00:21.460> to<00:00:21.669> stop<00:00:21.880> for<00:00:22.089> a<00:00:22.119> short

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
they only want to stop for a short

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.290 
they only want to stop for a short
period<00:00:22.570> of<00:00:22.689> time<00:00:22.749> and<00:00:23.699> when<00:00:24.699> you<00:00:24.789> come<00:00:25.029> to<00:00:25.210> the

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
period of time and when you come to the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.029 
period of time and when you come to the
back<00:00:25.449> to<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.109> the<00:00:26.230> tesla<00:00:26.529> station<00:00:26.919> it

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
back to to the tesla station it

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.050 
back to to the tesla station it
shouldn't<00:00:27.249> be<00:00:27.310> really<00:00:27.490> cool<00:00:27.609> the<00:00:27.789> super

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
shouldn't be really cool the super

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.370 
shouldn't be really cool the super
charging<00:00:28.329> station<00:00:28.749> should<00:00:28.990> just<00:00:29.140> be<00:00:29.259> called

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
charging station should just be called

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.230 
charging station should just be called
the<00:00:29.529> tesla<00:00:29.829> station<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:31.449> have<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.900> choice<00:00:32.140> of

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
the tesla station you have the choice of

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.760 
the tesla station you have the choice of
the<00:00:34.240> supercharger<00:00:34.570> which<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.380> and<00:00:35.650> always

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
the supercharger which is and always

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.930 
the supercharger which is and always
will<00:00:35.950> be<00:00:36.010> free<00:00:36.370> or<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.710> have<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.460> chart<00:00:39.700> that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
will be free or you have the chart that

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.540 
will be free or you have the chart that
the<00:00:40.090> choice<00:00:40.300> of<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.630> battery<00:00:40.990> pack<00:00:41.170> swap<00:00:41.550> which

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
the choice of a battery pack swap which

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.310 
the choice of a battery pack swap which
is<00:00:42.730> faster<00:00:43.060> than<00:00:43.180> you<00:00:43.540> can<00:00:43.630> fill<00:00:43.810> a<00:00:43.840> gas<00:00:44.020> tank

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
is faster than you can fill a gas tank

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.250 
is faster than you can fill a gas tank
so<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:45.790> only<00:00:45.970> decision<00:00:46.210> you<00:00:46.960> need<00:00:47.080> to<00:00:47.140> make

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
so the only decision you need to make

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.680 
so the only decision you need to make
when<00:00:47.980> you<00:00:48.130> come<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.610> one<00:00:49.150> of<00:00:49.180> our<00:00:49.330> tesla

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
when you come to one of our tesla

00:00:49.690 --> 00:01:07.800 
when you come to one of our tesla
stations<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.410> do<00:00:51.370> prefer<00:00:51.850> faster<00:00:52.450> or<00:00:52.630> free

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.080 

we've<00:01:08.810> we<00:01:09.170> filled<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.500> gas<00:01:09.650> station<00:01:10.160> gas

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
we've we filled a gas station gas

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.120 
we've we filled a gas station gas
stations<00:01:11.510> on<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.750> big<00:01:11.900> screen<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.380> there's

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
stations on the big screen and there's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.710 
stations on the big screen and there's
the<00:01:13.340> Vista<00:01:13.730> battery<00:01:14.060> pack<00:01:14.210> getting<00:01:14.510> swapped

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
the Vista battery pack getting swapped

00:01:14.720 --> 00:02:10.650 
the Vista battery pack getting swapped
out<00:01:15.850> with<00:01:16.850> some<00:01:17.000> festive<00:01:17.180> lights

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.660 

so<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:11.750> have<00:02:11.840> automated<00:02:12.349> nut<00:02:12.680> runners<00:02:13.040> use<00:02:13.519> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
so we have automated nut runners use the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.009 
so we have automated nut runners use the
same<00:02:13.879> nut<00:02:14.090> runners<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.540> we<00:02:14.629> use<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
same nut runners that we use in the

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.680 
same nut runners that we use in the
factory<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.739> they<00:02:16.550> find<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.030> spot<00:02:17.300> where<00:02:17.480> the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
factory and they find the spot where the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.050 
factory and they find the spot where the
bolts<00:02:18.200> are<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.890> automatically<00:02:19.489> torque<00:02:19.879> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
bolts are and automatically torque the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.330 
bolts are and automatically torque the
bolts<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.629> exact<00:02:21.220> specification<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
bolts to the exact specification that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.820 
bolts to the exact specification that
equal<00:02:22.700> each<00:02:22.879> bulb<00:02:23.120> needs<00:02:23.390> such<00:02:24.140> it's<00:02:24.440> hooked

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
equal each bulb needs such it's hooked

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.070 
equal each bulb needs such it's hooked
to<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.160> battery<00:02:25.519> specification<00:02:26.330> every<00:02:26.870> time

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
to the battery specification every time

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:44.000 
to the battery specification every time
there's<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.379> suit<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.890> battery<00:02:28.280> pack<00:02:28.459> swamp

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.340 

yeah<00:02:45.210> looks<00:02:46.210> like<00:02:46.390> looks<00:02:46.900> like<00:02:46.960> we've<00:02:47.200> got

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
yeah looks like looks like we've got

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.710 
yeah looks like looks like we've got
some<00:02:47.560> extra<00:02:47.860> time<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:51.240> since<00:02:52.240> we've<00:02:52.390> got<00:02:52.540> some

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
some extra time so since we've got some

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.240 
some extra time so since we've got some
extra<00:02:52.810> time<00:02:53.140> let's<00:02:53.440> let's<00:02:53.710> do<00:02:53.890> another<00:02:54.010> one

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
extra time let's let's do another one

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:03.510 
extra time let's let's do another one
now<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:01.480> researched<00:03:02.110> LNA<00:03:02.710> for<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.010> fastest

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
now we researched LNA for the fastest

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.810 
now we researched LNA for the fastest
gas<00:03:03.760> station<00:03:04.240> which<00:03:04.990> is<00:03:05.020> 10<00:03:05.890> 10<00:03:06.400> gallons

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
gas station which is 10 10 gallons

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.480 
gas station which is 10 10 gallons
minute<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:11.440> we<00:03:11.620> told<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.100> hobby<00:03:12.370> er

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
minute and and we told the hobby er

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.460 
minute and and we told the hobby er
there<00:03:12.760> who's<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.210> thing<00:03:13.420> go<00:03:13.630> as<00:03:13.810> fast<00:03:14.050> as<00:03:14.290> you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
there who's the thing go as fast as you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:04:25.689 
there who's the thing go as fast as you
can

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.219 

almost<00:04:26.699> done<00:04:26.940> with<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.210> gas<00:04:27.360> station<00:04:27.810> one<00:04:28.050> was

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
almost done with the gas station one was

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:37.400 
almost done with the gas station one was
done<00:04:33.919> so<00:04:34.919> we'll<00:04:35.220> have<00:04:35.340> almost<00:04:36.060> done<00:04:36.410> getting

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
done so we'll have almost done getting

00:04:37.410 --> 00:05:01.129 
done so we'll have almost done getting
there<00:04:59.360> sorry<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.419> don't<00:05:00.479> mean<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.840> keep<00:05:01.050> you
