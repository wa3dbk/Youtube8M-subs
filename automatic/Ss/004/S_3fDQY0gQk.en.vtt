00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:09.389
 [Music] 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.279
 hello such friends welcome once 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.810
 more to a new episode where I'm going 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.880
 to teach how to do a magic trick 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.560
 sure you're going to like one that you're going to 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.869
 be able to cheat your friends and family 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.320
 very easily and that surely with this 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.180
 magic trick fall because they fall we're going to 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:01:06.400
 see him 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:01:06.400
 [Music] 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:36.040
 [Music] 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.110
 to do this magic trick the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.360
 materials that we're going to need a 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.160
 sheet of bond paper size 4 a 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.680
 cardboard of any color that you 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.940
 want a plain cardboard of size a4 that 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.040
 unlike bond paper and 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.320
 Cardboard this has a thickness of 3 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.820
 mm fabric tape this is 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.860
 very finite that like the others 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.440
 we can go to buy them at 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.000
 any store of school supplies 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.950
 besides this we will also need 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.900
 two types of glue glue 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.170
 instantaneous and one of those glues 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.670
 whites for paper let's see what 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.560
 first thing we're going to do is draw 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.020
 these figures in the cardboard for 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.600
 later to be able to cut them for their 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.069
 contour 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:20.439
 [Music] 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.250
 once done this we would stay in these 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:26.860
 two identical cardboard frames 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.960
 after the card we take out 4 pieces 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.960
 same with the following dimensions 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.989
 then we stick a piece of cardboard to 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.849
 Each cardboard frame as were 4 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.829
 pieces of cardboard we made 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.939
 should be 2 that later on they 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.939
 I will say what they are for 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.240
 once we have both parties 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.670
 of the book we can start to make the 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.710
 truncated hinges and for this we are going to 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.430
 cut three strips of fabric from the fabric 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.620
 about 12 centimeters 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.719
 after these three strips we paste them 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.380
 in the pieces that we just made such 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:24.750
 which as shown in the video 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:24.750
 [Music] 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.300
 and 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.590
 yes 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.590
 [Music] 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.080
 Now what we are going to do is the part 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.090
 that will hide the currency and for this 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.830
 let's cut out two squares with the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.830
 dimensions that you are seeing on screen 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.720
 then we are going to divide each one of 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.730
 these squares in nine squares more 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.310
 small as we start from a square 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.110
 large 9 x 9 cm the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.150
 smaller squares are going to be left 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.569
 3 x 3 centimeters 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.670
 [Music] 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.409
 then we are going to fold the for these 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.680
 lines until you can reduce them to 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.780
 3 x 3 centimeters squares 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.609
 well now what we are going to do is paste 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.769
 these paper boxes to the tape of 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.070
 which fabric such as you can see 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.070
 continuation 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.440
 Now what we are going to do is unite the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.000
 two covers of the book and for this 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.280
 let's paste the only strip of the 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.530
 Cover right above the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.300
 cover on the left this we're going to 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.050
 do so that the two covers us 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.759
 look good together then we give you the 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.949
 back to the book and the two strips of the 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.229
 cover on the left we went through 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.180
 under the cover on the right and 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:05:04.449
 we paste them once more taking care that the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:05:06.160
 two covers fit well together if 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.670
 we get to be left over from the 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.370
 tape as nothing simply we cut them 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.520
 Y 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.520
 ah 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.050
 then we are going to paste the cards that 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.030
 they had left us and we are going to use them 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.130
 covers to cover all these tapes that 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.780
 we are left on the cover of the book if 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.790
 you want they can leave it like this but 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.700
 in my opinion I do not like it so we're going to 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:51.049
 put those caps 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:51.049
 [Music] 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.719
 Y 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.909
 sure at this point of the video you know 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.740
 how it works and it's because it 's very simple 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.899
 although at the beginning of the video I do not 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.819
 it seems this book can be opened from 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:07.189
 two shapes thanks to its hinges 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.869
 tricked and it is at this point where it is 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:10.939
 the trick we can choose what 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:14.059
 compartment show the one that contains 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:15.619
 the currency that is empty good friends 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:17.629
 this has been all I hope you have 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:19.039
 liked the video if you liked already know 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:21.710
 that they can let me know by giving 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.839
 like favorites by sharing it with your 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.729
