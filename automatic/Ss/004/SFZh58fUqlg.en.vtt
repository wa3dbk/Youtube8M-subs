00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.160 
so like I said that squeaky noises
coming<00:04:01.890> from<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.210> VL<00:04:03.210> compressor<00:04:03.690> down<00:04:03.959> that

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
coming from the VL compressor down that

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.870 
coming from the VL compressor down that
I<00:04:04.200> need<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.590> change<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.100> clutch<00:04:05.340> went<00:04:05.610> out<00:04:05.730> on

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
I need to change the clutch went out on

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.030 
I need to change the clutch went out on
as<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.270> can<00:04:06.420> see<00:04:06.540> it's<00:04:06.690> not<00:04:06.810> spinning<00:04:07.709> right

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
as you can see it's not spinning right

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.760 
as you can see it's not spinning right
so<00:04:08.370> making<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.450> noise<00:04:09.600> but<00:04:10.020> otherwise<00:04:10.319> that

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
so making that noise but otherwise that

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.830 
so making that noise but otherwise that
the<00:04:10.800> car<00:04:11.100> is<00:04:11.220> super<00:04:11.430> quiet<00:04:11.760> I'll<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.600> another

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
video once I get that big and then here

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.370

rotors<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.180> got<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.480> UH

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
rotors I got the UH

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.860 
rotors I got the UH
s500<00:04:25.950> lights<00:04:26.130> on<00:04:26.400> here<00:04:26.760> let<00:04:27.450> me<00:04:27.480> give<00:04:27.750> me<00:04:27.810> a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
s500 lights on here let me give me a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.600 
s500 lights on here let me give me a
second<00:04:28.290> I'll<00:04:28.410> crank<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.160> put<00:04:29.340> lights

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
second I'll crank that up and put lights

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:37.020 
second I'll crank that up and put lights
on

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.390 

so<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.690> can<00:04:37.900> see

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.400 

you<00:04:40.850> can't<00:04:41.120> see<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.479> but<00:04:41.630> that<00:04:41.810> is<00:04:41.990> flashing

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
you can't see it but that is flashing

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.980 
you can't see it but that is flashing
not<00:04:43.130> nighttime<00:04:43.639> with<00:04:43.910> its<00:04:44.060> flashing<00:04:44.300> that's

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
not nighttime with its flashing that's

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.589 
not nighttime with its flashing that's
the<00:04:45.169> turn<00:04:45.380> signal

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
the turn signal

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.799 
the turn signal
and<00:04:47.869> then<00:04:48.429> I'll<00:04:49.429> put<00:04:49.699> my<00:04:49.849> foot<00:04:50.089> on<00:04:50.149> the<00:04:50.270> gas<00:04:50.360> so

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:50.809 
and then I'll put my foot on the gas so

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:59.750 
and then I'll put my foot on the gas so
you<00:04:50.839> can<00:04:51.080> hear<00:04:51.379> hear<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.009> motor

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.610 

so<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.390> car<00:05:00.600> is<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.050> very<00:05:01.290> healthy<00:05:01.680> condition

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
so the car is in very healthy condition

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.750 
so the car is in very healthy condition
I'm<00:05:04.620> going<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.010> try<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.190> let<00:05:05.370> this<00:05:05.520> go<00:05:05.730> for

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
I'm going to try to let this go for

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.390 
I'm going to try to let this go for
about<00:05:06.090> eight<00:05:06.690> grand<00:05:06.870> like<00:05:07.650> I<00:05:07.770> said<00:05:07.980> I've

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.350 
about eight grand like I said I've
invested<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.090> lot<00:05:09.270> into<00:05:09.480> it<00:05:09.810> probably<00:05:10.770> did<00:05:11.360> at

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
invested a lot into it probably did at

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.710 
invested a lot into it probably did at
least<00:05:12.720> since<00:05:13.230> I<00:05:13.410> got<00:05:13.650> at<00:05:13.800> least<00:05:14.600> $7,000<00:05:15.600> worth

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
least since I got at least $7,000 worth

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.260 
least since I got at least $7,000 worth
of<00:05:15.900> work<00:05:16.520> seven<00:05:17.520> or<00:05:17.610> eight<00:05:17.700> thousand<00:05:18.060> dollars

of work seven or eight thousand dollars
worth<00:05:18.420> of<00:05:18.540> work<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:18.930> it's<00:05:19.080> definitely<00:05:19.500> worth
