and T there's nothing you can do there
is<00:00:02.700> no<00:00:03.000> gap<00:00:03.240> so<00:00:03.959> if<00:00:04.020> you<00:00:04.170> block<00:00:04.380> afford<00:00:04.740> one<00:00:04.950> you

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
is no gap so if you block afford one you

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.089 
is no gap so if you block afford one you

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
are guessing 5050 so here we go and that

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.270 
it's the frame advantage if you back
dash<00:03:14.300> get<00:03:14.750> hit<00:03:14.930> if<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.290> jump<00:03:15.560> out<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.709> get<00:03:16.069> hit

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
dash get hit if you jump out to get hit

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.250 
dash get hit if you jump out to get hit
your<00:03:16.730> only<00:03:16.970> options<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.690> wake<00:03:17.840> up<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.080> facts

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
your only options to wake up the facts

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.800 
your only options to wake up the facts
so<00:03:18.410> it's<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.620> really<00:03:18.920> strong<00:03:19.370> anti<00:03:20.269> delayed

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
so it's a really strong anti delayed

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.360 
so it's a really strong anti delayed
wake<00:03:20.959> them<00:03:21.080> set<00:03:21.320> up<00:03:21.350> interesting<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.340> think

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
wake them set up interesting and I think

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.560 
wake them set up interesting and I think
that's<00:03:22.700> one<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.970> big<00:03:23.180> things<00:03:23.209> in<00:03:23.510> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
that's one of the big things in the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.940 
that's one of the big things in the
future<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:23.959> this<00:03:24.019> game<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.560> lot<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.830> people

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
future in this game that a lot of people

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.040 
future in this game that a lot of people
say<00:03:25.250> wake<00:03:25.430> up<00:03:25.459> attacks<00:03:25.850> aren't<00:03:26.060> good<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.750> it

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
say wake up attacks aren't good and it

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.570 
say wake up attacks aren't good and it
would<00:03:27.140> extent<00:03:27.500> their<00:03:27.709> kind<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.190> right<00:03:28.370> that's

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
would extent their kind of right that's

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.460 
would extent their kind of right that's
a<00:03:28.640> late<00:03:28.790> way<00:03:28.910> could<00:03:29.090> be<00:03:29.120> super<00:03:29.870> super<00:03:30.019> strong

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
a late way could be super super strong

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.870 
a late way could be super super strong
right<00:03:30.769> so<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.160> think<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.370> lot<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.640> top

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
right so I think a lot of the top

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.160 
right so I think a lot of the top
players<00:03:32.060> are<00:03:32.330> going<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.510> come<00:03:32.630> up<00:03:32.720> with<00:03:32.750> setups

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
players are going to come up with setups

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.360 
players are going to come up with setups
I<00:03:33.260> know<00:03:33.350> Tom<00:03:33.620> Brady<00:03:33.830> was<00:03:33.980> talking<00:03:34.220> about

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
I know Tom Brady was talking about

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.210 
I know Tom Brady was talking about
earlier<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.850> he<00:03:34.940> has<00:03:35.120> some<00:03:35.360> with<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.600> clone

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
earlier that he has some with the clone

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.530 
earlier that he has some with the clone
I'm<00:03:37.220> sure<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.610> lot<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:37.970> top<00:03:38.150> guys<00:03:38.180> are

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
I'm sure a lot of the top guys are

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.030 
I'm sure a lot of the top guys are
coming<00:03:38.750> with<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.930> inside<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.590> late<00:03:39.709> wake<00:03:39.890> up

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
coming with the inside the late wake up

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.949
