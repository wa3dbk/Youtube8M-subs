00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
the extender right here the tube

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.209 
the extender right here the tube
extender

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219

has a 17 millimeter whole round ball on
them<00:02:07.609> and<00:02:07.939> what<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.630> not<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.929> do<00:02:09.080> is<00:02:09.319> to

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
them and what that is not to do is to

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.550 
them and what that is not to do is to
basically<00:02:10.039> fashion<00:02:11.020> just<00:02:12.020> like<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.380> now

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
basically fashion just like that now

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.080 
basically fashion just like that now
they<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.710> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
they have the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.759 
they have the
holder's<00:02:14.390> right<00:02:14.599> here<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.410> I'll<00:02:15.530> show<00:02:15.560> you

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
holder's right here and I'll show you

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.229 
holder's right here and I'll show you
basically<00:02:16.069> how<00:02:16.190> this<00:02:16.370> works<00:02:16.550> okay<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:17.030> is

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
basically how this works okay this is

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.640 
basically how this works okay this is
the<00:02:17.599> first<00:02:17.810> thing<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.019> need<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.379> is<00:02:18.500> just

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the first thing you need to do is just

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.770 
the first thing you need to do is just
kind<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.830> put<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.129> little<00:02:19.370> ring<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
kind of put this little ring on the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.770 
kind of put this little ring on the
shaft<00:02:21.050> alright<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.099> then<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:23.150> put<00:02:23.690> your

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
shaft alright and then you just put your

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.240 
shaft alright and then you just put your
cradle<00:02:24.200> right<00:02:24.349> here<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.739> shaft<00:02:24.980> you

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
cradle right here on the shaft you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.190 
cradle right here on the shaft you
tighten<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.580> down<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:29.330> there's<00:02:29.660> your<00:02:29.810> RAM

tighten it down and there's your RAM
mounting<00:02:30.500> cradle<00:02:30.769> now<00:02:30.860> what<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.549> this

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
mounting cradle now what we have on this

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.690 
mounting cradle now what we have on this
is<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.410> amps<00:02:33.410> for<00:02:34.840> mount<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.400> basically

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
is a amps for mount and it's basically

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.970 
is a amps for mount and it's basically
it's<00:02:37.940> going<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.330> attach<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.629> any<00:02:39.110> Ram<00:02:39.620> mounting

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
it's going to attach to any Ram mounting

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.369 
it's going to attach to any Ram mounting
cradle<00:02:40.310> next<00:02:40.910> we<00:02:41.000> take<00:02:41.180> our<00:02:41.299> GPS<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:42.019> is<00:02:42.230> the
