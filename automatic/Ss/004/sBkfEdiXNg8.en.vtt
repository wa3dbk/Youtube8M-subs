00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
emeralds anyway is an npc village so I'm

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.870 
emeralds anyway is an npc village so I'm
guessing<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.590> our<00:03:13.680> next<00:03:14.070> location<00:03:14.520> is<00:03:14.610> gonna

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
guessing that our next location is gonna

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.030 
guessing that our next location is gonna
be<00:03:15.030> an<00:03:15.120> NPC<00:03:15.540> village<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.050> know<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:16.440> let's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
be an NPC village so you know what let's

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.700 
be an NPC village so you know what let's
do<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.630> okay<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.780> looks<00:03:18.990> like<00:03:19.080> we've<00:03:19.410> found

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
do this okay it looks like we've found

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.350 
do this okay it looks like we've found
the<00:03:19.920> village<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:20.400> must<00:03:20.730> be<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> right<00:03:21.150> one

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
the village this must be the right one

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.480 
the village this must be the right one
we've<00:03:21.540> got<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> black<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.590> green<00:03:22.860> skull<00:03:23.340> and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
we've got the black and green skull and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.760 
we've got the black and green skull and
crossbones<00:03:24.030> here<00:03:24.300> but<00:03:24.480> weirdly<00:03:24.810> where<00:03:25.650> are

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
crossbones here but weirdly where are

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.550 
crossbones here but weirdly where are
all<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.040> villagers<00:03:26.520> this<00:03:27.270> is<00:03:27.480> awfully<00:03:27.690> spooky

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
all the villagers this is awfully spooky

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.200 
all the villagers this is awfully spooky
stuff<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.220> yeah<00:03:29.370> I'm<00:03:29.520> thinking<00:03:30.030> that

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
stuff so yeah I'm thinking that

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.270 
stuff so yeah I'm thinking that
hopefully<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.050> next<00:03:31.470> clue<00:03:31.740> will<00:03:32.040> be

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
hopefully the next clue will be

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.130 
hopefully the next clue will be
somewhere<00:03:32.850> in<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.270> village<00:03:33.540> I'm<00:03:33.870> guessing

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
somewhere in this village I'm guessing

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.360 
somewhere in this village I'm guessing

think we should take a look at this
modern<00:05:11.429> a<00:05:11.519> little<00:05:11.789> bit<00:05:11.909> more<00:05:12.089> detailed<00:05:12.509> just

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:12.689

really really cool little mod we're

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.359 
really really cool little mod we're
basically<00:05:18.839> what<00:05:18.989> happens<00:05:19.379> is<00:05:19.559> when<00:05:19.769> you<00:05:19.800> die
