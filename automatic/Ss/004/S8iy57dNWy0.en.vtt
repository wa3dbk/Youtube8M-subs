 Minutito the onion at a certain volume with 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.049
 salt pepper the onion and to the base of the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.500
 tortilla to give it the flavor it has to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.869
 be livianita not so much oil we cover it 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.340
 so you do not miss the juice 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.650
 reserve 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.720
 while the onion is there with its 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.720
 cooking let's beat the eggs 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.430
 with mate 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.810
 clearest 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.100
 not even a minute 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.100
 ah 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.870
 after this we add 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.870
 very small carrot zucchini italian 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.070
 ordering by all 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.869
 mix 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.799
 the eggs do not forget egg 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.610
 Italian pumpkin carrot look what 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.610
 cute colors 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.770
 and with this we are going to remove the children 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.899
 also eat vegetables why 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.369
 we are fighting campaigning for 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.369
 lower the overweight we have 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.520
 in a resource 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.250
 things of minutes if you do not 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.860
 left lunch or dinner at night and have 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.480
 prepared true can be with some 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.650
 chicken breasts 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.650
 a very salt 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.590
 now let's see our onion 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.590
 Cow 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.890
 is practically ready to talk to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.890
 we 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.399
 in the same pan as we 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.810
 we prepare the onions 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.810
 once we clean 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.100
 let's give it a few drops of oil 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:32.230
 and diameter do not reach two pounds 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.390
 we put a little oil 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.159
 I'm going to give you a secret that I have to 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.560
 although the Teflon pan is very good 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.290
 quality 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.739
 I finally put a pinch of salt in the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.739
 background 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.900
 that is so that they do not stick 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.330
 food now we mix our 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.990
 onion 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.420
 cabbage 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:01.050
 the ingredient that we have already here with 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.050
 eggs true carrot morrÃ³n 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.040
 It is also important to ensure that 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.050
 follow the tortilla added as 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.190
 true kitchen secret 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.730
 a half teaspoon of raw flour 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.880
 and a pinch of imperial baking 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.990
 of baking powder the background 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.990
 here we go now 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.260
 tortilla 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:52.720
 well cooked 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.720
 important for a little more gas 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.100
 for the edges 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.709
 they make up the first layer 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.650
 if we want we can 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.600
 You can also cover it so that 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.989
 cooking is called quality or simply 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.989
 we leave it 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.980
 if you want to vary the shortening for
