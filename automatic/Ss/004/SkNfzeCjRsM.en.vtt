00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.620
 February 3 , 2015 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.320
 is another milestone for the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.390
 aeronautics Brazil date the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.300
 kc-390 made the inaugural flight created by 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.630
 embraer for the Brazilian Air Force to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.490
 aircraft is the largest ever developed and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 manufactured in the country 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.070
 it is a historic and historic day 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.230
 by technology that Brazil has conquered 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 and the air force also our future 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.270
 will be brilliant with this airplane. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.270
 waiting the flight lasted an hour and 19 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.390
 minutes and happened on a rural area 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.750
 Around the Embraer Factory in Hawk 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 peixoto in the interior of sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.989
 crew was composed of two pilots 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.020
 and two Embraer engineers. 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.449
 the plane behaved very well and was 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.070
 quiet avion continues with sensor 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.360
 solo that were already happening them 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.909
 continue to run parallel to the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.270
 campaign in flight and we start 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.640
 the single campaign which is a mixed 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.740
 development and then certification 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.150
 more or less two years with the two 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.119
 prototypes of the second being 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.070
 and the one who already has the contract 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.479
 signed in May of last year provides 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.100
 delivery of 28 units kc-390 along 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.680
 12 years 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.930
 the first will be delivered to the force 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.720
 in 2016 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.320
 in fact we speak whenever kc 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 390 that will replace the c 130 cajias 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.750
 at 30 and will not replace will take a lot 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.270
 more missions far more ability than 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.759
 the castings in 30 and adding this 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.829
 technology of the highest quality 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.790
 we are seeing here today 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.860
 besides Brazil kc 390 already has 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.259
 prospects of operating in other countries 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.960
 the project counts on the participation of 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.380
 argentina of portugal and the republic 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.380
 Czech
