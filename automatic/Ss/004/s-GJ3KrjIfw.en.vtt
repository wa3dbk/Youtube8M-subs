00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
advanced lightning which is pretty

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.200 
advanced lightning which is pretty

as you can see if you play it it's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.709 
as you can see if you play it it's
frozen<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.780> time<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.609> do<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.120> what's

up that it's pretty gay i mean once

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.770 
up that it's pretty gay i mean once
lightning<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.409> cannot<00:01:07.770> move<00:01:08.090> but<00:01:09.090> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
you can see it can move which is pretty

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.300 
you can see it can move which is pretty
cool<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.580> guy<00:01:26.970> anymore<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> um

and<00:02:08.330> now<00:02:09.330> go<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.599> your<00:02:09.690> first<00:02:09.959> frame<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and now go to your first frame and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.520 
and now go to your first frame and
clicked<00:02:10.890> evolution<00:02:11.520> button

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
clicked evolution button

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.510 
clicked evolution button
and<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:13.040> at<00:02:13.190> zero<00:02:13.220> wats<00:02:13.730> frame<00:02:14.090> put<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.510> one

and it's at zero wats frame put that one

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.199 
and it's at zero wats frame put that one
and<00:02:16.870> now<00:02:17.870> we're<00:02:18.140> going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.290> make<00:02:18.530> go<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.209> effect

now from the first frame the phase

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.470 
now from the first frame the phase
should<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.030> stopwatch<00:02:35.680> 0<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.920> first<00:02:37.130> frame

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480

negative 2 on the last frame so let me

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.050 
negative 2 on the last frame so let me
show<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.870> what<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.620> far<00:02:43.060> it's

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
show you what you have so far it's

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.060 
show you what you have so far it's
pretty<00:02:44.300> sweet<00:02:45.130> but<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.310> will<00:02:46.400> be<00:02:48.040> much<00:02:49.040> better

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
pretty sweet but it will be much better

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.759 
pretty sweet but it will be much better
I<00:02:49.459> promise<00:02:49.550> with<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.380> when<00:02:51.380> we're<00:02:51.590> finished

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
I promise with that when we're finished

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.479 
I promise with that when we're finished
now<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:53.209> can<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:53.720> make<00:02:54.110> them<00:02:54.459> adjustment<00:02:55.459> here

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
now I can just make them adjustment here

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.770 
now I can just make them adjustment here
that's<00:02:56.480> 120<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:57.410> do<00:02:57.470> 115<00:02:58.310> instead<00:03:01.780> okay

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
that's 120 and I do 115 instead okay

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.960 
that's 120 and I do 115 instead okay
cool<00:03:04.060> now<00:03:05.470> I'm<00:03:06.470> going<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.880> go<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:09.400> layer<00:03:10.400> new

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
cool now I'm going to go to a layer new

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.729 
cool now I'm going to go to a layer new
adjustment<00:03:11.209> layer<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.810> now<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.709> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
adjustment layer and now this is the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.970 
adjustment layer and now this is the
just<00:03:16.310> my<00:03:16.459> lair<00:03:16.670> with<00:03:17.390> all<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.840> same<00:03:18.620> effects

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
just my lair with all the same effects

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.610 
just my lair with all the same effects
so<00:03:19.730> might<00:03:20.000> slow<00:03:20.540> your<00:03:20.750> computer<00:03:20.780> down<00:03:21.230> just<00:03:21.500> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
so might slow your computer down just a
