00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.540
 I was looking for the nest and looked over 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.390
 effort in him and such in fact in Japan the

 a game that has created many controversies and 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.639
 is the target of many theories and more precocious 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.860
 probably the most cohesive theory and 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.319
 most famous of greatest fears is to acquire 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.360
