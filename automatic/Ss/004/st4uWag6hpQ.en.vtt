00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
chance what I didn't realize was those

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.470 
chance what I didn't realize was those
were<00:02:19.220> going<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.430> be<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.670> two<00:02:19.849> toughest

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
to have it at eight hundred I thought

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.599

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
handed it off the way to me I thought if

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.530
