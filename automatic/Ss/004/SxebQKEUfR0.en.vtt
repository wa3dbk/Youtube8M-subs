00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.190

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
only hope but it appears Hot Toys has

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
only hope but it appears Hot Toys has
added<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> bonus<00:01:16.740> potted<00:01:17.189> Groot<00:01:17.490> figure<00:01:17.939> or

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
added the bonus potted Groot figure or

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.469 
added the bonus potted Groot figure or
you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.439> piece<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.400> 2-pack<00:01:21.150> set

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you know little piece to the 2-pack set

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.840 
you know little piece to the 2-pack set
so<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> would<00:01:22.650> imagine<00:01:22.830> most<00:01:23.070> people<00:01:23.580> would<00:01:23.759> be

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
so I would imagine most people would be

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.660 
so I would imagine most people would be
ordering<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.299> 2-pack<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:24.960> Rocket<00:01:25.320> Raccoon

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
ordering the 2-pack with Rocket Raccoon

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.429 
ordering the 2-pack with Rocket Raccoon
so<00:01:26.670> since<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.659> obviously<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> have

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so since you know obviously have to have

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.460 
so since you know obviously have to have
both<00:01:28.710> figures<00:01:29.659> but<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> meantime<00:01:31.049> this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
both figures but in the meantime this

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.429 
both figures but in the meantime this
will<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:33.030> Groot<00:01:33.270> figure<00:01:33.659> until<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.320> get
