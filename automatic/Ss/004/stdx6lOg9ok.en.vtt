00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.940
 in this recipe I want to teach you 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.740
 prepare a chicken burger that 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.689
 although of course it's not like the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.730
 famous hamburger that we all know 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.340
 from the burger restaurant chain 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.590
 king is great and we can 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.590
 prepare at home the day we want 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.540
 let's start by putting in a 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.090
 container the minced meat can be 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.150
 chicken turkey and chicken just like this is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.130
 we add a little salt and 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.130
 abundant freshly ground black pepper 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.820
 and mix it a little bit so that it goes 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.900
 taking the meat the taste of salt and 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.240
 of the pepper 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.510
 and for half a kilo of meat we're going to 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.970
 take about 125 grams of 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.620
 cream cheese and now we are going to give 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.540
 well of turns until we have it 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.790
 all well mixed 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.390
 when you have it ready let's go 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.160
 all the meat on a baking paper os 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 I recommend that you have it a bit 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.620
 baking paper to me the truth is that with 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.450
 the rush to record the video I missed 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.300
 when you have all the meat thrown at you 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.010
 you put another paper on it and I tell you what 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.340
 same as before try also 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.890
 grease it a little crush it a 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 tiny with the palm of your hand with a 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.650
 stretching roller until the meat 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.570
 let about one centimeter of thickness 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.430
 when you have it ready we are going to 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.260
 take to the freezer to cool down a 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.630
 little and then we can cut it with 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.490
 ease and to put it in the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.670
 freezer the best thing is that you put it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.670
 on a tray 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.770
 and have them about 30 minutes with that 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.259
 time will be more than enough for 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.140
 the meat cools and we can do better 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.689
 shape of the hamburgers when they have 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.420
 After 30 minutes, remove the meat from the 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.330
 freezer and to give it the typical shape 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 of these hamburgers take a paper and 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.039
 taking as a reference the bread making a 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.989
 small template and support it on the 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.090
 meat and marking the little one with a 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.459
 pen and then know where the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.800
 we need to cut that stay on for a 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.780
 little marked enough to be careful of 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.930
 that you do not key the pen inside the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.970
 meat although you equal from there 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.769
 from your house you do not see it well 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.380
 From here I see perfectly the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.120
 brands that I'm doing mark the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.970
 number of hamburgers that you need 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.310
 with these measures or they go between 4 and 5 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.850
 burgers when you have them 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.100
 go cutting all with a scissors and is 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.260
 just as the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.510
 cuts cut out all the paper and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.000
 you put them in a bowl and with this we are going to 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.190
 prepare some delicious chicken nuggets and 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.620
 the hamburgers you put them back 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.100
 and we're going to take them to the freezer 40 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.100
 minutes 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.230
 and while we take the opportunity to go 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.910
 preparing the batter in a dish or 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.430
 in a container that is a bit 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.830
 lengthened put 4 tablespoons of 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.840
 flour a handful of salt that more or 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.670
 less will come to be with a teaspoon 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.560
 little 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.560
 a little piece of dye 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.810
 and we're going to put it back pretty 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.140
 freshly ground black pepper 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.940
 mix it is a little bit with the rods 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.250
 and we are going to add the siphon to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.900
 squirts if you will not find siphon 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.540
 You can also do it with beer 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.209
 You throw some siphon and we remove with 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.400
 the rod and we return again to take 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.069
 siphon it 's better that you do it 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.379
 so that you do not pass because you 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.540
 It has to be a very thick texture 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.849
 how are you seeing here and when the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.150
 so you can add the egg 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.980
 and beat again when you've finished 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.930
 mix all this you will have the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.920
 batter ready to make our 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.920
 Chicken Burgers 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.980
 and before you start frying the meat 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.440
 we are going to anoint all the loaves with a 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.319
 little bit of margarine and put them on 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.420
 toast on a griddle or a pan 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.560
 remove the meat from the burgers 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.570
 freezer and put to heat the oil 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 you remove the paper and you can already 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.560
 put in the batter 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.230
 and let it be well impregnated 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.450
 batter on both sides 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.080
 and as soon as the oil is hot and 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.150
 You can start frying them, let them 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.340
 they cool you like a couple of minutes for each 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.530
 side to procure what has the oil 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.570
 too hot if you are not going to 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.390
 burn out and they will do us good by 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.640
 inside when they are well golden 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.710
 take them out to a plate with plenty of paper 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.400
 absorbent fry the rest of the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.199
 burgers in the same way 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.930
 the fact of putting the meat in the 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.300
 freezer the second time is for the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.460
 meat stay hard and you can 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.169
 handle more easily and with heat 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.110
 of the lights, the truth is that 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.139
 defrosted right away and some m deformed 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.060
 and put it in the pan and the meat of the 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.940
 cuts to take advantage of to make 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.740
 chicken nuggets with the same batter and 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.840
 we can start to assemble our 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.880
 burgers 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.400
 The first thing we are going to do is to be a 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.860
 such the loaves with a little mayonnaise 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.889
 we put the hamburger on the part 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.430
 from below the bread after we put some 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.320
 pieces of lettuce on top and almost 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.180
 that we have it ready only we have left 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.880
 put the top of the bread 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.070
 to eat them well warm you can 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.860
 put half a minute in the microwave each 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.840
 one then until the recipe has arrived 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.910
 today I hope you encourage yourself to prepare 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.310
 these rich burgers and let me leave
