I<00:03:52.650> think<00:03:52.950> as<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.070> spectacle<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.730> game<00:03:53.880> itself

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
I think as a spectacle the game itself

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.820 
I think as a spectacle the game itself
was<00:03:54.420> wonderful<00:03:54.840> before<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.500> game<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.680> were

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
was wonderful before the game you were

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.860 
was wonderful before the game you were
full<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.070> trepidation<00:03:56.460> but<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:56.880> mean<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.150> was<00:03:57.270> it

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
full of trepidation but I mean it was it

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.720 
full of trepidation but I mean it was it
was<00:03:57.990> wonderful<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.710> respectable<00:03:59.220> what

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
was wonderful and of respectable what

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.370 
was wonderful and of respectable what
about<00:03:59.910> Steven<00:04:00.060> Jeremy<00:04:00.540> intimated<00:04:01.110> there<00:04:01.260> that

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
about Steven Jeremy intimated there that

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.690 
about Steven Jeremy intimated there that
perhaps<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.830> could<00:04:01.980> swing<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.280> for<00:04:02.520> this

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
perhaps this could swing it for this

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.800 
perhaps this could swing it for this
could<00:04:02.880> be<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.030> thing<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.210> keeps<00:04:03.510> him<00:04:03.630> there

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
could be the thing that keeps him there

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.840 
could be the thing that keeps him there
but<00:04:03.900> perhaps<00:04:04.140> only<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.980> they<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.310> get<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.700> some

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
but perhaps only if they do get you some

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
but perhaps only if they do get you some
evening<00:04:06.090> next<00:04:06.120> season<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.600> would<00:04:06.720> be<00:04:06.840> a

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
evening next season that would be a

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.570 
evening next season that would be a
factor<00:04:07.230> wouldn't<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.530> well<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.040> mean<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.250> think

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
factor wouldn't it well I mean I think

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.220 
factor wouldn't it well I mean I think
it'll<00:04:08.910> take<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> brave<00:04:09.390> man<00:04:09.600> not<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:09.900> not<00:04:10.140> to

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
it'll take a brave man not so not to

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.750 
it'll take a brave man not so not to
allow<00:04:10.410> them<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.680> defend<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.070> salty<00:04:11.400> next<00:04:11.640> year

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
allow them to defend the salty next year

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.640 
allow them to defend the salty next year
