00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.570
 It was a really tough fight brutal 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.070
 The fight should be tough 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.970
 survive and they have that really good 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.970
 made are far gone and it has indeed 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.349
 No funds did not give any chances 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.860
 I believe only when no eckball says 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.079
 and form addressed halftime but two 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.220
 better the hair does not have us 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.550
 liked that they play along 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.960
 wanted and that was how it was for us 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.730
 we first problem with the with the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.920
 tactics of which we are the right ones 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.120
 have found medium and I think in 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.420
 the second has have much better 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.010
 made 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.649
 There was much better inside plays once 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.890
 a lot more diagonal balls in the balls 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.859
 played deep and that was thinking 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.660
 important point, which of course not 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.390
 The goal was planned that was not 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.030
 so we played out locked 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.080
 that was a misunderstanding 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.790
 behind what actually clean sheet to 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.490
 and of course that has ours 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.620
 task is complicated is therefore Aachen 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.530
 no blind team believe that 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.340
 have had a lot of bad luck 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.200
 RenÃ© van eck upstairs arrives in such a way 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.549
 stadium with such fans may there 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.530
 not really romp and untenrum 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.329
 really has to go up and has 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.200
 actually in my eyes not 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.270
 to look for the coach 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.030
 if you are at the level of the game you 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.009
 Are you thinking football is here? 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.540
 announced but I believe where eight 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.439
 now they are in there they only have to 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.540
 fold and fight 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.909
 I think so, I think so 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.280
 even today it was proof that 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.979
 many teams already and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.549
 take it very seriously and that the whole 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.799
 clearly to play against us that's it 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.439
 make life difficult yes every game is 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.100
 of course different and dortmund is fighting over 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.770
 to survive 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.200
 they are at the very back and so will be 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.170
 very difficult game but I hoped 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.270
 The stadium is getting full and busy 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.039
 audience back in the back I think that 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.310
 In any case, we raushauen everything 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.310
 turn
