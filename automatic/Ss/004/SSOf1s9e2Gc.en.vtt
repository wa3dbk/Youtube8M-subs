00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 now let's imagine such a situation in 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.660
 grandmothers have stolen a purse from a grandmother where 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.210
 some young people started to write glasses 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.210
 up on the street well or what person became 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.630
 bad on the street you'd fit help think 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.850
 Well , you should be sure of it 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.740
 you were generally in such situations in 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.420
 such situations did not turn out to think 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 my fate would not let go 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.430
 attention but it seems to me that everyone says so 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.010
 no one ask everyone will say of course how 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.890
 I will not help but of course I ’ll come but 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.540
 as the experiment showed everything passes 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 by 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.020
 what experiment is still about what we know 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.059
 racamakafo project 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.950
 where are two young people specifically 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.649
 act out life situations on the street 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.719
 in front of passers-by and shoot it on 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.660
 hidden camera and watch the reaction 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.489
 people before heard about such a trinity so here 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.469
 war gripe our young people the same rule 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.199
 such a social experiment and what 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.539
 let's see the result while filming 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.190
 35 people passed this video 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.390
 only five of them stopped and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.010
 offered their help 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.350
 such a social experiment on 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
 youth slang called prank what with 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.400
 Latin means leprosy is an invention 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.170
 prank joke and really at the beginning 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.090
 programs called only telephone 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.770
 draw but today u in the meaning of this 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.630
 words come in and social experiments 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.369
 through which you can learn how people 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.159
 will respond to certain 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.710
 life situations this idea you do not have 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.369
 by other people on this they filmed in 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.619
 other city 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.990
 I wanted to see what would happen in our 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.850
 city ​​where they live their surroundings 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.939
 After all, this place can be any 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.280
 man that is even our relative and 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.540
 see what could happen to him 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 there are people so remain indifferent 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.640
 pass by it scary well is it that in 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 city soldier a lot of people pass 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.689
 by not ready to help it 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.720
 Of course it is very sad and sad but 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.159
 I hope that with my 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.990
 further experiments people will 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.799
 watch and a little change their not measures 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.799

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.560
 9 min 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.360
