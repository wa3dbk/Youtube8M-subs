00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
at so that we had to go a little bit

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.110 
at so that we had to go a little bit
farther<00:04:59.060> back<00:04:59.419> into<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.900> range<00:05:01.030> it's<00:05:02.030> a

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
farther back into the range it's a

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.060 
farther back into the range it's a
little<00:05:02.330> bit<00:05:02.510> tricky<00:05:03.110> from<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:03.470> hele<00:05:03.650> trying

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
little bit tricky from the hele trying

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.580 
little bit tricky from the hele trying
to<00:05:04.160> look<00:05:04.340> at<00:05:04.490> things<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:05.030> realize<00:05:05.930> how<00:05:06.140> big

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
to look at things and realize how big

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.310 
to look at things and realize how big
they<00:05:06.830> might<00:05:07.070> actually<00:05:07.280> be<00:05:07.669> or<00:05:07.910> how<00:05:08.090> how<00:05:08.960> gnarly

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
they might actually be or how how gnarly

they might actually be or how how gnarly
you<00:05:09.860> know<00:05:09.950> this<00:05:10.990> theme<00:05:11.990> park<00:05:12.440> ride

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.570 

but<00:05:17.479> on<00:05:17.689> I<00:05:17.990> think<00:05:18.229> we<00:05:18.379> did<00:05:19.099> a<00:05:19.129> pretty<00:05:19.370> good<00:05:19.520> job

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
but on I think we did a pretty good job

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.909 
but on I think we did a pretty good job
and<00:05:20.089> found<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.449> wide<00:05:20.689> variety<00:05:20.960> of<00:05:21.379> terrain<00:05:21.740> de

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
and found a wide variety of terrain de

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:39.980 
and found a wide variety of terrain de
ski<00:05:22.219> so<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:23.180> definitely<00:05:23.509> stoked<00:05:23.839> on<00:05:24.050> it

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.659 

being<00:05:40.990> up<00:05:41.199> here<00:05:41.410> coming<00:05:41.830> into<00:05:42.009> this<00:05:42.100> trip<00:05:42.490> I

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
being up here coming into this trip I

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.610 
being up here coming into this trip I
just<00:05:42.699> I<00:05:43.120> was<00:05:43.389> really<00:05:43.690> trying<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.139> keep<00:05:44.350> an<00:05:44.470> open

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
just I was really trying to keep an open

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.409 
just I was really trying to keep an open
mind<00:05:44.949> and<00:05:45.310> hopefully<00:05:45.699> just<00:05:45.910> learn<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.150> lot

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
mind and hopefully just learn a lot

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.390 
mind and hopefully just learn a lot
because<00:05:46.720> I<00:05:46.930> think<00:05:46.990> you<00:05:47.199> got<00:05:47.319> to<00:05:47.440> be<00:05:47.560> patient

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
because I think you got to be patient

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.189 
because I think you got to be patient
with<00:05:48.699> these<00:05:48.910> mountains<00:05:49.419> and<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:50.080> know

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
with these mountains and you know

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.980 
with these mountains and you know
adapting<00:05:50.830> to<00:05:50.860> them<00:05:51.130> is<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.580> think<00:05:52.120> one<00:05:52.810> of<00:05:52.840> the

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
adapting to them is I think one of the

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.980 
adapting to them is I think one of the
most<00:05:53.830> challenging<00:05:53.919> but<00:05:54.729> most<00:05:55.120> rewarding

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
most challenging but most rewarding

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.600 
most challenging but most rewarding
things<00:05:56.229> you<00:05:56.380> can<00:05:56.530> do<00:05:56.650> with<00:05:56.800> your<00:05:56.860> skiing<00:05:57.280> I

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
things you can do with your skiing I

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.430 
things you can do with your skiing I
don't<00:05:58.000> know<00:05:58.060> for<00:05:58.240> me<00:05:58.389> I<00:05:58.419> want<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.870> do<00:05:58.990> different
