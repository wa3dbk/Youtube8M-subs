00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.419
 Welcome to our 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.930
 press conference after the home game against 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.790
 bayer leverkusen welcome the guests 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.410
 leverkusen the traveling journalists 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.000
 the representatives of the club and then the wife 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.639
 schmidt has to be a statement about the game 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.859
 ask 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.539
 yes of course I am satisfied with what 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.800
 my team here today on the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.830
 I have shown that we have shown space 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.720
 have made a great game eleven 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.189
 against eleven very clear chances 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.260
 unfortunately they did not play 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.930
 have used and then after the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.850
 yellow-red card 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.579
 also in the second half after 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.210
 acted in front have been very safe 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.680
 have a lot of passion behind 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.870
 Once the shortfall is done and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.430
 within nevertheless always good ones 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.469
 ball profits had switched quickly 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.270
 scored to the rear 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.710
 actually allowed nothing 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.120
 I think that's a lot better 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.890
 not outnumbered play a bit 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.960
 of course it is annoying that we 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.030
 not having rewarded us with music me 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.309
 believe it was the team 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.420
 absolutely earned but still experienced 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.670
 we of course with a very good one 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.990
 Feelings here because we two weeks ago 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.990
 similar situations had in wolfsburg 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.850
 of course a little earlier 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.670
 and I did not agree 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.890
 with what we played then 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.909
 we did not believe in content 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.259
 our game also outnumbered 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.939
 we have that through today 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.820
 be made that if 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.580
 nor a situation occurs, the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.780
 Of course as soon then in the forest quasi 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 at the next away game again 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.290
 Of course, that's not the case 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.670
 but still it was in the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.320
 old good sign content today 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.600
 another face in such a situation too 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.890
 show if you think about that with us 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.930
 was still playing with it another 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.700
 drive and who but the weather 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.280
 then implement something then find 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 I'm just a very good sign 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 from my team 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.820
 That's why we were still in very good condition 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.439
 Thank you thank you very much 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.610
 plenty are spreadable should be like the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.610
 balance of the game fails 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.020
 leverkusen was very strong today like mine 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.020
 colleague said it was very correct 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.240
 but we do not have as yet the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.190
 situation as of the last home game as 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.710
 without getting so much nosebleed 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.420
 has that mike frantz circulation problems 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.630
 he also had to go out and the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.120
 team has given everything but you 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.860
 was after the yellow-red card then 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.860
 simply in terms of strength not able 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.110
 leverkusen so that they more 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.540
 come under pressure 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.650
 we did that today but we did 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.830
 yes have the last two games 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.430
 experienced something we have everything 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.180
 given 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.100
 herter insane pressure and against 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.110
 Hope home given everything and then with 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.140
 the experiences the free zone team 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.250
 need relatively inexperienced team 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.440
 overall or boy if he then 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.750
 such things can not be put away 100 percent 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.390
 but you just have to leverage express 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.890
 was then individual when you saw 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.330
 how they duel one against one 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.570
 deny and so bellarabi that is supposed to 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.880
 is already exceptional class before 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.220
 He has a very good goalkeeper himself 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.050
 It is a pity that you decimated then 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.890
 will yet but we have the 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:31.290
 put away and have been lucky today 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:35.989
 I have to say but to peace 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.610
 and at least thank you very much 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.530
 Thank you very much from your side 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.050
 ask the two coaches mico 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.459
 please use a short question 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.630
 have played in the lead for a long time today 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.430
 your team in the hot 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.840
 Temperatures now on Wednesday is already 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.950
 again english week champions league 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.370
 how exhausting is that for her 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.370
 team 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.250
 also played on Wednesday and had one 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.740
 played a few English weeks and when 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.910
 if that's just always in terms of strength 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.080
 we would not be able to handle it 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.430
 not that correct for me today 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.530
 can play as we have played in 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.820
 and then you know that the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.340
 team physically in a very good 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.450
 state is of course is important now 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.700
 would be a bit more time now 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.380
 that's really very nice on wednesday 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.880
 to conscientiously regenerate the 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.190
 to make things fuller again so we can 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.440
 every Wednesday a very important game 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.260
 at home that was of course absolutely necessary 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.270
 Just win again in a good one 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.610
 constitution and there it is now 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.160
 but basically I believe that's true 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.480
 in all three four days so location 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.730
 it's also something we play 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.560
 of course, take out of the game today 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.280
 that you always your situation that is 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:48.240
 where continue to implement 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.980
 Other questions are not the case 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.180
 Wish the guests well out in there 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.180
 a nice weekend bye
