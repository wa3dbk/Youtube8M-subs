00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.290
 specialized training for 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.509
 future drivers 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 the professionals now that are 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.760
 entering the labor market 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.340
 I'm thinking that today I started the marcelo 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 there emerged unscathed marcelo him through it 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 of the videos was not like the one that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.109
 we are doing here 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.800
 He sought help here, or these classes. 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.790
 Okay, you noticed the differential one 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 week 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.379
 The moment you arrived and realized 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.329
 all this work what 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.219
 represented to you how was the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 reception that was all yours 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.199
 commitment will now come to this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.480
 time 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:01.829
 I learned things I want to know is motor or 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:04.619
 is the dashboard panel 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.409
 you have category b already for some time 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.260
 nor if a time has come to reach the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.070
 Big river was not a truck truck 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.700
 and you have realized that it is really 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.820
 and I realized that there was a lack of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.630
 something else 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.850
 know the engine with a brake and electric 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.780
 I did not know you think 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:37.049
 the school is prepared to 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 professional basic nontoxic beacon no 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.860
 It's that wonder, that 's where the professional has. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.259
 who turn around in the thirties can see 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.270
 get someone who does not have it either 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.450
 And you do not have to get your car straightened out. 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.610
 they do not have a sign with the day of 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.479
 teach your professional that here it is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 our main commitment is not to 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:07.870
 What do you think about the didactics of 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:11.260
 all work was to understand things 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.520
 it is now non-technical which one or 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:21.900
 three systems even though you have learned the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:24.190
 cooling system and the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.670
 student went to neda 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.280
 so we came here it was learned 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.920
 in these three classes in rondÃ´nia 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.230

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:47.650

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:52.240
 equal and if not let your goal 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.850
 is to test the company now 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.710
