 suzuki italia sales manager 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.640
 good time because in January it will be already 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.259
 here are its strengths 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.449
 yes you said well finally why 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.769
 we too have waited so long 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.290
 like our passionate customers 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.110
 so we finally have it and how 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.269
 you said it will go on sale in January so 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.320
 from mid-January across the entire network 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.840
 official suzuki indicative price we are 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.910
 around 12.500 but let's talk now a 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.579
 also of the contents, therefore a motorcycle 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.190
 which focuses a lot on lightness with 228 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.579
 kg at full load as all nikon 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.440
 liquids and the gasoline plane a chassis 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.449
 aluminum is perhaps not possible in 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.820
 aluminum in itself with radial connection 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.259
 adjustable front fork in the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.160
 preload and all others 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.020
 let's say so regulations studied bags 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.910
 specifically for the bike then 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.700
 easily attached one removable 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.959
 wide range of accessories designed 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.170
 together with the fashionable tip 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.490
 aluminum plastic ferrule arrows a 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.010
 led therefore a whole series of accessories 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.080
 that go a little bit to 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.110
 we say yes to complete what is the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.380
 the motorcycle the characteristics of the engine 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.630
 that already known for its say 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.850
 the duo is a perfect tourist destination 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.230
 thousand can you tell us something more about the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.240
 engine we are on the 101 horses therefore with 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.120
 a very good couple and the media i 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.070
 maximum 103 newton meters available from 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.770
 immediately then around 4,500 rpm 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.320
 already available then promises 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.610
 great credibility great reliability 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.520
 of course against that you can 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.800
 distinguish brands suzuki lightness and 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.330
 therefore easy to handle 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.970
 drive on all occasions for 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.619
 conclude the speech suzuki eicma us 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.870
 we have already presented the new babies 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.890
 burgman we want to mention a moment 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.420
 their contents 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.950
 yes we say this was a bit last 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.650
 piece that was lacking in renewal 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.780
 of the range in the burgman range therefore 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.280
 after the burgman 650 renewed the year 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.720
 last is a redesign of the boom 400 there was 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.670
 need to renew even a little bit 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.430
 and younger siblings then the burgman 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.950
 125 and 200 completely revised 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.590
 in aesthetics they aim as usual at su 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.230
 a great comfort a large capacity of 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.270
 load this year with a whole line 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.459
 much new much closer 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.030
 racy and more elegant in my opinion 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.840
 remain at the top for consumption 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.040
 we declare 34.4 km per liter for the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.380
 burgman 125 and over 30 km per liter per 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.850
 the burgman 200 both models 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.850
 they will be the serious bsd
