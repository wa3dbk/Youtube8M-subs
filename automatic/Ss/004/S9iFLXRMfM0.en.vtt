00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
those KD 58 couplers we're talking about

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.459 
those KD 58 couplers we're talking about
number<00:02:04.590> 58<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.520> there's<00:02:05.729> also<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.420> coupler<00:02:07.229> cut

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469

basically on the prototype it's for

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.289 
basically on the prototype it's for
these<00:02:16.590> are<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.799> ease<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.040> taking<00:02:17.730> apart<00:02:18.180> the

we've also got the very fine printing

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.899 
we've also got the very fine printing
the<00:03:00.959> under<00:03:01.290> magnification<00:03:01.470> comes<00:03:02.430> out<00:03:02.609> clear

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
the under magnification comes out clear

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.030 
the under magnification comes out clear
I've<00:03:03.120> tested<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.569> myself<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.560> printing<00:03:04.919> is

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
I've tested it myself the printing is

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.129 
I've tested it myself the printing is
precise<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:06.239> stuff<00:03:06.510> that's<00:03:06.689> large<00:03:06.900> enough<00:03:06.959> to

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
precise the stuff that's large enough to

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.080 
precise the stuff that's large enough to
see<00:03:07.409> without<00:03:07.530> magnification<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.519> clear<00:03:08.819> and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
see without magnification is clear and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.039 
see without magnification is clear and
the<00:03:09.269> stuff<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:10.139> you<00:03:10.290> aku<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.919> see<00:03:11.129> in<00:03:12.049> a

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
the stuff that you aku can see in a

the stuff that you aku can see in a
magnifying<00:03:13.709> glass<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:14.189> clear<00:03:14.489> even<00:03:14.519> though

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
magnifying glass is clear even though

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.089 
magnifying glass is clear even though
it's<00:03:15.090> very<00:03:15.180> tiny<00:03:15.840> print<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.669> to<00:03:18.030> scale<00:03:18.359> and

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
it's very tiny print it is to scale and

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.520 
it's very tiny print it is to scale and
very<00:03:20.099> well<00:03:20.430> done<00:03:20.639> let's<00:03:21.449> flip<00:03:22.139> it<00:03:22.290> over<00:03:22.379> and

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
very well done let's flip it over and

look at the bottom detail here we've got

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.949 
look at the bottom detail here we've got

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
wheel sets and if you can see here on

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.050 
wheel sets and if you can see here on
the<00:03:35.310> prototype<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.239> axles<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:37.819> colored<00:03:38.819> and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
the prototype the axles are colored and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.930 
the prototype the axles are colored and
on<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.049> model<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:41.040> axles<00:03:41.430> are<00:03:41.549> coloured<00:03:41.819> as

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
on this model the axles are coloured as

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.780 
on this model the axles are coloured as
well<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.530> was<00:03:43.680> done<00:03:43.889> correctly<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.579> all

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
well so that was done correctly in all

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.430 
well so that was done correctly in all
the<00:03:44.970> air<00:03:45.120> lines<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.629> things<00:03:45.750> under<00:03:46.260> there

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
the air lines and things under there

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.399 
the air lines and things under there
were<00:03:46.620> done<00:03:46.799> very<00:03:47.430> well<00:03:47.639> also<00:03:47.849> this<00:03:48.810> car<00:03:49.079> run<00:03:49.290> is

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
were done very well also this car run is

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.969 
were done very well also this car run is
extremely<00:03:49.859> smooth<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:51.169> like<00:03:52.169> I<00:03:52.349> said<00:03:52.409> it

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
extremely smooth and like I said it

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:57.199 
extremely smooth and like I said it
comes<00:03:53.549> in<00:03:53.729> 48<00:03:54.209> different<00:03:55.549> Road<00:03:56.549> numbers<00:03:56.939> from

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
comes in 48 different Road numbers from

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.849 
comes in 48 different Road numbers from
two<00:03:57.419> different<00:03:57.750> phases<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.439> phases<00:03:58.620> are

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
two different phases the phases are

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.170 
two different phases the phases are
going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.069> be<00:03:59.189> released<00:03:59.519> at<00:03:59.699> different<00:03:59.970> times

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
going to be released at different times

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.780 
going to be released at different times
but<00:04:00.479> this<00:04:00.659> phase<00:04:01.409> that's<00:04:01.739> currently<00:04:02.129> on<00:04:02.250> its

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
but this phase that's currently on its

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.159 
but this phase that's currently on its
way<00:04:02.939> the<00:04:03.090> shelves<00:04:03.479> should<00:04:03.720> be<00:04:03.810> there<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.079> the

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
way the shelves should be there in the

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.330 
way the shelves should be there in the
next<00:04:04.409> three<00:04:04.590> or<00:04:04.620> four<00:04:04.859> weeks

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
next three or four weeks

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.969
