00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello everyone today i will show you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.040
 how I dive 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.060
 your plants and very small containers 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.220
 branch container dishes of the approach is not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.859
 face and stalked celery 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.050
 I liked it because they did not 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.960
 need very few plants grow 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.510
 it is very normal here even everything is neat 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.390
 all clean they don't suffer it don't see 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.910
 what do not shout it turned out such I them 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.760
 exactly twenty eight thirty 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.000
 days it turns out these are such pumping 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.450
 Benefit the land that you would long ago 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 recommended and super avito i like 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.850
 on a trip to our tree added 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.850
 these are possible 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.730
 Well, as you all know, fill a glass 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:09.160
 thin not to the top but exactly half 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.080
 the capacity is a little bit so slightly 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.250
 we tamp with a foot and pay attention 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.240
 I didn't water 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.930
 a solution and pin 3 drops of water on the floor 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.380
 glasses of cooled boiled water 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.050
 why 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.230
 baked to decompose chlorine why 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.400
 necessarily hot because open 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.920
 this is the name of you who is made based 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.740
 oils are not acids need to get 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.130
 good at all such a ministry when 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.920
 here it makes of steel in the sun will 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.490
 wet I mean under the covers of all 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.340
 there will be enough plants 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.360
 stimulating substances spoon gently 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.940
 ordinary baby food 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.700
 take out the whole piece completely 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.770
 celery celery optional 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.340
 one to plant further voids fill 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.530
 on foot these two can be a handful of steaks 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.310
 but not necessarily one judge afterwards 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.840
 when you put a little on his place 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.310
 Pro older it can be a little bit 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.260
 it was easy and if it wasnâ€™t 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.200
 suffers petiole grows very good 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.880
 quick is good at ping after 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.800
 as a prison and rammed the words a little bit 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.720
 emulator from evil 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.440
 lightly sprinkled the earth to and so that was not 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.540
 crusts 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.420
 to 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.159
 In general, you know that there was no 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.680
 finish so that it is not overdone 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.060
 Vlad after all will 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.150
 pick a plant 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.700
 I make a good nutrient solution 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.930
 I have been using 50 miles for a long time and do not recognize 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.260
 I claim a liter of water 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.420
 I hire you such a pallet of this solution 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.379
 I put all these tapes 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.530
 they fill up with some water 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.870
 the method of communicating vessels soil 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.730
 it gets all wet and i cleaned and 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.599
 the plant is already uncoated 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.760
 the depth of the room 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.620
 to light such a plant is not enough 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.049
 got into this there are floors for two or three days 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.780
 there stands after this I take them closer to 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.939
 the sun and closer to the window sill 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.220
 to reduce the temperature in order to 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.519
 celery stalk very janette and 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.480
 minute samples let's say so but for that 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.500
 to complete 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.100
 there is no such light spray 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.240
 just take off the plants 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.090
 interesting option 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.690
 I looked by the way, too, at some 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.490
 women I liked single 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.890
 containers of plants in general then 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.580
 it turns out no worse than when 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.550
 we plant 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.030
 from strong right here thanks for 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.030
 Attention
