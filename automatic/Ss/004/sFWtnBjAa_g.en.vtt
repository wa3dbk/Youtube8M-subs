 minecraft and this is sometimes going to be a 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.509
 small tutorial on how to make a 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.020
 catapult and well this did not explain 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.939
 our subscriber gorliz squash ok in 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.590
 the truth will be reform if it is the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.630
 only one that has done it but then the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.860
 truth I did not know less sir and 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.920
 well let's urge what is 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.930
 tnt repeaters obviously in what 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.480
 It would be redstone in good material 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.850
 we are going to need a sand one this nothing 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.550
 more with water gun works a button and a 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.960
 normal piston ok let's go to 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.770
 start doing 9 ok not the squares 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.620
 456 789 very well 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.650
 here so in a straight line and in the last 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.260
 in which we cut another five to one 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.270
 two three four and five 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.170
 there is perfect now the next 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.540
 step is the bucket of water or winnowing and going 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.700
 to stay here one before here we go to 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.250
 put our piston and looking towards 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.350
 up goes pretty well let's start 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.940
 to fill with redstone except the first 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.890
 milestone where the water is all that is 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.110
 the current we go back to fast until 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.380
 here the last one and now if the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.320
 repeaters we go with the one here two and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.899
 three important that three be and we're going to 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.020
 separate them with the three legs open 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.729
 ok until the fourth time and we're going to 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.399
 keep filling it from remaining a little 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.200
 nothing else these two and now we are going to do 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.390
 with the repeaters we're going to grab and what 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.290
 let's put it back here like this and the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.840
 let's open all again ok 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.240
 and I repeat this invention taught me 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.479
 our subscriber squash goal 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.850
 very good very good invention as you see here 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.790
 he put here this is going to be where 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.040
 let's leave our button put ok 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.880
 here we are going to be one of sand this is 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.459
 important ok and now what comes is 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.599
 the energy that we were going to put tnt in 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.040
 all this up here except in the 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.040
 current that the current we are going to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.690
 leave everything normal here as you see is not 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.250
 our vote with the legs make sure 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.200
 that everything is open so that 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.600
 work perfect and make sure you bring 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.780
 an important diamond armor 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.730
 because if you can not die so 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.069
 activates the camera gives 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.069
 good look how they see uy 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.659
 wow 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.250
 well that's the human catapult and the 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.140
 You've already seen that it flies 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.349
 can use it for various things 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.349
 cool and every time we need another 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.599
 catapult more then we can put another and 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.000
 Well, we are going again filling everything 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.300
 comrades and now we are going to make you a 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.370
 I invented with him 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.700
 so that they see more behind as it looks 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.120
 and take as you see it looks pretty nice 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.040
 including the cube of even me look 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.140
 I think it could work if we 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.260
 we put ourselves here so I did not try 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.110
 but because we do not try it they have 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.629
 wrong here right here is very good 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.120
 and how it covers I'll grab you a 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.890
 little water comrades are have 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.050
 well there it is very good to see active the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.460
 activates the camera gives activated 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.680
 live the carnal 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.390
 In the channel 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.240

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.200
 had the web and the button active 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.200
 with the button 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:58.950
 active active active active active 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.190
 very well let's see if it works with 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.709
 this see how they look also works 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.260
 pretty good and good with this we have 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.629
