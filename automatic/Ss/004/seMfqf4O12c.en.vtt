00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Servus people welcome to the fitness tv 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.859
 my name is raffael and today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.339
 I like you the food of the times 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.260
 week ago 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.420
 this time it's broccoli, that's me 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.219
 Why would you have broccoli so well 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 What is it for ingredients in itself 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.320
 and why it helps us to build muscle 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.320
 and fat-reducing support you go 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 Let's start with the ingredients of 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.390
 broccoli 100 grams of broccoli have around the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.620
 28 calories that's not very much and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.330
 Accordingly actually hump 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.920
 really very good as a food 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.080
 during a diet when you lose weight 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.180
 would like to have another 100 grams 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.880
 broccoli around the three grams of carbs 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.790
 three grams of fiber and three to 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.800
 three and a half grams of protein and that counts 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.170
 yes broccoli to the vegetables the one 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.120
 have high levels of protein 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 Fat is also a little bit broccoli 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.300
 but the value is so low 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.000
 that he is not really to call 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.830
 the remaining 90 percent in broccoli 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 So, water is really a lot 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.809
 very high water content of about 90 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.180
 percent that is special about broccoli 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.920
 that's a mineral bomb is that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.930
 green vegetables are packed with 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.630
 should be mentioned mineral materials important 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 there potassium calcium phosphorus iron and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.010
 zinc is especially the value of potassium 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.080
 very high in broccoli and potassium 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.450
 is needed for the water balance 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.880
 Regulating in our body as well excites 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.310
 it 's easy synthesis and potassium 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 also necessary yes for various enzymes in 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.890
 the carbohydrate metabolism in transit 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.119
 bring 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.219
 furthermore, we also have important ones 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.899
 to name vitamins in groups 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.149
 there are vitamin c also in a very 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.490
 very high value and of course that too 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.130
 provitamin a better known as carotene 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 but not only they have vitamin b2 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.259
 b6 and vitamin e contained in bruck ii 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.799
 are also very important vitamins 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.820
 our body needed to function 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.710
 other important ingredients of the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.509
 These secondary plant substances bleed 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.490
 and these are also in the very high 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.020
 amounts in green vegetables contain 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.479
 call for wrought and the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.280
 glucosinolates and these have one 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.140
 especially positive effect on ours 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.969
 human body in particular for 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.340
 for example, you reduce the risk of cancer 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.020
 enormous and they also help with one 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.060
 Cancer is something you have 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.130
 Found that if you look at this 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.130
 secondary crop and supplies 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.680
 cancer can it yes healing process 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.420
 or the destruction of cancer cells 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.550
 little improve 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.720
 also for muscle building is suitable 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.160
 really good and that hump 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.170
 due to its relatively high 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.020
 protein content for a vegetable you have to 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.090
 of course, say of three grams 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.670
 100 grams seen and to be green 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.650
 carbohydrate content of also 3 grams 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.750
 reduced to 100 grams thereby suitable 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.220
 Be very good as a food while 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.230
 a diet for example during a 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.670
 low carb diet but not only that too 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.820
 the high proportion of the mentioned 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.020
 minerals and vitamins and 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.760
 antioxidant stuff is really great 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.980
 very good and provides our body with 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.510
 all important nutrients he 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.760
 Of course, ours explicitly needs ours 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.530
 musculature and accordingly suitable 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.100
 google is really very good 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.720
 food for muscle building and 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.920
 broccoli is a fitness vegetable otherwise 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.140
 you can not be humble if 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.150
 I even like the fitness vegetables par excellence 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.130
 and of course because of all of it 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.600
 nutrients which in itself carries it because 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.610
 These have a positive effect 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.770
 the human body explicitly on the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.570
 musculature that of course all people 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.060
 the muscle structure should be of interest 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.440
 You want to be able to operate level but 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.940
 also cooked that consume it no 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.220
 problem or you can not the google 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.660
 eat completely solid so the leaves 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.060
 the sausages and of course the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.180
 Stands now a tip on the edge of the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.130
 best the broccoli steam food or 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.750
 lightly fry you should broccoli 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.490
 Do not expose yourself to heat for too long 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.530
 because then all the healthy ones go 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.810
 substances in it are the antioxidant substances 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.340
 the cancer by hand carcinogenic substances 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.140
 then get lost and that must 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.000
 Of course I do not really like being 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.490
 from you know brokkoli fans 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.020
 you like broccoli because I'm not 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.340
 so the broccoli fell that is mine now 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.750
 here at the research to the video 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.290
 I do not eat so often 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.970
 broccoli 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.320
 although I actually taste quite good 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.350
 Now I want to know how you know 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.270
 is it you gladly broccoli it 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.300
 You do not like broccoli the first 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.350
 broccoli to meat or to travel 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.360
 The comments would be burning 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.250
 interested and of course, too 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.480
 the suggestion for the next video which 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.910
 I should eat food next week 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.350
 which should i analyze 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.820
 Write below in the comments 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.500
 that we are very, very good 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.669
 then I have fabric again for 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.470
 the next issue 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.030
 otherwise it was that visited me 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.040
 facebook at www.facebook.com 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.169
 slash in fitness dvds lay there 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.550
 on the pinboard what we see 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.550
 our days are pure
