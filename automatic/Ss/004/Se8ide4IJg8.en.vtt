00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 beat the video is beautiful so there I 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.620
 will leave the mario kart 8 because 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.030
 now there are numbers to mario 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.190
 kart before the hasty and now 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.389
 is that these eighths here then I 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.000
 not going to take the problem is that 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.270
 I take a character and I am 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.170
 forced to take a vehicle 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.939
 normally I take so and kong 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.390
 but here he has a bike and I do not like them 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.680
 motorcycles so I composed since they do 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.760
 the same weight 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.440
 so the problem is we're in 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.410
 balance per cubic centimeter so we have 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.950
 not really we can play you know 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.550
 like that then that I hate the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.550
 game is super beautiful 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.410
 so after 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.760
 what is new compared 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.210
 to the other mario kart and I did at that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.250
 gun departure missed it in hd if we had not 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.030
 never will the hd sensor 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.590
 the game is super fluid 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.940
 we can play at 402 and big 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.950
 this attack that was not 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.600
 frankly now cars 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.040
 can become hovercraft it does not 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.050
 useless 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.050
 except maybe to roll on the walls 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.680
 but OK 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 the game the game is super cool it happens to me 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.340
 to have played with the good friends 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.509
 we can play five cups then with 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.140
 this one in bank 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.140
 24 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 me when I discovered the sonic 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.409
 sonic racing was released with the wiiu g 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.740
 and russell awesome to play 1.5 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.060
 racing games on the same console and I 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.200
 thought because you were going to do the same 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.200
 thing and after so no 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.000
 it's also I tell myself at the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.159
 shell of two hours is super good 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.159
 does it sucks 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.830
 on demand hurricanes 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.540
 good we make everything is great 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.840
 buy it all as long as the mountain 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.840
 was
