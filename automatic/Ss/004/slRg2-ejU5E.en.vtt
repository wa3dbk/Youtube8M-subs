 kneading if necessary we pour flour 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.630
 so the dough we prepared it is not 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.390
 sticks to hands 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.420
 while we put it right in the bowl 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.140
 cover with a towel and prepare 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.220
 stuffing 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.100
 i use mashed potatoes 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.060
 seasoned fry I roast onions in 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.100
 large amounts of vegetable oil 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.680
 mix 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.250
 potato and set aside now 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.250
 let's start working with the dough I'm all dough 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.040
 divided into three parts and the third often 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.590
 I roll into a layer pay attention to 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.570
 one that the eye should not be very thin 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.570
 because the dough will still be torn 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:03:13.410
 and cut out 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:16.630
 equally circles and proceed 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.530
 the formation of dumplings in each circle 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.140
 lay out 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.350
 about a teaspoon or half a teaspoon 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.720
 spoons as it will 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.510
 stuffing and wem edge 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.930
 I decided to make a figure edge you will see 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.510
 guta 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.630
 you can do as you like and 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.380
 so we close the edges at this time with us 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.870
 water is already a large pot which 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.420
 we bring to the boil here are prepared 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.310
 dumplings expect when the water boils and 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.859
 so the first batch we have ready 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.870
 send dumplings in salted water 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.870
 expect when they come up it goes 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.859
 literally two minutes and dumplings can 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.859
 were getting 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.500
 I do a little dumplings with a skimmer 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.069
 so they do not stick to the bottom 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.799
 that's literally one to two minutes and our 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.500
 potato dumplings ready to take out 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.630
 skimmer and send a large number 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.810
 vegetable oil with onion optional 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.449
 can fill with creamy dumplings 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.580
 Stir in butter and sour cream to 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.970
 dumplings were completely covered 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.090
 vegetable oil and serve to the table and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.000
 so the dish we got very tasty 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.360
 since the dough is not hard very soft and 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.360
 gently 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.509
