00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.130
 so be it that the man goes there 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.469
 free transfer to the bavaria and aaron 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.900
 hunt just leaves us on a free transfer 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.580
 the situation sometimes arise 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 no impact for this season 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 what effects it will have for the next one 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.060
 I can not say yet if 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.519
 a player like aaron hunt at the age of 27 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 again, this looks in the contract 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.640
 really much is in it then I think 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.559
 then it is part of the football profession 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 and I have to accept that too 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.469
 do not believe that it is lacking 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 esteem to his club 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.149
 he grew up with 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.760
 I do not think so, but I appreciate that 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.050
 not when I was here last summer 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.480
 So I started that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.980
 impression that I do not have the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.820
 Appreciation enjoys the due 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.309
 his can 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 maybe I would have to enjoy and have 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.270
 I always try to clearly try 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.710
 make it as important as he is and I believe 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.409
 that's what people are looking at 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.689
 This year also honors that work 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.180
 the season always for the team 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.920
 has used 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 many kilometers went for us 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.400
 has brought crucial points also with 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 and I have the bremer audience now 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 with so much flair know landed 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 nine months 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.320
 I can not imagine 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.020
 that somebody just because of that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.430
 that a player at 27 just now 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.409
 once I decide what else to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.900
 do that just now flat rate 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.150
 I can now criticized by the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.079
 bremer audience at all 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.689
 we have after the seventh day of play 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.060
 between ours the relegation place 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.490
 had five points difference who after 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.040
 17th matchday between our 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.530
 relegation place five points difference 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.180
 would have been after the 27th 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.540
 play day between ours 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.149
 relegation place five points difference 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.320
 whether these five points differ 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.759
 threateningly safe or whatever 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.799
 always that has to value your caution 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.530
 We have always said for us as 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.270
 we 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.800
 we have a difficult season 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.040
 until the last day of the game around every point 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.530
 have to fight hard and the situation 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.870
 it was only three points 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.280
 there were eight points in the middle hitting 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.660
 I believe in these five points 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.819
 the table place we owned the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.420
 corresponds to our services and so on 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.020
 We also go into this game on 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.020
 sunday in hanover 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.810
 The requirements are, I believe 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.209
 relatively the same table anyway 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.080
 Last two games also have both 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:45.940
 both games lost and therefore 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.360
 all of us might have an interesting game 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.360
 to have
