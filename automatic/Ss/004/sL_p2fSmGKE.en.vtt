a<00:00:22.320> loss<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.769> him<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.160> think<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.359> flaw<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.930> was

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
a loss on him I think the flaw of it was

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.990 
a loss on him I think the flaw of it was
I<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.560> made<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.769> too<00:00:26.279> much<00:00:26.430> grain<00:00:26.760> down

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
I think I made that too much grain down

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.220 
I think I made that too much grain down
there<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.699> think<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.510> wasn't<00:00:30.990> wide

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
there and I think that wasn't wide

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.630 
there and I think that wasn't wide
enough<00:00:31.260> oh<00:00:33.440> no<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.680> he's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> pretty<00:00:35.489> good

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
enough oh no I think he's a pretty good

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
enough oh no I think he's a pretty good
