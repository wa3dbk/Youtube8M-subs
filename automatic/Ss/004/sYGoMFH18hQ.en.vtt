00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.350
 that all the people around the world 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.030
 welcome to is a bird guide and in 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.960
 this time we are going to see our raccoon 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.650
 Favourite 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.050
 Rocket Good Roque is the character that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.330
 flag in this last tournament that comes 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.999
 being raccoon this map chi minh the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.579
 planet hardware that is like a colony 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:23.999
 abandoned for the mentally ill and therefore 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:27.269
 the pets that were there gave them 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:29.159
 enough intelligence to be able to be 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.919
 as smart as a human being and 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:34.500
 apart you can walk on two legs the idea 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.079
 to do this was that the character's 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.640
 characters that did this to him that were 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.699
 several types of animals not only the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 raccoon there were also toads had 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:49.230
 horses until rabbits is that they were the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.010
 guardians of those on the thrones of the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.840
 internal and then rocks came being the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.000
 security chief 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.380
 later on when all that kind of 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.540
 saga where he was the head of security 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.410
 ends join the guardians of the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.410
 galaxy good rocket your skills 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.080
 because they are those of a normal raccoon is a 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.180
 raccoon of human intelligence that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.200
 because it's been a sense of touch 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.710
 as a higher sense of smell and therefore 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.520
 that's an expert pilot and it's also 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.340
 an excellent shooter 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.049
 now talking about what has been what 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.299
 that is in the game good this 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.500
 character is special is very different to 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.380
 any other character his passive 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.300
 that is easy trigger is that it joins the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.210
 Sequential attacks or counterattacks of 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.340
 another ally what are these 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.650
 good for example captain america that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.620
 he makes counterattacks when he is beaten 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.410
 or for example ecuador war machine 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.050
 gives more than one attack the second attack 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.490
 but he does it with the first skill 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.680
 banking 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.070
 that the first attack is important 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.729
 punk good bank creates pain which 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.399
 increases the damage received by 8% then 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.009
 somehow you can reach 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.870
 use as some pretty strategy 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.049
 elaborated 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.879
 then what we have to know 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.799
 also of this character is that all 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.769
 that skill is a quick action like 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.980
 can see fast action then so 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.980
 It would seem absurd not good when this 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.980
 character starts the game starts with 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.239
 three ammunition cells and instead of 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.260
 raise the stamina you can increase 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.290
 three more the ammunition cells but 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.560
 the top is being in 105 for example 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.960
 it is updated one used three and 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.540
 five ammunition then 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.569
 you can decide to start and throw three 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.510
 times bank 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.290
 the enemy is going to have this pain for 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.969
 three and is 24 percent more damage 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.329
 as fast fractions after 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.739
 use once go and two kill you 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.060
 because that way I would use all three or 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.030
 you just start with the bread one bank 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.080
 and you could see what else 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.110
 we can see its base of states is this 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.800
 normally in attack and precision lacks 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.360
 of life and lacks defense but if 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.730
 what we want is to do a lot of damage we have 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.110
 comment on the attack and the accuracy and if 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.530
 we want to do it balance now we have 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.970
 that raise the attack and defense life 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.209
 now to give you an idea of how 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.530
 this character works in a battle 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.549
 Well, we are going to use the only battle 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.190
 where there are those who will endure 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.209
 the enemies that are being here with 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.910
 captain america who does 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.130
 counterattacks and rocker let's start 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.130
 to show them a bit of its potential 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.349
 while this starts his third attack 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.909
 its main function is that there will be 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.920
 a 50 percent chance that 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.159
 you write the attacks remotely and the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.500
 1000 which means that you're going to attack 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:13.000
 of energy or types so do not dodge them 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:18.100
 simply those that are physical 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.760
 and finally his fourth attack makes 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.570
 damage between more negative states have 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.250
 the enemy as you can see 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.650
 it is very likely that he will react with 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.900
 this skill with the counterattack of 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.090
 the sequential attacks in my opinion is 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.510
 like 80 to 90 percent of equipment 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.370
 what happens if they are fixed 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.580
 it's almost certainly going to be another 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.580
 sequential attack and the raccoon 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.400
 then join them all three of the 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.010
 Three stacks of pain is pretty 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.440
 simple for example here I already have it 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.520
 just two ammunition or increase it to 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.820
 five how can you see that that is the top 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.820
 insular 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.389
 as you can see it is always good not 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.150
 always but sometimes like 80 to 90 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.790
 percent there is one to the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.580
 counterattacks then if we want 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.440
 use it in bp because you have to think about 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.040
 characters that see counterattacks like 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.040
 colossus 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.700
 in fact any infiltrate too 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.670
 with filtradores and if pÃ©rez a contrata 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.830
 can also work but there are 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.380
 several options this extending from the 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.770
 fabric as well as a little head and see 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.140
 which is the best good chance alone 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.390
 let's write the rocker potential 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.320
 I hope this guide has served us 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.320
 we see in the next
