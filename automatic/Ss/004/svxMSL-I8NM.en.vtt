00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.370 
pestered so in the 80s did you you
already<00:00:30.240> had<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.599> eyeballs<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.199> this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
already had your eyeballs on this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.350 
already had your eyeballs on this
factory<00:00:31.830> farming<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.149> wasn't

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
factory farming and it just wasn't

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.150 
factory farming and it just wasn't
wasn't<00:00:33.930> making<00:00:34.140> sense<00:00:34.170> steel<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.860> wasn't

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
wasn't making sense steel it wasn't

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.709 
wasn't making sense steel it wasn't
making<00:00:35.250> sense<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.000> knew<00:00:36.180> about<00:00:36.420> heritage

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
making sense and I knew about heritage

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
making sense and I knew about heritage
bridge<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> how<00:00:37.440> well<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.070> pasture

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
bridge and how well they do on pasture

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.869 
bridge and how well they do on pasture
so<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.390> got<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:40.020> an<00:00:40.770> old<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.399> breed

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
to see well they're going to see a lot

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.130 
to see well they're going to see a lot
more<00:01:30.960> dark<00:01:31.380> meat<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.159> birds<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.570> it's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
more dark meat on the birds and it's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.929 
more dark meat on the birds and it's
going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> lot<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.860> flavorful<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
going to be a lot more flavorful me and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.370 
going to be a lot more flavorful me and
it's<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> lot<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:36.689> texture<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it's going to be a lot more texture to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
it's going to be a lot more texture to
the<00:01:37.500> meat<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:37.860> these<00:01:37.979> birds<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.579> spent

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the meat because these birds have spent

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.390 
the meat because these birds have spent
their<00:01:39.450> entire<00:01:39.509> lives<00:01:40.079> running<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> around<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
their entire lives running it around and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550 
their entire lives running it around and
and<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.970> their<00:01:42.119> musculature<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.350> more

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and so their musculature is more

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.530 
and so their musculature is more
developed<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> much<00:01:45.390> more

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
developed but to have a much more

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.800 
developed but to have a much more
flavorful<00:01:48.540> flick<00:01:49.170> flavorful<00:01:49.680> taste<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
flavorful flick flavorful taste and it
