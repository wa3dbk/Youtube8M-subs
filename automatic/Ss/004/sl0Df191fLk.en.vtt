off<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.250> tokens<00:03:38.930> but<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.200> think<00:03:40.470> Elspeth<00:03:40.829> would

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
off the tokens but I think Elspeth would

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.190 
off the tokens but I think Elspeth would
have<00:03:41.130> been<00:03:41.250> more<00:03:41.430> potent<00:03:41.850> as<00:03:41.970> Pat<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:42.900> tapped

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
have been more potent as Pat is tapped

have been more potent as Pat is tapped
