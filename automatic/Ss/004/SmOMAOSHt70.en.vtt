the STI does have a tendency to
understeer<00:02:12.959> more<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.040> than<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> Evo<00:02:14.610> 8<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
understeer more so than the Evo 8 the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.930 
understeer more so than the Evo 8 the
grip<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.290> still<00:02:16.769> excellent<00:02:17.340> even<00:02:17.670> though<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
grip is still excellent even though the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000 
grip is still excellent even though the

firm ride makes your teeth rattle of

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.069 
firm ride makes your teeth rattle of
times<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.910> throttle<00:02:21.329> response<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.840> better

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
times the throttle response is better

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.990 
times the throttle response is better
than<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.319> Mitsubishi<00:02:22.829> but<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.370> run<00:02:23.819> at<00:02:23.910> the

throttle<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.290> life<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> STI<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.610> band

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
throttle is so life of the STI can band

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.660 
throttle is so life of the STI can band
the<00:02:30.269> head<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.690> hyperactive<00:02:31.069> kangaroo<00:02:32.069> so

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the head like a hyperactive kangaroo so

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.400 
the head like a hyperactive kangaroo so
much<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.390> found<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.810> easier<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.200> start

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
much so that I found it easier to start

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.379 
much so that I found it easier to start
off<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.769> sanket<00:02:35.129> which<00:02:35.250> proves<00:02:35.640> how<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.269> the

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
off the sanket which proves how for the

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:43.010 
off the sanket which proves how for the
clutches

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.950 

all<00:02:43.680> right<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> BMW<00:02:44.760> either<00:02:45.420> lovable

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
all right so it is a BMW either lovable

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.420 
all right so it is a BMW either lovable
of<00:02:46.140> them<00:02:46.320> are<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.890> them<00:02:47.100> or<00:02:47.220> hate<00:02:47.370> them

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
