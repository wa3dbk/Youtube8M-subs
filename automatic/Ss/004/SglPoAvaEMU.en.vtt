Hills you have to be able to put up a
year<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.019> know<00:02:38.380> how<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.620> gauge<00:02:38.860> your<00:02:38.890> effort

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
year and know how to gauge your effort

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.310 
year and know how to gauge your effort
at<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:40.090> right<00:02:40.239> time<00:02:40.540> going<00:02:40.840> up<00:02:41.049> certain

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
slopes and down certain slopes so it's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.420 
slopes and down certain slopes so it's
telling<00:02:43.870> me<00:02:43.959> something<00:02:44.019> hard<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:45.220> something
