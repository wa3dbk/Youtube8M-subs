00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 the crisis in Brazilian public transportation 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.000
 next year will earn sao paulo 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.679
 five new subway stations but the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.380
 largest city in the country suffers 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.910
 consequences of a precarious and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.190
 insufficient 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 the subway itself went on strike several 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.609
 times this year 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.710
 not to mention the lack of trains and buses 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.260
 almost always crowded 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.230
 the reporter Mariana Caetano shows what 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.260
 could be done to improve the day to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.880
 day of millions of passengers at the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.730
 or inside the bus 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.309
 the maid cooks spend 7 hours a day 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.149
 to and from work arrives in 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.770
 home ten o'clock at night when 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.270
 insured morning raises video has no 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.230
 time for nothing or for the children of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.879
 people 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 lenny is a member of the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.870
 of São Paulo that connects the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.079
 terminals in the south and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.510
 flag in the center five million and 500 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.300
 thousand people use the bus system of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.010
 capital every day when there is no 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.049
 those your step you have to 16 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.710
 sub 16 have some that do not have to 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.570
 to hold 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.240
 You're at the door, not so much teaching. 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.710
 horrible I'm just safe from morning home is 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.420
 eight hours of service 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.270
 When I get home in the evening 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.720
 It's time to pack this up and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.420
 does not help anyone who can run away 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 Strong subways conditioning you and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.780
 agility and development 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.450
 hamlets in your right but the extent of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.220
 subway that was born in the late 60's is 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.960
 limited i for example working taboos 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.570
 Saw has no subway over there 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.210
 If I had I would use are little more than 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.340
 60 kilometers and three million 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.579
 less than one-third of the population 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.860
 already a centennial New York network in 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.729
 united states exceeds one thousand 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.670
 kilometers 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.939
 more than half the local population 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.299
 depends on the tokyo subway 80% of 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.430
 inhabitants use 286 kilometers of 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.380
 subway lines search 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.780
 institute datafolha disclosed in this 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.180
 Monday shows that one-third of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.209
 population charges new subway lines 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.370
 to vent the city traffic 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.100
 the São Paulo government intends to inaugurate 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.920
 more 18 km 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.550
 subway until 2010 and promises to 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.320
 to cptm trains and integrate them to the subway 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.330
 the first the quality of training is 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.090
 quality training with air 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.290
 conditioned with a video camera on the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.630
 wagon to provide security with a 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.700
 condition improved mobility and 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.490
 shorter intervals around 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.220
 of 34 minutes each kilometer of subway 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.040
 It costs at least 200 million reais 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.710
 fundamental works are the expensive and 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.320
 delayed all services such as subway 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.630
 buses and micro buses for example must 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.820
 be complementary as well as the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.350
 solutions for collective transportation in 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.910
 major cities 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.740
 Brazilian invested attraction may 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.140
 being a few do street turns 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.930
 avenues for cars that are Carlos 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.690
 are inefficient in the insured cim 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.820
 congested and served by few people 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.010
 while the investment in the subway 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.260
 like the runners he reversed this 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.760
 matrix you invest in more research with 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.650
 This is cheaper than you can get. 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.420
 with the same Jonas doing more trips to 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.630
 more people will find it harder to walk 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.760
 automobile car vehicle and people 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.890
 will tend to have a facility 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.820
 greater use of public transport 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.820
 with this quality
