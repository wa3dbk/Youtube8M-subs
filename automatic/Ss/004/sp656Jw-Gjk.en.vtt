friends who are photographers that I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.490 
friends who are photographers that I
really<00:00:22.740> admire<00:00:23.010> their<00:00:23.400> their<00:00:24.150> ability<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.570> put

really admire their their ability to put

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.109 
really admire their their ability to put
together<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:26.070> image<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.789> really

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
together an image that was really

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.330 
together an image that was really
arresting<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.779> both<00:00:28.320> technical<00:00:28.740> quality<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
arresting in both technical quality and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.240 
arresting in both technical quality and
in<00:00:29.910> concept<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> came<00:00:32.070> into

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
in concept I think that when I came into

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370 
in concept I think that when I came into
the<00:00:32.399> program<00:00:32.579> my<00:00:33.090> knowledge<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.750> quite<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> bit

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the program my knowledge was quite a bit

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.280 
the program my knowledge was quite a bit
more<00:00:34.410> superficial<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:36.540> feel<00:00:36.989> at<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
more superficial and I feel at this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.500 
more superficial and I feel at this
point<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.739> time<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> program<00:00:38.640> has<00:00:38.910> built<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
point in time the program has built a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.840 
point in time the program has built a
foundation<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.260> knowledge<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.920> skill<00:00:41.520> I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
foundation of knowledge and skill I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.220 
foundation of knowledge and skill I
think<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.719> lot<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:44.780> I<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.989> didn't

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
think it's a lot about I just didn't

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
think it's a lot about I just didn't
have<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.350> environment<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.340> learn<00:00:47.460> about

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
have the environment to learn about

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.459 
have the environment to learn about
lighting<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.930> doing<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.200> lot<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:51.469> natural

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
lighting I was doing a lot of natural

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
lighting I was doing a lot of natural
light<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.430> learned<00:00:53.670> most<00:00:53.879> at<00:00:54.180> Humber<00:00:54.539> was

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
light but I learned most at Humber was

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.439 
light but I learned most at Humber was
lighting<00:00:56.489> techniques<00:00:57.859> as<00:00:58.859> well<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.449> overall

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
lighting techniques as well as overall

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.450 
lighting techniques as well as overall
composition<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.289> how<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> work<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
composition and how to work in the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
composition and how to work in the
studio<00:01:02.670> I'd<00:01:03.420> never<00:01:03.719> used<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.320> Hasselblad's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
studio I'd never used to Hasselblad's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.580 
studio I'd never used to Hasselblad's
and<00:01:05.220> face<00:01:05.489> backs<00:01:05.760> before<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and face backs before this is really a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
and face backs before this is really a
photography<00:01:08.520> oriented<00:01:09.210> program<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.810> that's

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
photography oriented program and that's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.870 
photography oriented program and that's
