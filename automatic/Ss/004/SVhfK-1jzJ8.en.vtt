00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.500
 hello dear anna's friends today at 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.620
 studios im m forum will be interesting 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.690
 phone 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.179
 called motorolla small table 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.809
 then the first video will be kept on like 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.349
 always devoted to 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.569
 what sizes I will explain where what 

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:20.199
 buttons located and connector 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.660
 and then we'll see 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.339
 what can be shown is approximate 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.539
 dimensions 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.539
 timeline 58 00 so they look 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.580
 bottom together 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.460
 they are on the side 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 connector checks 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 approximate dimensions 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.130
 that's how they look somewhere 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.710
 started now a little bit 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.200
 Shahri plug connector read started in 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.360
 bottom of the reports we have 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.740
 is the main cheese button unfortunately 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.590
 no mechanical buttons 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.180
 although I for example would like mechanical 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.340
 end and call buttons means touch 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.570
 control buttons back minimum 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.540
 home screen and search itself 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.830
 the top of us is the speaker 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.700
 to drive through light sensors have a sensor 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.000
 approximation to down 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.220
 there is even a small little hard labor 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.620
 that here is here in this 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.420
 parts 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.220
 largely signal about 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.870
 missed calls and stuff like that 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.729
 it means further below we have no 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.300
 connectors 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.150
 on the right side we have a keys 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.490
 camera activation unfortunately if on 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.070
 her pressing a normal mode 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.880
 but when they are activated that is 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.630
 Aktobe camera only through the menu 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.280
 next we have the adjustment key 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.190
 volume rocker such here 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.600
 in me is bad and done though 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.740
 to be honest it is sometimes difficult but it worked 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.030
 the upper part we have three with 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.090
 half a minute alas connector check 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.330
 and I'm there, the key, respectively 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.999
 turn off the phone 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.109
 setting screen lock lesson 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.149
 raw side 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:16.609
 we have a small connector 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.639
 percent 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.649
 microdistrict beaten 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.029
 for 1 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.119
 we are at no mark 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.519
 strong wise photo camera 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.839
 oooh with flash double 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.509
 actually behind them we have 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.789
 small here is such a point where 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.619
 hiding one speaker set h unfortunately 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.439
 a little flex in that place where 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.659
 located 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.299
 but he actually wanted to tell everyone 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.179
 about the key and 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.059
 connectors
