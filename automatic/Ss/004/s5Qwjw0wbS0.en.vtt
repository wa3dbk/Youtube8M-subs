00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.730 
a picture of maxi just from the trailer
I<00:00:25.680> thought<00:00:25.829> looking<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.610> wait<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> second<00:00:27.779> wait

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
I thought looking for wait a second wait

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.880 
I thought looking for wait a second wait
a<00:00:28.800> second<00:00:29.789> looks<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.720> closer<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.439> indeed

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
a second looks a bit closer and indeed

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.700 
a second looks a bit closer and indeed
my<00:00:32.519> thoughts<00:00:32.879> work<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.720> bond<00:00:34.019> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.589> went

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
my thoughts work of bond and then I went

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
my thoughts work of bond and then I went
over<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> Archie<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.519> have<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.269> closer<00:00:36.420> look

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
over to Archie and have a closer look

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.990 
over to Archie and have a closer look
there<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.199> indeed<00:00:37.530> again<00:00:37.949> my<00:00:38.580> thoughts<00:00:38.850> were

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
there and indeed again my thoughts were

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.630 
there and indeed again my thoughts were
confirmed<00:00:39.680> Archie<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.800> Maxie<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.220> leader<00:00:41.519> of

likely gotten bigger glasses and Archie
here<00:00:49.829> has<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.850> probable<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> nigga

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
here has I think it's probable a nigga

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.389 
here has I think it's probable a nigga
chain<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> chain<00:00:53.100> around<00:00:53.219> his

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
chain because it is the chain around his

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.639 
chain because it is the chain around his
neck<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.989> glasses<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
neck you can see there the glasses you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.810 
neck you can see there the glasses you
can't<00:00:55.859> receipt<00:00:56.100> ooh<00:00:56.280> whoa<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.609> see<00:00:56.699> like

can't receipt ooh whoa you can see like

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.209 
can't receipt ooh whoa you can see like
half<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> colored<00:00:58.020> area<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.620> its<00:00:58.800> glasses

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
half of the colored area on its glasses

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.240 
half of the colored area on its glasses
and<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> mega<00:01:00.719> chain<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.980> obviously

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
and then the mega chain is so obviously

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.500 
and then the mega chain is so obviously
embedded<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> tree<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> bottoms<00:01:03.359> bit

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
embedded in the tree at the bottoms bit

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.749 
embedded in the tree at the bottoms bit
bit<00:01:03.750> easier<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.399> not

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
bit easier to see there but you know not

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.330 
bit easier to see there but you know not
something<00:01:06.570> people<00:01:06.600> i<00:01:07.050> don't<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.979> i<00:01:08.009> think<00:01:08.100> i

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.459 
knows guys who the frick knows I assume
they<00:02:03.030> wouldn't<00:02:03.270> use<00:02:03.390> them<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> meter<00:02:04.170> for

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
they wouldn't use them for the meter for

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.020 
they wouldn't use them for the meter for
every<00:02:04.770> single<00:02:05.009> battle<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.369> probably<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.790> the

every single battle it probably just the

playing you have getting mayor camera op
tomato<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.690> make<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:18.989> Sharpedo<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:20.519> can

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
tomato or make a Sharpedo so we can

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.059 
tomato or make a Sharpedo so we can
assume<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.480> that's

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
assume that that's

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.250 
assume that that's
might<00:02:22.280> happen<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.939> can<00:02:23.090> assume<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.480> might

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
might happen we can assume that might

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.280 
might happen we can assume that might
happen<00:02:24.799> who<00:02:25.730> knows<00:02:25.760> though<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:27.019> is<00:02:27.139> what

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
happen who knows though this is what

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.910 
happen who knows though this is what
we've<00:02:27.439> got<00:02:27.739> but<00:02:28.280> we<00:02:28.459> we<00:02:28.909> are<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.659> amazing<00:02:30.530> okay

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
we've got but we we are as amazing okay

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.940 
we've got but we we are as amazing okay
so<00:02:31.639> Maxine<00:02:32.480> Archie<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:32.959> mega<00:02:33.290> items<00:02:33.709> guys

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so Maxine Archie have mega items guys

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.390 
so Maxine Archie have mega items guys
how<00:02:34.549> height<00:02:35.030> are<00:02:35.329> you<00:02:35.540> now<00:02:35.780> they<00:02:36.469> have<00:02:36.799> mega

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
how height are you now they have mega

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160 
how height are you now they have mega
items<00:02:37.969> so<00:02:38.329> we<00:02:38.480> are<00:02:38.599> going<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:38.930> mega

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
items so we are going to get mega

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.959 
items so we are going to get mega
evolutions<00:02:39.829> for<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.489> other<00:02:40.609> team<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.879> was

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
evolutions for the other team I was

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.759 
evolutions for the other team I was
whoever<00:02:41.120> Sandra<00:02:41.989> but<00:02:42.170> it's<00:02:42.409> a<00:02:42.469> slightly

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
whoever Sandra but it's a slightly

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.530 
whoever Sandra but it's a slightly
different<00:02:42.950> because<00:02:43.250> obviously<00:02:43.939> the<00:02:44.209> Sandra

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
different because obviously the Sandra

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.360 
different because obviously the Sandra
was<00:02:44.629> in<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.959> generation<00:02:45.290> in<00:02:45.620> which<00:02:45.799> mega

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
was in the generation in which mega

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.309 
was in the generation in which mega
evolution<00:02:46.909> or<00:02:47.209> in<00:02:47.359> the<00:02:47.450> games<00:02:47.689> in<00:02:47.989> which<00:02:48.049> mega

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
evolution or in the games in which mega

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.929 
evolution or in the games in which mega
evolution<00:02:48.620> was<00:02:48.709> introduced<00:02:49.159> whereas<00:02:49.489> these

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
evolution was introduced whereas these

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.849 
evolution was introduced whereas these
are<00:02:50.120> remix<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:50.689> you<00:02:50.750> are<00:02:50.989> not<00:02:51.109> expect<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.680> but

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
are remix so you are not expect it but

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.030 
are remix so you are not expect it but
indeed<00:02:52.370> we<00:02:52.939> do<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.810> approach<00:02:54.200> what<00:02:55.010> a

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
indeed we do so this approach what a

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.629 
indeed we do so this approach what a
hundred<00:02:55.459> percent<00:02:55.519> confirms<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
hundred percent confirms that that the

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.729 
hundred percent confirms that that the
champion<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.389> Steven<00:02:59.870> or<00:02:59.989> whatever<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.469> going

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
champion is Steven or whatever is going

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.080 
champion is Steven or whatever is going
to<00:03:00.859> be<00:03:00.919> using<00:03:01.069> your<00:03:01.250> make<00:03:01.370> evolution<00:03:01.760> they

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
to be using your make evolution they

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.970 
to be using your make evolution they
can't<00:03:02.299> have<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.989> team<00:03:03.230> leaders<00:03:03.590> user-

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
can't have the team leaders user-

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.399 
can't have the team leaders user-
elution<00:03:04.639> and<00:03:04.849> then<00:03:05.659> i'll<00:03:05.780> have<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.989> champion

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
elution and then i'll have the champion

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.770 
elution and then i'll have the champion
use<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:06.889> it<00:03:07.549> might<00:03:07.760> even<00:03:07.790> lean<00:03:08.269> towards

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
use on and it might even lean towards

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.449 
use on and it might even lean towards
the<00:03:09.290> elite<00:03:09.620> for<00:03:09.859> using<00:03:10.129> them<00:03:10.219> as<00:03:10.340> well

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
the elite for using them as well

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.429 
the elite for using them as well
obviously<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:11.060> know<00:03:11.209> i'm<00:03:11.989> nearly<00:03:12.230> four

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
obviously you know i'm nearly four

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.589 
obviously you know i'm nearly four
didn't<00:03:12.650> use<00:03:12.739> them<00:03:12.859> an<00:03:12.919> X&amp;Y<00:03:13.239> but<00:03:14.239> they<00:03:14.389> could

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
didn't use them an X&amp;Y but they could

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.869 
didn't use them an X&amp;Y but they could
add<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.109> new<00:03:15.230> arrangement<00:03:15.769> because<00:03:15.859> a<00:03:16.250> lot<00:03:16.849> of

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
add the new arrangement because a lot of

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.689 
add the new arrangement because a lot of
people<00:03:17.349> expressed<00:03:18.349> disappointment<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.579> i

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
people expressed disappointment that i

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.159 
people expressed disappointment that i
may<00:03:19.819> get<00:03:19.879> other<00:03:20.239> than<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.599> need<00:03:20.719> for<00:03:20.900> did<00:03:21.019> not

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
may get other than you need for did not

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.080 
may get other than you need for did not
use<00:03:21.290> mega<00:03:21.560> evolution<00:03:22.069> so<00:03:22.280> they<00:03:22.370> might<00:03:22.549> then

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
use mega evolution so they might then

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.360 
use mega evolution so they might then
also<00:03:23.389> integrate<00:03:24.139> it<00:03:24.319> in<00:03:24.409> tibet<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.889> two<00:03:25.159> great

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370
