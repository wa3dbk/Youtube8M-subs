00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
questions what do you eat how did you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.339 
questions what do you eat how did you
get<00:00:19.849> so<00:00:20.029> big

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
get so big

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.890 
get so big
etc<00:00:21.730> for<00:00:22.730> anybody<00:00:22.939> that<00:00:23.060> knows<00:00:23.210> me<00:00:23.539> knows<00:00:23.570> that

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
etc for anybody that knows me knows that

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:33.490 
etc for anybody that knows me knows that
I<00:00:24.199> started<00:00:24.589> out<00:00:24.740> as<00:00:25.539> 52<00:00:26.539> pounds<00:00:27.519> today

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.939 

I<00:00:34.390> found<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:37.370> key<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:38.500> convenience<00:00:39.500> and

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
I found that the key is convenience and

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.029 
I found that the key is convenience and
consistency<00:00:41.199> it's<00:00:42.199> not<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.500> me<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:42.860> you're

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
consistency it's not to me and you're

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.029 
consistency it's not to me and you're
not<00:00:43.159> to<00:00:43.309> be<00:00:43.430> consistent<00:00:44.350> so<00:00:45.350> I<00:00:45.409> do<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.710> lot<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:45.949> my

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
not to be consistent so I do a lot of my

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.689 
not to be consistent so I do a lot of my
food<00:00:46.309> prep<00:00:46.640> for<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.690> whole<00:00:47.839> week<00:00:48.110> all<00:00:48.289> at<00:00:48.409> once

protein bread local pineapples one of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.490 
protein bread local pineapples one of
the<00:01:02.539> things<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:02.869> I<00:01:02.989> like<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:03.860> do<00:01:04.009> because<00:01:04.190> for

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
the things that I like to do because for

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.889 
the things that I like to do because for
20<00:01:06.500> pounds<00:01:08.890> so<00:01:09.890> find<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.130> hard<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.429> get<00:01:10.899> enough

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
20 pounds so find it hard to get enough

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.600 
20 pounds so find it hard to get enough
calories<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:12.500> maintain<00:01:12.590> my<00:01:13.130> size<00:01:13.369> but<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:14.630> grow

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
calories to maintain my size but to grow

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.430 
calories to maintain my size but to grow
so<00:01:16.610> what<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:16.759> found<00:01:17.060> works<00:01:17.390> best<00:01:17.509> is<00:01:17.869> protein

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
so what I found works best is protein

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.639 
so what I found works best is protein
shakes<00:01:18.729> what<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.789> like<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.060> do<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:20.539> take<00:01:20.750> old

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
you protein yeah it's still shape but

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.080 
you protein yeah it's still shape but
it's<00:01:32.240> it's<00:01:32.690> more<00:01:33.170> akin<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.679> whole<00:01:34.280> meal<00:01:34.580> it's

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
a little bit more nutrition also again

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.249 
a little bit more nutrition also again
for<00:01:39.950> calories<00:01:40.459> I<00:01:40.759> leave<00:01:41.060> my<00:01:41.239> chicken<00:01:41.690> my<00:01:42.050> rice
