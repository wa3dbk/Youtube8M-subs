one<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.259> we're<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> talk<00:01:34.920> about

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
one up here we're going to talk about

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.819 
one up here we're going to talk about
the<00:01:35.220> slingshot<00:01:35.670> solar<00:01:35.970> toss<00:01:36.210> great<00:01:37.140> hybrid

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the slingshot solar toss great hybrid

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.800 
the slingshot solar toss great hybrid
board<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> hybrid<00:01:38.790> kite<00:01:39.119> surfboard<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
board and the hybrid kite surfboard is a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.080 
board and the hybrid kite surfboard is a
category<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.619> most<00:01:41.369> people<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.939> getting

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
category that's most people are getting

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.020 
category that's most people are getting
into<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.810> working<00:01:43.649> light<00:01:43.860> wind<00:01:44.130> reaches

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
into so working light wind reaches

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.719 
into so working light wind reaches
really<00:01:45.360> well<00:01:45.540> goes<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.290> wind<00:01:46.470> well<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.610> when

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
really well goes up wind well but when

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.980 
really well goes up wind well but when
you<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:47.939> into<00:01:48.090> some<00:01:48.270> surf<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.720> still<00:01:48.899> gonna

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you get into some surf it's still gonna

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.810 
you get into some surf it's still gonna
be<00:01:49.049> turn<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.460> notice<00:01:50.729> just

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
be turn here and you can notice just

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.039 
be turn here and you can notice just
right<00:01:51.000> off<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.119> bat<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.780> narrower

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
right off the bat it's a lot narrower

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870 
right off the bat it's a lot narrower
it's<00:01:52.470> gonna<00:01:52.590> be<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:52.799> longer<00:01:53.130> than<00:01:53.340> say

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it's gonna be a little longer than say

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.789 
it's gonna be a little longer than say
someone<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> Nash<00:01:54.659> fish<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.560> still

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
someone like the Nash fish but it still

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
someone like the Nash fish but it still
maintains<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.729> real<00:01:56.939> wide<00:01:57.240> tail

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
maintains that kind of real wide tail

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
maintains that kind of real wide tail
down<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> bottom<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.979> also<00:01:59.549> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.850> look

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
down to the bottom and also if you look

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.639 
down to the bottom and also if you look
at<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> rocker<00:02:00.479> line<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.350> flat

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
at the rocker line it's really flat

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.950 
at the rocker line it's really flat
below<00:02:02.250> your<00:02:02.430> feet<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:02.909> flatness<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.810> what

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
below your feet so that flatness is what

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.170 
below your feet so that flatness is what
gives<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.500> drive<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.979> wind<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.909> want

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
gives you that drive of wind so you want

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180 
gives you that drive of wind so you want
to<00:02:06.270> make<00:02:06.390> sure<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.979> know<00:02:08.009> if
