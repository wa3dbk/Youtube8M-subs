hi I'm Ron Bowman and today we're
talking<00:00:05.549> about<00:00:05.790> trail<00:00:06.180> running<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.660> now

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
talking about trail running and now

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.880 
talking about trail running and now
we're<00:00:07.020> going<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.170> talk<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.350> little<00:00:07.529> bit<00:00:07.710> about

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.370 
we're going to talk a little bit about
getting<00:00:08.130> started<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:08.970> trail<00:00:09.179> running<00:00:09.389> there's

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
getting started in trail running there's

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.860 
getting started in trail running there's
a<00:00:10.440> mistaken<00:00:10.800> impression<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.730> trail<00:00:12.599> runs

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
a mistaken impression that trail runs

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.540 
a mistaken impression that trail runs
all<00:00:13.259> include<00:00:14.040> 50k<00:00:14.719> 31<00:00:15.719> mile<00:00:15.960> 50<00:00:16.529> mile<00:00:16.710> runs<00:00:17.250> or

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
all include 50k 31 mile 50 mile runs or

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.700 
all include 50k 31 mile 50 mile runs or
even<00:00:17.760> longer<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.960> that's<00:00:19.109> probably<00:00:19.529> because

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
even longer and that's probably because

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.710 
even longer and that's probably because
those<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> races<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.210> most<00:00:21.420> people

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
those are the races that most people

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.509 
those are the races that most people
hear<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:21.990> those<00:00:22.800> are<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.010> ones<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.250> draw

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
hear about those are the ones that draw

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.759 
hear about those are the ones that draw
most<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> attention<00:00:24.689> there<00:00:25.500> aren't<00:00:25.680> a

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
most of the attention there aren't a

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.179 
most of the attention there aren't a
whole<00:00:25.920> lot<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.340> 10k<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.090> even<00:00:27.779> shorter<00:00:28.199> trail

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
whole lot of 10k or even shorter trail

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.540 
whole lot of 10k or even shorter trail
runs<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> lot<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.689> notoriety<00:00:31.550> for

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
runs that get a lot of notoriety for

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
runs that get a lot of notoriety for
that<00:00:32.700> reason<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.690> mistaken<00:00:34.110> impression

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
that reason that mistaken impression

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.790 
that reason that mistaken impression
tends<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.840> dissuade<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> people<00:00:37.620> from

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
tends to dissuade a lot of people from

tends to dissuade a lot of people from
getting<00:00:37.920> involved<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.879> trail<00:00:39.329> runs

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
getting involved in in trail runs

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.420 
getting involved in in trail runs
because<00:00:40.379> they're<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.710> ready<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.190> kind

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
because they're not ready for that kind

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.380 
because they're not ready for that kind
of<00:00:41.520> distance<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:42.120> they're<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> little

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
of distance or they're a little

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.420 
of distance or they're a little
intimidated<00:00:42.989> by<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> thought<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.950> having<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
intimidated by the thought of having to

intimidated by the thought of having to
run<00:00:44.640> 30<00:00:45.300> miles<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.739> working<00:00:47.160> on

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
run 30 miles just to be working on

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
run 30 miles just to be working on
trails<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:48.390> you're<00:00:48.570> interested<00:00:48.899> looking<00:00:49.140> into

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
trails if you're interested looking into

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.290 
trails if you're interested looking into
doing<00:00:49.980> some<00:00:50.280> trail<00:00:50.489> running<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> first<00:00:51.149> thing

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
doing some trail running the first thing

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
doing some trail running the first thing
to<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.719> research<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.410> area<00:00:52.770> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to do is just research your area you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.069 
to do is just research your area you
probably<00:00:53.640> already<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.270> some<00:00:54.510> some

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
probably already know of some some

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.819 
probably already know of some some
towpaths<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:56.039> fire<00:00:56.879> trails<00:00:57.270> or<00:00:58.199> trails<00:00:58.559> that

that are paved bike trails things like

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.030 
that are paved bike trails things like
that<00:01:09.510> which<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:09.930> nice<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.560> they<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that which are nice and they do get you

off the the hard asphalt roads they can

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.320 
off the the hard asphalt roads they can
be<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> little<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.549> safer<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
be a little bit safer but you have to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
be a little bit safer but you have to
watch<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.710> other<00:01:16.710> traffic<00:01:17.280> pedestrian

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
strollers those kind of things I tend to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
strollers those kind of things I tend to
think<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.369> trail<00:01:24.180> running<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.810> running<00:01:25.470> on

think of trail running as running on

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.480 
think of trail running as running on
dirt<00:01:26.280> paths<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:27.030> trails<00:01:27.439> hiking<00:01:28.439> trails<00:01:28.770> fire

trails or even deer trails that the

animals have worn into the forest those

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.140 
animals have worn into the forest those
are<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> best<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> trails<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.000> my

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
are the best kind of the trails in my

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.760 
are the best kind of the trails in my
opinion<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.900> those<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
opinion and those you have to do a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.499 
opinion and those you have to do a
little<00:01:37.979> bit<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> research<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.909> find<00:01:39.119> out<00:01:39.299> where

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
little bit of research to find out where

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.120 
little bit of research to find out where
they're<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.869> usually<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> web

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
they're at usually you can go to the web

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.850 
they're at usually you can go to the web
and<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> research<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.869> local<00:01:43.649> running
