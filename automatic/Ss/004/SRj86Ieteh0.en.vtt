00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
this just in hot off the wherever it

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.940 
this just in hot off the wherever it
came<00:00:07.410> from<00:00:07.700> and<00:00:08.700> it's<00:00:08.820> still<00:00:08.970> hot<00:00:09.380> well<00:00:10.380> it's

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
came from and it's still hot well it's

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
came from and it's still hot well it's
not<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.420> doesn't<00:00:12.420> feel<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.809> hot<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
not that doesn't feel that hot to the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.549 
not that doesn't feel that hot to the
touch

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
touch

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.400 
touch
but<00:00:13.980> I'm<00:00:14.130> told<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.790> thing<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.150> hot<00:00:16.109> what

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
but I'm told that this thing is hot what

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.240 
but I'm told that this thing is hot what
am<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.590> talking<00:00:16.650> about

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
am I talking about

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.240 
am I talking about
this<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.880> 9800<00:00:18.720> GTX<00:00:19.260> right<00:00:19.920> here<00:00:20.070> holding

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
this is the 9800 GTX right here holding

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.150 
this is the 9800 GTX right here holding
in<00:00:20.369> my<00:00:20.430> hand<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.740> this<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> very

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
in my hand and this is a very

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.070 
in my hand and this is a very
interesting<00:00:23.519> card<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.330> saying<00:00:24.689> interesting

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
interesting card I'm saying interesting

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.740 
interesting card I'm saying interesting
because<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:26.250> doesn't<00:00:26.760> compete<00:00:27.029> with<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> 9800

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
because it doesn't compete with the 9800

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.550 
because it doesn't compete with the 9800
GX<00:00:28.349> -<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:28.859> far<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> price<00:00:29.880> goes<00:00:30.349> but<00:00:31.349> when

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
GX - as far as the price goes but when

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.650 
GX - as far as the price goes but when
you<00:00:31.679> talk<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:32.099> performance<00:00:32.660> there's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you talk about performance there's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.610 
you talk about performance there's
probably<00:00:33.870> nothing<00:00:33.989> out<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.230> that's<00:00:34.500> gonna

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
probably nothing out there that's gonna

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.590 
probably nothing out there that's gonna
beat<00:00:34.829> three<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> these<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.180> try<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
beat three of these and this is a try a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.850 
beat three of these and this is a try a
satellite<00:00:37.020> card<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> guys<00:00:37.680> been

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
satellite card a lot of you guys been

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.670 
satellite card a lot of you guys been
waiting<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> new<00:00:39.000> trial<00:00:39.270> ID<00:00:39.690> card<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.350> I'd

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
waiting for a new trial ID card and I'd

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.090 
waiting for a new trial ID card and I'd
rather<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.950> using<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.210> try<00:00:42.570> us-ally

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
rather be using this one and try us-ally

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.520 
rather be using this one and try us-ally
over<00:00:44.100> top<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> GTX<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.539> 88<00:00:45.809> energy<00:00:46.050> TX<00:00:46.320> or

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
over top of the GTX the 88 energy TX or

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.080 
over top of the GTX the 88 energy TX or
the<00:00:46.710> 82<00:00:47.039> nardole<00:00:47.399> trot<00:00:47.579> or<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.820> use<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.059> of

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the 82 nardole trot or they use one of

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
the 82 nardole trot or they use one of
these<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.660> three<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.079> these<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.739> computer

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
these or three of these in a computer

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.310 
these or three of these in a computer
now<00:00:50.520> three<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.660> little<00:00:52.199> bit

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
now three of these is a little bit

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.400 
now three of these is a little bit
faster<00:00:52.620> than<00:00:52.829> two<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.969> 9800<00:00:54.390> gx2<00:00:55.079> cards

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
faster than two of the 9800 gx2 cards

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
faster than two of the 9800 gx2 cards
and<00:00:55.949> take<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> look<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> price<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and take a look at the price this this

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.670 
and take a look at the price this this
one's<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:57.899> three<00:00:58.050> hundred<00:00:58.140> dollars<00:00:58.530> less

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
one's two or three hundred dollars less

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.459 
one's two or three hundred dollars less
expensive<00:00:59.309> than<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> GX<00:01:00.449> 2<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
expensive than the GX 2 and in the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.599 
expensive than the GX 2 and in the
benchmarks<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> compare<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.489> one

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
benchmarks I'm going to compare this one

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.329 
benchmarks I'm going to compare this one
to<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> GX<00:01:03.300> 2<00:01:03.480> keep<00:01:04.049> saying<00:01:04.229> GX<00:01:04.500> 2<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.159> one's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to the GX 2 keep saying GX 2 that one's

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
to the GX 2 keep saying GX 2 that one's
like<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> monster<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.200> this<00:01:07.200> one's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
like the monster right now this one's

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.679 
like the monster right now this one's
not<00:01:07.560> quite<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.979> fast<00:01:08.189> overall<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
not quite as fast overall but for the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.440 
not quite as fast overall but for the
money<00:01:10.100> it's<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.400> almost<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> same<00:01:12.060> speed<00:01:12.299> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
money it's it's almost the same speed it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.910 
money it's it's almost the same speed it
even<00:01:12.689> beats<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.110> some<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> benchmarks

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
even beats it in some of the benchmarks

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.090 
even beats it in some of the benchmarks
so<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:16.229> look<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> guys<00:01:16.830> come

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
so here it is just look at it guys come

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.850 
so here it is just look at it guys come
on<00:01:17.310> look<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.650> everybody's<00:01:19.650> been<00:01:19.740> waiting

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
to see this so I'll just hold it up for

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.179 
to see this so I'll just hold it up for
a<00:01:21.299> minute<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.259> guy<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.619> his<00:01:22.770> eyes<00:01:22.950> are

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
a minute the guy there his eyes are

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.760 
a minute the guy there his eyes are
bleeding<00:01:23.369> lightning<00:01:23.990> that's<00:01:24.990> B<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.320> G's<00:01:25.530> way

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
bleeding lightning that's B of G's way

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.429 
bleeding lightning that's B of G's way
to<00:01:25.830> say<00:01:26.100> wow<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.509> make<00:01:27.630> your<00:01:27.750> eyes<00:01:27.869> glow

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
green and bleed lightning I think what

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.359 
green and bleed lightning I think what
are<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> specs<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.439> card<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
are the specs on this card well it's a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.240 
are the specs on this card well it's a
256<00:01:33.180> bit<00:01:33.270> card<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.560> paper<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.979> doesn't

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
256 bit card now on paper it doesn't

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.649 
256 bit card now on paper it doesn't
even<00:01:35.369> doesn't<00:01:35.759> even<00:01:35.850> sound<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.240> fast<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.600> the

even doesn't even sound as fast as the
80<00:01:36.810> turn<00:01:37.140> GTX<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.650> remember<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.220> a

80 turn GTX but remember this is a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.030 
80 turn GTX but remember this is a
different<00:01:38.700> process<00:01:38.909> than<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.290> GTX<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
different process than the GTX so it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.999 
different process than the GTX so it
runs<00:01:41.189> cooler<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.820> faster<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.829> can

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
runs cooler and faster and they can

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.940 
runs cooler and faster and they can
actually<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.759> better<00:01:44.909> benchmarks<00:01:45.649> with<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
actually get better benchmarks with I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.999 
actually get better benchmarks with I
guess<00:01:47.720> less<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.930> far<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.470> memory

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
guess less as far as the memory

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.149 
guess less as far as the memory
interface<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.460> less<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.740> what<00:01:52.740> else<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.950> less

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
interface is less and what else is less

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710 
interface is less and what else is less
well<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.939> don't<00:01:54.090> even<00:01:54.180> know<00:01:54.329> let's<00:01:54.509> talk<00:01:54.630> about

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
well I don't even know let's talk about

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.389 
well I don't even know let's talk about
specs<00:01:55.049> 512<00:01:55.619> megabytes<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.009> memory<00:01:56.070> that's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
specs 512 megabytes of memory that's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.100 
specs 512 megabytes of memory that's
less<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.729> well<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.479> were<00:01:57.540> 12<00:01:57.780> megabytes

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
less as well so if I were 12 megabytes

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.969 
less as well so if I were 12 megabytes
of<00:01:58.170> gddr3

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
of gddr3

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.370 
of gddr3
and<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.729> runs<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.240> double<00:02:00.960> data<00:02:01.079> rate<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and that runs at double data rate of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.999 
and that runs at double data rate of
2200<00:02:02.280> also<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.540> shader<00:02:03.899> clock<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.259> at<00:02:04.350> 1688

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
2200 also the shader clock is at 1688

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.080 
2200 also the shader clock is at 1688
and<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.880> core<00:02:06.060> clock<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.740> 675<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> there

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and the core clock is at 675 so there

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.040 
and the core clock is at 675 so there
you<00:02:09.149> got<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> right<00:02:09.629> there

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you got it right there

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.190 
you got it right there
and<00:02:10.370> don't<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.430> confused<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:12.300> fast<00:02:12.630> let's<00:02:13.080> go

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and don't be confused it's fast let's go

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.630 
and don't be confused it's fast let's go

1200 this card the GTX was at 193 frames

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.440 
1200 this card the GTX was at 193 frames
a<00:02:25.290> second<00:02:25.650> now<00:02:25.980> compare<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> GX<00:02:26.910> 2<00:02:27.150> at

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
a second now compare that to the GX 2 at

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.350 
a second now compare that to the GX 2 at
197<00:02:28.260> frames<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.620> second<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> lot<00:02:30.180> less

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
197 frames a second so for a lot less

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.480 
197 frames a second so for a lot less
money<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.840> almost<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.440> same<00:02:31.710> performance

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
money it's almost the same performance

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.160 
money it's almost the same performance
alright<00:02:33.330> we're<00:02:33.420> gonna<00:02:33.510> compare<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
alright we're gonna compare that to the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.250 
alright we're gonna compare that to the

38 70 X 2 which is a 215 frames a second
now<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.740> gotta<00:02:38.010> hand<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> 8<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.610> ATI<00:02:38.910> they

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
now I gotta hand it to 8 the ATI they

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.760 
now I gotta hand it to 8 the ATI they
always<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.540> well<00:02:39.720> with<00:02:39.840> half-life<00:02:40.230> games<00:02:40.500> but

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
always do well with half-life games but

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.740 
always do well with half-life games but
all<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.670> other<00:02:41.760> games<00:02:41.940> these<00:02:42.240> two<00:02:42.480> are<00:02:42.720> the

from AMD 80 I was at 90 97 frames a
second<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.130> can<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.760> beats<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.060> by

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
1200 that's high resolution but we're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.390 
1200 that's high resolution but we're

running it on medium settings the GTX
was<00:03:11.550> at<00:03:11.640> 46<00:03:12.180> frames<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.540> second

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
was at 46 frames a second

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.200 
was at 46 frames a second
the<00:03:13.260> GX<00:03:13.500> 2<00:03:13.710> was<00:03:13.860> at<00:03:14.010> 50<00:03:14.310> frames<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.730> second<00:03:15.090> and

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
the GX 2 was at 50 frames a second and

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.860 
the GX 2 was at 50 frames a second and
the<00:03:15.990> 38<00:03:16.710> 70<00:03:17.130> X<00:03:17.250> 2<00:03:17.430> was<00:03:17.580> at<00:03:17.700> 39<00:03:18.150> frames<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.570> second

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the 38 70 X 2 was at 39 frames a second

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.950 
the 38 70 X 2 was at 39 frames a second
so<00:03:19.100> these<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.520> beat<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.760> 30<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.210> 70<00:03:21.510> X<00:03:21.660> 2<00:03:21.810> in

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
so these do beat the 30 and 70 X 2 in

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.930 
so these do beat the 30 and 70 X 2 in
most<00:03:22.290> games<00:03:22.560> except<00:03:23.400> for<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.580> source<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:23.910> your

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.310 
most games except for the source in your
games<00:03:24.240> but<00:03:24.390> everything<00:03:24.780> else<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.110> pretty

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
games but everything else it's pretty

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.590 
games but everything else it's pretty
much<00:03:25.730> chewing<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.820> up<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.090> spitting<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.480> out

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
much chewing it up and spitting it out

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.350 
much chewing it up and spitting it out
and<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.920> performance<00:03:29.400> but<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.090> card

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
and the performance but of this card

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.780 
and the performance but of this card
that's<00:03:30.780> what's<00:03:30.930> surprising<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.440> me<00:03:31.590> it's<00:03:32.550> this

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
that's what's surprising to me it's this

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.640 
that's what's surprising to me it's this
thing's<00:03:33.000> only<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.630> little<00:03:34.110> bit<00:03:34.200> more<00:03:34.380> expensive

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
thing's only a little bit more expensive

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.530 
thing's only a little bit more expensive
than<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> unit<00:03:35.220> energy<00:03:35.400> T<00:03:35.760> but<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> results

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
than the unit energy T but the results

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.130 
than the unit energy T but the results
are<00:03:36.690> much<00:03:36.900> higher<00:03:37.080> than<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.380> DS<00:03:37.560> energy<00:03:37.920> T<00:03:38.070> and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
are much higher than a DS energy T and

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.630 
are much higher than a DS energy T and
comparing<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.230> with<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.380> 8800<00:03:41.010> GX<00:03:41.310> 2<00:03:41.490> is

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
comparing it with the 8800 GX 2 is

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.890 
comparing it with the 8800 GX 2 is
really<00:03:41.850> not<00:03:41.940> even<00:03:42.210> fair<00:03:42.390> because<00:03:42.690> they're<00:03:42.810> not

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
really not even fair because they're not

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.990 
really not even fair because they're not
even<00:03:43.170> in<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.320> same<00:03:43.500> category<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
even in the same category but the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.330 
even in the same category but the
benchmarks<00:03:45.510> there<00:03:46.470> are<00:03:46.530> only<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.740> few<00:03:46.890> frames<00:03:47.220> a

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
benchmarks there are only a few frames a

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.390 
benchmarks there are only a few frames a
second<00:03:47.670> slower<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.270> this<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.290> with<00:03:49.440> some

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
second slower and this is with some

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.400 
second slower and this is with some
preliminary<00:03:50.730> drivers<00:03:51.510> as<00:03:51.630> well<00:03:51.660> when<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.320> new

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
preliminary drivers as well when the new

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.230 
preliminary drivers as well when the new
drivers<00:03:52.800> come<00:03:52.980> out<00:03:53.160> I'm<00:03:53.310> expecting<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:53.970> speed

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
drivers come out I'm expecting a speed

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.670 
drivers come out I'm expecting a speed
jump<00:03:54.480> for<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.750> card<00:03:54.990> so<00:03:55.290> I'm<00:03:55.530> gonna

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
jump for this card so I'm gonna

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.260 
jump for this card so I'm gonna
wholeheartedly<00:03:56.160> say<00:03:56.550> hey<00:03:56.700> pick<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.030> up<00:03:57.120> pick

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
wholeheartedly say hey pick it up pick

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.870 
wholeheartedly say hey pick it up pick
it<00:03:57.330> up<00:03:57.710> Erica<00:03:58.710> I'm<00:03:59.310> still<00:03:59.490> going<00:03:59.640> back<00:03:59.730> and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
it up Erica I'm still going back and

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.430 
it up Erica I'm still going back and
forth<00:04:00.030> man<00:04:00.180> I'm<00:04:00.330> really<00:04:00.810> thinking<00:04:01.050> about<00:04:01.230> this

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
forth man I'm really thinking about this

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.200 
forth man I'm really thinking about this
card<00:04:01.680> because<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.520> can<00:04:02.640> get<00:04:02.760> three<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.090> these

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
card because you can get three of these

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.290 
card because you can get three of these
and<00:04:03.710> I<00:04:04.710> mean<00:04:05.400> what<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.580> speed<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.820> producing

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
and I mean what the speed is producing

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.270 
and I mean what the speed is producing
and<00:04:06.480> also<00:04:06.660> it's<00:04:06.810> it's<00:04:07.050> smaller<00:04:07.380> than<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.740> GX<00:04:08.070> 2

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
and also it's it's smaller than the GX 2

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.460 
and also it's it's smaller than the GX 2
as<00:04:08.430> well<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.670> GX<00:04:08.910> 2<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.180> little<00:04:09.300> longer<00:04:09.720> so

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
as well the GX 2 is a little longer so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.660 
as well the GX 2 is a little longer so
yeah<00:04:10.770> with<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:10.980> speed<00:04:11.190> you're<00:04:11.280> gonna<00:04:11.370> be<00:04:11.520> able

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
yeah with the speed you're gonna be able

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.400 
yeah with the speed you're gonna be able
to<00:04:11.730> get<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.240> also<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.870> fact<00:04:13.020> that<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.260> uses

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
to get and also the fact that it uses

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.180 
to get and also the fact that it uses
less<00:04:13.709> power

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
less power

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.650 
less power
alright<00:04:14.850> looking<00:04:15.060> at<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.180> back<00:04:15.270> here<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.570> is

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
alright looking at the back here that is

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.729 
alright looking at the back here that is
where<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.840> plug<00:04:15.959> up<00:04:16.109> your<00:04:16.170> power<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.560> need<00:04:16.680> a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
where you plug up your power you need a

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.060 
where you plug up your power you need a
6<00:04:17.220> pin<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.640> an<00:04:17.730> 8<00:04:17.910> pin<00:04:18.150> PCI<00:04:18.359> Express<00:04:18.780> connector

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
6 pin and an 8 pin PCI Express connector

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.860 
6 pin and an 8 pin PCI Express connector
now<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.370> Box<00:04:20.580> they've<00:04:20.820> included<00:04:21.090> one<00:04:21.840> of

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
now in the Box they've included one of

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.060 
now in the Box they've included one of
these<00:04:22.550> one<00:04:23.550> molex<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.450> 6-pin<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.770> it's<00:04:25.979> really

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
these one molex to 6-pin so it's really

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.380 
these one molex to 6-pin so it's really
gonna<00:04:26.250> be<00:04:26.340> dependent<00:04:26.729> on<00:04:26.760> your<00:04:26.910> power<00:04:27.090> slope

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
gonna be dependent on your power slope

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.700 
gonna be dependent on your power slope
supply<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:27.930> make<00:04:28.020> sure<00:04:28.140> you<00:04:28.229> have<00:04:28.350> an<00:04:28.440> 8<00:04:28.560> pin

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
supply and make sure you have an 8 pin

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.100 
supply and make sure you have an 8 pin

these we also have a breakaway about

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.170 
these we also have a breakaway about
right<00:04:38.250> here<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.520> can<00:04:38.640> be<00:04:38.700> used<00:04:38.850> for<00:04:38.910> s-video

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
right here that can be used for s-video

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.330 
right here that can be used for s-video
or<00:04:39.360> also<00:04:39.930> for<00:04:40.260> this<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.860> can<00:04:40.979> plug<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:41.250> in

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
or also for this you can plug it in

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.040 
or also for this you can plug it in
there<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.580> then<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.760> have<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.050> component

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
there and then you have a component

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.150 
there and then you have a component
coming<00:04:43.470> out<00:04:43.560> right<00:04:43.710> there<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:43.890> then<00:04:44.040> old

VGA<00:04:52.770> monitor<00:04:53.370> well<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:53.729> can<00:04:53.850> still<00:04:54.030> use<00:04:54.210> it

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
VGA monitor well you can still use it

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.350 
VGA monitor well you can still use it
with<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:54.960> card<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:56.010> again<00:04:56.310> it's<00:04:57.270> an

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
with this card so again it's an

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.969 
with this card so again it's an
extremely<00:04:57.750> efficient<00:04:58.350> cars<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.680> think<00:04:58.860> that's

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
extremely efficient cars I think that's

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.310 
extremely efficient cars I think that's
the<00:04:59.130> new<00:04:59.220> name<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.610> game<00:04:59.810> it's<00:05:00.810> not<00:05:01.080> as

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
the new name of the game it's not as

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.400 
the new name of the game it's not as
fast<00:05:01.650> as<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.100> GX<00:05:02.700> 2<00:05:02.970> but<00:05:03.960> it<00:05:04.050> shouldn't<00:05:04.350> be

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
fast as the GX 2 but it shouldn't be

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.909 
fast as the GX 2 but it shouldn't be
it's<00:05:04.890> a<00:05:05.040> lot<00:05:05.430> less<00:05:05.729> expensive<00:05:05.940> I<00:05:06.680> don't<00:05:07.680> know

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
it's a lot less expensive I don't know

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.530 
it's a lot less expensive I don't know
man<00:05:08.160> I'm<00:05:08.310> thinking<00:05:08.640> of<00:05:08.729> I<00:05:08.910> might<00:05:09.120> go<00:05:09.240> with<00:05:09.270> this

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
man I'm thinking of I might go with this

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.000 
man I'm thinking of I might go with this
one<00:05:09.690> I'm<00:05:09.810> not<00:05:09.930> sure<00:05:10.050> if<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:10.229> one<00:05:10.410> of<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.590> GX<00:05:10.860> 2

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
one I'm not sure if this one of the GX 2

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.159 
one I'm not sure if this one of the GX 2
the<00:05:11.160> GX<00:05:11.400> 2<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.610> this<00:05:12.210> much<00:05:12.419> faster<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:12.900> this

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
the GX 2 is this much faster but this

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.600 
the GX 2 is this much faster but this
much<00:05:13.320> bigger<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.740> takes<00:05:13.890> up<00:05:14.040> this<00:05:14.250> much<00:05:14.310> more

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
much bigger and takes up this much more

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.750 
much bigger and takes up this much more
power<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.260> yeah<00:05:16.260> that's<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.530> lot<00:05:16.680> more<00:05:16.830> money<00:05:16.890> so

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
power so yeah that's a lot more money so

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.370 
power so yeah that's a lot more money so
this<00:05:18.330> is<00:05:18.419> probably<00:05:18.630> gonna<00:05:18.750> be<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.990> hot<00:05:19.110> card

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
this is probably gonna be the hot card

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.090 
this is probably gonna be the hot card
I'm<00:05:20.130> predicting<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.820> 9800<00:05:21.540> GTX<00:05:22.470> it's<00:05:23.010> gonna

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
I'm predicting the 9800 GTX it's gonna

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.380 
I'm predicting the 9800 GTX it's gonna
be<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.310> hot<00:05:23.430> card<00:05:23.700> for<00:05:23.850> performance<00:05:24.300> and

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
be the hot card for performance and

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.990 
be the hot card for performance and
price<00:05:24.630> I<00:05:25.190> thought<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:26.250> know<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.370> looked<00:05:26.820> at<00:05:26.910> it

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
price I thought you know I looked at it

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.100 
price I thought you know I looked at it
I<00:05:27.030> was<00:05:27.120> thinking<00:05:27.419> you<00:05:27.479> know<00:05:27.570> it's<00:05:27.810> gonna<00:05:27.900> be<00:05:28.080> a

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
I was thinking you know it's gonna be a

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.659 
I was thinking you know it's gonna be a
million<00:05:28.650> dollars<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:29.220> then<00:05:29.280> I<00:05:29.370> looked<00:05:29.520> at<00:05:29.610> the

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
million dollars and then I looked at the

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:30.950 
million dollars and then I looked at the
price<00:05:29.790> tag<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.180> did<00:05:30.750> it<00:05:30.840> like<00:05:30.900> a

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
price tag and I did it like a

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.469 
price tag and I did it like a
double-take<00:05:31.410> whoa<00:05:31.700> it's<00:05:32.700> not<00:05:32.880> not<00:05:33.270> at<00:05:33.360> all

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
double-take whoa it's not not at all

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.760 
double-take whoa it's not not at all
what<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:33.660> thought<00:05:33.780> it<00:05:33.900> was<00:05:33.990> gonna<00:05:34.110> be<00:05:34.169> so

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
what I thought it was gonna be so

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.820 
what I thought it was gonna be so
excellent<00:05:35.280> price<00:05:35.990> amazing<00:05:36.990> performance<00:05:37.620> I

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
excellent price amazing performance I

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.580 
excellent price amazing performance I
keep<00:05:38.669> saying<00:05:38.880> that<00:05:39.050> almost<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.140> same<00:05:40.289> speed

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
keep saying that almost the same speed

keep saying that almost the same speed
as<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.740> GX<00:05:41.430> 2<00:05:41.610> it's<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:41.940> little<00:05:42.300> slower<00:05:42.510> at<00:05:42.660> some

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
as the GX 2 it's a little slower at some

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.930 
as the GX 2 it's a little slower at some
resolutions<00:05:43.350> at<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.919> uber<00:05:44.160> high<00:05:44.310> resolutions
