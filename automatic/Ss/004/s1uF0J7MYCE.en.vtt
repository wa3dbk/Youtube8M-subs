it's the deed hammering on to the fourth
it's<00:04:31.550> very<00:04:31.760> important<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.240> keep<00:04:32.919> the

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
it's very important to keep the

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.980 
it's very important to keep the
alternating<00:04:34.430> bass<00:04:34.699> going<00:04:35.180> in<00:04:35.330> this<00:04:35.479> case<00:04:35.720> it's

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
alternating bass going in this case it's

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.240

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.250 

now<00:05:01.610> you'll<00:05:01.760> notice<00:05:01.970> vibrato<00:05:02.540> is<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.780> big<00:05:02.990> part

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
now you'll notice vibrato is a big part

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.170 
now you'll notice vibrato is a big part
of<00:05:03.350> this<00:05:03.500> as<00:05:03.710> well<00:05:03.920> but<00:05:04.490> just<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:04.850> call<00:05:05.030> out

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
of this as well but just to call out

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.580 
of this as well but just to call out
what<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.450> right<00:05:05.630> hands<00:05:05.990> up<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.260> while<00:05:06.440> I'm

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
what the right hands up to while I'm

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.680 
what the right hands up to while I'm
doing<00:05:06.890> this<00:05:07.040> it<00:05:07.970> starts

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.490 

the<00:05:14.110> hammer<00:05:14.320> on<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:14.800> I'm<00:05:14.890> pinching<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:17.020> second

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
the hammer on so I'm pinching the second

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:27.930 
the hammer on so I'm pinching the second
and<00:05:17.680> the<00:05:17.770> fourth<00:05:17.980> strings

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.730 

you

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.680 

so<00:05:32.280> follow<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.729> right<00:05:32.910> hand<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.270> just<00:05:33.419> play

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
so follow the right hand and just play

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:40.740 
so follow the right hand and just play
that<00:05:33.870> over<00:05:34.199> and<00:05:34.320> over<00:05:34.530> until<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.800> get<00:05:35.070> that

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:50.409 

again

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.390 

it's<00:05:51.139> more<00:05:51.349> important<00:05:51.710> that<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:51.830> hear<00:05:52.159> what's

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
it's more important that you hear what's

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.860 
it's more important that you hear what's
going<00:05:52.639> on<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:53.000> then<00:05:53.090> you<00:05:53.120> try<00:05:53.419> to<00:05:53.449> emulate

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
going on and then you try to emulate

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.779 
going on and then you try to emulate
rather<00:05:54.500> than<00:05:54.710> to<00:05:54.889> for<00:05:55.099> me<00:05:55.220> to<00:05:55.370> sit<00:05:55.550> here<00:05:55.580> and

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
rather than to for me to sit here and

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.969 
rather than to for me to sit here and
tell<00:05:56.060> you<00:05:56.120> exactly<00:05:56.300> because<00:05:56.960> it's<00:05:57.169> again<00:05:57.830> in

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
tell you exactly because it's again in

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.439 
tell you exactly because it's again in
this<00:05:58.129> case<00:05:58.370> it's<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.699> lot<00:05:58.849> easier<00:05:59.030> done<00:05:59.419> than

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
this case it's a lot easier done than

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.529 
this case it's a lot easier done than
said<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:01.220> order<00:06:01.729> of<00:06:01.879> the<00:06:02.000> picking<00:06:02.389> that's

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
said the order of the picking that's

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:10.310 
said the order of the picking that's
going<00:06:02.840> on<00:06:02.990> here<00:06:03.229> but<00:06:03.409> I'll<00:06:03.500> slow<00:06:03.740> it<00:06:03.860> down

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.690 

you

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.010 

okay<00:06:17.270> so<00:06:17.330> what's<00:06:17.630> happening<00:06:18.020> there<00:06:18.260> is

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.340 

you

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.500 

now<00:06:25.500> so<00:06:26.500> I'm<00:06:26.650> sliding<00:06:27.070> up<00:06:27.400> using<00:06:28.060> my<00:06:28.270> ring

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
now so I'm sliding up using my ring

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.120 
now so I'm sliding up using my ring
finger<00:06:28.990> on<00:06:29.170> the<00:06:29.890> ninth<00:06:30.670> fret<00:06:31.000> up<00:06:31.650> two<00:06:32.650> frets<00:06:32.890> to

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
finger on the ninth fret up two frets to

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.340 
finger on the ninth fret up two frets to
the<00:06:33.250> eleventh<00:06:33.700> and<00:06:33.880> following<00:06:34.870> it<00:06:35.020> with<00:06:35.200> my

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
the eleventh and following it with my

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.130 
the eleventh and following it with my
middle<00:06:35.410> finger<00:06:36.240> to<00:06:37.240> the<00:06:37.270> tenth<00:06:37.660> fret<00:06:37.900> of<00:06:38.110> the

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
middle finger to the tenth fret of the

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:49.190 
middle finger to the tenth fret of the
second<00:06:38.650> string

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.430 

then<00:06:50.200> back<00:06:50.440> down<00:06:50.670> same<00:06:51.670> two<00:06:51.880> notes<00:06:52.320> to<00:06:53.320> the

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
then back down same two notes to the

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:08.860 
then back down same two notes to the
room<00:06:53.620> back<00:06:54.370> to<00:06:54.400> the<00:06:54.670> day<00:06:54.850> again

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.170 

you

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.779 

you

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.850 

and<00:07:16.939> that's<00:07:17.389> the<00:07:17.569> intro<00:07:17.900> so<00:07:18.199> it's<00:07:18.319> done<00:07:18.529> twice

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
and that's the intro so it's done twice

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.489 
and that's the intro so it's done twice
again<00:07:19.339> focus<00:07:19.939> on<00:07:20.089> hearing<00:07:20.960> what<00:07:20.990> you<00:07:21.229> wanted

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:21.499 
again focus on hearing what you wanted

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:24.369 
again focus on hearing what you wanted
to<00:07:21.620> sound<00:07:21.800> like<00:07:22.870> emulating<00:07:23.870> what<00:07:23.990> your<00:07:24.139> arm<00:07:24.259> is

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:24.379 
to sound like emulating what your arm is

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:26.739 
to sound like emulating what your arm is
doing<00:07:24.740> and<00:07:24.919> also<00:07:25.729> the<00:07:25.849> vibrato<00:07:26.300> is<00:07:26.539> very

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:26.749 
doing and also the vibrato is very

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:28.869 
doing and also the vibrato is very
important<00:07:27.229> in<00:07:27.319> that<00:07:27.439> intro<00:07:27.860> you<00:07:28.490> know<00:07:28.580> give<00:07:28.789> it

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 
important in that intro you know give it

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:33.119 
important in that intro you know give it
a<00:07:28.939> little<00:07:29.120> pressure<00:07:29.779> as<00:07:30.110> you're<00:07:30.499> shaking

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.129 

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:37.059 

let<00:07:34.129> the<00:07:34.249> guitar<00:07:34.580> ring<00:07:34.849> out
