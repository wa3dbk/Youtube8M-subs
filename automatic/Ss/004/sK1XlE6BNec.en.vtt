on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.970> blade<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.990> doesn't<00:01:43.380> open<00:01:43.590> no

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
on the blade so that it doesn't open no

matter<00:01:44.670> how<00:01:44.759> loose<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.540> make<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.530> screw

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
matter how loose you make this screw

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.340 
matter how loose you make this screw
right<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:48.180> doesn't<00:01:48.570> want<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.930> fly<00:01:49.049> open

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
right here it doesn't want to fly open

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.520 
right here it doesn't want to fly open
but<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.329> take<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.899> flick<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.350> real

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
but if you take it and flick it real

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.190 
but if you take it and flick it real
good<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.490> flies<00:01:54.180> open<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.840> thought<00:01:58.020> I'd

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
