00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
a little bit old school so let's talk

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.880 
a little bit old school so let's talk
apple<00:00:16.710> rumors<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.430> iphone<00:00:18.000> 5<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.869> word<00:00:19.590> came

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
apple rumors and iphone 5 a word came

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890 
apple rumors and iphone 5 a word came
out<00:00:20.070> today<00:00:20.310> via<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.939> loop<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.600> first

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
out today via the loop and first

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.800 
out today via the loop and first
reported<00:00:22.500> from<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> loop<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.400> macrumors<00:00:24.240> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
reported from the loop on macrumors that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.080 
reported from the loop on macrumors that
we<00:00:24.990> are<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> iphone<00:00:26.730> 5

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
we are not going to see the iphone 5

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.650 
we are not going to see the iphone 5
until<00:00:27.740> 2012<00:00:28.740> which<00:00:29.279> actually<00:00:29.550> makes<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.359> lot<00:00:30.420> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
until 2012 which actually makes a lot of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.080 
until 2012 which actually makes a lot of
sense<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> loop<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> claiming<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
sense so the loop is claiming that it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.959 
sense so the loop is claiming that it
was<00:00:33.360> delayed<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.680> had<00:00:34.829> normally<00:00:35.250> been<00:00:35.550> thought

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
was delayed it had normally been thought

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.790 
was delayed it had normally been thought
that<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.329> were<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.079> iphone<00:00:37.500> 5

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

following<00:01:14.549> CES<00:01:15.049> in<00:01:16.049> January<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.549> had<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:17.880> kept

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
following CES in January so had we kept

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810 
following CES in January so had we kept
the<00:01:18.689> original<00:01:18.780> release<00:01:19.320> cycle<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.130> new

the original release cycle of new
iPhones<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.540> June<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.439> would<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.619> been

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
iPhones in June there would have been

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.410 
iPhones in June there would have been
about<00:01:22.860> six<00:01:23.369> months<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.880> between<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
about six months in between the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.929 
about six months in between the
varieties<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.049> iPhone<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.670> saw<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
varieties and iPhone and when we saw the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
varieties and iPhone and when we saw the
iphone<00:01:27.420> 5<00:01:27.689> which<00:01:28.020> certainly<00:01:28.409> would<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.710> made

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
iphone 5 which certainly would have made

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.330 
iphone 5 which certainly would have made
for<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> few<00:01:29.790> upset<00:01:30.479> people<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> having<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
for a few upset people so having the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.950 
for a few upset people so having the
iphone<00:01:32.759> come<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> few<00:01:33.450> months<00:01:33.720> later

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
iphone come out a few months later

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.940 
iphone come out a few months later
perhaps<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> early<00:01:35.640> part<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.259> 2012<00:01:37.259> does

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
perhaps in the early part of 2012 does

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.490 
perhaps in the early part of 2012 does
give<00:01:38.280> us<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.909> unified<00:01:39.570> release<00:01:40.079> cycle

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
give us actually a unified release cycle

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
give us actually a unified release cycle
so<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.950> probably<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.640> same<00:01:41.970> iphone<00:01:42.450> come

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so we probably see the same iphone come

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.730 
so we probably see the same iphone come
out<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.500> verizon<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.399> AT&amp;T<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> JRE<00:01:46.470> time

I<00:02:13.349> am<00:02:13.469> that<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:13.739> see<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.129> lot<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.340> devices

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
I am that we see in a lot of devices

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.670 
I am that we see in a lot of devices
however<00:02:15.629> it's<00:02:15.810> still<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.469> more

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
however it's still one of the more

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.640 
however it's still one of the more
popular<00:02:16.890> phones<00:02:17.719> around<00:02:18.719> Apple<00:02:19.379> short

popular phones around Apple short

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.039 
popular phones around Apple short
certainly<00:02:20.129> not<00:02:20.340> suffering<00:02:20.849> from<00:02:21.180> lack<00:02:21.989> of

certainly not suffering from lack of

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.759 
certainly not suffering from lack of
sales<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.310> laying<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.819> iphone<00:02:24.269> 5

sales so the laying the iphone 5

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.319 
sales so the laying the iphone 5
certainly<00:02:25.769> makes<00:02:25.950> sense<00:02:26.219> as<00:02:26.370> well<00:02:26.609> perhaps<00:02:26.999> to
