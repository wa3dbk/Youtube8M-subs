that's part of the meaningful use
especially<00:06:03.870> stage<00:06:04.470> 2<00:06:04.950> so<00:06:05.430> they<00:06:05.820> do<00:06:05.880> offer<00:06:06.240> that

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
that have this system are very very

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.410 
that have this system are very very
happy<00:07:10.720> with<00:07:10.750> it<00:07:11.200> as<00:07:11.830> far<00:07:12.220> as<00:07:12.370> its<00:07:12.580> capability

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420 
happy with it as far as its capability

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.720 
happy with it as far as its capability
some<00:07:14.230> would<00:07:14.440> even<00:07:14.740> say<00:07:15.100> that<00:07:15.610> it<00:07:16.060> is<00:07:17.190> quite<00:07:18.190> the

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
some would even say that it is quite the

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.880 
some would even say that it is quite the
robust<00:07:19.180> system<00:07:19.780> and<00:07:19.990> can<00:07:20.200> do<00:07:20.410> just<00:07:20.770> about

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.890 
robust system and can do just about

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.310 
robust system and can do just about
anything<00:07:21.400> that<00:07:21.640> you<00:07:21.910> would<00:07:22.060> like<00:07:22.270> it<00:07:22.480> to<00:07:22.510> do<00:07:22.840> if

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.320 
anything that you would like it to do if

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.050 
anything that you would like it to do if
you<00:07:23.710> know<00:07:23.950> how<00:07:24.190> to<00:07:24.250> do<00:07:24.640> it

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
you know how to do it

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.100 
you know how to do it
so<00:07:25.600> I<00:07:26.410> think<00:07:27.100> this<00:07:27.550> is<00:07:27.610> a<00:07:27.760> good<00:07:28.030> system<00:07:28.300> and<00:07:28.570> I

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
so I think this is a good system and I

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.620 
so I think this is a good system and I
wanted<00:07:29.440> to<00:07:29.500> do<00:07:29.770> a<00:07:29.800> review<00:07:30.100> on<00:07:30.610> it<00:07:30.640> and<00:07:30.970> let<00:07:31.240> some

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
wanted to do a review on it and let some

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.320 
wanted to do a review on it and let some
of<00:07:31.780> you<00:07:31.900> know<00:07:32.170> the<00:07:33.040> capabilities<00:07:33.880> that<00:07:34.120> this

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 
of you know the capabilities that this

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.570 
of you know the capabilities that this
system<00:07:34.780> has<00:07:35.080> and<00:07:35.620> I<00:07:35.710> hope<00:07:35.920> that<00:07:36.130> this<00:07:36.250> helps

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.580 
system has and I hope that this helps

00:07:36.580 --> 00:08:08.930 
system has and I hope that this helps
you<00:07:36.700> today

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.000
