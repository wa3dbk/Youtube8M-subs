00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.869
 Mercedes Benz inventor of the automobile worked for decades all more 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:15.310
 for sure 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.310
 in traffic 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.409
 he attempts 1939 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:26.399
 A systematic research takes place starting from 1959 the pioneer work under free 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.399
 sky 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.130
 Frauenthal speed 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.130
 maximum 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.390
 cool 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.390
 greater acceleration through a hot water package is 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 practically has collisions 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.070
 with other vehicles 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.719
 even then the safety concept of Mercedes Benz 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.170
 instead of fixed passenger space 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.440
 Crumple zones in front and behind 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
 Energy absorbed 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.350
 already presented in 1951 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.490
 the initiatives of Mercedes Benz 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.490
 the security cell closed 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.340
 First tested on a simple scheme, finally I have here in 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 Monte Carlo 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.400
 which were closed in 1972 in a special halls for production 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.360
 all kinds 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.970
 last night 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 on account 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 recorded and evaluated 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.150
 further milestones 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.610
 Plastic and had gone away 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.600
 how safe we ​​are also in the construction of the lightweight construction 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.720
 Industries back 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.549
 100 hours left 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.370
 as a chance for survival 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.730
 modern computer systems 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.760
 the community order was interrupted 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.620
 for example 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.950
 Improvements to the chassis 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.030
 the car steering rear axle 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.220
 before components or components go into production 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.140
 5 it was 1 and millions of kilometers 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.400
 test track 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.270
 in the foreground of all considerations 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.710
 at Mercedes Benz, people are always ticking
