00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
which really is that we think is ash ash

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.080 
which really is that we think is ash ash
check<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:11.280> they're<00:01:11.520> great<00:01:12.000> pits<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
check but they're great pits and as the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.060 
check but they're great pits and as the
food<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.299> burning<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.619> come<00:01:16.829> along
