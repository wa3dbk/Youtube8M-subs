00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.420
 hello guys in this fast video 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.260
 I want to show you my first job at 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.510
 on peace 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.000
 I want to thank cira for some 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.460
 straight he gave me the greeting bye 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.300
 turn the tips he gave me are 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.590
 about buying plates because they are 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
 come to know of this thing 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.100
 because practically the plates are not 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 all the same there are dishes or too much 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:45.039
 soft and bettin and a little more rigid than 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.329
 from what I perceived they are more ideal 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.920
 for this technique 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.989
 I still don't have the dishes 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.750
 buy these here I talk about 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.280
 those a little more rigid but will be the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.620
 next purchase I will make in these 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.030
 days then I will show you this now 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.519
 this job 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.800
 it is a parure and while i 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.770
 earrings to make the pendant mi 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.720
 I am inspired by the pendant bar 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.130
 which came out in the last and shawn james 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.910
 number 35 of the talented and liana 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.910
 manor and I'm talking about the pendant 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 Mediterranean 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.670
 then what I realized is 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.920
 this is obviously not the same here 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.380
 however, she is about the same as yours 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.740
 work used a drop 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.009
 I used instead 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.880
 then trickles maybe there are differences with 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:43.960
 the different measurement beads 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.170
 I used these sedans in blue and 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.380
 these other black ones I bought from 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:56.340
 obi sedans show you what these are 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:02.009
 in blue 6 mm are these here in glass 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:06.090
 and then these other 4 mm in is always 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.090
 purchased from obi sedans 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.150
 as regards the wheels instead o 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:19.360
 used both in coloring 11 0 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:22.510
 that 15 0 this here that the new kiro kyle 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.340
 04 55 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:32.190
 here then surely the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.959
 precise name pretender 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.150
 this also because they are at the very first 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.440
 experience but also because unfortunately 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.870
 slices didn't make it much easier 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.600
 these bettins and I also bought them 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.810
 if you obi sedans and have me 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.500
 subsequently told that these ghettos 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.780
 I am 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.260
 when soft for this type of 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.500
 technique in fact as you can see in 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.519
 some points the kittens are 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.280
 quite undulating although I have 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:11.260
 made of very light points or otherwise 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.799
 I tried to get them then used 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.680
 crystals all the jets the trickles and even 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:24.430
 different sizes of say swarovski from 4 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.639
 and from three and nothing what else to say this 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.620
 technique I like a lot and I'm sure 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.650
 I will also do other things 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.210
 why 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.780
 not only do I find a technique I find one 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.290
 very fascinating technique then I have 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:46.110
 inserted here a say from 3 mm and here one 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:48.150
 rail from 11 then I realized the 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.570
 in this way I inserted a 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.520
 ring and then the chain that I don't have 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.220
 still that buffon I don't know tell you what 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.920
 think of this one of this first 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.780
 work 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.200
 obviously the colors are always al 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.830
 usually some colors and stanzas because 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:16.730
 me if I don't make something that is a 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:22.520
 little bit whimsical I am not here 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:25.910
 then I'll show you the earrings too 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.940
 the earrings are very simple 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.320
 made with the basic module of his 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.830
 tarsiers seem to go blue and black lines 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:42.510
 here a local from the same same type 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.300
 workmanship here at the top and then nothing 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.040
 as a final I wanted to insert this b 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.690
 cone always jet say stretched so 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.450
 to embellish a little more 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.560
 the earring is finally I realized 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:01.620
 same the nuns with a thread 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:07.290
 silver metallic 0 60 mm then ho 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:10.200
 also included b with sini 3 mm a 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:16.110
 then here is another thing on the back 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:19.200
 finished this way you see ho 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.020
 used the 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.930
 the false alcantara but I have not used 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.449
 the ultra his and is in my opinion 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.050
 the ultra his best ideas for 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.729
 this type of processing because it is not 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.889
 like this kind of singing since that 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.680
 has the fabric inside and that tends a 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.800
 bit to fray while the ultra suede 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.880
 and not to this kind of problem 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.650
 so in my opinion yes fits more to 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.360
 this type of processing 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:57.350
 so I didn't use it, though 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:59.870
 this then another thing I wanted 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.849
 tell you regarding the thread I have 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.220
 used 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:08.449
 I initially made attempts and 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.110
 trying to make earrings 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:15.740
 This so my third attempt I 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.949
 used primarily this wine then 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.250
 the classic weaving thread then the 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:24.650
 but I realized that 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:28.669
 he tended to pull the strips too tightly 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.060
 therefore already the slices slip in more i 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.910
 points that I made with this up not 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.330
 I could see he was pulling too hard 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.370
 tended to attract a little bit too much 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.490
 the flat then I finally decided 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:47.030
 to use this thread which is a good one 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:55.120
 very simple filament purchased in 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:57.440
 haberdashery and it's really thin you see it is 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.520
 nothing I found very, very much 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:04.160
 better with this type of thread that stretches 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.070
 to leave the plates soft between 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.790
 them and don't pull too much and then one thing 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:13.100
 much in favor of this thread and what not 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:17.510
 it is absolutely seen in the processing 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:20.900
 and avoid buying so many 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.420
 threads how many and how many are we say the 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.580
 strip colors to avoid 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.550
 which in fact can be seen in the 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:31.220
 no working boys as I have you 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.640
 said before I hope my work of 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:37.280
 ice and nothing I expect yours 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:41.570
 your comments your comments 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.790
 criticisms they always make always 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.710
 pleasure they do well whatever it is 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:49.250
 and indeed these rom videos very fast 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.080
 as I told you and nothing I greet you and there 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.800
 we hear at the next update 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.800
 Hello Hello hello
