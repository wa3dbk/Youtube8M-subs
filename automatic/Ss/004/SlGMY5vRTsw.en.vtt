00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.100
 tutorial and where do I get you now 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.110
 show you how to be in the new 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.660
 version of the new team version 1.6 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.700
 fireworks so rockets can black 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.590
 I've thought of it now as a whole 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.340
 first, of course, a workbench in the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 take a hand and just set here 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 so and next we need 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.060
 either a dye we can like 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 for example, here determine which color 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.439
 the fireworks are such with the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.719
 orange, we can too 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.280
 I show you headshots later 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.960
 we still need it now 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.540
 We can also do it with fireballs 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.660
 take and then we need paper 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.940
 And we still need black powder 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.200
 black powder and now we go oh yes 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 and maybe that's just not possible 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.879
 bad so that's already light 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.360
 it's the childish up on the workbench 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.449
 do this dye in the middle of the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.859
 fireball right next to it 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.420
 Everything is supposed to be down to the order 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.939
 No matter where you do something and you have to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 Do not go clay or fire balls with pure 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.140
 do and here the black powder 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.229
 now you can even more that goes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.979
 not now we have this one 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.330
 sternen is the issue here because fireworks 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.540
 the pacted the middle of crafting 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.770
 feldes now paper a black powder 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 because you can still here too 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 1 2 behind 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 then the rocket flies higher at 3 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.689
 she flies even higher 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.060
 i always take two the second height 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.070
 and now you have papers left here 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.250
 make one already you have the fire department 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.909
 just so i make it very short 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.939
 do it and show it to you 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.520
 whole times and with a right click 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.280
 on the ground and the thing goes 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.170
 in the air 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.950
 that's the way it is, and I got it all 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:01.230
 now heads again with creeper 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.880
 and as loud only briefly so and indeed 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.229
 With glue heads could be the same 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.620
 Also, just do it in the middle 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.090
 now just do it around black powder 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.470
 you do not necessarily need one 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.310
 Fireball is not me either 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.650
 just declared wrong that was my rock 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.650
 sorry where I explained here now 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.920
 that was not so in the powerplant wait 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.200
 I am very short again 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.330
 and that was true, you still have to 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.830
 still do dye in the middle and 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.120
 now you can, for example, the fireball 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.550
 Remove that I made now times 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.190
 and then allowed to do kryta head if yes 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.230
 again black powder and monastery ettal 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.550
 this firework star then too 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.320
 again in the middle pack the again 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.510
 just as here we have a 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.640
 black powder and now we have this 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.270
 rocket here and now i'll show you this 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.540
 and then here are such a slate 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.620
 head then arises under the sound is a 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.910
 a bit more now and there can 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.810
 then you have a lot of fun too 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.170
 expensive 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.489
 So I think it's really cool 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.100
 you can also take other colors for 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.820
 example blue or red I'll show you this 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:14.130
 all now again to red to emmental 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.720
 and just her pants red &amp; partners 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.850
 talking back to the middle of crafting 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.150
 to we could again now optional 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.760
 fireballs monastery and make it stop 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.110
 you do not have to do it optional right now 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.320
 here again paper and again yes in rome 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.330
 in the black book a maximum of three pure and 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.730
 Now we have this rocket here 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.900
 so and I will fly a little bit cost 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.980
 higher that looks really cool 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.300
 from yes and there you can really much fun 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.090
 have with this fireworks 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.400
 So I like it very well it can 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.770
 also in blue or in yellow or in 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.020
 green or yes it just gives me that way 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:05.650
 Remove them lose it beautiful 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:07.270
 is dark so exactly come then has 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.010
 your mission the whole fireworks so 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.170
 I think it's really cool 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.190
 Harman means that and that sounds right 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:19.780
 fun with the fireworks and good me 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:22.360
 Can I send away and is 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.190
 really cool with the fire departments and 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.790
 Although I gave her away up here I have 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.590
 the version 12 d 50 b so the snapshot 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.660
 was on this date where I 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.100
 Slimming is the team 1.4 context 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.170
 not yet out there but probably 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.330
 if i upload the video that is 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.010
 version is not there already 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.020
 wonder why I still have the snapshot 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.390
 and so well did you have the 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.770
 fireworks and one can still believe 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.720
 make something else I do not know 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.720
 no longer what it was but could 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.160
 you could do it now instead of the 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.240
 I could still think of heads here 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.430
 Something you could also diamonds 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.830
 not so with diamond I have 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.020
 never done 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.140
 Just do theirs I'll take it 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.250
 again rose red closed and practical 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.360
 again with pure and 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.130
 black powder as I have here again 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.450
 this firework star here is a paper around 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.150
 black powder that's why I do it now 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.810
 just a black powder and then 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.500
 we have here 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.570
 this title oh and then we emerge 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.419
 so stripes in the sky I think if 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.020
 one uses diamonds also looks right 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.010
 Well, that's really right 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.790
 really cool 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.310
 oh yes and in a 146 are the items 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:37.979
 now drop in the 3d 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.860
 monster and defeat a monster 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.689
 so 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.240
 diamond sword I'll show you the whole 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:47.139
 how that looks then I can 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.990
 show you here again 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.479
 the spider here and now are the 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.680
 but drobs in 3d only move 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.659
 if you are nice if you are now 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.430
 also switches quickly then are the 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:02.539
 again in 2d as otherwise so yes 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.939
 It was already with the intro video 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.409
 how to crafted fireworks so i know 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:08.539
 for now the best video and the 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:10.849
 sound quality is not that good either 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.039
 my new headset so has not now so 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.259
 took to the micro-you can hear probably already unfortunately 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.789
 is that but so well I wanted anyway 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.810
 Do this video and you all the 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.610
 not show again 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:25.069
 So I think you have as with this 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:26.629
 become fire and young and for all those 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.029
