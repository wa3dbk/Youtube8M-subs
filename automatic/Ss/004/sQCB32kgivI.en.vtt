00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 Cooperatives are associations of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.509
 people who join voluntarily 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.480
 to satisfy your needs 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.419
 economic and cultural 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.730
 In this sense, his work is guided by 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.820
 cooperative work the fia that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.190
 limited the farm we have to study 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.340
 to a cooperative and we distribute the base 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.620
 strengthen that cooperative but in turn 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.480
 we also convey this concern 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.410
 especially the guys who come here to 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.470
 learn to develop a garden 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.970
 organic in the form of 70 people who 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.650
 they approach on Saturday to Saturday good 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.690
 we also articulate strongly with the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.100
 school institutions because the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.440
 school institutions are the paw 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.270
 fundamental in this area action of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970
 cooperatives will see that this child 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.220
 missing is this guideline out there 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.409
 way of not having something formalized as 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.759
 cooperative but I already understand a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.520
 little this way so that when 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.929
 they remain with this volume of age and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.819
 no longer succeed in this cooperative 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.630
 to carry forward any kind of 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.600
 entrepreneurship 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.869
 the concept of cooperativism us 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 we teach it in a very simple way 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.280
 arrives at Andres the first aid worker 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.100
 is in our nature because the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.380
 plants take care of each other in their 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.320
 urban farm teach you how to cultivate 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.299
 land and produce organic food to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.640
 the time they promote cooperativism 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.610
 in workshops open to the whole community 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.069
 the management of urban gardens is a step 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.350
 important community on the way 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.080
 of producing the food facing the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.899
 good food sovereignty panty model 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.729
 this articulates strongly with training 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.920
 understand that you can achieve a lettuce 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.890
 in a flowerpot also articulate 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.530
 strongly with the social area where there 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.450
 an important link in achieving this 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.099
 food to this family that needs a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.450
 dish of food to this child and more than 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.450
 nothing how good we see the need 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.650
 in the effort that we have to achieve 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.080
 all right in this area 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.670
 to yourself and I want all the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.190
 theme of the garden to make the return 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.180
 at home and to be able to cultivate my 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.040
 own vegetables and all that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.680
 and be able to have a garden with some 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.609
 plants in a department like 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.689
 department I would like to have that 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:43.379
 vegetable we started the year in 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:47.200
 first place highlighting the need for 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.000
 produce a healthy food without the use of 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.159
 agrochemicals and agrochemicals 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.079
 for me it's fabulous because apart from 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.420
 learn for children 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.519
 so that they learn to eat vegetables to 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.840
 teach them to cultivate the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.840
 earth and all that that fabulous
