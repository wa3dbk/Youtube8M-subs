make an acrylic version of this as a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
make an acrylic version of this as a

temporary and the reason we do that is

temporary and the reason we do that is
we<00:01:31.799> want<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> patient<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> wear<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:34.049> replica<00:01:34.680> of

we want the patient to wear a replica of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
we want the patient to wear a replica of
this<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.549> about<00:01:35.640> three<00:01:35.880> weeks<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.840> can

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
this for about three weeks so we can

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.710 
this for about three weeks so we can
ascertain<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.070> lip<00:01:38.579> line<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.030> phonetics<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
ascertain the lip line the phonetics the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.719 
ascertain the lip line the phonetics the
the<00:01:40.020> aesthetics<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.520> we

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the aesthetics and then what we do is we

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.490 
the aesthetics and then what we do is we
mill<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.720> temporary<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.409> we

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
mill that that that temporary and we

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.780 
mill that that that temporary and we
copy<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.579> yes
