00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.220
 at risk 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.989
 long days and pleasant nights are 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.479
 roland deschain we find ourselves setting 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.579
 multiple teams on green as you have 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.409
 seen cut the first part of this 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.979
 gameplay because the is also shown 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.379
 score 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.329
 I was doing 10 to 8 pins of this 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.850
 game had certainly not started in 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.070
 best of ways but later I will do 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.680
 only two dead will pull five 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.420
 swarms before starting the comment is 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.909
 of real I wanted to open also for 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.890
 correctness to explain to you how much it is for me 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.520
 it was quite difficult laborious 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.429
 bring such a result 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.350
 as you know, match making has split 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.119
 in two parts that of the players who 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.860
 have the new maps and that of the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.360
 therefore, players who do not yet have them 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.020
 when I am looking for a match currently 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.909
 he always looks for games with i 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.679
 players who have new maps 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.270
 usually the players who buy 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.679
 the new maps are also those that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.720
 then the players play a little more 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.880
 more experienced and this already in a while 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.130
 therefore influenced so many times me 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.500
 I found myself having to try to win the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.479
 leave with my group and work hard 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.700
 for this reason without arriving at 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.130
 results not at all interesting 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.049
 we say that this happened at least the two 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.450
 thirds of the matches I made in 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.759
 new maps if not more in the rest 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.500
 third of those games we had a little 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.299
 more control than he considered a 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.140
 little bit like opportunities to do too 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.939
 a good result in 70 60 percent 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.920
 sometimes he just pulled a couple of 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.049
 here I think this swarm enemy enemies 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.840
 is due to the fact that finding precisely 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.940
 people are a bit more experienced and people are found 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.130
 who perhaps cares more about penalties 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.650
 I pull a swarm equity I don't know though 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.440
 I actually found it very often 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.670
 this fact that has created me quite a few 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.880
 perplexity 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.280
 beyond this we also add the files 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.600
 the mistakes I make and then 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.579
 then the setting in the new maps 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.350
 although my playing time remained 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.269
 almost unchanged 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.280
 it took longer to get to a 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.380
 similar result usually game 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.329
 always with my friends for fun and 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.790
 the results come on their own after a while 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.250
 is here instead they arrived after quite a while 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.490
 because all this is December 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.650
 for two reasons 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.510
 first of all because maybe someone 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.700
 tends a little bit and eliminates too much 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.700
 youtubers thinking that always in 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.520
 every breaker is perfect instead not 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.370
 so the second reason is that this 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.260
 phenomenon does not and does not affect only me 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.900
 but I think a bit all the players why 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.420
 seeing very few hundred from youtube 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.550
 more on these maps 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.040
 since youtubers are nothing more than 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.440
 normal players in the end 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.510
 I guess that too much 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.000
 majority of players found themselves 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.640
 a little more difficult for the reasons 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.140
 listed first if you want in the comments 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.180
 write me also what was a 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.310
 let your experience be like this 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.190
 can also a little compare the various 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.540
 situations 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.320
 closed the parenthesis we return to the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.780
 game 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.580
 I have just recently taken the third swarm 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.240
 which was a really fast swarm 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.590
 around a little over 30 seconds and vi 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.500
 I show briefly in 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.840
 overlay the class for once 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.230
 I decided to use a class sti 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.880
 alt and I replaced the quick extraction 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.890
 with the silencer and then I put 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.600
 dexterity to compensate usually 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.400
 I prefer to use over the limit for 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.040
 arrive quickly from a location 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.100
 to the other or tactical mask in the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.100
 small maps instead here or just put 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.960
 dexterity to compensate for the replacement 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.850
 with the quick extraction silencer 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.100
 this thing obviously makes the class 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.260
 a little less powerful than that not 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.570
 silenced in less versatile however 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.080
 when the enemies really flow through you 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.990
 on like on green it could also 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.340
 I do not know, however, I do not know 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.840
 a new class for me but the first one 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.930
 time the video shows of 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.670
 I usually use quite similar classes 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.520
 macro also lethal equipment in 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.130
 domination and demolition is a classic e 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.930
 personally advise because it is ska 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.000
 racca weapon with a lot of scope and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.830
 also a lot of damage and also 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.170
 however it remains a weapon 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.280
 devastating 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.740
 the only flaw is that it takes a 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.300
 time to learn to manage 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.200
 well recoil but it's nothing 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.210
 complicated 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.650
 changing the subject I tried to 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.820
 summarize a little to all those 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.130
 tips or advice I gave 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.080
 in different comment live for how much 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.030
 concerns the game settings 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.690
 best that could help you 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.640
 improve your style of play 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.710
 let's start from the commands I advise you if 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.330
 you don't have a particular controller like 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.000
 that of the matt cutts of disgust 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.830
 of the bar to always use anyway 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.540
 the tactical mode takes a while 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.860
 get used to but with this mode 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:28.230
 you can easily do drop shot 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.300
 without ever having to remove the thumb 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.550
 from the analogical then without ever losing 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.500
 aiming this will help you a lot in the 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.290
 clashes one on one obviously there 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.090
 takes some time to get used to the 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.460
 second thing we can cure is 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.100
 audio and default audio 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.730
 personally it really makes me enough 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.830
 disgust 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.320
 already just starting from the menu music 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.330
 the main who maybe was there opened it 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.360
 the first day I bought call 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.520
 of duty but now it has really broken down 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.230
 that is from about the third day of 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.180
 game or completely deactivated 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.790
 music just to not have it in 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.430
 main world then ingame seems to me 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.290
 certain weeks when some music 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.000
 to finish the time things like that don't 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.680
 I'm completely sure why it is 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.360
 a long time that turned it off 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.850
 completely 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.670
 then there is the voice that in practice the voice 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.710
 would be all the ads short type 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.380
 we are losing b and we are conquering 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.420
 a that's the one there and it's too strong 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.010
 with respect to the game especially there 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.750
 notice if you play with headphones with 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.000
 TV better to leave a little more 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.100
 strong because in any case they are ipson plus 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.960
 confused instead with headphones and put it on 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.150
 the lower I leave him under half 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.350
 much 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.820
 I prefer to hear where they come from 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.370
 good shots than to hear if he is 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.590
 conquering me in a goal because 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.190
 I really say it not too strong 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.140
 and anyway I feel the same also 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.390
 other players' voices can 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.580
 adjust the advice not to keep them 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.260
 only too strong also because later 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.150
 there is always someone with the strongest microphone 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.010
 he has his own plan and they hold him up 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.990
 continuously with headphones which is a lot 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.550
 comfortable, however, from the options it seems to me 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.700
 maybe the podcast entry that does change 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.770
 that thing though that the minimum for 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.090
 conclude a last trick that yes 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.150
 can do but is not so indispensable 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.850
 use the visual for color blinds that 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.440
 makes the names of the enemies in orange there 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.960
 see on the minimal orange penny as 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.330
 in this video and the allies become 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.990
 blue and no sorry blue and that in 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:29.290
 teams with you blue in my opinion this 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.180
 minimum pale pcre color blinds ie me 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:34.570
 I prefer it for the combination of 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.430
 colors then you can simply try it 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.890
 to know that there is this possibility that 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.080
 see how better you are before 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.480
 close the video I wanted to thank in 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.610
 particular must teheran cod that would be 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.260
 right booster and I'll live knicks that too 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.370
 their youtube cores you find in 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.990
 signing up 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.310
 I thank you for watching and see you 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.310
 to the next video, hello everyone
