that's more fighting going on then for

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.770 
that's more fighting going on then for

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
example here we have AI against the AI

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.240 
example here we have AI against the AI
which<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.260> something<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.680> took<00:02:07.920> what<00:02:08.130> our

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
which is something that took what our

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
which is something that took what our
programmers<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:08.940> wanted<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:10.080> have

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
programmers really wanted to do to have

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.800 
programmers really wanted to do to have
Greek<00:02:10.440> soldiers<00:02:10.649> fighting<00:02:11.150> against<00:02:12.150> your

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
fighting we've tried to really maximize

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.000 
fighting we've tried to really maximize
that<00:02:18.209> intense<00:02:18.989> feel<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.500> example<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that intense feel for example with the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.740 
that intense feel for example with the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
kind of have to just see the pattern

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.180 
kind of have to just see the pattern
actually<00:02:54.480> or<00:02:54.750> how<00:02:55.019> we<00:02:55.110> fight<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:55.739> he's<00:02:55.920> got<00:02:56.100> the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.899 

so<00:04:24.500> like<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.919> showed<00:04:25.069> you<00:04:25.129> before<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:25.580> mean<00:04:25.819> you

so like I showed you before I mean you
get<00:04:26.210> your<00:04:26.389> your<00:04:26.720> triangle<00:04:27.289> combos<00:04:27.680> with<00:04:28.340> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
get your your triangle combos with the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.189 
get your your triangle combos with the
hop<00:04:28.669> slammed<00:04:29.000> down<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:31.930> some<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.080> other

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
hop slammed down and some of the other

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.629 
hop slammed down and some of the other
combos<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:33.740> find<00:04:33.949> any<00:04:34.099> other<00:04:34.129> two<00:04:34.430> games

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
combos that you find any other two games

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.930 
combos that you find any other two games
for<00:04:34.789> example<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:36.310> special<00:04:37.310> square<00:04:37.550> combo

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
for example the special square combo

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.200 
for example the special square combo
that<00:04:38.229> is<00:04:39.229> more<00:04:39.500> for<00:04:39.650> crowd<00:04:39.830> control<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.370> also

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
that is more for crowd control and also

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.610 
that is more for crowd control and also
something<00:04:41.509> that<00:04:41.659> we<00:04:41.900> added<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.349> i'll<00:04:42.440> show

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
something that we added that i'll show

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.899 
something that we added that i'll show
you<00:04:42.710> right<00:04:42.889> now<00:04:42.949> which<00:04:43.280> is<00:04:43.310> more<00:04:43.759> focused

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
you right now which is more focused

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:50.379 
you right now which is more focused
attack<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:49.400> leaves<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.759> vulnerable<00:04:49.789> at<00:04:50.270> the

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
attack that leaves you vulnerable at the

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.730 
attack that leaves you vulnerable at the
end<00:04:50.539> because<00:04:50.690> there's<00:04:51.020> there's<00:04:51.319> a<00:04:51.379> little<00:04:51.590> bit

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
end because there's there's a little bit

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.520 
end because there's there's a little bit
of<00:04:51.940> like<00:04:52.940> about<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.210> second<00:04:53.629> of<00:04:53.750> vulnerability

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
of like about a second of vulnerability

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.860 
of like about a second of vulnerability
that<00:04:54.770> if<00:04:55.190> you<00:04:55.370> end<00:04:55.520> up<00:04:55.610> in<00:04:55.759> a<00:04:56.210> big<00:04:56.509> group<00:04:56.690> of

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
that if you end up in a big group of

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.469 
that if you end up in a big group of
people<00:04:56.930> you're<00:04:57.440> most<00:04:57.740> likely<00:04:58.009> get<00:04:58.250> hit

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.670 

diversity<00:05:02.479> on<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:03.020> on<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.169> combat<00:05:03.500> was<00:05:03.530> a
