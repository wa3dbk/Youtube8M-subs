00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
check it out

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.920 
check it out
the<00:00:38.550> Sun<00:00:38.879> had<00:00:39.149> melted<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.700> p√∫blicas<00:00:41.700> wing<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.529 

wing<00:00:45.930> spar<00:00:48.350> yeah<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.770> I'm<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.640> huge<00:00:50.879> fan<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.270> hot

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
wing spar yeah so I'm a huge fan of hot

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.290 
wing spar yeah so I'm a huge fan of hot
glue<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.739> has<00:00:53.430> its<00:00:53.610> downsides

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
glue but it has its downsides

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.020 
glue but it has its downsides
obviously<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.500> sets<00:00:55.770> fast<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.489> since<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> use

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
obviously it sets fast and since you use

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
obviously it sets fast and since you use
but<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.350> leave<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> Sun<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.160> extreme

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
but you leave in the Sun or extreme

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.450 
but you leave in the Sun or extreme
temperatures<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.329> or<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> battery<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.829> maybe

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
temperatures like or a battery or maybe

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
temperatures like or a battery or maybe
a<00:01:02.579> speed<00:01:03.210> control<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.629> might<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.530> it's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
a speed control it might be and it's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.200 
a speed control it might be and it's
gonna<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.339> enough<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.880> just

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
gonna it's good enough that they just

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.670 
gonna it's good enough that they just
keep<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.630> mind<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.110> using<00:01:07.470> hot

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
keep that in mind if you're using hot

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.340 
keep that in mind if you're using hot
glue<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.189> well<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.689> cheap<00:01:09.960> easy<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
glue that well it's it's cheap easy to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
glue that well it's it's cheap easy to
use<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.890> might<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> best<00:01:11.610> application

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
use it might not be the best application

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
use it might not be the best application
for<00:01:12.630> every<00:01:12.840> application<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> after<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
for every application so after that I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.950 
for every application so after that I
built<00:01:14.790> another<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.659> set<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:15.930> my

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
built another one and set up my

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:53.719 
built another one and set up my
slingshot<00:01:16.290> check<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.070> out

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.030 

point<00:01:54.729> of<00:01:54.850> impact<00:01:58.649> let's<00:01:59.649> see<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.159> damage

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
point of impact let's see the damage

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:14.930 
point of impact let's see the damage
holy<00:02:03.600> cow<00:02:08.520> yeah<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.850> did<00:02:09.970> not<00:02:10.119> work

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.580 

cheaters<00:02:15.940> nothing<00:02:16.480> left

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:39.130 

they're<00:02:23.590> gonna<00:02:23.709> kill<00:02:24.010> someone<00:02:24.280> man<00:02:24.640> oh<00:02:25.800> my<00:02:27.450> god

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.810 

so<00:02:40.140> never<00:02:40.320> before<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:41.010> destroyed<00:02:41.430> three<00:02:41.700> hours

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
so never before I destroyed three hours

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.950 
so never before I destroyed three hours
apart<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.480> quickly<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.950> blender<00:02:44.960> it's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
apart so quickly that blender it's

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.920 
apart so quickly that blender it's
generated<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:48.320> pulled<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.410> back<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.590> good<00:02:49.890> I

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
generated I pulled it back a good I

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.170 
generated I pulled it back a good I
don't<00:02:51.930> know<00:02:52.080> I'd<00:02:52.230> say<00:02:52.970> 50<00:02:53.970> feet<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:55.370> 30<00:02:56.370> feet<00:02:56.640> so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
don't know I'd say 50 feet or 30 feet so

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.360 
don't know I'd say 50 feet or 30 feet so
here's<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> glider<00:02:57.720> F<00:02:58.020> did<00:02:58.260> after<00:02:58.980> an<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.160> dirt

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
here's the glider F did after an in dirt

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.740 
here's the glider F did after an in dirt
of<00:02:59.580> quite<00:03:00.140> disasters<00:03:01.140> crash<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:03.090> impacted<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
of quite disasters crash it impacted the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.810 
of quite disasters crash it impacted the
roofs<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.290> hard<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.980> steel<00:03:05.250> pieces<00:03:05.520> came

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
roofs so hard the steel pieces came

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.010 
roofs so hard the steel pieces came
apart<00:03:06.120> which<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.600> hot<00:03:07.440> seat<00:03:07.680> together

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
apart which I hot seat together

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.870 
apart which I hot seat together
this<00:03:10.020> was<00:03:10.230> quite<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.590> impact<00:03:11.130> so

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
this was quite the impact so

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.000 
this was quite the impact so
unfortunately<00:03:12.450> my<00:03:12.510> first<00:03:12.870> tent<00:03:13.230> Jesus<00:03:13.770> link

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
unfortunately my first tent Jesus link

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.830 
unfortunately my first tent Jesus link
shot<00:03:14.190> from<00:03:14.370> my<00:03:14.430> airplane<00:03:14.760> failed<00:03:15.450> this

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
shot from my airplane failed this

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.420 
shot from my airplane failed this
airplane<00:03:16.230> didn't<00:03:16.410> fly<00:03:16.620> more<00:03:16.830> than<00:03:16.980> 5<00:03:17.190> feet

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
airplane didn't fly more than 5 feet

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.250 
airplane didn't fly more than 5 feet
before<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:17.820> utterly<00:03:18.120> destroyed<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.080> what<00:03:19.230> I

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
before is utterly destroyed so what I

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.440 
before is utterly destroyed so what I
learned<00:03:19.500> from<00:03:19.680> all<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:20.090> first<00:03:21.090> this

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
learned from all this first this

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.750 
learned from all this first this
airplane<00:03:21.870> endured<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.410> lot<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:23.070> punishment<00:03:23.340> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
airplane endured a lot of punishment and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.460 
airplane endured a lot of punishment and
I<00:03:23.850> learned<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.090> lot<00:03:24.270> from<00:03:24.330> how<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.840> was<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.320> was

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
I learned a lot from how it was or was

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.050 
I learned a lot from how it was or was
not<00:03:25.500> destroyed<00:03:26.040> if<00:03:26.340> you've<00:03:26.520> watched<00:03:26.760> my<00:03:26.880> other

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
not destroyed if you've watched my other

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.670 
not destroyed if you've watched my other
episodes<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.750> know<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.200> nose<00:03:28.410> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
episodes you know that the nose the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.440 
episodes you know that the nose the
first<00:03:28.890> thing<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.280> gets<00:03:29.430> destroyed<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.390> I

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
first thing that gets destroyed so I

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.300 
first thing that gets destroyed so I
added<00:03:30.630> these<00:03:30.840> two<00:03:31.170> wooden<00:03:31.800> dowels<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
added these two wooden dowels on the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.340 
added these two wooden dowels on the
side<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:33.000> glued<00:03:33.570> them<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.050> way<00:03:34.170> up<00:03:34.200> along

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
side and glued them all the way up along

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.400 
side and glued them all the way up along
here<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.980> try<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.340> absorb<00:03:36.060> some<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.360> impact

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
here to try to absorb some of the impact

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.750 
here to try to absorb some of the impact
you<00:03:37.410> saw<00:03:37.620> from<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.890> video<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.520> hit

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
you saw from the video that this hit

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.760 
you saw from the video that this hit
them<00:03:38.910> really<00:03:39.360> really<00:03:39.600> hard<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.350> yet<00:03:40.560> was

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
them really really hard and yet was

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.440 
them really really hard and yet was
almost<00:03:40.950> zero<00:03:41.130> damage<00:03:41.640> near<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.120> nose<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.360> this

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
almost zero damage near the nose of this

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.940 
almost zero damage near the nose of this
airplane

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
airplane

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.670 
airplane
so<00:03:43.950> these<00:03:44.100> perform<00:03:44.580> amazing<00:03:45.590> absorbing<00:03:46.590> that

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
so these perform amazing absorbing that

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.470 
so these perform amazing absorbing that
damage<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.489> think<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:47.820> future<00:03:47.970> airplanes

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
damage so I think in future airplanes

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.820 
damage so I think in future airplanes
I'm<00:03:48.750> gonna<00:03:48.930> put<00:03:49.080> up<00:03:49.170> something<00:03:49.380> like<00:03:49.470> this

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
I'm gonna put up something like this

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.530 
I'm gonna put up something like this
throughout<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> whole<00:03:50.340> fuselage<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.420> other

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
throughout the whole fuselage the other

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.030 
throughout the whole fuselage the other
thing<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.810> learned<00:03:52.019> was<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.200> pretty<00:03:52.440> basic<00:03:52.590> when

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
thing I learned was a pretty basic when

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.110 
thing I learned was a pretty basic when
you're<00:03:53.130> trying<00:03:53.340> something<00:03:53.489> new<00:03:53.670> like<00:03:53.910> this

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
you're trying something new like this

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.310 
you're trying something new like this
start<00:03:54.720> slowly

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
start slowly

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.720 
start slowly
what<00:03:55.650> motivating<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.280> need<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.489> pull<00:03:56.700> that

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
what motivating you need to pull that

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.460 
what motivating you need to pull that
airplane<00:03:57.150> back<00:03:57.330> as<00:03:57.480> far<00:03:57.720> as<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:57.989> could<00:03:58.049> at<00:03:58.290> her

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
airplane back as far as I could at her

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.530 
airplane back as far as I could at her
eyes<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:59.190> have<00:03:59.580> no<00:03:59.700> idea<00:03:59.940> but<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.180> was<00:04:00.209> pretty

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
eyes I have no idea but I was pretty

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.960 
eyes I have no idea but I was pretty
stupid<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.230> next<00:04:01.440> time<00:04:01.680> I'm<00:04:02.160> gonna<00:04:02.430> pull<00:04:02.730> just

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
stupid so next time I'm gonna pull just

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.720 
stupid so next time I'm gonna pull just
a<00:04:03.090> few<00:04:03.480> feet<00:04:03.720> back<00:04:03.930> slowly<00:04:04.799> moved<00:04:05.100> further<00:04:05.340> for

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
a few feet back slowly moved further for

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.310 
a few feet back slowly moved further for
the<00:04:05.820> back<00:04:05.970> as<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.299> understand<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.870> principles

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
the back as I understand the principles

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.009 
the back as I understand the principles
in<00:04:07.410> art<00:04:07.560> play<00:04:07.829> here<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.790> all<00:04:08.940> your<00:04:09.150> screaming

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
in art play here and all your screaming

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.470 
in art play here and all your screaming
about<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.070> launch<00:04:11.250> replacement<00:04:11.940> least

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
about the the launch replacement least

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.090 
about the the launch replacement least
idolize<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.110> there<00:04:13.260> watch<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.530> video<00:04:13.799> it's

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
idolize that there watch the video it's

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.710 
idolize that there watch the video it's
so<00:04:14.190> clearly<00:04:14.430> when<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:14.850> surgical<00:04:15.209> tools<00:04:15.570> are

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
so clearly when that surgical tools are

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.690 
so clearly when that surgical tools are
pulling<00:04:16.049> on<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.290> airplane<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:17.310> can<00:04:17.430> see

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
pulling on this airplane you can see

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.080 
pulling on this airplane you can see
that<00:04:18.600> as<00:04:18.870> appalled<00:04:19.290> it<00:04:19.609> rotated<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.700> airplane

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
that as appalled it rotated the airplane

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.780 
that as appalled it rotated the airplane
like<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:22.019> then<00:04:22.919> as<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.070> wings<00:04:23.340> caught<00:04:23.669> the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
like this and then as a wings caught the

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.159 
like this and then as a wings caught the
air<00:04:23.970> its<00:04:24.600> forces<00:04:25.229> reading<00:04:25.530> through<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.770> seal

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
air its forces reading through the seal

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.170 
air its forces reading through the seal
so<00:04:26.860> I'm<00:04:26.919> thinking<00:04:27.189> I<00:04:27.310> gotta<00:04:27.490> move<00:04:27.639> this<00:04:27.819> before

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
so I'm thinking I gotta move this before

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.989 
so I'm thinking I gotta move this before
launch<00:04:28.389> hook<00:04:28.689> from<00:04:28.990> here<00:04:29.319> to<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.919> nose<00:04:30.129> so

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:30.999 
launch hook from here to the nose so

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.939 
launch hook from here to the nose so
that<00:04:31.030> pulls<00:04:31.599> it<00:04:31.870> through<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.229> air<00:04:32.349> rather

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
that pulls it through the air rather

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.580 
that pulls it through the air rather
than<00:04:33.360> twisting<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.449> to<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:34.599> river<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.560> I

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
than twisting it to the river so I

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.350 
than twisting it to the river so I
learned<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.889> lot<00:04:36.039> this<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.550> kind<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.759> a<00:04:36.849> fail<00:04:37.090> but

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
learned a lot this is kind of a fail but

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.420 
learned a lot this is kind of a fail but
watch<00:04:37.779> for<00:04:37.990> next<00:04:38.259> week's<00:04:38.439> episode<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:39.039> take<00:04:39.249> all

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.309 
watch for next week's episode I take all
these<00:04:39.610> learnings<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.300> put<00:04:40.749> it<00:04:40.840> into<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.050> new

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
these learnings and put it into a new

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.529 
these learnings and put it into a new
airplane<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.039> a<00:04:42.310> new<00:04:42.460> launch<00:04:42.729> set<00:04:42.969> up<00:04:43.060> maybe

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
airplane and a new launch set up maybe
