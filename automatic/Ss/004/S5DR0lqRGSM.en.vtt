00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
very very interesting changes the game a

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.279 
very very interesting changes the game a
little<00:00:23.910> bit<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.600> comes<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.019> flying

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
little bit when it comes to flying

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.769 
little bit when it comes to flying
against<00:00:25.890> tanks<00:00:26.189> I've<00:00:26.670> had<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> few<00:00:27.449> people

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
against tanks I've had a few people

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.599 
against tanks I've had a few people
commenting<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.380> videos<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.369> wanted

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
commenting on videos and I just wanted

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.849 
commenting on videos and I just wanted
to<00:00:29.730> test<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.179> out<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.480> myself<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.289> see

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to test it out for myself and just see

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.069 
to test it out for myself and just see
exactly<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.820> has<00:00:33.000> changed<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.899> thought

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
exactly what has changed and I thought

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.630 
exactly what has changed and I thought
why<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.350> make<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> quick<00:00:35.040> video<00:00:35.219> while<00:00:35.610> I'm

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
why not make a quick video while I'm

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.490 
why not make a quick video while I'm
added<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.180> show<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.420> guys<00:00:36.600> exactly<00:00:36.960> what<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
added to show you guys exactly what I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.860 
added to show you guys exactly what I
find<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.250> first<00:00:38.460> thing<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.850> tested<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.540> Jets

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
find the first thing we tested was Jets

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
find the first thing we tested was Jets
against<00:00:40.320> hangs<00:00:40.559> previously<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.700> would<00:00:41.910> have

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
against hangs previously this would have

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.060 
against hangs previously this would have
taken<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:42.629> two<00:00:42.989> strays<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.829> able<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
taken about two strays to be able to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
taken about two strays to be able to
kill<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> tank<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.270> would<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.510> had<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
kill the tank and they would have had to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
kill the tank and they would have had to
have<00:00:45.840> been<00:00:45.930> pretty<00:00:46.320> decent<00:00:46.770> stripes<00:00:47.100> since

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
have been pretty decent stripes since

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
have been pretty decent stripes since
the<00:00:48.030> update<00:00:48.149> however<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.140> clearly<00:00:49.559> takes<00:00:50.039> only

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the update however it clearly takes only

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.639 
the update however it clearly takes only
a<00:00:50.579> single<00:00:50.940> strafe<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.020> strafe<00:00:52.320> doesn't

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
a single strafe and that strafe doesn't

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
a single strafe and that strafe doesn't
even<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.489> good<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.910> well<00:00:54.360> as

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
even have to be that good as well as

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779 
even have to be that good as well as
testing<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.199> Jets<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.920> tested<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
testing with the Jets we tested with the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
testing with the Jets we tested with the
mini<00:00:57.059> guns<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> attack<00:00:58.050> posit<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
mini guns on the attack posit that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.680 
mini guns on the attack posit that
didn't<00:00:59.190> seem<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.730> any<00:00:59.969> difference<00:01:00.480> it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
didn't seem to have any difference it's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.540 
didn't seem to have any difference it's
exactly<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> same<00:01:01.590> amount<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.980> time<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
exactly the same amount of time as it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939 
exactly the same amount of time as it
was<00:01:02.730> before<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.359> patch<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:04.260> did<00:01:04.470> test<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
was before this patch we did test it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
was before this patch we did test it
with<00:01:05.100> rockets<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.760> grenade<00:01:06.299> launchers<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
with rockets and grenade launchers and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.410 
with rockets and grenade launchers and
it<00:01:07.409> seemed<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.950> take<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.610> less<00:01:08.820> damage<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it seemed to take a lot less damage to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
it seemed to take a lot less damage to
kill<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.750> again<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.770> our

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
kill it again with these so our

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.250 
kill it again with these so our
conclusion<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.990> player

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
conclusion is that if it's a player

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.469 
conclusion is that if it's a player
using<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> gun<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.189> has<00:01:14.520> explosive<00:01:15.119> rounds

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
using a gun that has explosive rounds

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
using a gun that has explosive rounds
it's<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:16.049> take<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.380> lot<00:01:16.710> less<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.159> kill<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it's gonna take a lot less to kill a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
it's gonna take a lot less to kill a
tank<00:01:17.640> than<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> used<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> from<00:01:18.869> what<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.170> saw

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
tank than it used to from what we saw

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.200 
tank than it used to from what we saw
when<00:01:19.560> testing<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> seemed<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.610> about<00:01:20.880> four

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
when testing it seemed like about four

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
when testing it seemed like about four
shots<00:01:21.570> from<00:01:21.810> an<00:01:21.960> RPG<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.530> any<00:01:23.100> type<00:01:23.430> of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
shots from an RPG or any type of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.969 
shots from an RPG or any type of
explosive<00:01:24.000> would<00:01:24.570> detonate<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.170> tank<00:01:25.590> without

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
explosive would detonate a tank without

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.310 
explosive would detonate a tank without
any<00:01:26.369> problems<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> huge<00:01:28.080> difference

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
any problems this is a huge difference

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200 
any problems this is a huge difference
from<00:01:28.710> before<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.130> patch<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.000> about

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
from before the patch when it was about

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.749 
from before the patch when it was about
