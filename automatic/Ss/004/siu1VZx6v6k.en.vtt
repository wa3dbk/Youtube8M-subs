00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:39.249 
to drag you through a whole bunch of

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:41.759 
to drag you through a whole bunch of
explaining<00:00:39.870> exactly<00:00:40.870> what<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:41.440> need<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.649> do

explaining exactly what you need to do
here<00:00:43.949> alright<00:00:44.949> so<00:00:45.159> you're<00:00:45.249> gonna<00:00:45.339> make<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.609> ramp

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
here alright so you're gonna make a ramp

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.110 
here alright so you're gonna make a ramp
and<00:00:47.109> you're<00:00:47.530> gonna<00:00:47.620> deactivate<00:00:48.159> the<00:00:48.699> blockade

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
and you're gonna deactivate the blockade

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.549 
and you're gonna deactivate the blockade
so<00:00:49.449> you<00:00:49.510> can<00:00:49.749> raise<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.319> ramp<00:00:51.749> and<00:00:52.749> then<00:00:53.350> once

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
so you can raise the ramp and then once

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
so you can raise the ramp and then once
you<00:00:53.710> do<00:00:53.859> that<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:55.239> will<00:00:55.449> activate<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:57.309> make

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
you do that you will activate it to make

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.199 
you do that you will activate it to make
it<00:00:57.729> go<00:00:57.909> underneath<00:00:58.239> so<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.870> ramp<00:00:59.049> stays<00:00:59.350> up

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:00.209 
it go underneath so the ramp stays up

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:08.880 
it go underneath so the ramp stays up
and<00:01:01.209> then<00:01:01.659> you<00:01:01.780> drive<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.139> Batmobile<00:01:02.319> on<00:01:02.709> it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.220 

okay<00:01:09.890> I<00:01:09.920> did<00:01:10.130> too<00:01:10.280> much<00:01:10.660> but<00:01:11.660> it's<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:11.990> there

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.840 
all right so now then you need Batman's
weight<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:15.800> get<00:01:16.010> out<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.220> Batmobile<00:01:16.730> you

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
weight so you get out the Batmobile you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.210 
weight so you get out the Batmobile you
stand<00:01:17.180> on<00:01:17.330> this<00:01:17.510> bat<00:01:17.810> symbol<00:01:18.140> right<00:01:18.650> here<00:01:18.860> that

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
stand on this bat symbol right here that

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.030 
stand on this bat symbol right here that
falls<00:01:19.460> out<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.790> box<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:21.110> other<00:01:21.650> part<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:21.980> the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
falls out the box the other part of the

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.660 
falls out the box the other part of the
ramp<00:01:22.280> then<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.120> use<00:01:23.330> your<00:01:23.540> remote<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:24.680> access

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
ramp then you use your remote to access

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.060 
ramp then you use your remote to access
the<00:01:26.000> Batmobile<00:01:26.510> again<00:01:26.870> while<00:01:27.440> still<00:01:27.860> standing

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
the Batmobile again while still standing

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.190 
the Batmobile again while still standing
on<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.640> bat<00:01:28.910> second<00:01:29.330> signal<00:01:29.900> right<00:01:30.020> there

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
on that bat second signal right there

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.510 
on that bat second signal right there
you<00:01:30.350> can<00:01:30.500> see<00:01:30.650> me<00:01:30.770> over<00:01:30.950> your<00:01:31.070> hand<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.430> there

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
you can see me over your hand in there

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.870 
you can see me over your hand in there
now<00:01:32.480> I<00:01:32.810> activate<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.650> blockade<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:34.370> I<00:01:34.400> can<00:01:34.640> go

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
now I activate the blockade so I can go

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.010 
now I activate the blockade so I can go
smoothly<00:01:35.240> across<00:01:35.720> without<00:01:36.560> falling<00:01:36.740> down<00:01:38.020> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
smoothly across without falling down and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.090 
smoothly across without falling down and
on<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.200> other<00:01:39.410> side<00:01:39.620> you're<00:01:39.800> gonna<00:01:39.860> see

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.850 
on the other side you're gonna see
another<00:01:40.340> rare<00:01:40.670> with<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.540> same<00:01:41.860> concept

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
another rare with the same concept

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.610 
another rare with the same concept
pretty<00:01:43.160> much<00:01:43.400> now<00:01:44.330> this<00:01:44.479> scene<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:45.260> seems<00:01:45.530> a

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
pretty much now this scene this seems a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.590 
pretty much now this scene this seems a
little<00:01:45.650> easy<00:01:46.130> but<00:01:46.610> when<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:46.940> was<00:01:47.150> going<00:01:47.450> through

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
little easy but when I was going through

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.310 
little easy but when I was going through
it<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:47.840> was<00:01:47.870> like<00:01:47.990> what<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.320> heck<00:01:48.620> do<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:48.830> do<00:01:48.950> it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
it I was like what the heck do I do it

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.420 
it I was like what the heck do I do it
but<00:01:51.320> again<00:01:51.530> I'm<00:01:51.680> just<00:01:51.830> going<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.100> make<00:01:52.190> it<00:01:52.310> easy

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
but again I'm just going to make it easy

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.370 
but again I'm just going to make it easy
as<00:01:52.610> possible<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.240> you're<00:01:53.690> gonna<00:01:53.780> be<00:01:53.960> activate

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
as possible so you're gonna be activate

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.800 
as possible so you're gonna be activate
though<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:56.440> it<00:01:57.440> holds<00:01:57.619> in<00:01:58.100> place<00:01:58.540> then<00:01:59.540> you<00:01:59.690> get

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
though so it holds in place then you get

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.120 
though so it holds in place then you get
a<00:01:59.840> you're<00:02:00.140> gonna<00:02:00.200> need<00:02:00.410> a<00:02:00.470> running<00:02:00.800> start<00:02:00.979> on

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
a you're gonna need a running start on

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.880 
a you're gonna need a running start on
this<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:01.850> back<00:02:02.570> all<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.869> way<00:02:02.990> up<00:02:03.200> rev<00:02:03.740> it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
this one so back all the way up rev it
