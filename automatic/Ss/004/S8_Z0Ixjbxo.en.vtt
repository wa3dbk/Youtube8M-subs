 Hello, people. Good morning, welcome. 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.599
 channel where creative and I'm back 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.359
 now in continuing evaluation had 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.359
 wires for the winter in 2014 I go 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.640
 show you the silva oil 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.320
 is a very light film very soft it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.080
 I'm not mistaken. 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.099
 is in a ball of 100 grams he has 1 200 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.440
 meters 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.540
 it is 82% acrylic 18% and polyamide is have 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.550
 so superbonita ceo colors 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.899
 I liked that the cni remember a little 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.320
 Dalmatian, right? 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.750
 I find it super cuddly is the indication of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.920
 needle for them 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.020
 I'm not mistaken it's just a peek 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
 here is 5 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.739
 I'm using needle and 6 and it's 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.350
 getting my job I'm getting 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.170
 making a huge scarf 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.560
 I took to work or on holiday 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.020
 Is'm doing is what will stay with 16 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.640
 side of each country can see how 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.920
 the reverse with this type of wire is in the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.810
 five first five careers 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600
 first points on each side making 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.700
 rice because if you only 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.400
 point 6, the work begins to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.130
 coiled starts to do so sabino 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.570
 It really does not work where 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.090
 people will show that we are doing 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.310
 a tri knit tricot with 16 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.710
 for example here at the beginning of this 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 career should certainly do 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.780
 worries followed point by point the rice to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.700
 people say you find then what is 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.759
 Come on then I'll do 6 always 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.130
 disregarding my assessment of this 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.820
 wire is remembering guys I have not won 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.700
 these style yarns 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.060
 have no manufacturer any store and 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.310
 the children I buy on the internet is the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.890
 risk is because sometimes we do not have 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.630
 a very cool notion of 15 and soft 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.610
 stones type of thing 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.560
 my rating is from the 10th grade to that 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.870
 very soft film 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.880
 it has an excellent yield and does not 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.190
 tolerating now how much I paid more 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.959
 when the band of about 14 15 reais more 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.150
 or at least I think that was it 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.690
 buy online at the horizon bazaar 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.930
 I recommend that you and other type 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.209
 I think with this ball if it does not 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.330
 a scarf I'm going to get very close to 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.000
 a scarf are in evaluation recommend 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.920
 I loved yarn and if you have to buy more 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.050
 a ball to continue the scarf I will 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.700
 buy same is this so it is remembering 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.320
