make sure it feels that same way but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.750 
make sure it feels that same way but
it's<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.870> know<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.560> many<00:02:27.680> people<00:02:28.070> especially

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
Nitty Gritty of this trick needs to look

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.280 
Nitty Gritty of this trick needs to look
a<00:02:37.490> little<00:02:37.640> bit<00:02:37.820> better<00:02:37.910> than<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.300> or<00:02:38.540> perform

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
a little bit better than this or perform

a little bit better than this or perform
better<00:02:39.440> than<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.070> um<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:41.420> know

better than this and um and you know

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.910 
better than this and um and you know
maybe<00:02:41.690> these<00:02:41.900> should<00:02:42.140> be<00:02:42.170> excluded<00:02:42.500> these

but<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.660> franchise<00:02:51.110> have<00:02:51.290> kind<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.560> been

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
but this franchise have kind of been

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.280 
but this franchise have kind of been
left<00:02:52.340> alone<00:02:52.550> have<00:02:53.090> been<00:02:53.120> ideas<00:02:53.960> in<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.140> back

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
left alone have been ideas in the back

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.720 
left alone have been ideas in the back
of<00:02:54.410> your<00:02:54.470> head<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.680> now<00:02:55.040> are<00:02:55.280> coming<00:02:55.640> to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
of your head that now are coming to

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.580 
of your head that now are coming to
fruition<00:02:55.910> after<00:02:56.390> all<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.600> time<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:57.020> think<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
fruition after all that time I think the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.190 
fruition after all that time I think the
online<00:02:57.980> element<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:58.940> what<00:02:59.240> we<00:02:59.540> were

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
online element is is what we were

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.440 
online element is is what we were
missing<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.250> now<00:03:01.550> obviously<00:03:02.180> that

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
missing and and now obviously that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.850 
missing and and now obviously that
technology<00:03:03.050> has<00:03:03.080> come<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.410> age<00:03:03.590> and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
technology has come of age and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.710 
technology has come of age and
everyone's<00:03:04.250> got<00:03:04.370> high<00:03:04.520> speed<00:03:04.790> data<00:03:05.000> access<00:03:05.450> so

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
everyone's got high speed data access so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.690 
everyone's got high speed data access so
I<00:03:05.960> feel<00:03:06.350> like<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.280> element<00:03:07.490> that

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
I feel like that is the element that

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.120 
I feel like that is the element that
that<00:03:08.390> we<00:03:09.020> really<00:03:09.320> were<00:03:09.440> striving<00:03:09.680> for<00:03:10.040> him

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130
