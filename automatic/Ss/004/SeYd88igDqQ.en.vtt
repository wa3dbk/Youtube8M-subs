00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.979
 yes 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.420
 there are people in the forum who ask us 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.160
 about streaming photos so we're going to 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.970
 talk a little about it 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.560
 the first thing that is streaming photos 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.320
 it is an icloud service that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.590
 store your photos for 30 days in 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.720
 the apple servers also called 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.460
 cloud and synchronizes with others 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.769
 devices that you have with the same 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.190
 apple video for example the ipod ipod 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:39.320
 touch pc or macintosh or also apple tv 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.100
 apart from these 30 days there is another limit 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.109
 that would be a thousand photos 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.079
 except in the frame in the pce that once 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.149
 downloaded are not removed in addition these 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.940
 photos do not count when calculating 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.280
 the space that apple offers in icloud 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.820
 that start with 5 gigas and 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.950
 later you can hire more 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.710
 if we want to activate it, we should enter 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.190
 within the menu in settings 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.610
 icloud on the top if not 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.530
 we associate the account created the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.130
 apple ide 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.369
 once activated stepped inside 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.210
 streaming photos and check the box 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.210
 of streaming photos 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.490
 on a computer in a pc 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.310
 would have to go inside start at 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.740
 control panel and we will appear icloud 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.860
 if it does not appear we have to look 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.570
 within itunes in help search 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.110
 updates 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.930
 it will appear 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.350
 the icloud control panel option 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.190
 to install it then once inside 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.510
 icloud this window appears 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.730
 we would have to check the box 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.530
 photos in streaming and within options 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.870
 gives us the option to select the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.270
 folders where we want it to be 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.300
 download or upload 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.560
 that in this case by default they appear 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.770
 images pictures string and both appear 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.550
 folders if I want to upload one in 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.770
 I would train inside this folder and 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.060
 I would drag the one I have on the computer 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.430
 to climb 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.870
 right now I do not have more but good in 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.390
 more that you would have to go inside 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.670
 System preferences 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.540
 icloud and check the photo box in 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.970
 streaming after you open there photo or 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.380
 opening to confirm that the option to 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.870
 streaming photos is enabled 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.390
 You can also modify from the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.250
 adjustments of photos in streaming in the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.620
 preferences of each of the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.280
 applications if you want to eliminate some 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.480
 photo on the iphone or the ipad on the ipod 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.520
 touch you have to have version 5.1 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.900
 until this version apple did not give the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.190
 option to eliminate them so that or that or if 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.680
 you have the 5.0 or 5.0.1 you would have 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.770
 eliminate them all turn it off just like 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.620
 you activate it more features by 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.280
 example the compatible formats would be 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.910
 jpg tiff png and most of the 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.810
 raw formats 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.180
 regarding apple tv if you want to see the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.520
 streaming photos you should enter 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.230
 in the streaming photos view of the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.530
 Internet section of the main menu 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.870
 of the apple tv and then it will ask you to 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.000
