00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 this 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.849
 hello friends in this video where I'm going to 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.040
 show a scent of marbella these 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.990
 figures of the jandro brand and 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.990
 approximately 40 centimeters 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.189
 and for the back of commerciality 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.240
 resulting this plastic that 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.500
 it's a little 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.500
 but they do not understand the offer 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.260
 it was much bigger 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.750
 but the figures 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.219
 It was completely new and the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.949
 Finishes did not look for anything 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.660
 that figure is usually in a thousand pesos 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.470
 here in Mexico US $ 80 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:05.890
 approximately 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:08.590
 and I found it 400 still I do not want 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.260
 buy it because as I commented not with 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.300
 a new touch that the figure had 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.250
 completely immobile and immobile and the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.260
 Finishes were not very good 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 this is a little smaller but say 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.060
 that the articulated which called me the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.930
 attention and let's see 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.690
 how about the figure 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.720
 as you will appreciate it has movement 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.000
 animal 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.000
 in the arms according to this articulated 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.710
 legs and we can move the knees 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.530
 they are not articulated I think so 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.750
 they were articulated the finish to simple 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.960
 view 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.000
 very well done the team to get it out to the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.330
 camera a little more to see if it is offered 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.330
 the best 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.750
 the paint is very well made the helmet 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.880
 It is very well finished 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.910
 all this is a 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.390
 it's like a plastic and background looks 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.510
 as well as what metal color the armor is 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.880
 You see very nice the other norm that I had 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.860
 seen a retinue a very plastic 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.040
 poor quality I did not know this and like that 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.110
 like that translucent 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.420
 all badly painted then that's what 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.420
 what I did not like about the current 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.950
 a break a few minutes because if they can 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.370
 see the air hand rather a little bit 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.590
 here for which I tried to move him not 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.890
 has let me do what came the best 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.530
 with an error 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.970
 thus hand but after 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.640
 be removing you have to do with 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.000
 strength comes a little hard maybe because 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.000
 the new 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.530
 you do not see that it brings any paint that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.060
 then this part of the hand came 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.400
 turned over you have to do it a little bit 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.310
 strong the first time to get it 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.410
 to right and now if you can appreciate to 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.750
 air 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.320
 with the extended hand as it comes in the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.320
 image d 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.099
 here is the figure 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.560
 it can be stopped without any problem 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.580
 the other 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.180
 I figured I had seen I was very much 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.180
 big 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.650
 Y 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.220
 the quality was not good the star of 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.910
 the brand itself 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.910
 but nevertheless 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.510
 I did not like it that much 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.510
 is about to buy it 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.100
 this figure I also coinciding 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.990
 true the price must be average 300 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.780
 thousand 200 500 pesos 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.780
 but even if I had left more expensive 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:22.050
 articulated figures interns only raid 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.050
 articulated arms 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.470
 the finish is much better where the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.470
 figure 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.149
 some structures 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.149
 I hope they subscribe to my channel
