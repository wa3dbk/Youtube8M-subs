major difficulty so you can't just about
scramble<00:02:29.709> up<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.860> fall<00:02:30.070> but<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.430> really

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
greasy so instead turn to go up this

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.090 
greasy so instead turn to go up this
gully<00:02:33.550> here<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.810> side<00:02:35.140> fall<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.769> then

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
gully here to the side fall and then

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.250 
gully here to the side fall and then
it's<00:02:36.910> almost<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.239> an<00:02:37.360> overflow<00:02:37.780> stream<00:02:38.079> let

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
it's almost like an overflow stream let

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.229 
it's almost like an overflow stream let
me<00:02:38.350> come<00:02:38.500> across<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:39.850> top<00:02:40.060> out<00:02:42.239> there's

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239

a<00:02:43.299> rope<00:02:43.480> up<00:02:43.660> again<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.680> there<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:46.209> little<00:02:46.239> water

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
a rope up again is there so little water

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.809 
a rope up again is there so little water
