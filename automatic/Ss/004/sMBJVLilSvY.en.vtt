spawning in your house I thought that

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.320 
spawning in your house I thought that
was<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.660> very<00:02:22.050> cool<00:02:22.470> idea<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.070> I've<00:02:23.820> never<00:02:24.030> seen

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
was a very cool idea and I've never seen

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.540 
was a very cool idea and I've never seen
that<00:02:24.390> before<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:25.260> probably<00:02:25.620> took<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.130> most

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
that before that probably took the most

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.780 
that before that probably took the most
time<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.240> do<00:02:27.390> because<00:02:27.840> i<00:02:28.260> said<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.220> uh<00:02:29.280> all

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
time to do because i said this uh all

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.750 
time to do because i said this uh all
this<00:02:30.180> cobblestone<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.050> maybe<00:02:31.290> four<00:02:32.250> blocks
