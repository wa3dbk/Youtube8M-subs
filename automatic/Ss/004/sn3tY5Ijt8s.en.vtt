00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
not really i'm just kind of because

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.810 
not really i'm just kind of because
justin<00:02:06.140> casters<00:02:06.590> been<00:02:06.770> here<00:02:07.010> for<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.430> year<00:02:07.490> so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
justin casters been here for a year so

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.570 
justin casters been here for a year so
i'm<00:02:07.940> kind<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.380> I'd<00:02:09.380> sort<00:02:09.710> of<00:02:09.860> follow<00:02:10.430> him

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
i'm kind of I'd sort of follow him

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.950 
i'm kind of I'd sort of follow him
around<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.060> sort<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.360> learn<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.780> ropes

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
around and sort of learn the ropes

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.020 
around and sort of learn the ropes
through<00:02:12.170> him<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:12.650> I'm<00:02:13.190> kind<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.550> figuring<00:02:13.700> out

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
through him so I'm kind of figuring out

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.490 
through him so I'm kind of figuring out
what<00:02:14.240> we<00:02:14.390> do<00:02:14.570> when<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.050> all<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.260> kind<00:02:15.440> of

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
what we do when and all that kind of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.980 
what we do when and all that kind of
stuff<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.150> we<00:02:17.150> actually<00:02:17.300> keep<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.660> lot<00:02:17.840> today

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
stuff and we actually keep the lot today

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.180 
stuff and we actually keep the lot today
and<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.320> another<00:02:18.440> keeping<00:02:18.800> practice

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
and we have another keeping practice

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.740 
and we have another keeping practice
later<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.490> think<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:19.970> it's<00:02:20.540> going<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.690> be

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
later I think so it's going to be

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.450 
later I think so it's going to be
crucial<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.200> keep<00:02:21.380> our<00:02:21.530> legs<00:02:21.740> as<00:02:21.980> strong<00:02:22.220> as<00:02:22.340> we

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
crucial to keep our legs as strong as we

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.310 
crucial to keep our legs as strong as we
can<00:02:22.700> for<00:02:23.000> all<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.510> camp<00:02:23.750> how<00:02:24.110> would<00:02:24.290> you

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
can for all of camp how would you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.040 
can for all of camp how would you
describe<00:02:24.770> your<00:02:25.130> consistency<00:02:25.790> from<00:02:26.360> day<00:02:26.750> one

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
describe your consistency from day one

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.290 
describe your consistency from day one
of<00:02:27.170> camp<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.710> had<00:02:27.890> one<00:02:28.220> day<00:02:28.460> but<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:29.150> know<00:02:29.240> you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
of camp you had one day but you know you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.940 
of camp you had one day but you know you
were<00:02:29.630> i<00:02:29.870> think<00:02:30.050> a<00:02:30.110> little<00:02:30.230> sketchy<00:02:30.590> but

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
were i think a little sketchy but

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.650 
were i think a little sketchy but
otherwise<00:02:31.490> you've<00:02:31.910> been<00:02:32.030> pretty<00:02:32.240> good<00:02:32.270> right

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
otherwise you've been pretty good right

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.110 
otherwise you've been pretty good right
yeah<00:02:32.810> well<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.530> started<00:02:34.520> out<00:02:34.640> really<00:02:34.850> good<00:02:35.060> i

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
yeah well I I started out really good i

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.410 
yeah well I I started out really good i
went<00:02:35.360> 27<00:02:35.750> 429<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.560> first<00:02:36.800> day<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.250> i<00:02:37.610> think

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
went 27 429 the first day and i think

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.440 
went 27 429 the first day and i think
that<00:02:39.050> might<00:02:39.260> have<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.770> mean<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.330> hoping

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
that might have I mean I I was hoping

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.790 
that might have I mean I I was hoping
that<00:02:41.630> would<00:02:41.840> keep<00:02:41.959> up<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.380> then<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.620> have

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
that would keep up and then you have

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.410 
that would keep up and then you have
that<00:02:42.950> big<00:02:43.070> drop-off<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.730> had<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> next<00:02:44.300> day

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
that big drop-off I had the next day

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.360 
that big drop-off I had the next day
which<00:02:44.660> as<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.260> kicker<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.709> mean<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.070> sounds<00:02:46.220> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
which as a kicker I mean it sounds a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.500 
which as a kicker I mean it sounds a
little<00:02:46.550> weird<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.760> say<00:02:46.970> but<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.180> think<00:02:47.360> that's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
little weird to say but I think that's

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.480 
little weird to say but I think that's
probably<00:02:47.720> good<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.020> have<00:02:48.290> at<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.160> beginning

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
probably good to have at the beginning

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.920 
probably good to have at the beginning
of<00:02:49.550> camp<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.090> kind<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.300> feel<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.690> pressure

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
of camp you kind of feel the pressure

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.720 
of camp you kind of feel the pressure
you<00:02:51.110> feel<00:02:51.320> what<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.560> let<00:02:51.740> what<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:52.459> to

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
you feel what it let what it's like to

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.000 
you feel what it let what it's like to
hit<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> ground<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.350> realize<00:02:54.709> that<00:02:54.740> you

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
hit the ground and you realize that you

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.890 
hit the ground and you realize that you
need<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.220> bounce<00:02:55.400> back<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.690> biggest

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
need to bounce back and the biggest

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.050 
need to bounce back and the biggest
thing<00:02:57.170> with<00:02:57.260> kicking<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.790> forgetting<00:02:58.790> and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
thing with kicking is forgetting and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.760 
thing with kicking is forgetting and
having<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.540> short<00:02:59.780> memory<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.410> can<00:03:00.680> get

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
having a short memory so you can get

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.140 
having a short memory so you can get
back<00:03:00.920> out<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.310> field<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.760> feel<00:03:02.000> like

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
back out on that field and feel like

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.910 
back out on that field and feel like
you're<00:03:02.330> as<00:03:02.540> good<00:03:03.140> as<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.290> always<00:03:03.530> are<00:03:03.770> you

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
you're as good as you always are you

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.620 
you're as good as you always are you
know<00:03:04.040> most<00:03:04.610> kickers<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.000> done<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.390> long

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
know most kickers have done this a long

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.820 
know most kickers have done this a long
time<00:03:05.900> especially<00:03:06.170> when<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.560> get<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.740> the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
time especially when you get to the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.620 
time especially when you get to the
college<00:03:07.100> level<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.610> it's<00:03:08.209> got<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.450> be<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
college level and it's got to be the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.240 
college level and it's got to be the
same<00:03:08.810> thing<00:03:08.989> every<00:03:09.170> time<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.830> won't<00:03:10.100> be

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
same thing every time and you won't be

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.920 
same thing every time and you won't be
here<00:03:10.459> if<00:03:10.550> you're<00:03:10.670> not<00:03:10.760> good<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.360> just<00:03:11.750> got

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
here if you're not good so you just got

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.140 
here if you're not good so you just got
to<00:03:11.959> go<00:03:12.530> back<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.800> your<00:03:12.830> normal<00:03:13.010> self<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.640> kind
