 by mistake around here welcome 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.920
 today we will see a very useful together 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.580
 exercise for heating the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.170
 left hand 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.099
 using the picking technique 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.099
 alternating good vision 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.180
 you want to know how to see them 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.410
 together 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.690
 to execute this correctly 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.900
 exercise that you will have to keep your wrist 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 folded without exaggerating the fingers 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.129
 perpendicular to the keyboard of the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.629
 guitar and thumb straight behind the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.610
 handle 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.260
 very well then we start positioning 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.210
 the index on the sixth string vi 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.170
 I remember being the topmost one 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 towards us and the other fingers on the keys 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.840
 following from this position 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.430
 remains momentarily calls the others 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.080
 fingers leaving only impression 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.979
 the index and we give a penalty between towards the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.979
 low with the right hand 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:22.030
 then medium bandaged upwards annular 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.070
 a little finger came through the bottom 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.659
 punishment through the high 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.340
 at this point we repeat the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.970
 same thing on the ropes 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.970
 successive 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.350
 is 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.940
 you can do the exercises also at 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.940
 contrary 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.709
 to study this correctly 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.650
 exercise performed first of all a 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.150
 extremely low speeds taking care of well 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.580
 the movements and when these will be 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.380
 become natural started ad 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.380
 gradually increase the speed 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.670
