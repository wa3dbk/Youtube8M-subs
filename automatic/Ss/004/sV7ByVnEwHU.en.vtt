 this advice from a specialist 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.350
 when we talk about family cars we 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.519
 speaks first of big chests for 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.479
 take away the business of all the 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.550

 even if he is in love with cars from 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.019
 sport this father of two children first 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:50.709
 the practical mind so he's looking for a 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.149
 Another spacious vehicle but used 

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:55.010
 a new car whenever you want 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.539
 but the number plates in 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.309
 coming out of the concession the haircut is 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.539
 already huge so a used car 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.769
 she has already rolled if she is 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.460
 is not too much where the facts rather this 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.050
 I'm looking for 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.960
 David and his wife have always 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.760
 Preferred used vehicles 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.050
 despite some disappointments during 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.120
 first technical checks and when 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.430
 revisions turned out that in fact the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.680
 vehicle had suffered a relatively 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.590
 important is that there had been 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.870
 work relatively makeup that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.910
 had been made in particular under the 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.610
 vehicle things we do not think about 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.260
 naturally check this experience 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.240
 do not discourage him 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.970
 he has already spotted two offers on 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.740
 internet but he hesitates still needs it 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.050
 go through an individual or by a 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.010
 professional 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.500
 each his little stories and his 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.640
 car so we try a little bit 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.120
 to beautify the bride 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.380
 forward it's a bit of good war 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.810
 nevertheless there are things that even a 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.360
 particular honest may not have 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.070
 detected then to avoid vices 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.020
 hidden and to pay for his car 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.560
 second hand at the right price what should he 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.560
 pay attention 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.420
 anthony glotin and commercial advisor 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.800
 he has the answers to these questions you 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.630
 please go settle down for 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.400
 to avoid unpleasant surprises 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.050
 must start by looking closely 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.450
 some essential papers 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.830
 what is important is especially the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.870
 countries that are gray card 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.730
 if you buy an individual that the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.930
 particular who you buy it is well 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.489
 the holder of the gray card 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.560
 if the owners for less than 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.030
 three months he wants to have a worry 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.340
 possibly nature it is also necessary 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.440
 try to know as much as possible 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.050
 repairs made on the car 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.120
 the ideal is to get the seller the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.610
 maintenance booklet with all 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440
 tampons from the different garages that are 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.780
 intervened in the absence of a book 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.700
 of maintenance sometimes they are lost you 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.010
 can ask for bills the maximum 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.260
 of invoices unlike a particular 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.120
 a professional to the obligation of you 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.160
 provide this detailed information 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.049
 tracing the history of the vehicle 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.090
 it must also bring you 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.250
 guarantees you must demand to have a 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.900
 guarantee contract on which he will 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.120
 possibly take a decision 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.709
 charge in case of failure during the 12 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.110
 next few months 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.180
 david a comfortable budget between 25 and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.870
 35 thousand euros and his biggest 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.579
 worry 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.160
 buy a car with a meter 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.110
 trafficked it's important to check the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.560
 match of mileage with age of 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.750
 vehicle 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.040
 so on this vehicle is registered in 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.720
 June 2014 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.060
 it's a little less than a little 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.650
 more than six months so that means 6000 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.150
 km in six months that's fine 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.940
 plausible for example on this vehicle 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.350
 which is a lot more kilometers that is 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.610
 around one hundred thousand kilometers you 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.500
 you can check points 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.480
 much more important wear this 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.250
 that they show us that the vehicle to 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.780
 an age you see at the level of the seat 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.310
 the seats are more worn 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.410
 the gear knob lever 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.870
 also 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.580
 the vehicle today at five years to 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.450
 five years in may km it's something 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.220
 of logic in relation to its wear in 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.790
 summary before buying a car 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.620
 second hand 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.510
 check the registration card and the carnet 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.220
 of maintenance if there is no notebook 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.580
 of maintenance asked the bills of 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.130
 repair at a professional you 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.010
 can require a warranty contract 6 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.960
 minimum month 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.480
 finally make sure that the wear of the 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.660
 vehicle coincides with his age and his 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.660
 mileage
