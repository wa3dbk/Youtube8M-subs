00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.770
 hello all and then there we will start the 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.770
 grotto 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 my bull welcome the second edition 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.090
 of facetime is the new frame is that the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.699
 people just invented it for now because 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.490
 people already recorded the other but he had 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.820
 recorded to be the continuation of ebx 2 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.980
 We recorded but did not like it. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.670
 So we decided to turn this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.410
 thing and in the separate table but in the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.879
 that I did I cut the part that people 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.070
 is saying that it was the continuation of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.170
 versys, I went and I do not want to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.200
 first then make the second logo and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.420
 still we still choose to call 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.300
 this facetime program 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.870
 Now I ask you why it 's good. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.789
 Why are wevers delaying us? 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 to be able to do it because I have to go to 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.309
 his house or he has to come to mine. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.489
 Home to us recorded Facetime to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.530
 people record by facetime and then send 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.170
 the file for him usually I edit 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.570
 the videos it edits every podcast is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.689
 continue iphoto is I came you day 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.509
 we just decided to call it 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.580
 This is because as you can see the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.040
 people use trainees to record this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.020
 He 's at his house because he's milton. 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.390
 my and this is going to be a program 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 people expect that weekly people will 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 record on Fridays and we wait 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 Monday or Tuesday the edition is 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.390
 It's ready for us to put this on 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:49.500
 youtube and that's it so now we're going 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.860
 talk about the best sunday shop 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.439
 apple store in rio de janeiro that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.719
 so far has not had any problem of 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.299
 logistics 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.939
 Well I started thinking apple will go 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.689
 change in brazil that supports you to start 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.780
 It got to be good but as I was traveling 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.569
 Three days ago I called the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.650
 support is there for 10 800 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.379
 And why am I wanting to buy one? 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.109
 macbook was then asking for information 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.829
 and things like I bought in Brazil 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:26.430
 in the United States and from what I understand 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:29.879
 so the two experts are little me 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.040
 they said that you buy a product 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.659
 apple online device eg iphone 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.239
 ipad ipod macbook which is what was the case 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.859
 He will not have any guarantee for Brazil. 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.139
 Only I think they'll do it alone. 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.409
 to spend more money because I've already seen 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.760
 I have read in several places that guarantee 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.299
 apple is worldwide 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.409
 we then besides these problems of the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.019
 active informal staff or else it is 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.840
 they do not have stock 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.180
 now tell me how a store of 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.090
 apple that just opened in the country 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.859
 concept and so many millions of inhabitants 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.260
 They have stock of iphone and ipad and Black 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.980
 that will date as maybe a store 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.980
 out of stock 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.180
 Let's open a channel on youtube without 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.689
 camera 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.060
 I'll just say one more business here. 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:29.189
 I took that retarded face and 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.739
 according to which I slept three hours today 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.229
 I woke up at 5 o'clock in the morning and got on the flight. 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.599
 from Recife to Brasilia, so I'm 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:39.019
 super tired or even talk about our 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.019
 podcast 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.340
 Look this is my worm is the globe of 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.430
 snow 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:59.389
 let's not talk about a more business 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.389
 interesting now 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.620
 maybe you already know more 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.720
 is also doing podcast is for 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.489
 complement our videos on youtube 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.159
 because for example the things that people 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.440
 I do not want to talk too much about videos. 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.190
 We'd rather talk in the podcast for 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.889
 not be a very repetitive el video 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.669
 too tall is too much 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:31.919
 For now we have two podcasts in the 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:34.380
 soundcloud soundcloud.com slash e 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.050
 universal usb and I think you already 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.710
 know everything that everything is ours and the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.710
 psb 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:49.500
 so we have a little 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:51.419
 problem is that I asked them to give me 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.880
 more space is not because you have to 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.320
 pay for this give more space 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.169
 only they have not responded yet 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.280
 so for now it will only be 3 2 or 3 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.090
 podcast 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.570
 but as soon as I can release the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.210
 we can all other podcast and 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.220
 people will try to put it on itunes 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.820
 also just that we depend on the apple 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.250
 Release now let's talk about the news 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.950
 of the week 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.860
 unfortunately samsung made the doom 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.190
 has happened lately 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.530

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.750
 then leaves and prevent is that you never 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.849
 to be continued 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:50.280

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.039
 they will do 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.380
