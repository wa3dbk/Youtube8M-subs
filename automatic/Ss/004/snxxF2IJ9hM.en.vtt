start with this game beating up c9 what

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.370 
start with this game beating up c9 what
was<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> plan<00:00:17.070> coming<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.490> um<00:00:18.230> we<00:00:19.230> had<00:00:19.350> some

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
was the plan coming in um we had some

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.320 
was the plan coming in um we had some
such<00:00:20.160> champions<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.880> wanted<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.150> go

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
such champions that we wanted to go

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.570 
such champions that we wanted to go
through<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.660> kind<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.020> handled<00:00:22.619> our<00:00:22.890> pick<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
through we kind of handled our pick and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.099 
through we kind of handled our pick and
ban<00:00:23.730> face<00:00:23.970> differently<00:00:24.420> than<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
ban face differently than we have in the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.800 
ban face differently than we have in the
past<00:00:25.260> few<00:00:25.500> weeks<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> big

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
past few weeks so I think that was a big

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.960 
past few weeks so I think that was a big
factor<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.500> they<00:00:28.949> basically<00:00:29.160> played<00:00:29.699> into

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
factor and they basically played into

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.550 
factor and they basically played into
our<00:00:30.060> hand<00:00:30.300> they<00:00:30.539> picked<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.170> wanted<00:00:31.439> them

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
our hand they picked what we wanted them

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.260 
our hand they picked what we wanted them
to<00:00:31.679> pick<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.099> got<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.460> wanted<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to pick and we got what we wanted so I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.290 
to pick and we got what we wanted so I
think<00:00:33.600> that's<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.960> huge<00:00:34.170> factor<00:00:34.350> could<00:00:35.040> you

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
think that's a huge factor could you

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.819 
think that's a huge factor could you
expand<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.930> mean<00:00:36.960> by<00:00:37.110> playing<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
expand on what you mean by playing the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.520 
expand on what you mean by playing the
pic<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.010> fan<00:00:38.250> band<00:00:38.670> phase<00:00:38.850> differently

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
pic and fan band phase differently

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.369 
pic and fan band phase differently
before<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:41.250> would<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.820> kind<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.809> into

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
before we would just kind of go into

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.500 
before we would just kind of go into
like<00:00:43.680> set<00:00:43.950> scenarios<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.059> set

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
like set scenarios and have like set

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
like set scenarios and have like set
team<00:00:45.750> comps<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.410> time<00:00:46.559> around<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.950> were

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
team comps but this time around we were

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.860 
team comps but this time around we were
a<00:00:47.100> bit<00:00:47.399> more<00:00:47.550> flexible<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
a bit more flexible and just a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410 
a bit more flexible and just a
prioritized<00:00:49.770> certain<00:00:50.039> champions<00:00:50.489> over<00:00:50.820> just

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
prioritized certain champions over just

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.330 
prioritized certain champions over just
like<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> full<00:00:51.840> team<00:00:51.989> come<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.980> seemed<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> work

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
you for that one um well I only started

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.920 
you for that one um well I only started
doing<00:02:17.520> LCS<00:02:17.880> my<00:02:18.030> scene<00:02:18.210> years<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.600> my<00:02:18.720> schedule

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
doing LCS my scene years so my schedule

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
doing LCS my scene years so my schedule
is<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.290> little<00:02:19.380> bit<00:02:19.680> more<00:02:19.800> lack<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.370> wasn't

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
is a little bit more lack so it wasn't

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280 
is a little bit more lack so it wasn't
as<00:02:20.700> hard<00:02:20.880> for<00:02:21.060> me<00:02:21.150> Johnny's<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.660> his<00:02:22.110> junior

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
as hard for me Johnny's in his junior

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.650 
as hard for me Johnny's in his junior
which<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.070> guess<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.280> hardest<00:02:24.150> part<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.600> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
which is I guess the hardest part of the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.960 
which is I guess the hardest part of the
high<00:02:25.230> school<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.130> guess<00:02:26.460> it'll<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.790> little

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
high school so I guess it'll be a little

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.730 
high school so I guess it'll be a little
bit<00:02:27.150> tougher<00:02:27.300> for<00:02:27.540> him<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.320> have<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.650> get

the goals like let's look for dragons
things<00:03:48.269> like<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.570> force<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.380> advantages

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
things like this to force the advantages

things like this to force the advantages
uh<00:03:50.580> with<00:03:51.269> our<00:03:51.420> team<00:03:51.630> come<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.930> think<00:03:52.140> definitely

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
our 55 is a lot better because we have

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.470 
our 55 is a lot better because we have
like<00:03:54.920> 22<00:03:55.920> abilities<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.610> stop<00:03:57.000> Kazakhs

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
with the division we got like we knew if

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.020 
with the division we got like we knew if
they're<00:04:13.739> going<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:13.950> come<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.280> or<00:04:14.400> not<00:04:14.549> so<00:04:14.820> we

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
they're going to come in or not so we

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.860 
they're going to come in or not so we
could<00:04:15.180> avoid<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.340> also<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:18.000> seating<00:04:18.660> like

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
could avoid that and also a seating like

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.529 
could avoid that and also a seating like
we<00:04:19.109> generally<00:04:19.410> have<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.560> big<00:04:19.769> minion<00:04:20.700> wave<00:04:20.880> so

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
we generally have a big minion wave so

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.659 
we generally have a big minion wave so
we<00:04:21.810> wouldn't<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.620> minion<00:04:22.950> would<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.520> take

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
we wouldn't the minion would just take

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.370 
we wouldn't the minion would just take
the<00:04:23.910> cocoon<00:04:24.750> or<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.200> binding

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
the cocoon or the binding

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.870 
the cocoon or the binding
someone<00:04:27.130> actually<00:04:27.280> direct<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.640> guys<00:04:27.760> and

lantern and then there's a trundle
tp'ing<00:04:49.180> onto<00:04:49.540> a<00:04:49.600> ward<00:04:49.840> there<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.290> then

tp'ing onto a ward there and then
switches<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.490> back<00:04:51.640> shredding<00:04:52.000> everyone

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
switches in the back shredding everyone

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.520 
switches in the back shredding everyone
down<00:04:52.360> because<00:04:52.660> they've<00:04:52.840> been<00:04:52.870> focusing

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
down because they've been focusing

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.530 
down because they've been focusing
Evelyn<00:04:53.920> and<00:04:54.100> from<00:04:54.970> here<00:04:55.090> we're<00:04:55.270> basically

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
Evelyn and from here we're basically

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.300 
Evelyn and from here we're basically
able<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:55.960> clean<00:04:56.170> up<00:04:56.320> where<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.590> had<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:57.010> lot<00:04:57.250> of

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
able to clean up where I had a lot of

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.490 
able to clean up where I had a lot of
gold<00:04:57.580> at<00:04:57.730> this<00:04:57.880> point<00:04:58.180> I<00:04:58.390> actually<00:04:58.960> agar<00:04:59.380> the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
gold at this point I actually agar the

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.110 
gold at this point I actually agar the
barrier<00:04:59.800> so<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.040> hits<00:05:00.190> high<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.550> finishes<00:05:00.940> him

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
barrier so it hits high and finishes him

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.370 
barrier so it hits high and finishes him
nice<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:02.470> then<00:05:03.340> yeah<00:05:03.580> we<00:05:04.000> were<00:05:04.060> able<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.570> get

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
nice and then yeah we were able to get

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.020 
nice and then yeah we were able to get
the<00:05:05.470> Baron<00:05:05.710> pretty<00:05:05.890> low<00:05:06.070> but<00:05:06.460> they<00:05:06.700> clean<00:05:06.910> the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
the Baron pretty low but they clean the

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.980 
the Baron pretty low but they clean the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
word we have over there and then we

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.170 
word we have over there and then we
don't<00:05:08.080> have<00:05:08.230> any<00:05:08.380> vision<00:05:08.560> left<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.220> at<00:05:10.000> this

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
don't have any vision left so at this

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.120 
don't have any vision left so at this
point<00:05:10.420> ELISA<00:05:10.810> comes<00:05:11.320> in<00:05:11.440> for<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.680> steal<00:05:11.920> the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
point ELISA comes in for the steal the

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.160 
point ELISA comes in for the steal the
blind<00:05:12.340> hook<00:05:12.520> this<00:05:12.700> is<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.240> at<00:05:13.870> this<00:05:13.990> point

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
blind hook this is and at this point

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.900 
blind hook this is and at this point
it's<00:05:14.380> kind<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.740> gamble<00:05:14.890> but<00:05:15.310> we<00:05:15.760> just

it was like 38 to 37,000 super didn't
even<00:05:36.550> feel<00:05:36.700> like<00:05:36.730> that<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:37.180> feel<00:05:37.570> like<00:05:37.630> you're

even feel like that I feel like you're
way<00:05:38.050> far<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.590> right<00:05:38.680> I<00:05:38.740> thought<00:05:39.010> we<00:05:39.160> were<00:05:39.280> much

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
way far the right I thought we were much

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.700 
way far the right I thought we were much
further<00:05:39.730> yeah<00:05:40.390> like<00:05:40.690> 2000<00:05:41.230> the<00:05:41.290> entire<00:05:41.500> time

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
further yeah like 2000 the entire time

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.620 
further yeah like 2000 the entire time
so<00:05:42.610> then<00:05:42.760> when<00:05:43.000> you<00:05:43.060> have<00:05:43.120> this<00:05:43.300> sort<00:05:43.480> of<00:05:43.540> a

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
so then when you have this sort of a

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.240 
so then when you have this sort of a
lead<00:05:43.810> how<00:05:44.470> do<00:05:44.530> you<00:05:44.620> how<00:05:44.770> do<00:05:44.830> you<00:05:44.860> close<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.100> out

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
lead how do you how do you close it out

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.050 
lead how do you how do you close it out
then<00:05:45.460> from<00:05:45.790> there<00:05:46.680> well<00:05:47.680> barons<00:05:48.070> usually<00:05:48.880> like

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
then from there well barons usually like

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.270 
then from there well barons usually like
the<00:05:49.180> easiest<00:05:49.450> play<00:05:49.780> if<00:05:50.500> you're<00:05:50.710> not<00:05:50.830> looking

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
the easiest play if you're not looking

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.410 
the easiest play if you're not looking
to<00:05:51.340> get<00:05:51.430> baron<00:05:51.760> then<00:05:51.910> you<00:05:52.060> have<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.240> push<00:05:52.390> down

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
to get baron then you have to push down

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.420 
to get baron then you have to push down
turrets<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.140> that's<00:05:53.800> kind<00:05:54.010> of<00:05:54.040> hard<00:05:54.220> to<00:05:54.280> do

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
turrets and that's kind of hard to do

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.100 
turrets and that's kind of hard to do
with<00:05:54.670> the<00:05:55.030> sort<00:05:55.270> of<00:05:55.330> wave<00:05:55.450> clear<00:05:55.660> they<00:05:55.810> have<00:05:55.930> in

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
with the sort of wave clear they have in

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.600
