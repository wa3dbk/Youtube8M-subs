so you have a smooth piece that looks
like<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:51.480> now<00:01:52.480> you<00:01:52.540> take<00:01:52.810> one<00:01:52.870> wing<00:01:53.880> fold<00:01:54.880> it

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
like this now you take one wing fold it

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.760 
like this now you take one wing fold it
into<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.570> center<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:57.270> fold<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.450> again<00:01:58.620> to<00:01:59.620> the
