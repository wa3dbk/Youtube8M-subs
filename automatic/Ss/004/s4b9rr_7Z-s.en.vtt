00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
firepower in the range and then the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.709 
firepower in the range and then the
damage<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.550> damage<00:00:59.879> i'm<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.210> right<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.450> at

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
