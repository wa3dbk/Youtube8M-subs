00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
recognize me for me it was just

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.830 
recognize me for me it was just
something<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.279> assumed<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.720> be

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
something I I assumed but to be

it's<00:01:09.320> quite<00:01:09.470> interesting<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.950> see<00:01:10.190> what<00:01:10.490> it

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
it's quite interesting to see what it

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.240 
it's quite interesting to see what it
allows<00:01:10.880> me<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.300> do<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.660> how<00:01:12.260> free<00:01:12.980> sometimes

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
it's me it makes me feel but it that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.630 
it's me it makes me feel but it that
comes<00:01:15.530> from<00:01:15.710> me<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:15.950> doesn't<00:01:16.220> come<00:01:16.340> from<00:01:16.370> the

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
comes from me it doesn't come from the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.310 
comes from me it doesn't come from the
audience<00:01:17.000> really<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:17.300> just<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:17.780> feel<00:01:18.080> like<00:01:18.290> I

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
audience really it just I feel like I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:31.280 
audience really it just I feel like I
can<00:01:18.530> maybe<00:01:18.770> try<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.460> more<00:01:19.640> stuff

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.040 

it<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.190> unexpected<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:33.090> me<00:01:33.120> to<00:01:33.540> work

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
it was really unexpected for me to work

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.400 
it was really unexpected for me to work
on<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.290> series<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.550> Panem<00:01:36.410> the

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
on a series like that like Panem the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.300 
on a series like that like Panem the
role<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.830> perfect<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.430> me<00:01:38.550> she<00:01:39.480> was<00:01:39.600> French

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
role was perfect for me she was French

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.250 
role was perfect for me she was French
so<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.730> didn't<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.870> had<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
so I didn't have really I had to

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.140 
so I didn't have really I had to
transform<00:01:43.920> maybe<00:01:44.220> my<00:01:44.340> accent<00:01:44.760> little<00:01:44.910> bit

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
transform maybe my accent little bit

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.400 
transform maybe my accent little bit
more<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.510> make<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.690> sound<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:46.050> little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.380> more

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
more to make it sound a little bit more

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.820 
more to make it sound a little bit more
European<00:01:47.340> than<00:01:47.370> North<00:01:48.120> American<00:01:48.830> obviously

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
European than North American obviously

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.320 
European than North American obviously
but<00:01:50.160> um<00:01:50.960> but<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.080> just<00:01:52.320> interesting<00:01:52.620> to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
but um but it's just interesting to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.000 
but um but it's just interesting to
experience<00:01:54.330> what<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> business<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.560> like

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
experience what the business is like

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.650 
experience what the business is like
over<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.550> because<00:01:56.790> basically<00:01:57.330> when<00:01:57.540> you're

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
over there because basically when you're

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.420 
over there because basically when you're
on<00:01:57.750> set<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.229> pretty<00:01:58.680> much<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:59.010> same<00:01:59.160> thing

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
on set it's pretty much the same thing

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.070 
on set it's pretty much the same thing
but<00:02:00.300> all<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.750> money<00:02:00.960> behind<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
but all the money behind and the the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.080 
but all the money behind and the the
publicists<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.400> marketing<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
publicists and the marketing and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.359 
publicists and the marketing and
everything<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.890> what's<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
everything and that's that's what's so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.580 
everything and that's that's what's so
different<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.300> when<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.750> feel<00:02:09.990> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
different and that's when you feel the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.500 
different and that's when you feel the
power<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.100> they<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.700> behind<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
power that they all have behind a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:24.190 
power that they all have behind a
production

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.860 

but<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.350> interesting<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:26.190> see<00:02:26.430> how<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.750> way

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
but it's interesting to see how the way

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.700 
but it's interesting to see how the way
we<00:02:28.050> work<00:02:28.380> here<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:29.190> Montreal<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.910> set<00:02:30.680> when<00:02:31.680> I

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
we work here in Montreal on set when I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.090 
we work here in Montreal on set when I
just<00:02:32.690> when<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.720> take<00:02:33.990> that<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.500> bring<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.920> on

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
just when I take that and I bring it on

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.250 
just when I take that and I bring it on
on<00:02:35.610> an<00:02:35.730> American<00:02:36.120> set<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:37.080> different

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
on an American set it's really different
