this is going to be a video description

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.410 
this is going to be a video description
of<00:00:04.020> what<00:00:04.259> happened<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:05.520> can<00:00:05.700> see<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.150> cut

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
of what happened you can see the cut

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.020 
of what happened you can see the cut
wire<00:00:06.690> there<00:00:07.309> basically<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:08.460> happened<00:00:08.910> is

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
wire there basically what happened is

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.460 
wire there basically what happened is
that<00:00:09.360> wire<00:00:11.719> connected<00:00:13.759> here<00:00:14.809> but<00:00:15.809> those<00:00:16.080> two

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
that wire connected here but those two

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.510 
that wire connected here but those two
cables<00:00:17.270> connect<00:00:18.619> into<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.650> base<00:00:19.980> they

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
cables connect into the base they

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.290 
cables connect into the base they
connect<00:00:20.880> here<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.039> they<00:00:23.039> also<00:00:24.619> connect<00:00:25.619> here

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
connect here and they also connect here

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.320 
connect here and they also connect here
but<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> problem<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.250> this<00:00:29.250> wire<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.179> you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
but the problem is this wire here as you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.150 
but the problem is this wire here as you
can<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.830> was<00:00:31.830> cut<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.200> guess<00:00:34.530> actually

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
can see was cut and on my guess actually

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.430 
can see was cut and on my guess actually
it<00:00:35.280> did<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> during<00:00:36.690> shipping<00:00:37.140> after

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it did have a during shipping after

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.080 
it did have a during shipping after
thinking<00:00:37.920> about<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> last<00:00:38.489> night

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
thinking about it last night

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.389 
thinking about it last night
I<00:00:39.120> realized<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.440> probably<00:00:40.860> happened

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
I realized that what probably happened

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.069 
I realized that what probably happened
is<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:43.230> an<00:00:43.469> adjustment<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:45.079> which

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
is this this is an adjustment here which

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.209 
is this this is an adjustment here which
raises<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.100> lowers<00:00:48.590> handlebars<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.920> this

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
raises and lowers handlebars but this

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.939 
raises and lowers handlebars but this
adjustment<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.449> adjust<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.289> handlebars

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
adjustment you can adjust the handlebars

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.869 
adjustment you can adjust the handlebars
and<00:00:54.020> make<00:00:55.020> them<00:00:55.260> longer<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.340> shorter<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.760> what

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and make them longer or shorter and what

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.979 
and make them longer or shorter and what
happened<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:58.010> as<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.750> when<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
happened was as you can see when you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.090 
happened was as you can see when you
lower<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> handlebars<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.210> part<00:01:04.100> sticks

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
lower to the handlebars this part sticks

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.820 
lower to the handlebars this part sticks
out<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.510> lower<00:01:06.720> them<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
might be able to see that the other one

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.090 
might be able to see that the other one
the<00:01:44.600> other<00:01:44.630> wire<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.320> second<00:01:45.680> layer<00:01:45.799> which<00:01:45.950> I

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
the other wire the second layer which I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.800 
the other wire the second layer which I
thought<00:01:46.310> was<00:01:46.490> fine<00:01:46.789> is<00:01:47.479> also<00:01:49.119> chew<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:50.240> into<00:01:50.570> so

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
thought was fine is also chew it into so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.590 
thought was fine is also chew it into so
it's<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.229> useless<00:01:51.560> as<00:01:51.860> well<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:52.939> has<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.299> be

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
it's it's useless as well this has to be

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.800 
it's it's useless as well this has to be
replaced<00:01:53.960> because<00:01:54.679> these<00:01:55.070> wires<00:01:55.810> they're

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
replaced because these wires they're

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.870 
replaced because these wires they're
fully<00:01:57.530> glued<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:59.149> this<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.020> called<00:02:00.350> the

fully glued in this this is called the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.449 
fully glued in this this is called the
CSB<00:02:01.880> or<00:02:03.159> control<00:02:04.159> shaft<00:02:04.909> base<00:02:05.899> I<00:02:06.319> was<00:02:07.159> able<00:02:07.280> to

the<00:02:42.980> good<00:02:43.280> news<00:02:43.609> is<00:02:44.359> that<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:45.049> is<00:02:45.620> okay

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the good news is that this is okay

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.000 
the good news is that this is okay
because<00:02:46.850> if<00:02:47.150> these<00:02:47.450> one<00:02:48.049> of<00:02:48.079> those<00:02:48.380> two<00:02:48.739> wires

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
because if these one of those two wires

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.569 
because if these one of those two wires
was<00:02:49.340> broken<00:02:50.079> then<00:02:51.079> we<00:02:51.410> have<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.829> replace<00:02:52.130> I

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
was broken then we have to replace I

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.460 
was broken then we have to replace I
think<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.239> might<00:02:53.420> be<00:02:53.600> able<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.930> replace<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
think you might be able to replace the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.530 
think you might be able to replace the
wiring<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.340> couldn't<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.910> myself<00:02:56.090> I'd

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
wiring but I couldn't do that myself I'd

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.840 
wiring but I couldn't do that myself I'd
have<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.810> get<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.079> dealer<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:58.519> would

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
have to get to a dealer and that would

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.490 
have to get to a dealer and that would
probably<00:02:59.120> cost<00:02:59.450> me<00:02:59.690> two<00:02:59.959> or<00:02:59.989> three<00:03:00.109> hundred

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
probably cost me two or three hundred

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.330 
probably cost me two or three hundred
bucks<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.280> along<00:03:01.850> with<00:03:01.880> having<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.569> get<00:03:02.690> this

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
