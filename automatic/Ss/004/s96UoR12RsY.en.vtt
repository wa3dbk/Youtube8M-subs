the<00:01:16.340> two<00:01:16.610> versions<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.090> Quivers<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.510> we<00:01:17.600> have

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
the two versions of Quivers that we have

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.240 
the two versions of Quivers that we have
this<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.230> compact<00:01:18.710> design<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.070> this

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
this is the compact design and this

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.060 
this is the compact design and this
actually<00:01:19.610> mounts<00:01:20.000> directly<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.860> riser

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
actually mounts directly to the riser

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.790 
actually mounts directly to the riser
the<00:01:22.370> ball<00:01:22.520> itself<00:01:22.930> it's<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:24.050> top<00:01:24.260> feed<00:01:24.470> design

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
the ball itself it's a top feed design

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.280 
the ball itself it's a top feed design
where<00:01:25.070> we<00:01:25.100> can<00:01:25.340> adjust<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:26.330> overall<00:01:26.690> angle

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
where we can adjust the overall angle

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.710 
where we can adjust the overall angle
let's<00:01:27.500> bracket<00:01:27.980> so<00:01:28.190> no<00:01:28.700> matter<00:01:28.880> what<00:01:29.150> you<00:01:29.570> can

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
let's bracket so no matter what you can

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.360 
let's bracket so no matter what you can
make<00:01:29.900> sure<00:01:30.110> your<00:01:30.290> Quivers<00:01:30.740> at<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.070> correct

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
make sure your Quivers at the correct

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.210 
make sure your Quivers at the correct
height<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.330> it's<00:01:32.480> not<00:01:32.630> sticking<00:01:32.900> out<00:01:33.110> past<00:01:33.440> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
height so it's not sticking out past the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.090 
height so it's not sticking out past the
Kami<00:01:34.460> or<00:01:34.670> ball<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:35.510> also<00:01:35.690> have<00:01:36.050> a<00:01:36.380> riser

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100
