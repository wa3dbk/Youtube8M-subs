boss today we're gonna be taking a look
at<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> deny<00:00:35.760> probe<00:00:36.390> scouting<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.350> know

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
at how to deny probe scouting I know

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
at how to deny probe scouting I know
this<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.190> actually<00:00:38.280> work<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> probe

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
this is gonna actually work for a probe

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is gonna actually work for a probe
and<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.750> drone<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.770> work<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.129> either<00:00:41.190> or

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and a drone it can work for either or

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.680 
and a drone it can work for either or
it's<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.670> little<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.120> difficult<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it's a little bit more difficult for the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
it's a little bit more difficult for the
SUV<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.770> larger<00:00:44.129> health<00:00:44.340> pool

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
SUV just because of a larger health pool

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
SUV just because of a larger health pool
I<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:44.940> obviously<00:00:45.450> both<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.260> drone<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I know obviously both the drone and the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100 
I know obviously both the drone and the
probe<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.610> able<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.149> recharge<00:00:48.629> themselves

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
probe are able to recharge themselves

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.500 
probe are able to recharge themselves
the<00:00:50.100> drone<00:00:50.309> recharges<00:00:50.820> itself<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the drone recharges itself up and the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.619 
the drone recharges itself up and the
probe<00:00:51.719> recharges<00:00:52.320> its<00:00:52.530> shields<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
probe recharges its shields but in this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
probe recharges its shields but in this
short<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.199> kind<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.590> short<00:00:55.920> burst

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
short this is kind of a short burst

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.010 
short this is kind of a short burst
fight<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.300> don't<00:00:57.510> manage<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.870> take

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
fight and if you don't manage to take

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.090 
fight and if you don't manage to take
them<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.320> right<00:00:58.500> away<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:58.890> they're<00:00:59.010> gonna

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
them out right away then they're gonna

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.260 
them out right away then they're gonna
get<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> base<00:00:59.670> but<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> whole<00:01:00.000> point<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
get in the base but the whole point of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.689 
get in the base but the whole point of
what<00:01:00.359> we're<00:01:00.510> looking<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.960> how<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.170> deny

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
what we're looking at is how to deny

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
what we're looking at is how to deny
early<00:01:02.699> game<00:01:02.940> worker<00:01:03.660> scouting<00:01:04.320> from<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.799> probe

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
early game worker scouting from a probe

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.460 
early game worker scouting from a probe
and<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.790> drone<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.390> gonna<00:01:06.540> hold<00:01:06.750> true<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and a drone it's gonna hold true for the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.810 
and a drone it's gonna hold true for the
SUV<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> mentioned<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> little

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
SUV but like I mentioned it's a little

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.969 
SUV but like I mentioned it's a little
bit<00:01:09.119> harder<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.720> denying<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.470> initial

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
bit harder at denying that initial

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.770 
bit harder at denying that initial
pushing<00:01:11.430> now<00:01:11.939> let's<00:01:12.150> take<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> look<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
pushing now let's take a look if you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
pushing now let's take a look if you
just<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> guy<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> front<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.610> your

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
just have a guy at the front of your

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.950 
just have a guy at the front of your
wall<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> lot<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.180> times<00:01:15.390> you'll<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> Marine

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
wall a lot of times you'll have a Marine

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140 
wall a lot of times you'll have a Marine
at<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> front<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.500> wall<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.060> let's<00:01:18.060> see

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
at the front of your wall and let's see

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.700 
at the front of your wall and let's see
what<00:01:18.299> happens<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> probe<00:01:19.110> tries<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> run

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
what happens when a probe tries to run

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
what happens when a probe tries to run
through<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> scout<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.180> just

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
through to get a scout and I'm just

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
through to get a scout and I'm just
gonna<00:01:21.360> haven't<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:22.170> eclis<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
gonna haven't if eclis and just have the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.910 
gonna haven't if eclis and just have the
Marine<00:01:23.640> attacking<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> what's<00:01:25.439> gonna<00:01:25.530> happen

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
Marine attacking so what's gonna happen

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.010 
Marine attacking so what's gonna happen
is<00:01:26.009> Maria<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.490> gonna<00:01:26.700> attack<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.659> since<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
is Maria is gonna attack but since the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.620 
is Maria is gonna attack but since the
probe<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> faster<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> normally<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.479> an

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
probe is faster and normally on just an

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.940 
probe is faster and normally on just an
attack<00:01:30.930> move<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.380> marines<00:01:31.650> gonna<00:01:31.829> be

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
attack move the marines gonna be

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.010 
attack move the marines gonna be
standing<00:01:32.310> still<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> probe<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.750> running

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
standing still when the probe is running

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.179 
standing still when the probe is running
through<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:34.979> through

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
through then he will get right through

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.590 
through then he will get right through
your<00:01:35.310> base<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> full<00:01:36.329> Scout

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
your base and he will get a full Scout

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
your base and he will get a full Scout
of<00:01:36.780> everything<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.680> he'll<00:01:38.490> be

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
of everything that's going on he'll be

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.280 
of everything that's going on he'll be
running<00:01:38.759> around<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.390> he'll<00:01:39.479> know<00:01:39.630> exactly

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
running around and he'll know exactly

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
running around and he'll know exactly
what<00:01:40.740> you're<00:01:40.920> doing<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.939> precisely

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
what you're doing and this is precisely

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
what you're doing and this is precisely
what<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.750> want<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> deny<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.649> we're<00:01:43.740> gonna

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
what you want to deny so we're gonna

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
what you want to deny so we're gonna
look<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.220> how<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.430> effectively<00:01:45.210> stop<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.810> now

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
look at how to effectively stop that now

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.130 
look at how to effectively stop that now
the<00:01:46.500> method<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.939> scoot<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> shoot<00:01:48.960> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the method is it's the scoot and shoot I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
the method is it's the scoot and shoot I
think<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.619> been<00:01:49.950> coined<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.549> specifically

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
think it's been coined that specifically

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
think it's been coined that specifically
but<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.869> doesn't<00:01:52.530> need<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.770> called<00:01:53.070> any<00:01:53.250> one

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
but it doesn't need to be called any one

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.240 
but it doesn't need to be called any one
thing<00:01:53.579> or<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.790> other<00:01:53.909> all<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.780> is

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
thing or the other all it really is is

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.709 
thing or the other all it really is is
increasing<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> speed<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.969> which<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.299> attack

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
increasing the speed in which you attack

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.249 
increasing the speed in which you attack
also<00:01:58.649> following<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.310> target<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.659> goal<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
also following the target so the goal is

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.020 
also following the target so the goal is
what<00:02:01.560> we're<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.860> doing<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.399> using<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
what we're gonna be doing is using the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.109 
what we're gonna be doing is using the
move<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.810> stop<00:02:04.350> command<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:05.100> hold<00:02:05.640> works<00:02:05.909> as

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
move and stop command or hold works as

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.760 
move and stop command or hold works as
well<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.570> prefer<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.079> stop<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.619> much

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
well but I prefer to you stop it's much

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
well but I prefer to you stop it's much
closer<00:02:08.039> much<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.550> easy<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:08.879> me<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.420> you're

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
closer much more easy for me so you're

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.270 
closer much more easy for me so you're
gonna<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.050> clicking<00:02:10.410> back<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.830> ask<00:02:10.979> click

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
gonna be clicking back and ask click

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280 
gonna be clicking back and ask click
back<00:02:11.489> s<00:02:11.730> click<00:02:12.060> back<00:02:12.270> s<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.750> that's<00:02:12.870> basically

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
back s click back s and that's basically

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.820 
back s click back s and that's basically
what<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.590> is

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
what it is

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
what it is
the<00:02:13.980> same<00:02:14.160> method<00:02:14.490> that's<00:02:14.640> gonna<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.940> used<00:02:15.090> for

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the same method that's gonna be used for

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.180 
the same method that's gonna be used for
kiting<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.930> we'll<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.560> taking<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.920> look<00:02:17.070> at

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
kiting and we'll be taking a look at

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.040 
kiting and we'll be taking a look at
that<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.490> another<00:02:17.760> video<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.540> wanted<00:02:18.960> to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
that in another video but I wanted to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.750 
that in another video but I wanted to
show<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.230> guys<00:02:19.410> how<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.680> deny<00:02:20.130> early<00:02:20.580> game

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
show you guys how to deny early game

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.460 
show you guys how to deny early game
scouting<00:02:21.060> because<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.570> really<00:02:21.720> crucial<00:02:22.080> for

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
scouting because it's really crucial for

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.410 
scouting because it's really crucial for
you<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.680> able<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.860> do<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.300> your

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
you to be able to do this so that your

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.670 
you to be able to do this so that your
opponent<00:02:24.750> doesn't<00:02:24.900> know<00:02:25.080> what<00:02:25.290> you're<00:02:25.410> doing

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
opponent doesn't know what you're doing

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.980 
opponent doesn't know what you're doing
with<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> secondary<00:02:26.580> scout<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.660> what's<00:02:27.870> gonna

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
with a secondary scout so what's gonna

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.600 
with a secondary scout so what's gonna
happen<00:02:28.380> here<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.920> probe<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.220> gonna<00:02:29.370> move

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
happen here is the probe is gonna move

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.940 
happen here is the probe is gonna move
into<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.120> base<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.630> using<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.500> move<00:02:31.800> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
into the base and using that move and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.680 
into the base and using that move and
stop<00:02:32.190> command<00:02:32.610> I'm<00:02:32.790> gonna<00:02:32.940> deny<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> from

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
stop command I'm gonna deny it from

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.630 
stop command I'm gonna deny it from
actually<00:02:33.840> getting<00:02:34.110> out<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.770> range<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.430> my

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
actually getting out of range of my

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.050 
actually getting out of range of my
Marine<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.390> here<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:36.750> go<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:44.790> see

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
Marine so here we go so as you can see

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.960 
Marine so here we go so as you can see
it's<00:02:45.330> move<00:02:45.630> stop<00:02:46.020> move<00:02:46.380> stop<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:47.070> did<00:02:47.730> miss<00:02:47.940> one

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
it's move stop move stop I did miss one

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.850 
it's move stop move stop I did miss one
of<00:02:48.270> those<00:02:48.570> because<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.930> hit<00:02:49.050> stop<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> little<00:02:49.740> bit

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
of those because I hit stop a little bit

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.290 
of those because I hit stop a little bit
too<00:02:49.980> early<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.460> that's<00:02:50.520> precisely<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
too early but that's precisely the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.240 
too early but that's precisely the
method<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.810> needs<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.170> be<00:02:52.200> used<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.800> in

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
method that needs to be used and in

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.860 
method that needs to be used and in
doing<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:53.910> as<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.209> can<00:02:54.300> see<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.540> ended<00:02:54.780> up

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
doing so as you can see I ended up

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.870 
doing so as you can see I ended up
killing<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> probe<00:02:55.500> right<00:02:55.680> here<00:02:56.010> preventing

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
killing the probe right here preventing

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.310 
killing the probe right here preventing
him<00:02:57.030> from<00:02:57.060> actually<00:02:57.360> entering<00:02:57.959> my<00:02:58.080> base

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
him from actually entering my base

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.680 
him from actually entering my base
entirely<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.370> all<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.910> need<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.209> be<00:03:00.330> doing<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
entirely and all you need to be doing is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
entirely and all you need to be doing is
making<00:03:00.720> sure<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.320> your<00:03:01.470> Marine<00:03:01.740> is<00:03:01.890> moving

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
making sure that your Marine is moving

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.610 
making sure that your Marine is moving
in<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> general<00:03:02.459> direction<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:03.450> whatever<00:03:04.020> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
in the general direction of whatever the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.130 
in the general direction of whatever the
worker<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.910> then<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.570> hit<00:03:06.810> stop

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
worker is and then you hit stop

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.890 
worker is and then you hit stop
periodically<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.760> actually<00:03:09.180> bypass<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
periodically to actually bypass the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.390 
periodically to actually bypass the
attack<00:03:10.200> animation<00:03:10.800> he<00:03:10.920> actually<00:03:11.190> ends<00:03:11.340> up

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
attack animation he actually ends up

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.220 
attack animation he actually ends up
shooting<00:03:11.640> faster<00:03:12.330> than<00:03:12.480> he<00:03:12.570> typically<00:03:12.959> would

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
shooting faster than he typically would

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.350 
shooting faster than he typically would
to<00:03:14.130> coincide<00:03:14.490> with<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.940> fact<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.209> is

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
to coincide with the fact that is

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.730 
to coincide with the fact that is
actually<00:03:15.660> moving<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.080> same<00:03:16.260> direction

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
actually moving in the same direction

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.900 
actually moving in the same direction
I<00:03:16.800> told<00:03:17.040> take<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> look<00:03:17.430> at<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
I told take a look at that with the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.940 
I told take a look at that with the
drone<00:03:18.150> here<00:03:18.420> gonna<00:03:18.600> move<00:03:18.840> them<00:03:18.959> up<00:03:19.080> grab<00:03:19.739> my

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
drone here gonna move them up grab my

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.830 
drone here gonna move them up grab my
meringue<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.940> remember<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.510> back<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
meringue and remember it's just back and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.140 
meringue and remember it's just back and
s<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.440> back<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.860> s<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.459> if<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.670> do<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.940> right

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
s and back and s and if you do it right

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.699 
s and back and s and if you do it right
you're<00:03:24.360> actually<00:03:24.630> gonna<00:03:24.720> shoot<00:03:24.989> faster<00:03:25.560> than

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
you're actually gonna shoot faster than

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.050 
you're actually gonna shoot faster than
you<00:03:25.800> typically<00:03:26.190> would<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.820> you'll<00:03:26.910> be<00:03:27.000> able

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
you typically would and you'll be able

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.670 
you typically would and you'll be able
to<00:03:27.180> get<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.390> extra<00:03:27.570> shot<00:03:27.989> off<00:03:28.200> for<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
to get that extra shot off for the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.009 
to get that extra shot off for the
killing<00:03:29.070> blow<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.640> remember<00:03:30.269> when<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> worker

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
killing blow and remember when a worker

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.070 
killing blow and remember when a worker
normally<00:03:31.769> runs<00:03:32.220> into<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.450> base<00:03:33.660> they're

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
normally runs into the base they're

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.050 
normally runs into the base they're
gonna<00:03:34.170> actually<00:03:34.410> run<00:03:34.830> past<00:03:35.190> your<00:03:35.489> Marine<00:03:35.790> if

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
gonna actually run past your Marine if

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.840 
gonna actually run past your Marine if
you<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.390> have<00:03:36.540> him<00:03:36.750> hold<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.769> held<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.489> attack

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
you just have him hold it held on attack

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.940 
you just have him hold it held on attack
here<00:03:39.209> just<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.810> normal<00:03:40.110> attack<00:03:40.410> he'll<00:03:40.680> chase

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
here just a normal attack he'll chase

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.800 
here just a normal attack he'll chase
them<00:03:41.190> but<00:03:41.760> he'll<00:03:41.910> get<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.330> range<00:03:42.510> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
them but he'll get out of range and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.570 
them but he'll get out of range and
again<00:03:43.050> so<00:03:43.200> it's<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.620> two-fold<00:03:44.040> thing<00:03:44.340> not<00:03:44.550> only

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
again so it's a two-fold thing not only

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.030 
again so it's a two-fold thing not only
following<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.660> worker<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:46.590> you're<00:03:46.739> also

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
following the worker but you're also

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.890 
following the worker but you're also
attacking<00:03:47.459> faster<00:03:48.209> than<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.540> typically

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
attacking faster than you typically

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.170 
attacking faster than you typically
would<00:03:49.170> be<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.340> precisely<00:03:50.790> how<00:03:51.120> you

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
would be so that is precisely how you

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.780 
would be so that is precisely how you
deny<00:03:51.870> probe<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.769> drone<00:03:53.040> scouting<00:03:53.550> and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
deny probe and drone scouting and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.190 
deny probe and drone scouting and
remember<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.300> same<00:03:54.450> things<00:03:54.660> gonna<00:03:54.780> work<00:03:55.019> for

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
remember the same things gonna work for

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.930 
remember the same things gonna work for
the<00:03:55.320> SUV<00:03:55.709> except<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.190> won't<00:03:56.400> get<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:56.820> that

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
the SUV except you won't get it in that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.580 
the SUV except you won't get it in that
initial<00:03:57.360> burst<00:03:57.600> like<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.959> can<00:03:58.170> here<00:03:58.410> for

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
initial burst like you can here for

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.920 
initial burst like you can here for
these<00:03:58.709> guys<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.640> this<00:03:59.820> is<00:03:59.880> precisely<00:04:00.209> why<00:04:00.870> in

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
these guys and this is precisely why in

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.560 
these guys and this is precisely why in
professional<00:04:01.590> games<00:04:01.890> if<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.700> see<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> Protoss

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
professional games if you see a Protoss

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.630 
professional games if you see a Protoss
player<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.200> they<00:04:04.560> want<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.920> try<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.220> scout

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
player and they want to try to scout

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.610 
player and they want to try to scout
their<00:04:05.910> opponents<00:04:06.300> base<00:04:06.480> they'll<00:04:07.140> move<00:04:07.320> up

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
their opponents base they'll move up

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.530 
their opponents base they'll move up
they'll<00:04:08.010> see<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> Marine<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.090> then<00:04:09.180> right<00:04:09.390> away

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
they'll see a Marine and then right away

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.300 
they'll see a Marine and then right away
they'll<00:04:09.780> pull<00:04:09.989> back<00:04:10.170> because<00:04:10.380> they<00:04:10.709> know<00:04:10.950> that

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
they'll pull back because they know that

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.009 
they'll pull back because they know that
the<00:04:11.880> opponent<00:04:12.360> they're<00:04:12.450> playing<00:04:12.690> against

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
the opponent they're playing against

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.750 
the opponent they're playing against
it's<00:04:13.170> good<00:04:13.380> enough<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.860> be<00:04:13.980> able<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.580> move

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
it's good enough to be able to that move

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.400 
it's good enough to be able to that move
and<00:04:14.910> stop<00:04:15.150> command<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.750> actually<00:04:16.019> kill<00:04:16.260> their

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
and stop command and actually kill their

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.560 
and stop command and actually kill their
worker<00:04:16.620> before<00:04:16.890> makes<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.400> on<00:04:17.489> end<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:18.419> you'll

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
worker before makes it on end so you'll

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.390 
worker before makes it on end so you'll
see<00:04:18.720> pro<00:04:18.870> players<00:04:19.140> not<00:04:19.350> even<00:04:19.590> attempt<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.160> push

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
see pro players not even attempt to push

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.820 
see pro players not even attempt to push
in<00:04:20.580> once<00:04:20.820> they<00:04:21.000> see<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.239> Marine<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:22.410> once<00:04:22.740> again
