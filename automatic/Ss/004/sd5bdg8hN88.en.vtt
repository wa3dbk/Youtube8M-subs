down to Spin Boldak where the main town
is<00:01:43.060> obviously<00:01:44.060> that's<00:01:44.270> important<00:01:44.780> it's<00:01:45.740> the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
is obviously that's important it's the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.010 
is obviously that's important it's the
robot<00:01:46.760> Road<00:01:46.970> is<00:01:47.150> probably<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.780> most

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
robot Road is probably the most

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.590 
robot Road is probably the most
important<00:01:48.970> secondary<00:01:49.970> road

besides<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.230> highway<00:01:51.650> in<00:01:52.010> this<00:01:52.370> district<00:01:52.909> you

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
besides the highway in this district you

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.149 
besides the highway in this district you
have<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:54.320> huge<00:01:54.860> cereal<00:01:55.550> growing<00:01:56.740> area<00:01:57.740> here<00:01:58.040> and

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
have a huge cereal growing area here and

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.670 
have a huge cereal growing area here and
behind<00:01:58.400> us<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.760> as<00:01:59.330> well<00:01:59.690> as<00:01:59.900> fruit<00:02:00.500> and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
behind us and as well as fruit and

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
vegetables grapes are grown here so the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.750 
vegetables grapes are grown here so the
potential<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.350> would<00:02:06.650> think<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.729> know

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
potential I would think is you know

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.050 
potential I would think is you know
three<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.330> four<00:02:08.509> times<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.009> then<00:02:10.280> what

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
three to four times you know then what

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.270 
three to four times you know then what
it<00:02:11.209> was<00:02:11.390> originally<00:02:11.930> we<00:02:12.620> had<00:02:12.769> been<00:02:12.920> told<00:02:13.099> that

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
it was originally we had been told that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.240 
it was originally we had been told that
it<00:02:13.519> used<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.849> take<00:02:14.000> about<00:02:14.239> two<00:02:14.450> hours<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
it used to take about two hours for the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.250 
it used to take about two hours for the
community<00:02:17.150> here<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.510> travel<00:02:17.840> up<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.110> down
