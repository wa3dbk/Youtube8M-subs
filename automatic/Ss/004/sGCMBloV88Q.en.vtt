00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.809
 superman as he should have finished 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.420
 the other there are two missiles if superman 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.610
 about danger 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.100
 he did not even have to touch at speed the 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.140
 engines of having me on the other hand can 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.750
 have them happy the things you said 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.990
 about me I said that not even you with your 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.260
 great speed the countries apart 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.260
 While I 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.070
 these missiles pictures sky 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.540
 if they are because I turned it around 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 have a couple of times and they were the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.820
 unique missiles that I found that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.410
 you mentioned and those are the missiles 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.410
 certain desire is to remove them from here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.590
 and then you did the usual thing to make sure 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.420
 that looks out of prison to kiss me with 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.280
 luisa a time schedule the space 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.159
 knowing the great camera 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.600
 you know what else turns out that the other one had 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.180
 a piece of kryptonite that would have 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.040
 finished if I just took it seriously yes 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.630
 but for some reason he asked to tell me 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.950
 your plane next to you but with trying 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.950
 shut up so that I will find you 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.940
 you can believe it the villains are stupid and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.710
 I know 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.770
 you know what I would have done they launched 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.679
 vote and then tie it 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.960
 and that of the missiles I would only have taken 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:35.320
 to de facto combat against missiles that 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.659
 They visited the problem glory please 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.429
 uses 6 central and trinitarian settings 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.549
 for each situation what's wrong with me 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.439
 belt or nothing is nothing wrong just 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.090
 that when you have a device that 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.980
 come back so fast I wanted to enter the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.830
 time itself in pieces 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.350
 at least to see I'm batman that to see 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.630
 those who do not say these very often 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.980
 I carry things in my belt because I am 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.980
