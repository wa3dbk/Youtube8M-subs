different things it's powered by android
froyo<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.020> believe<00:00:49.500> off<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> top<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> my

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
froyo if I believe off the top of my

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.360 
froyo if I believe off the top of my
head<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> let's<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.440> such<00:00:53.219> as

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
head so let's just get into it such as

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.240 
head so let's just get into it such as
slides<00:00:53.640> open<00:00:54.440> over<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> next<00:00:55.649> few<00:00:55.800> weeks<00:00:56.100> I'll

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
slides open over the next few weeks I'll

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.250 
slides open over the next few weeks I'll
have<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> full<00:00:56.820> coverage<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:58.129> welcome<00:00:59.180> so

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
have a full coverage for you welcome so

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.299 
have a full coverage for you welcome so
clearly<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> right<00:01:01.980> side<00:01:02.219> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
clearly we know what the right side is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.380 
clearly we know what the right side is
going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.579> let's<00:01:02.760> check<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.090> left

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
going to be let's check out the left

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.130 
going to be let's check out the left
side<00:01:03.570> first<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> micro<00:01:06.780> SD<00:01:07.670> adapter

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
side first so we have a micro SD adapter

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.700 
side first so we have a micro SD adapter
as<00:01:10.140> well<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> USB<00:01:11.189> cable<00:01:11.869> for<00:01:12.869> charging<00:01:12.930> i

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
as well as a USB cable for charging i

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.980 
as well as a USB cable for charging i
believe<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:15.080> if<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.200> USB<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.540> microUSB<00:01:18.540> i

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
believe it's if it's USB to microUSB i

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.390 
believe it's if it's USB to microUSB i
think<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.180> open<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.630> even<00:01:21.900> further

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
think and if we open it up even further

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.530 
think and if we open it up even further
here's<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> battery<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.240> actually

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
here's the battery now there's actually

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.850 
here's the battery now there's actually
what's<00:01:24.780> cool<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> since<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.799> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
what's cool is since this is going to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.080 
what's cool is since this is going to
use<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.340> juice<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.970> actually

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
use a lot of juice because it actually

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
use a lot of juice because it actually
has<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.509> screens<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.140> screens<00:01:28.259> are<00:01:28.560> very

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
has two screens and screens are very

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.649 
has two screens and screens are very
battery<00:01:29.189> intensive<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.450> include

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
battery intensive they actually include

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.770 
battery intensive they actually include
two<00:01:30.840> batters<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> box<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.780> as

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
two batters right in the box as well as

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.440 
two batters right in the box as well as
a<00:01:33.810> battery<00:01:34.380> charger<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.210> charge

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a battery charger so that you can charge

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
a battery charger so that you can charge
the<00:01:36.630> second<00:01:36.960> battery<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the second battery and have it with you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429 
the second battery and have it with you
and<00:01:38.070> ready<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> road<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and ready to go on the road with you and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.899 
and ready to go on the road with you and
then<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.799> quickly<00:01:40.950> swap<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.640> so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
then you can quickly swap them out so

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.560 
then you can quickly swap them out so
clearly<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.360> means<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> has<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
clearly that means that this is it has a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.499 
clearly that means that this is it has a
removable<00:01:46.049> battery<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:47.909> i<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.299> all

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
removable battery so i think that's all

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
removable battery so i think that's all
it's<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.869> well<00:01:49.770> there's<00:01:50.009> actually<00:01:50.280> some<00:01:50.399> other

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it's on well there's actually some other

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.260 
it's on well there's actually some other
stuff<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.600> reading<00:01:52.020> material

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
stuff here you got your reading material

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
stuff here you got your reading material
honestly<00:01:54.270> probably<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.259> put<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
honestly probably just put that to the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
honestly probably just put that to the
side<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.189> never<00:01:56.369> look<00:01:56.579> at<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.360> that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
side and never look at it and that

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.260 
side and never look at it and that
should<00:01:57.689> probably<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:58.140> fine<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.680> most<00:01:58.860> users

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
should probably be fine for most users

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.289 
should probably be fine for most users
and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.540> course<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.500> sprint

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
and then of course you have your sprint

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.100 
and then of course you have your sprint
recycling<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:03.570> old<00:02:03.750> phone<00:02:03.990> which

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
recycling for your old phone which

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.039 
recycling for your old phone which
always<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.409> cool<00:02:04.710> thing<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.159> offer<00:02:06.049> but

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
always a cool thing that they offer but

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.440 
always a cool thing that they offer but
let's<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.469> quickly<00:02:08.459> look<00:02:08.789> at<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.060> device

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
let's just quickly look at this device

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.680 
let's just quickly look at this device
and<00:02:09.800> then<00:02:10.940> we'll<00:02:11.940> give<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.120> more<00:02:12.270> coverage<00:02:12.450> in

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and then we'll give you more coverage in

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.990 
and then we'll give you more coverage in
a<00:02:12.750> later<00:02:12.930> video

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
a later video

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.100 
a later video
that's<00:02:14.420> actually<00:02:14.720> kind<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.930> interesting

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
that's actually kind of interesting

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.080 
that's actually kind of interesting
let's<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.740> look<00:02:15.890> at<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.040> one<00:02:16.190> more<00:02:16.370> time<00:02:16.610> so

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
let's just look at that one more time so

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.310 
let's just look at that one more time so
here's<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.390> front<00:02:17.630> screen<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.080> way<00:02:18.170> it

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
here's the front screen and the way it

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.590 
here's the front screen and the way it
actually<00:02:18.440> opens<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.910> actually<00:02:20.180> opens<00:02:20.450> like

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
actually opens it actually opens like

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.350 
actually opens it actually opens like
this<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.110> then<00:02:21.380> spins<00:02:21.740> around<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.300> can

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
this and then spins around so you can

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.930 
this and then spins around so you can
look<00:02:23.540> at<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.110> or<00:02:24.490> you<00:02:25.490> can<00:02:25.640> look<00:02:25.790> at

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
look at it like that or you can look at

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.410 
look at it like that or you can look at
it<00:02:25.970> sort<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:27.010> together<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:28.730> almost

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
it sort of together like that almost

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.900 
it sort of together like that almost
like<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.570> extension<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.800> screens<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:34.160> if

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
like a extension of the screens and if

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.699 
like a extension of the screens and if
we<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.450> can<00:02:35.600> set<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.140> desk<00:02:36.380> and

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
we just you can set it on the desk and

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.290 
we just you can set it on the desk and
it<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.580> sort<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.360> work<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.470> um<00:02:40.060> let's<00:02:41.060> see<00:02:41.240> if

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
it can sort of work so um let's see if

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.000 
it can sort of work so um let's see if
we<00:02:41.360> can<00:02:41.510> turn<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:41.840> bad<00:02:42.050> boy<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.590> let<00:02:42.890> me<00:02:42.980> see

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
we can turn this bad boy on let me see

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.160 
we can turn this bad boy on let me see
if<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.459> locate<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.850> power<00:02:44.150> button<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.810> the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
if I can locate the power button on the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.980 
if I can locate the power button on the
side

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.820 

hmm<00:02:55.850> maybe<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.030> isn't<00:02:57.210> charged<00:02:57.720> we'll<00:02:58.560> go

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
hmm maybe this isn't charged we'll go

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.610 
hmm maybe this isn't charged we'll go
ahead<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.040> take<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.310> off<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.360> i<00:03:00.660> will<00:03:01.530> be

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
ahead and take that off so i will be

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.990 
ahead and take that off so i will be
giving<00:03:01.710> you<00:03:01.860> more<00:03:02.100> coverage<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> coming

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
giving you more coverage in the coming

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.910 
giving you more coverage in the coming
days<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> chiro<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.260> kyocera<00:03:04.710> echo

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
days on the chiro and the kyocera echo

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.340 
days on the chiro and the kyocera echo
i'm<00:03:05.850> surprised<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.900> doesn't<00:03:07.110> have<00:03:07.200> any

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
i'm surprised that it doesn't have any

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.810 
i'm surprised that it doesn't have any
power<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:08.610> start<00:03:09.000> with<00:03:12.380> but<00:03:13.380> um<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.520> we'll<00:03:14.700> give

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
power to start with but um so we'll give

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.370 
power to start with but um so we'll give
you<00:03:14.880> more<00:03:15.060> coverage<00:03:15.240> on<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.600> device<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.110> the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
you more coverage on this device in the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.870 
you more coverage on this device in the
coming<00:03:16.710> weeks<00:03:16.920> I'm<00:03:17.130> Michael<00:03:17.370> struk<00:03:17.640> for

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
coming weeks I'm Michael struk for

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.580 
coming weeks I'm Michael struk for
Michael<00:03:18.120> strong<00:03:18.270> calm<00:03:18.720> I'm<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:19.230> excited

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
Michael strong calm I'm really excited

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.380 
Michael strong calm I'm really excited
and<00:03:19.830> interested<00:03:20.040> for<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:20.550> device<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.060> think

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and interested for this device I think

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.640 
and interested for this device I think
it's<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.570> really<00:03:21.600> cool<00:03:21.930> product<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.440> one<00:03:22.530> that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
it's a really cool product and one that

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.000 
it's a really cool product and one that
can<00:03:22.800> really<00:03:22.950> take<00:03:23.220> off<00:03:24.380> initially<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.620> a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
can really take off initially it's a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.460 
can really take off initially it's a
little<00:03:26.250> bit<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.520> seems<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.820> little<00:03:26.850> bit<00:03:27.150> clunky

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
little bit it seems a little bit clunky

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.570 
little bit it seems a little bit clunky
but<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.530> think<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:28.830> if<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.100> phone<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.430> give

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
but I think that if this phone can give

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.310 
but I think that if this phone can give
a<00:03:29.610> good<00:03:29.700> enough<00:03:30.080> representation<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.200> what

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
a good enough representation of what

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.540 
a good enough representation of what
true<00:03:31.500> multitasking<00:03:31.800> on<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> mobile<00:03:32.340> platform

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
true multitasking on a mobile platform

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.210 
true multitasking on a mobile platform
can<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.120> like<00:03:33.540> then<00:03:33.960> I<00:03:34.050> can<00:03:34.260> obviously<00:03:34.710> see<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
can be like then I can obviously see the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.520 
can be like then I can obviously see the
echo<00:03:35.550> 2<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.120> other<00:03:36.570> carriers<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.440> other

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
echo 2 and other carriers and other

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.930 
echo 2 and other carriers and other
manufacturers<00:03:38.070> as<00:03:38.190> well<00:03:38.220> looking<00:03:38.610> into<00:03:38.820> this

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
manufacturers as well looking into this

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.220 
manufacturers as well looking into this
form<00:03:39.210> factor<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.720> seeing<00:03:39.990> what<00:03:40.080> they<00:03:40.200> can

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
form factor and seeing what they can

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.590 
form factor and seeing what they can
offer<00:03:40.530> for<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:42.030> if<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.390> have<00:03:42.480> any
