something and already have to fill up
its<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:41.130> guess<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.340> math<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.849> comes

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
its I guess with the math it comes

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.110 
its I guess with the math it comes
that's<00:02:43.090> about<00:02:43.269> 40<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:43.930> maybe<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.349> uh<00:02:45.120> maybe

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
that's about 40 so maybe that uh maybe

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.199 
that's about 40 so maybe that uh maybe
