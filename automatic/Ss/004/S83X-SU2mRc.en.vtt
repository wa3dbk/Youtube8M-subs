00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.340 
you know when you first open it up
you'll<00:02:22.400> see<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:23.000> knife<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:24.020> know<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.320> a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
you'll see the knife you know like a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:33.420 
you'll see the knife you know like a
nice<00:02:24.620> plastic<00:02:25.460> packaging<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:27.700> after<00:02:28.700> that

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.480 

you'll<00:02:34.430> see<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.290> sort<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.800> an<00:02:36.950> instruction

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
you'll see like a sort of an instruction

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.890 
you'll see like a sort of an instruction
manual<00:02:37.690> with<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> whole<00:02:39.140> bunch<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.560> different

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
manual with a whole bunch of different

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900 
manual with a whole bunch of different
languages<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.260> everything<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.820> has

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
languages and everything and that it has

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.449 
languages and everything and that it has
lifetime<00:02:44.570> limited<00:02:45.380> lifetim<00:02:45.440> warranty<00:02:45.830> which

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
lifetime limited lifetim warranty which

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.830 
lifetime limited lifetim warranty which
is<00:02:46.750> if<00:02:47.750> if<00:02:48.050> there's<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.620> manufacturer<00:02:49.840> defect

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
is if if there's a manufacturer defect

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.229 
is if if there's a manufacturer defect
or<00:02:51.130> something<00:02:52.130> along<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.550> lines<00:02:52.820> of<00:02:53.030> that

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
or something along the lines of that

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.900 
or something along the lines of that
then<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.980> can<00:02:55.220> send<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.850> back<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.060> them<00:02:56.390> and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
then you can send it back to them and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.370 
then you can send it back to them and
get<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:58.940> new<00:02:59.120> one<00:02:59.270> or<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.690> can<00:02:59.810> try<00:02:59.900> to<00:02:59.989> fix<00:03:00.200> it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
get a new one or they can try to fix it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.880 
get a new one or they can try to fix it
so<00:03:01.310> that's<00:03:01.640> pretty<00:03:01.730> good

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
so that's pretty good

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.620 
so that's pretty good
it<00:03:04.280> tells<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.820> close<00:03:05.300> enough<00:03:05.390> about

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
it tells you it close enough about

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.360 
it tells you it close enough about
referring<00:03:06.200> your<00:03:06.320> knife<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.830> caring<00:03:07.130> for<00:03:07.160> your

referring your knife and caring for your

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.030 
referring your knife and caring for your
sheath<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.880> all<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.660> stuff<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.140> again<00:03:09.590> I

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
sheath and all that stuff but again I

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.490 
sheath and all that stuff but again I
mean<00:03:10.640> most<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.480> sort<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.900> common<00:03:12.320> sense

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
mean most of this sort of common sense

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.590 
mean most of this sort of common sense
even<00:03:13.100> being<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.310> weave<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.700> just<00:03:14.239> put<00:03:14.480> that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
even being a weave that just put that

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.820 
even being a weave that just put that
aside<00:03:15.520> back<00:03:16.520> in<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.700> box<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.410> gun<00:03:18.620> I

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
aside back in the box and so the gun I

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.820 
aside back in the box and so the gun I
mean<00:03:19.040> not<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> gun<00:03:19.489> then<00:03:19.790> -<00:03:20.500> when<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.590> first

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
mean not the gun then - when you first

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.270 
mean not the gun then - when you first
flip<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.190> out<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:23.660> first<00:03:23.959> thing<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.380> notice

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280

flip it out the first thing you notice
is<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.670> two<00:03:25.850> three<00:03:26.180> holes<00:03:26.420> here<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.910> kind

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
is the two three holes here and the kind

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.830 
is the two three holes here and the kind
of<00:03:29.810> sort<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.019> griptape<00:03:30.620> texture<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:32.360> really

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
of sort of griptape texture it's really

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.750 
of sort of griptape texture it's really
really<00:03:33.260> nice<00:03:34.150> has<00:03:35.150> some<00:03:35.720> heft<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.489> not<00:03:37.489> as

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
really nice has some heft to it not as

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.430 
really nice has some heft to it not as
much<00:03:38.060> as<00:03:38.269> like<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:38.920> like<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.950> fixed<00:03:40.370> blade<00:03:40.610> but

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.740 
just it feels like it's built like a
tank<00:05:56.110> so<00:05:56.500> I<00:05:56.529> mean<00:05:56.740> camping<00:05:57.310> perfect<00:05:57.750> cutting

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
tank so I mean camping perfect cutting

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.140 
tank so I mean camping perfect cutting
splitting<00:05:59.680> will<00:06:00.009> not<00:06:00.159> promise<00:06:00.370> splitting<00:06:00.969> but

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
splitting will not promise splitting but

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.230 
splitting will not promise splitting but
maybe<00:06:01.839> maybe<00:06:02.319> if<00:06:02.589> he<00:06:02.800> had<00:06:03.009> like<00:06:03.159> a<00:06:03.240> another

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
maybe maybe if he had like a another

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.680 
maybe maybe if he had like a another
bigger<00:06:04.960> piece<00:06:05.319> for<00:06:05.940> like<00:06:06.940> a<00:06:06.969> to<00:06:07.360> use<00:06:07.479> as<00:06:07.659> a

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
bigger piece for like a to use as a

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.029 
bigger piece for like a to use as a
hammer<00:06:08.310> that<00:06:09.310> would<00:06:09.490> probably<00:06:09.849> work<00:06:10.060> so<00:06:11.039> again

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039
