of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.479> way<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
of the back way in I don't know it's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
of the back way in I don't know it's
it's<00:01:54.600> got<00:01:54.750> two<00:01:54.930> main<00:01:55.079> doors<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.460> kind

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it's got two main doors but this is kind

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
it's got two main doors but this is kind
of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> back<00:01:57.000> door<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> giant

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
of the back door so this is the giant

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
of the back door so this is the giant
pool<00:01:59.130> table<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.610> made<00:01:59.820> which<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.060> really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
pool table that I made which is really

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.539 
pool table that I made which is really
hard<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> tell<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.500> pool<00:02:01.680> table<00:02:01.860> other

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
hard to tell it as a pool table other

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.620 
hard to tell it as a pool table other
than<00:02:02.670> fact<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.119> there's<00:02:03.270> green<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
than fact that there's green in the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.109 
than fact that there's green in the
middle<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:05.340> there's<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.700> nice

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
middle of it and then there's just nice

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.300 
middle of it and then there's just nice
little<00:02:06.540> there's<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.409> lot<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.740> nice<00:02:07.920> views<00:02:08.190> all

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
little there's a lot of nice views all

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.469 
little there's a lot of nice views all
over<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> house<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.300> enjoyed

making that

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.490 
making that
it's<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.740> really<00:02:10.920> modern<00:02:11.370> esque<00:02:11.730> dialed<00:02:12.330> home

blocky<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.600> didn't<00:02:30.780> want<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:30.990> be

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
blocky because I didn't want it to be

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.200 
blocky because I didn't want it to be
super<00:02:31.470> obvious<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.160> wasn't<00:02:32.550> minecraft<00:02:33.060> I

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
super obvious that it wasn't minecraft I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.760 
super obvious that it wasn't minecraft I
mean<00:02:33.420> obviously<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.110> some<00:02:34.380> wedges<00:02:34.500> for

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770

the<00:02:34.860> ramps<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.300> didn't<00:02:36.750> want<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.960> be<00:02:37.110> too

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
the ramps but I didn't want it to be too

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.140

obvious with everything else so we're

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.730

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
basement where I stored the build block

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.550 
basement where I stored the build block
at<00:03:10.800> over<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:12.050> so<00:03:13.050> those<00:03:13.200> are<00:03:13.230> both<00:03:13.380> over

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
head out through the build block so we'd

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.890 
head out through the build block so we'd
be<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.769> out<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> front<00:03:20.040> door<00:03:20.519> or<00:03:20.850> back<00:03:21.120> I

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
then we get down here what I'm pretty

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.390 
then we get down here what I'm pretty
happy<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.420> nether<00:03:31.050> portal<00:03:31.560> which

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
happy with is the nether portal which

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.610 
happy with is the nether portal which
with<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.150> way<00:03:33.270> that<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.600> works<00:03:33.750> actually<00:03:34.200> kind

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
with the way that it works actually kind

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.110 
with the way that it works actually kind
of<00:03:34.650> looks<00:03:34.860> like<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.130> goes<00:03:35.280> somewhere<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:35.880> that

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
of looks like it goes somewhere so that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.170 
of looks like it goes somewhere so that
turned<00:03:36.990> out<00:03:37.050> pretty<00:03:37.170> well<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.790> then<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.060> just

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
turned out pretty well and then it just

the<00:06:20.590> video<00:06:20.860> turned<00:06:21.100> out<00:06:21.900> so<00:06:22.900> part<00:06:23.770> of<00:06:23.830> the

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
the video turned out so part of the

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.370 
the video turned out so part of the
reason<00:06:24.220> that<00:06:24.250> I<00:06:24.370> did<00:06:24.550> think<00:06:24.729> that<00:06:24.790> I<00:06:24.910> did<00:06:25.240> oh<00:06:25.510> my

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
reason that I did think that I did oh my

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.360 
reason that I did think that I did oh my
missing<00:06:26.800> planet<00:06:27.479> so<00:06:28.479> I<00:06:28.950> should<00:06:29.950> have<00:06:30.100> released

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
missing planet so I should have released

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.250 
missing planet so I should have released
the<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:31.840> alternate<00:06:32.560> ending<00:06:32.770> at<00:06:33.010> this<00:06:33.190> point

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
the the alternate ending at this point

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.360 
the the alternate ending at this point
but<00:06:35.260> there<00:06:35.410> were<00:06:35.470> two<00:06:35.590> main<00:06:35.740> focuses<00:06:36.100> for<00:06:36.280> this

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
but there were two main focuses for this

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.760 
but there were two main focuses for this
video<00:06:36.610> and<00:06:36.840> obviously<00:06:37.840> it's<00:06:37.990> not<00:06:38.050> to<00:06:38.560> bash

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
video and obviously it's not to bash

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.730 
video and obviously it's not to bash
minecraft<00:06:39.580> specifically<00:06:40.180> or<00:06:41.110> really<00:06:41.440> at<00:06:41.650> all

minecraft specifically or really at all
it's<00:06:41.979> just<00:06:42.070> kind<00:06:42.340> of<00:06:42.370> a<00:06:42.490> I<00:06:42.760> guess<00:06:43.630> artsy<00:06:44.080> look

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
it's just kind of a I guess artsy look

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.330 
it's just kind of a I guess artsy look
at<00:06:44.440> it<00:06:44.560> I<00:06:44.620> don't<00:06:44.740> know<00:06:44.770> whatever<00:06:44.950> yeah<00:06:45.160> it's

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
at it I don't know whatever yeah it's

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.400 
at it I don't know whatever yeah it's
just<00:06:45.550> something<00:06:45.729> fun<00:06:45.850> to<00:06:45.910> do<00:06:46.030> but<00:06:46.570> like<00:06:46.780> the

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
just something fun to do but like the

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.230 
just something fun to do but like the
way<00:06:47.440> that<00:06:47.620> I<00:06:47.680> ended<00:06:47.950> it<00:06:48.040> I<00:06:48.220> chose<00:06:48.760> kind<00:06:49.150> of

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
way that I ended it I chose kind of

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.200 
way that I ended it I chose kind of
specifically<00:06:49.690> as<00:06:49.960> I<00:06:50.320> was<00:06:50.470> developing<00:06:50.740> it

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
specifically as I was developing it

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.940 
specifically as I was developing it
because<00:06:52.210> I<00:06:52.300> wanted<00:06:52.390> it<00:06:52.600> to<00:06:52.750> be<00:06:52.870> in<00:06:53.800> the

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
because I wanted it to be in the

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.440 
because I wanted it to be in the
basement<00:06:54.100> he<00:06:54.460> had<00:06:54.610> all<00:06:54.729> those<00:06:54.820> diamonds<00:06:55.270> like

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
basement he had all those diamonds like

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.780 
basement he had all those diamonds like
he<00:06:55.840> had<00:06:55.930> been<00:06:56.160> built<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.220> house<00:06:57.340> on<00:06:57.490> diamond

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
he had been built the house on diamond

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.120 
he had been built the house on diamond
mine<00:06:57.940> and<00:06:58.180> so<00:06:58.900> one<00:06:59.560> of<00:06:59.590> the<00:06:59.680> big<00:06:59.710> things<00:06:59.830> in

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
mine and so one of the big things in

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.950 
mine and so one of the big things in
Minecraft<00:07:00.310> is<00:07:00.610> obviously<00:07:00.910> diamonds<00:07:01.300> so<00:07:01.930> I

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
Minecraft is obviously diamonds so I

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.570 
Minecraft is obviously diamonds so I
wanted<00:07:02.380> to<00:07:02.470> portray<00:07:02.860> it<00:07:03.070> as<00:07:03.130> kind<00:07:03.310> of<00:07:03.460> like<00:07:03.550> a

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
wanted to portray it as kind of like a

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.219 
wanted to portray it as kind of like a
that's<00:07:04.450> the<00:07:04.570> most<00:07:04.720> important<00:07:05.050> thing<00:07:05.080> in

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:05.229 
that's the most important thing in

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:06.840 
that's the most important thing in
Minecraft<00:07:05.410> like<00:07:05.830> I<00:07:05.950> have<00:07:06.220> to<00:07:06.340> protect<00:07:06.490> it<00:07:06.729> so

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
Minecraft like I have to protect it so

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.820 
Minecraft like I have to protect it so
he<00:07:06.970> died<00:07:07.120> for<00:07:07.360> that<00:07:07.390> but<00:07:08.020> in<00:07:08.140> the<00:07:08.290> alternate

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
he died for that but in the alternate

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.990 
he died for that but in the alternate
ending<00:07:10.050> he<00:07:11.050> you<00:07:11.740> see<00:07:11.890> that<00:07:12.010> he<00:07:12.070> lives<00:07:12.340> or<00:07:12.790> he

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
ending he you see that he lives or he

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.790 
ending he you see that he lives or he
survived<00:07:13.330> it<00:07:13.510> and<00:07:13.690> so<00:07:14.140> he<00:07:14.320> kind<00:07:14.470> of<00:07:14.530> becomes

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
survived it and so he kind of becomes

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.640 
survived it and so he kind of becomes

backstory for hair brines lower so it

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.000 
backstory for hair brines lower so it
wasn't<00:07:25.390> totally<00:07:25.630> random<00:07:26.110> that's<00:07:26.500> good<00:07:26.710> but

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010 
wasn't totally random that's good but

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.940 
wasn't totally random that's good but
yeah<00:07:27.430> basically<00:07:28.349> who<00:07:29.349> knew<00:07:29.500> it<00:07:29.620> would<00:07:29.650> be<00:07:29.860> in

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:29.950 
yeah basically who knew it would be in

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.250 
yeah basically who knew it would be in
the<00:07:30.010> future<00:07:30.370> when<00:07:30.520> star<00:07:30.760> made<00:07:30.910> was<00:07:31.030> a<00:07:31.060> thing<00:07:31.300> so

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
the future when star made was a thing so

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.600 
the future when star made was a thing so
yeah<00:07:32.830> I

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.610 
yeah I

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.249 
yeah I
hope<00:07:33.789> that<00:07:33.969> that<00:07:34.419> all<00:07:34.539> these<00:07:34.810> kind<00:07:35.050> of<00:07:35.110> make
