00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
puts it over an alternating base which

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.180 
puts it over an alternating base which
some<00:00:41.480> people<00:00:41.720> also<00:00:41.870> call<00:00:41.989> javis<00:00:42.650> picking<00:00:43.010> base

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
position to that so the lick by itself

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.360 
position to that so the lick by itself
is<00:00:50.210> going<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.870> sound<00:00:51.350> like<00:00:51.500> this<00:00:51.620> without<00:00:52.220> the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
is going to sound like this without the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:04.020 
is going to sound like this without the
thumb<00:00:52.580> you've<00:00:53.150> got<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.420> opening<00:00:53.720> Bend

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.430 

and<00:01:04.360> that's<00:01:04.540> all<00:01:04.720> happening<00:01:05.140> over

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
and that's all happening over

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.870 
and that's all happening over
alternating<00:01:05.920> thumb<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:06.370> have<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.580> do<00:01:06.850> a

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
alternating thumb and you have to do a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.250 
alternating thumb and you have to do a
little<00:01:07.060> bit<00:01:07.300> of<00:01:07.390> moving<00:01:07.510> around<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.990> get<00:01:08.140> the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
little bit of moving around to get the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.200 
little bit of moving around to get the
thumb<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:09.250> get<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.460> alternating<00:01:09.850> thumb<00:01:09.880> so

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
thumb to get the alternating thumb so

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.000 
thumb to get the alternating thumb so
that<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.450> has<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.600> note<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.080> play<00:01:11.290> all<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.770> time

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010
