house just to build a house you may not

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
house just to build a house you may not
do<00:01:39.479> any<00:01:40.080> style<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:41.789> of<00:01:41.819> people

do any style but this is kind of people

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.029 
do any style but this is kind of people
do<00:01:42.209> they<00:01:42.360> put<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.569> door<00:01:42.959> and<00:01:43.319> then<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.800> a

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
do they put a door and then they put a

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.469 
do they put a door and then they put a
torch<00:01:44.429> maybe<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.880> outside<00:01:45.119> maybe<00:01:45.300> not

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
torch maybe on the outside maybe not

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
torch maybe on the outside maybe not
even<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.959> looks<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.470> bad<00:01:46.709> and<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.580> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
even that it looks really bad and so I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.010 
even that it looks really bad and so I
think<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.179> some<00:01:48.360> people<00:01:48.599> even<00:01:48.720> do

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
think that is some people even do

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.320 
think that is some people even do
something<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.849> I<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:51.119> like

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
something like that now I don't like

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.550 
something like that now I don't like
that<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.690> looks<00:01:51.899> really<00:01:52.020> playing<00:01:52.319> a<00:01:52.410> lot<00:01:52.500> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that it looks really playing a lot of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.960 
that it looks really playing a lot of
people<00:01:52.770> i<00:01:52.860> mean<00:01:52.979> these<00:01:53.069> are<00:01:53.220> common<00:01:53.550> materials

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
people i mean these are common materials

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
people i mean these are common materials
wood<00:01:54.209> and<00:01:54.360> kabul<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.869> maybe<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.709> you're<00:01:55.860> lucky

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
wood and kabul and maybe if you're lucky

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.729 
wood and kabul and maybe if you're lucky
you<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> torch<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:58.170> sort<00:01:58.349> of<00:01:58.560> what

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
you get a torch so that's sort of what

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.919 
you get a torch so that's sort of what
people<00:01:59.039> tend<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.550> do<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.970> i<00:02:00.569> mean<00:02:00.720> if<00:02:00.840> you're

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
people tend to do and i mean if you're

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.660 
people tend to do and i mean if you're
building<00:02:01.080> creative<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:01.920> no<00:02:02.220> reason<00:02:02.459> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
building creative there is no reason to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.279 
building creative there is no reason to
build<00:02:02.849> your<00:02:03.000> house<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:04.050> just<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
build your house like this that's just a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.029 
build your house like this that's just a
waste<00:02:04.440> yeah<00:02:04.800> that's<00:02:05.340> our<00:02:05.550> blah<00:02:05.849> house<00:02:06.090> so

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
waste yeah that's our blah house so

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.770 
waste yeah that's our blah house so
moving<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.550> one<00:02:09.090> example<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.750> good

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
moving on this is one example of a good

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.229 
moving on this is one example of a good
house<00:02:10.140> entrance<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.310> my<00:02:11.400> opinion<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.000> can

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
house entrance in my opinion so you can

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.320 
house entrance in my opinion so you can
use<00:02:12.480> stairs<00:02:13.470> which<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.220> meant<00:02:14.489> for<00:02:15.030> stairs

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
use stairs which are meant for stairs

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.420 
use stairs which are meant for stairs
like<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.379> but<00:02:16.799> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.099> use<00:02:17.250> them<00:02:17.400> for

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
like this but you can use them for

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
like this but you can use them for
design<00:02:17.939> purposes<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.719> here<00:02:19.349> I've<00:02:19.439> actually

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
design purposes so here I've actually

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.229 
design purposes so here I've actually
use<00:02:19.799> stairs<00:02:20.129> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> side<00:02:20.670> putting<00:02:21.060> them

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
use stairs on the side putting them

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.950 
use stairs on the side putting them
upside<00:02:21.540> down

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
upside down

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.240 
upside down
and<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.260> weird<00:02:22.590> places<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.010> they<00:02:23.070> make

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and then weird places and they make

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640 
and then weird places and they make
really<00:02:23.610> cool<00:02:24.000> entrance<00:02:24.930> looking<00:02:25.350> because<00:02:25.470> you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
really cool entrance looking because you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.430 
really cool entrance looking because you
can<00:02:25.800> fit<00:02:26.010> under<00:02:26.280> there<00:02:26.490> under<00:02:26.820> we're<00:02:27.780> just

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
can fit under there under we're just

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.500 
can fit under there under we're just
getting<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.800> thumb<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.210> makes

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
getting a thumb you can just it makes

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.210 
getting a thumb you can just it makes
really<00:02:30.780> cool<00:02:31.140> designs<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.100> use

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
really cool designs and you can use

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.650 
really cool designs and you can use
stairs<00:02:32.460> for<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:32.880> that's<00:02:32.970> one<00:02:33.240> idea<00:02:33.360> you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
stairs for that so that's one idea you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.290 
stairs for that so that's one idea you
can<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.650> also<00:02:34.830> think<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.700> colors<00:02:36.120> that

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
can do and also think of colors that

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.880 
can do and also think of colors that
look<00:02:36.360> good<00:02:36.690> together<00:02:36.810> blocks<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.560> look<00:02:37.710> good

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
look good together blocks that look good

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.240 
look good together blocks that look good
together<00:02:38.010> i<00:02:38.190> guess<00:02:38.430> i<00:02:38.520> should<00:02:38.670> say<00:02:38.880> um<00:02:40.250> like

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
together i guess i should say um like

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.730 
together i guess i should say um like
like<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.180> instance<00:02:42.210> tan<00:02:42.630> stone<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.020> courts<00:02:43.320> or

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
like for instance tan stone in courts or

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.800 
like for instance tan stone in courts or
not<00:02:43.890> saying<00:02:44.100> yeah<00:02:44.370> sandstone<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.060> courts

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
not saying yeah sandstone and courts

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.170 
not saying yeah sandstone and courts
look<00:02:45.960> really<00:02:46.320> nice<00:02:46.410> together<00:02:46.880> glowstone<00:02:47.880> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
look really nice together glowstone and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.240 
look really nice together glowstone and
all<00:02:48.270> this<00:02:48.450> looks<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:48.900> nice<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.130> i

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
all this looks really nice just like i

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.550 
all this looks really nice just like i
used<00:02:50.460> here<00:02:50.880> nether<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.020> courts<00:02:52.320> actually

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
used here nether in the courts actually

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.980 
used here nether in the courts actually
looks<00:02:52.710> very<00:02:52.890> good<00:02:53.010> together<00:02:53.720> netherrack<00:02:54.720> and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
looks very good together netherrack and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.690 
looks very good together netherrack and
sandstone<00:02:55.710> doesn't<00:02:56.010> necessarily<00:02:56.370> good

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
sandstone doesn't necessarily good

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.980 
sandstone doesn't necessarily good
together<00:02:56.820> though<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.300> kind<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.510> weird<00:02:57.720> just

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
together though it's kind of weird just

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.540 
together though it's kind of weird just
got<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.380> got<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.530> mess<00:02:59.100> around<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> things

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
got it you got a mess around the things

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.550 
got it you got a mess around the things
like<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.000> usually<00:03:00.810> if<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.500> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
like that and usually if you think it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.680 
like that and usually if you think it
looks<00:03:01.710> good<00:03:01.830> most<00:03:02.130> people<00:03:02.370> will<00:03:02.520> as<00:03:02.760> well<00:03:02.790> so

this here a lot of people build castles
and<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.110> one<00:03:07.290> design<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.710> can<00:03:07.740> use

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and this is one design you can use

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.590 
and this is one design you can use
castles<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.910> lot<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.060> times<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.300> lot<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.480> these

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
castles a lot of times a lot of these

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.750 
castles a lot of times a lot of these
like<00:03:09.810> wood<00:03:10.170> columns<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.980> side<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.610> then<00:03:11.730> a

like wood columns on the side and then a
lot<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.150> times<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.420> use<00:03:12.540> stone<00:03:12.930> brick<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.830> just

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
lot of times you use stone brick I just

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.680 
lot of times you use stone brick I just
throw<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:14.490> some<00:03:14.640> cracked<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.180> mossy<00:03:15.510> because

if you're in creative you can make those

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.710 
if you're in creative you can make those
things<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.240> might<00:03:18.360> really<00:03:18.480> make<00:03:18.600> them

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
things and you might really make them

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.060 
things and you might really make them
miserable<00:03:18.930> i<00:03:19.140> don't<00:03:19.290> remember<00:03:19.410> with<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.830> stone

if you have a non super thought world

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.659 
if you have a non super thought world
dig<00:04:54.810> these<00:04:54.930> out<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.410> hate<00:04:55.889> hitting<00:04:56.340> my<00:04:56.430> head<00:04:56.460> and

that<00:05:14.849> but<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.389> main<00:05:15.570> point<00:05:15.780> of<00:05:15.900> this<00:05:16.020> was<00:05:16.289> to

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
that but the main point of this was to

that but the main point of this was to
show<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:17.220> what<00:05:17.430> you<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.729> do<00:05:17.820> with<00:05:17.940> lava<00:05:18.360> and

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
also water so lava you can if you dig a

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.920 
also water so lava you can if you dig a
hole<00:05:21.690> right<00:05:22.020> here<00:05:23.300> then<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.389> will<00:05:24.509> fall<00:05:24.720> and

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
hole right here then it will fall and

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.140 
hole right here then it will fall and
not<00:05:24.990> flow<00:05:25.320> out<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.400> looks<00:05:26.550> really<00:05:26.610> nice<00:05:26.820> so

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150
