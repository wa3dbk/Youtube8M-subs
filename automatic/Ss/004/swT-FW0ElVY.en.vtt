they<00:00:02.070> call<00:00:02.310> it<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.550> poly<00:00:02.760> only<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.780> basically

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
they call it the poly only is basically

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.400 
they call it the poly only is basically
eggs<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.160> sugar<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.359> mix<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.990> that

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
eggs and sugar and you mix it in that

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.440 
eggs and sugar and you mix it in that
case<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.859> Marsala<00:00:08.309> wine<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.090> serve<00:00:09.330> it

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
case with Marsala wine and you serve it

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.080 
case with Marsala wine and you serve it
with<00:00:09.570> berries<00:00:09.809> it's<00:00:10.110> really<00:00:10.320> wonderful<00:00:11.090> but

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
with berries it's really wonderful but

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.079 
with berries it's really wonderful but
in<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.110> French<00:00:13.380> tradition<00:00:14.130> Semyon<00:00:14.910> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
in the French tradition Semyon is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.180 
in the French tradition Semyon is
basically<00:00:15.480> eggs<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.379> sugar<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.920> cooked

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
basically eggs and sugar is cooked

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.640 
basically eggs and sugar is cooked
together<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:18.060> we're<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> cook<00:00:19.410> them

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
together and we're going to cook them

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.620 
together and we're going to cook them
but<00:00:19.920> not<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.609> scramble<00:00:20.910> point<00:00:21.390> you're<00:00:21.539> not

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
but not to scramble point you're not

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.450 
but not to scramble point you're not
going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.869> get<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.380> cook<00:00:22.590> what<00:00:23.400> I'd

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
going to get it really cook what I'd

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.429 
going to get it really cook what I'd
like<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> do<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.180> I've<00:00:24.390> got<00:00:24.420> my<00:00:24.689> bowl<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.140> cold

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
like to do is I've got my bowl it's cold

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
like to do is I've got my bowl it's cold
here<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.949> haven't<00:00:26.279> even<00:00:26.340> put<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> water

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
here I haven't even put it on the water

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.910 
here I haven't even put it on the water
yet<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.750> I've<00:00:27.840> got<00:00:27.990> my<00:00:28.140> heat<00:00:28.349> set<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.680> four

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
yet and I've got my heat set of four

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.220 
yet and I've got my heat set of four
which<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.369> really<00:00:29.640> low<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.080> this

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
which is really low I'm going to do this

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.870 
which is really low I'm going to do this
because<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.679> don't<00:00:31.710> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> cook<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
because I don't want to cook them and I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.120 
because I don't want to cook them and I
don't<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> go<00:00:33.300> too<00:00:33.360> fast<00:00:33.890> I'm<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
don't want to go too fast I'm going to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.790 
don't want to go too fast I'm going to
throw<00:00:35.219> away<00:00:35.280> my<00:00:35.460> sugar<00:00:36.140> my<00:00:37.140> throwing<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.590> eggs

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
throw away my sugar my throwing my eggs

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.979 
throw away my sugar my throwing my eggs
this<00:00:38.129> planet<00:00:38.460> yolks<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.210> whole<00:00:39.420> egg<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.740 

we're<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> put<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.500> together

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
we're going to put all that together

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.459 
we're going to put all that together
normally<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.870> don't<00:00:45.960> want<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> mix<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> sugar

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
normally we don't want to mix the sugar

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.110 
normally we don't want to mix the sugar
in<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> egg<00:00:47.039> together<00:00:47.430> too<00:00:47.670> early<00:00:48.000> because

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
in the egg together too early because

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.119 
in the egg together too early because
it'll<00:00:48.420> cook<00:00:48.629> yet<00:00:48.960> it'll<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.559> burn<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it'll cook yet it'll actually burn the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
it'll cook yet it'll actually burn the
egg<00:00:51.770> sugar<00:00:52.770> actually<00:00:53.100> does<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> eggs

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
egg sugar actually does that to the eggs

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
egg sugar actually does that to the eggs
over<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.719> we'll<00:00:54.989> break<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> protein<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
over time we'll break up the protein and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270 
over time we'll break up the protein and
it<00:00:56.789> doesn't<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> ability<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.649> hold

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it doesn't have the ability to hold

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.510 
it doesn't have the ability to hold
together<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> poem<00:01:00.890> but<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
together as a poem but now that's in a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.570 
together as a poem but now that's in a
bowl<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.960> Steam<00:01:04.290> good<00:01:04.739> nice<00:01:04.949> nice

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
bowl and it's on Steam good nice nice

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
bowl and it's on Steam good nice nice
steaming<00:01:05.939> water<00:01:06.869> I'm<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> start<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
steaming water I'm going to start to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.679 
steaming water I'm going to start to
whisk<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.979> fairly<00:01:08.970> vigorously

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
whisk you fairly vigorously

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.969 
whisk you fairly vigorously
trying<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.439> air<00:01:11.710> incorporate<00:01:12.640> into<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:14.799> as

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
trying to air incorporate into it now as

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.380 
trying to air incorporate into it now as
I<00:01:15.159> do<00:01:15.219> that<00:01:15.340> you're<00:01:15.610> going<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.759> notice<00:01:15.909> in<00:01:16.270> here

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
I do that you're going to notice in here

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.789 
I do that you're going to notice in here
-<00:01:16.539> it<00:01:16.840> changes<00:01:17.259> color

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
- it changes color

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.859 
- it changes color
we'd<00:01:18.280> also<00:01:18.430> change<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.030> by<00:01:19.210> getting<00:01:19.539> really

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
we'd also change this by getting really

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.380 
we'd also change this by getting really
really<00:01:20.110> fun<00:01:23.399> in<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.490> process<00:01:24.939> of<00:01:25.030> doing<00:01:25.119> this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
really fun in the process of doing this

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.270 
really fun in the process of doing this
which<00:01:25.990> brings<00:01:26.320> me<00:01:26.409> more<00:01:26.619> than<00:01:26.890> just<00:01:26.950> whip<00:01:27.250> it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
which brings me more than just whip it

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.029 
which brings me more than just whip it
we're<00:01:27.700> going<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.880> cook<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:29.710> going<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:29.890> cook

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
we're going to cook it I'm going to cook

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.010 
we're going to cook it I'm going to cook
it<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.369> a<00:01:30.399> point<00:01:30.670> where<00:01:30.970> we<00:01:31.360> first<00:01:31.600> kill<00:01:31.899> the

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
it to a point where we first kill the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.230 
it to a point where we first kill the
cell<00:01:32.229> at<00:01:32.380> all<00:01:32.500> any<00:01:32.829> cell<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.399> might<00:01:33.640> be<00:01:33.789> in<00:01:33.880> it

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
cell at all any cell that might be in it

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.370 
cell at all any cell that might be in it
we're<00:01:34.720> also<00:01:34.869> going<00:01:35.049> to<00:01:35.110> make<00:01:35.170> sure<00:01:35.289> that<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
we're also going to make sure that is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.660 
we're also going to make sure that is
starts<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.439> thicken<00:01:38.679> like<00:01:38.979> like<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.429> ribbon

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
starts to thicken like like the ribbon

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.870 
starts to thicken like like the ribbon
stage<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.240> making<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.600> hollandaise<00:01:41.049> sauce<00:01:41.789> if<00:01:42.789> I

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
stage of making a hollandaise sauce if I

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.109 
stage of making a hollandaise sauce if I
remember<00:01:43.119> making<00:01:43.270> hollandaise<00:01:43.810> sauce<00:01:45.119> how

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
remember making hollandaise sauce how

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.609 
remember making hollandaise sauce how
you<00:01:46.179> whip<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.539> at<00:01:46.630> first<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:47.049> turn<00:01:47.289> it<00:01:47.439> into<00:01:47.530> a

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
you whip it at first you turn it into a

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.949 
you whip it at first you turn it into a
ribbon<00:01:48.009> sort<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.399> like<00:01:48.670> light<00:01:48.909> colors<00:01:49.299> sit

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
ribbon sort of like light colors sit
