well<00:00:01.380> hello<00:00:01.650> guys<00:00:01.890> here<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.280> am<00:00:02.490> again

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
well hello guys here I am again

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.110 
well hello guys here I am again
this<00:00:04.680> time<00:00:04.950> I'm<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.370> show<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:06.080> how<00:00:07.080> fast

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
this time I'm going to show you how fast

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.490 
this time I'm going to show you how fast
how<00:00:09.120> incredible<00:00:09.660> fast<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.170> redshifted

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
how incredible fast is redshifted

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.820 
how incredible fast is redshifted
actually<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:12.139> am<00:00:13.139> pretty<00:00:13.259> sure<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.269> I<00:00:15.650> don't<00:00:16.650> know

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
actually I am pretty sure I I don't know

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.700 
actually I am pretty sure I I don't know
what<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.130> say<00:00:18.529> here<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.590> had<00:00:19.800> seen<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.030 

800,000<00:00:25.910> Harris<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:30.349> I'm<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> show

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
800,000 Harris so I'm just going to show

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.540 
800,000 Harris so I'm just going to show
you<00:00:32.149> how<00:00:33.149> fast<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> renders<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.460> just<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you how fast it renders and just a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.490 
you how fast it renders and just a
preview<00:00:38.210> I'm<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> show<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.809> cab<00:00:40.050> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
preview I'm going to show you a cab to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.130 
preview I'm going to show you a cab to
her<00:00:40.530> layers<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:43.800> geometry<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.840> first

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
her layers on this geometry so the first

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.830 
her layers on this geometry so the first
one<00:00:48.980> here<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.309> three<00:00:50.969> hundred<00:00:51.000> thousand

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
one here it is three hundred thousand

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.450 
one here it is three hundred thousand
hairs<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.699> second<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:58.129> five<00:00:59.129> hundred

here in my scene options of course I'm

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.240 
here in my scene options of course I'm
going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.729> show<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.390> redshift<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.770> enabled

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
going to show you redshift is enabled

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.359 
going to show you redshift is enabled
and<00:01:20.060> my<00:01:21.060> other<00:01:21.299> settings<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.799> using<00:01:23.070> low

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and my other settings I'm using low

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.570 
and my other settings I'm using low

for<00:01:40.200> landlord<00:01:40.740> erase<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:42.920> here<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> goes

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
for landlord erase so well here it goes

00:01:45.229 --> 00:02:04.149 
for landlord erase so well here it goes
ready

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159
